At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.","Chris Suh","Thank you, Ria. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and Carolyn Frantz, our new Deputy General Counsel, Corporate Secretary.","On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide to the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. This quarter, we incurred tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We have excluded the impact of this tax charge in our non-GAAP net income and earnings per share metrics.","These non-GAAP financial metrics should not be considered as the substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They're included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results.","All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses is performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.","We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until January 31, 2019.","During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during the conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.","Satya Nadella","Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Our results this quarter speak to us picking the right secular trends and markets, and following that up with focused innovation and execution. The intelligent cloud and intelligent edge paradigm is fast becoming a reality. Azure growth accelerated. LinkedIn growth accelerated. Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 are driving our growth and transforming the workplace. Xbox is reaching new customers with new offers.","With that as the backdrop, I want to highlight key areas of innovation and growth across our customer solutions. Every CEO I talk to is keen to start their transformation journey by empowering their employees in creating a modern workplace. They want productivity and collaboration tools that deliver continuous innovation and do so securely.","Spectre and Meltdown are the latest instances in an increasingly complex threat environment. Our investments to make Windows 10 the most secure, always up-to-date operating system enabled us to move quickly to protect customers in the face of these threats.","Protecting customers will continue to be a top priority. Our continued commitment to operational security and advanced technology is one reason customers like BP, Goodyear, PayPal are choosing Microsoft 365. MasterCard chose Microsoft 365 to empower employees and inspire teamwork with integrated apps like Teams, Yammer and SharePoint.","We're infusing AI across Microsoft 365 with the simple goal of helping people do their best work. Insights in Excel is a new service that uses machine learning to detect and highlight patterns. Translator brings 60 languages to Word. We're helping people be more productive on the go on any platform with real-time co-authoring in Office apps on iOS, Android and now the Mac.","And just this month, we announced that dictation will be available across multiple apps in Office 365, empowering users to write freely using only their voice. We're making voice a first-class input for productivity. Cortana can help manage your e-mail, by pulling up important e-mails, reading them aloud, and letting you reply using just your voice.","We're also bringing Cortana's intelligence to Outlook Mobile app, notifying you when it's time to leave a meeting to get to your next one, based on your location and traffic.","Mixed Reality empowers employees with new immersive experiences. Enterprise customers like Mercedes Benz in Germany are using Mixed Reality to transform training, helping maintenance technicians learn everything from guided brake repair to how components in a new diesel engine work.","We're expanding our opportunity with Microsoft 365 for organizations of all types and sizes. Take Firstline Workers, leading global telecommunications, retail and hospitality companies such as BT, Target, Panera Bread and Delta Global Services, all chose Office 365 to maximize the impact of their Firstline Workforce.","In education, we're empowering every student with new learning tools natively built into Office 365 to improve reading, writing and comprehension, as well as Mixed Reality experiences for immersive learning.","This quarter, we launched Surface LTE and unveiled a new generation of always-on, always-connected Windows 10 PCs from our OEM partners. With up to 20 days of standby power, this new category of PCs, deeply integrated with Cortana and with new near-field and far-field capability, will fundamentally change productivity.","Now, I'll turn to LinkedIn and business applications. As we pass the one-year mark of Microsoft and LinkedIn, uniting the world's leading professional cloud with the world's leading professional network, LinkedIn continues its strong trajectory with accelerating revenue growth and record levels of engagement. The fifth consecutive quarter of more than 20% sessions growth.","Appetite for conversations across the platform continues to grow from sharing in the feed, to video, to one-on-one messages sent, all up more than 60% year-over-year. This increased engagement across the platform is driving strong growth in demand for sponsored content and marketing solutions and record levels of job postings and job visitors in Talent Solutions.","LinkedIn is continually creating new ways for members to connect and engage with one another, such as this quarter's launch of Career Advice. From the deeper integration of Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365 for Sales and Dynamics for Talent to the launch of Profile Card to bring personalized LinkedIn insights directly into Office 365 to the new Resume Assistant. I'm excited about the many ways in which we are delivering powerful customer and member experiences that leverage both the Microsoft and LinkedIn Graphs.","We continue to see good momentum in Dynamics 365 with revenue growth of 67% year-over-year. Our modern and modular business process applications are resonating with customers driving digital transformation. Park Place Technologies, a global leader in datacenter support, chose Dynamics 365 along with LinkedIn Sales Navigator integration. And United Technologies and Columbia Sportswear chose Dynamics 365 and Azure for their digital transformation.","Now I'll talk about Cloud and AI. As Intelligent Cloud, Intelligent Edge becomes more predominant, our architectural advantage is increasingly clear to our customers. You see this reflected in the latest CIO surveys, as well as in our 98% Azure revenue growth this quarter. Only Microsoft delivers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance. This architectural advantage helps us address both existing enterprise workloads and new workloads such as IoT and Edge AI.","To thrive in this new era, customers need a consistent stack across public cloud and the edge, a model Azure Stack uniquely enables. Since broad availability just a few months ago, we are seeing incredible customer demand for Azure Stack across a diverse set of industries, including Schlumberger, ABB and Mitsui Knowledge Industry.","We are democratizing data science and AI, so any organization can convert their data into actionable insights and drive competitive advantage. Azure Cosmos DB is the first globally distributed, multi-model database. It is unique in its support for a new class of low-latency, event-based server-less applications.","Azure Databricks brings leading Apache Spark-based analytics. Our new SQL Server on Linux is off to a strong start with more than 5 million downloads and will bring more developers to the SQL ecosystem longer term.","To thrive in a world with millions of intelligent end points, every company needs an IoT strategy. Microsoft is giving customers comprehensive solutions to help them realize the promise of connected world of devices and things.","Azure IoT Central is the first global-scale SaaS offering that enables customers to build intelligent, secure, enterprise-grade IoT app in hours. Azure Event Grid simplifies the creation of event-driven IoT solutions across millions of end points. Azure IoT Edge enables customers to run server-less computing and machine learning models at the edge.","Chevron is using Azure IoT to harness massive amounts of data from its oil fields to accelerate deployment of new, intelligent solutions for oil exploration and to manage thousands of oil wells worldwide, increasing revenue and improving safety and reliability of their operations. Kohler is building connected, voice-activated products powered by Azure IoT and Johnson Controls is using large-scale device management capabilities in Azure IoT and Windows IoT for their new smart GLAS thermostat with Cortana voice control.","We reached the human parity milestone in machine reading comprehension using the Stanford Question Answer Dataset benchmark, which is the ability for AI to read a document and answer questions about it. We're using this and other AI advances to address some of society's most pressing challenges by partnering broadly across industries.","In healthcare, we are partnering with Adaptive Biotechnologies to build a practical solution for mapping the human immune system to detect cancer and other diseases in the earliest stages. We've created a HIPAA-compliant Health Bot powered by Azure Cognitive Services to assist with questions about health insurance, symptoms, and location of nearby doctors. Aurora Healthcare, UPMC and Premera Blue Cross have already signed on.","In retail, Kroger is using Azure to power their digital grocery store display solution for real-time pricing and promotions based on customer data to boost sales. Lowe's autonomous in-store robot uses Azure to keep constant tabs on inventory and identify out of stock or misplaced items, freeing store employees to focus on their customers. And Publicis Groupe's new AI platform built on Azure and Office 365 will empower their 80,000 employees worldwide.","Now, let me turn to Gaming. Our new Xbox One X was the top selling premium console this holiday in the United States, and we saw strong sales of the Xbox One S. We will continue to innovate in console to attract high value gamers, who want immersive 4K experiences, to build a broader subscription service with Game Pass, and to extend our services to all devices in our customers' lives across console, PC and mobile.","Our decision to release exclusive game content on the Xbox Game Pass simultaneously with global release increases the value of the subscription for members and our partners, and we are off to a very good start.","We grew gamer engagement again this quarter with 59 million monthly active Xbox Live members, record usage of our Xbox Live services, record viewers of our new streaming service, Mixer, and record Minecraft users.","Finally, we just acquired PlayFab, which serves more than 700 million gamers with more than 1,200 games from companies like Disney, Rovio and Atari. It's a complete backend platform for mobile, PC and console game developers to build, launch, and scale cloud-connected games, extending our investments in Azure to provide a world-class cloud platform for the gaming industry.","Before I turn over to Amy, I want to reflect on a topic that is at the forefront of every customer conversation that I have. In an era, where there is rapid transformation driven by digital technology, customers are looking for a trusted partner. Someone with a business model that is aligned with their long-term interests, deep technical innovation, and an understanding of the responsibility that goes along with this innovation. This perhaps is one our key differentiators. Internally, we have a saying, Microsoft runs on trust. And we strive to earn it every day with all of the constituents we serve.","Now, I'll hand it over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in more detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining you for the questions later.","Amy Hood","Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter revenue was $28.9 billion, up 12% and 11% in constant currency, with better than expected performance across all segments. Gross margin increased 12%. Operating income increased 10%. This quarter, we incurred a tax charge of $13.8 billion related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding that, earnings per share was $0.96, increasing 20%.","We achieved another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth, as we continued to realize the impact of strategic growth investments, along with strong sales execution.","At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 4 points of revenue growth and 5 points of gross margin growth, with minimal impact on operating income growth. Excluding the cost of amortization of acquired intangibles, LinkedIn contributed a $111 million to operating income and continues to be accretive to EPS this fiscal year, ahead of our original expectations.","Across most geographies, our results were in line with overall, improving macroeconomic trends. Large markets including the U.S., Western Europe and France performed better than expected, driven by commercial cloud momentum.","Our sales teams and channel partners delivered another quarter of outstanding commercial results even as we continue to work through our sales reorganization from July. Our commercial revenue annuity mix improved by 3 points year-over-year to 86% with healthy renewal rates.","Commercial bookings increased 7% and 4% in constant currency, even with a 20% smaller underlying expiration base. Commercial unearned revenue came in slightly higher than expected, at more than $20.2 billion, from growth in multiyear customer commitments to Azure.","Commercial cloud revenue was $5.3 billion, growing 56% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across geographic markets and customer segments. Gross margin increased by 7 points to 55%, in line with seasonal trends. We improved gross margin percentage in each cloud service, and Azure again saw the most significant margin improvement this quarter. Company gross margin was 62% and flat year-over-year.","Sales mix of higher margin products and services, including better than expected performance from Windows Server and Windows OEM Pro, combined with improving cloud margins offset the impact of the growing mix of cloud revenue, LinkedIn amortization cost, and device launches.","The FX impact on company and segment revenue growth was in line with expectations. The weaker U.S. dollar increased revenue growth by less than 1 point. FX had only 1 point of impact on operating expense growth, less than expected. This quarter, operating expenses grew 14% and 13% in constant currency, with 10 points of growth from LinkedIn, including $154 million of amortization expense. We continued to increase investments in cloud engineering, AI and sales capacity to drive future growth.","Now to the segment results. Productivity and Business Processes revenue grew 25% and 24% in constant currency to $9 billion, slightly better than expected, fueled by LinkedIn revenue acceleration. LinkedIn contributed 15 points of growth.","Office Commercial revenue grew double-digits again this quarter, increasing 10% year-over-year. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 41% from installed base growth across all customer segments, and ARPU expansion from continued customer migration to higher value offers in the E3 and E5 workloads. Office 365 commercial seats grew 30% in line with the expected trend, given the increasing size of the base.","Office Consumer revenue increased 12% and 11% in constant currency, driven by Office 365 recurring subscription revenue and growth in our subscriber base, now at 29.2 million. Our Dynamics business grew 10% and 9% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 67% and 68% in constant currency.","LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was better than expected, at $1.3 billion, driven by strong sales execution across all LinkedIn services. We saw continued strength in user engagement, customer acquisition, renewals, and upsell performance.","Segment gross margin dollars increased 24% and 23% in constant currency, with 14 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including the impact of $222 million of amortization expense. Gross margin percentage decreased slightly due to the impact of LinkedIn related amortization expense and the increased mix of cloud services.","Operating expenses grew 41%, 39% in constant currency, with 33 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $154 million of amortization expense. Excluding LinkedIn, operating expenses increased on cloud engineering and sales capacity investments. Operating income increased 9% and 10% in constant currency, with only 2 points of negative impact from LinkedIn.","The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $7.8 billion of revenue, growing 15%, with better than expected performance driven by hybrid cloud. Server products and cloud services revenue grew 18% with another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth. Azure revenue growth accelerated to 98%, with Azure premium services revenue growing triple-digits for the 14th consecutive quarter.","Enterprise Services revenue grew 5%, and 3% in constant currency, as growth in Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services was partially offset by declines in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003.","Segment gross margin dollars grew 13%, and gross margin percentage declined slightly, as the impact of increasing cloud revenue mix was mostly offset by material improvement in Azure gross margin. Operating expenses grew 3% and 2% in constant currency from ongoing investments in sales capacity and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 24%.","In More Personal Computing, revenue was $12.2 billion, up 2%, with better than expected results driven by Windows and Search. Excluding phone, revenue grew 4%. Our Windows OEM business grew 4% this quarter, better than we expected.","OEM Pro revenue reflects a stronger than anticipated commercial PC market bolstered by improved macro conditions and continued healthy enterprise Windows 10 deployments. We benefitted as well from a higher mix of premium licenses and the timing of license purchases.","OEM Non-Pro revenue was down 5 points, below the stabilizing consumer PC market. We continued to see growth in the premium category in line with the market, but heightened price competition on entry-level devices contributed to lower volumes. Inventory levels remained in the normal range.","Windows commercial products and cloud services declined 4% and 5% in constant currency, mainly due to the impact of a large deal in the prior year.","Search revenue ex-TAC grew 15% from higher revenue per search driven by continued optimization of our advertising platform, and search volume growth in both the U.S. and international markets. Surface revenue grew 1%, roughly flat in constant currency, as we continued to transition our portfolio towards Surface Laptop, Pro with LTE and the new Surface Book 2.","This holiday quarter, Gaming revenue grew 8%, mainly driven by hardware revenue growth of 14%, 13% in constant currency, from the launch of our premium console, the Xbox One X. Xbox software and services revenue growth was 4%, with continued monetization growth partially offset by prior year first party AAA title launches.","Segment gross margin dollars were roughly flat year-over-year, with the decline in Gaming offset by growth in Search and Surface. Segment gross margin percentage declined, as expected with the console launch.","Operating expenses increased 2%, and 1% in constant currency, from growth in engineering investments in Search, AI and Gaming that were partially offset by declines in Windows marketing and phone expenses. Operating income declined 2%. As a reminder, Q2 was the last quarter of phone comparability given the sale of the feature phone business last year.","Now back to the overall company results. As expected, our capital expenditures, including finance leases, increased sequentially to $3.3 billion due to higher levels of customer demand and usage for our cloud services. Cash paid for property and equipment was $2.6 billion.","Free cash flow generation - free cash flow grew this quarter 23% driven by operating cash flow growth of 25%. Free cash flow increased from higher customer collections following strong billings growth, working capital improvements in the hardware business and contribution from LinkedIn. Other income and expenses was $490 million this quarter, more than planned, due to higher interest income.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 18%, lower than anticipated, driven by an audit settlement as well as the normal variability between service and license revenue mix, geographic revenue mix, and the timing of equity vests. We returned $5 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends.","Now let's turn to next quarter's outlook. Assuming rates - assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 2 points, COGS by 1 point and operating expenses by 1 point.","With positive IT spend signals, a strengthening commercial PC market and growing customer demand for hybrid cloud services, we expect our commercial business to remain strong, as we drive annuity growth, expand our installed base and execute well on renewals. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be down approximately 2% to 3% sequentially, in line with historic seasonality. And our Q3 expiry base will return to year-over-year growth, impacting commercial bookings growth.","Third, CapEx. We will increase our capital expenditures to support increasing demand and capacity requirements. On an accrual dollar basis, we expect a sequential dollar increase next quarter.","We expect year-over-year improvement in overall commercial cloud gross margin as Azure margin improvement continues to offset an increasing mix of Azure revenue. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $8.6 billion and $8.8 billion. Both Office commercial and consumer revenue growth will be driven by Office 365, with growth rates for each consistent with Q2.","We expect double-digit Dynamics revenue growth from the shift to Dynamics 365. LinkedIn should deliver approximately $1.2 billion, growing more than 20%.","In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $7.55 billion and $7.75 billion, with strong double-digit revenue growth in server products and cloud services. In Enterprise Services, we expect a revenue growth rate similar to Q2, as growth in Premier support should offset the decline in Windows 2003 custom support agreements.","In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $9.1 billion and $9.4 billion. In Windows, we expect OEM revenue to be largely in line with the total PC market. Both OEM Pro revenue and Non-Pro revenue should be impacted by similar dynamics seen in Q2.","Now to Devices, Surface revenue should grow year-over-year from continued launch momentum from the latest Surface Pro, Book and Laptop, but decline sequentially consistent with holiday seasonality.","In Search ex-TAC, we expect a similar strong rate of revenue growth to Q2. In Gaming, we expect revenue growth similar to last quarter, but with a revenue-mix shift to software and services and continued year-over-year growth of our Xbox Live user-base.","We expect COGS between $9 billion and $9.2 billion, including 1 point of FX headwind. We expect operating expenses of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, including 1 point of FX headwind. Given the opportunity ahead of us and our execution to date, we will continue to invest in intelligent cloud, intelligent edge, AI and our sales teams to drive sustainable top-line growth.","Other income and expense should be approximately $350 million as we continue to take gains in our equities portfolio and earn dividend and interest income. This is lower than we previously expected, reflecting the impact of rising interest rates on our fixed income portfolio.","Now, a few comments on the fiscal year. First, given our outperformance in the first half of the year, we are now ahead of our previous expectation for full-year gross margin. We are now trending to be roughly flat year-over-year including LinkedIn. Second, we still expect full year operating expenses, including LinkedIn, between $36.4 billion and $36.7 billion. We are confident in this investment, given our significant growth opportunities, consistent execution and strong competitive position.","Third, on operating margin we are again trending ahead of our previous guidance. We now expect company operating margin, including LinkedIn, to be slightly up year-over-year. Excluding LinkedIn, company operating margin should improve by more than a point.","Fourth, tax rate. Based on our current understanding of the recently enacted tax law, we now expect our effective tax rate for H2 to be 16%, plus or minus 2 points. For FY 2019, we expect our full-year effective tax rate to be slightly below the new U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%, due to the impact of tax law provisions effective for us July 1, 2018.","We will continue to have quarterly variability based on the mix of service and license revenue, geographic mix of revenue and the timing of equity vest.","Finally, we remain consistent in our ongoing commitment to capital return. As always, we believe the highest shareholder value is created first through organic and inorganic investment to pursue the significant market opportunities ahead and are proud of our resource allocation changes and the results.","And, we've been focused on capital return through both dividends and share repurchase as a key part of our commitment to total shareholder return for many years. With the recent tax reform, we can continue that commitment without the need to access the capital markets.","Before turning to Q&A, I have one special thank you. Chris Suh is moving to a new role as the senior finance leader of our Azure and Server business. On behalf of the company, thank you for your significant impact on Investor Relations for the past five years. And I'd like to welcome Mike Spencer, the former finance leader of our Office 365 business, as the new Head of Investor Relations. We look forward to having you lead the team.","Now, Chris, let's go to Q&A.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to the Q&A. Ria, can you please repeat your instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Karl Keirstead","Thanks very much and congratulations on the results. So relative to your guidance, over half the beat this quarter came in the Intelligent Cloud segment. So I wouldn't mind digging in there a little bit. And it wasn't just the amazing Azure performance. Your on-prem server product business accelerated despite the cautious commentary about a tough comp on the last call.","Even Enterprise Services was plus-3% instead of flat. And your guide actually suggests that that goodness in Intelligent Cloud should continue next quarter, despite actually a way tougher comp. So I'm just curious, Amy or Satya, if there are any threads that you can weave through this Intelligent Cloud outperformance, if you saw any broader increase in enterprise spend in the December quarter. Any change in behavior or is all of this goodness a little bit more Microsoft-specific? Amy, you called out IT spending signal, so I'm guessing maybe a little bit was macro. Thank you.","Satya Nadella","Thanks, Karl. Let me start and, Amy, you can add. I mean, for me it all comes down to really having an architectural advantage on what is a new secular trend. So when we think about the Intelligent Cloud and the Intelligent Edge, and then bring that to the Azure business, you can see it at each layer. When it comes to infrastructure, we're the only cloud provider that provides true hybrid cloud computing with Azure and Azure Stack.","When it comes to the data tier, we have real uniqueness. Take something like Cosmos DB. It's the only planet-scale database, that's multi-model, supports these new programming models of server-less and event-driven programming. Take SQL, what we are seeing in terms of SQL growth, in terms of Azure DB, as well as SQL server and SQL server on Linux, that's again addressing the customer needs.","There are new workloads that are being born, that require both the cloud and the edge, IoT being a great example of that. And especially when you take that in combination with AI, again, you train on the cloud and you score on the edge. That's a real competitive advantage. We have everything from sort of the lifecycle management of how these models get created and deployed, and so on.","So I think that's what you're seeing. There will be variability quarter to quarter. There will be mix differences. But overall, when I look at what is it that we need to get done is innovate on what is a fundamental architectural advantage to where the world is going.","Amy Hood","And I would say, Karl, a couple of things. We've been investing here both in engineering to land the differentiation that Satya just talked about in sales resources and then continuing to invest in technical sales resources that can help our customers be successful in these deployments. I actually think you're continuing to see the impact of those investments growing in time and growing in expertise.","And so, I feel encouraged both by the technical differentiation, but also the return on the investments we've made here, that lead us to have good amount of confidence that you do see in the guide in Q3. And yes, you're right, we do have a tougher comparable, particularly on-prem in Q3, which is correct.","Karl Keirstead","Okay, thank you both.","Satya Nadella","Thank you, Karl.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Karl. We'll move to next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Keith Eric Weiss","Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. Very - again, a really solid quarter. And, Chris, it's been great working with you. Sorry to see you go from this role.","I'll ask my questions. One question for Satya, and starting a little bit narrow, maybe running off from there. Gaming in the quarter seems to have - had a good quarter for gaming with Xbox launch. But more broadly, there are some murmurings out there about Xbox falling behind PlayStation. If you look at the sort of the bases of those two consoles, there are murmurings about not having enough kind of exclusive games on the console.","I know you sort of mixed up leadership a little bit there. How do you feel about your positioning in gaming from a narrow focus? And then more broadly, how are you guys feeling about your position in the home if you will. When I go home, I'm talking to Alexa. I'm not talking to Cortana. Is that something that you're comfortable with where we are today? Is that something we should see improving on a going forward basis?","Satya Nadella","Thanks, Keith. So let me take both of those questions. So on gaming, we feel good about Xbox One X, the premium console launch. We also feel good about the volume we got for Xbox One S, because we always wanted that halo effect of the premium console driving even the lower-end console, because that creates the sockets for gaming for us.","But our real strategy going forward is not only to do great work on the console, but to complement that with the work we're doing on the PC. PC gaming is a growth market. And so, therefore you see us, whether it's our subscription offer, whether it's our streaming efforts that are increasingly bringing the console plus PC together.","And then, not stopping there, but going to other devices, for example mobile. Minecraft on mobile we just launched in fact in the last quarter in China. We are seeing tremendous growth of Minecraft expansion on mobile platform in China. So overall, you will see us do good work on the console, we'll compete there. But more importantly, we have a much more broader gaming view in terms of what value we can add with our subscription services streaming services across all devices.","And one other point I think I made in my remarks earlier is gaming also is a growth area for Azure. In other words, we have now increasing past services that we are going to reinforce on Azure and attract more game developers. Some of the know-how that we have from Xbox is not just about the Xbox, but it's going to help developers across the board. So that I think will also transcend or lead into even media companies. So we're very excited about some of what we can get out of our investments in gaming. So that's our focus on gaming.","In terms of Cortana and home, I think it's probably important. Although the question I'll ask is, you asked it narrowly, but my investments are much broader. In other words, I first start by saying let's make sure our best AI capability, whether it's speech, whether it's ultimately even image recognition and dialogue management, because right now most assistants are fairly dumb in terms of just doing one-turn dialogue, but where we're going to go is multi-turn dialogue and that requires real natural language understanding.","So all of those investments, for example, are available on Azure as Cognitive Services. I even referenced in my remarks how in healthcare people are using those to build bots and skills and agents. That's where we will make sure we do our best, building blocks and AI work. Of course, it will manifest for us with Cortana as an agent from Microsoft that has some special skills, especially around that crossover between work and life.","Most agents and their knowledge or smarts come from the data access they have. In our case, it's going to be about things that are there in Office 365. The people, places, things and how we reason about it and help users, whether they're at home or whether they're at work.","Lastly, even when it's comes to devices, we want to take an approach that brings all assistants. That's why we are working with Alexa, we would welcome it on our devices, because we believe in a world where our own assistant should be available everywhere and so should other assistants be available on our devices versus thinking that the end game here is about speaking, doing one-turn dialogues on one speaker in one home. That's just not our vision.","Keith Eric Weiss","Excellent.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Keith. We'll move to next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with [Ever AB] [ph]. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you. Congrats first on the great quarter, and Chris, thanks and congratulations on the new position, so you'll be greatly successful. Satya, I'd like to ask you a question, can you give us a sense of what is the adoption of Azure in the U.S. versus International, not just in the revenue point of view. But in terms of the mix of premium workloads, types of workloads, et cetera? How should we think, where we are in that process?","Satya Nadella","I would say, the U.S. has been a lead market in general when it comes to the latest technology and architectural paradigm adoption, whether it'd like take something like AI or the higher-level services around data. We clearly see first things happening in U.S. and quickly followed by geographies like Germany and the UK. There are certain workloads like the IoT workload, where we do see very advanced action in countries like Germany, especially with the industrial customers in terms of smart factories, Japan.","But I think broadly, I don't see any difference than say, what we used to see or what we still see on our server or any other technology adoption curves. And they have differences in industry patterns, because different industries are strong in different parts of the globe. So - and then, they represent different use cases in terms of the components of Azure that get used.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Mark. We'll take next question please, Ria.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you. Two questions. One, Amy, I guess you've been talking about and so is IR about the commercial bookings, where the expiry base was down over year-over-year - on a year-over-year basis. I am just wondering, if you look ahead to 2019, is there anything you could share with us about the size of the expiry base in that period just so we can think about it? I know, you don't give guidance that far out, but just as we start to think about - thinking about further out growth.","And then, I guess the other question would be - you mentioned better IT spending. But just also given the significant savings companies in the U.S. are going to be seeing due to lower tax bills. Is there any early feedback from partners or customers about the rate that this might be reinvested back into IT spending and digitization? Thank you.","Amy Hood","Thanks, Heather. In general, fiscal 2019 will have a higher base than fiscal 2018, just as you start to think through the impacts on bookings for the next year. And as we talked about, Q3 has that same attribute, it's higher than it was a year-ago Q2. The reason we called it out, obviously, because it was such an outlier. And if you look back three years sort of how this EA expiry base works, our performance this quarter was really strong compared to three years ago. So I feel great about our sales execution especially in terms of growing the recapture rate at accounts.","To the question on the demand signals we're seeing in the U.S. in particular - I think, it is quite early, but as we said the U.S. has been a good market for us and a strong market for us for a good period of time, and it was again in Q2, as we noted. And I think, we are optimistic as we look to H2, when we see the signals we're seeing in the market whether it's PCs, server or the cloud demand.","Heather Bellini","Thank you.","Chris Suh","Thank you, Heather. Thanks. We'll take next question, Ria.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Philip Winslow","Hi. Thanks, guys, for taking my question and congrats not only just on the income statement, but also obviously the balance sheet where, obviously, the commercial, it was only down 5% versus your guided 7%, so congrats there. The - my focus is actually on the commercial side, but specifically on Office. Obviously, your Office 365 revenue continues to outpace seat growth there.","We've talked about that in the past with pricing, but if I just look at also overall Office on the commercial side, up 10%, same as Q1, when you all think about just going forward just the mix of those two, obviously, the on-prem business is still declining in the high-teens, and then Office 365 growing rapidly. How do you think about just the blended growth of Office commercial and the puts and takes there?","Amy Hood","This is one, where I tend to when I think about that 10% number, it really is the same way I think about Office 365. Our goal and I think the real opportunity that remains with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 going forward, is our ability to continue to grow the installed base, and to also continue to grow our ARPU. The combination of those two things and the opportunity we see is the reason in the sales re-org that we did in July, we continue to put resources and sales resources behind collaboration and communication, and so many of the important workloads that allow us to give great value to customers.","And you've even started to see it this quarter as you're pointing out, Phil. We saw a little bit more impact of E5 this quarter in ARPU than we have been seeing. It's been in the market a while, we're seeing that momentum, the value all up of E5 not just from an Office perspective, but from a Microsoft 365 perspective with security and management as well as some of the newer products that are getting some strong adoption like Teams.","I think we feel really good about where we are, and the value and our opportunity both from small business up to the large enterprise from first line workers to do all of these - do all these things and continue to execute well. So the guide certainly implies that continued optimism.","Philip Winslow","Awesome. Thanks, guys.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Phil. We'll take - go to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.","Raimo Lenschow","Thanks for taking my question, and all the best for you, Chris. I just wanted to double click on the productivity gaze you see in the Cloud especially on Azure. Can you talk a little bit about the [drivers there] [ph]? I know one is that your build-out pattern was different than some of your competitors, so you're kind of filling capacity. But also talk a little bit about what you see in terms of how you are delivering the services in Azure and how that's evolving? Thank you.","Satya Nadella","I mean, overall we did take an approach that we want to make sure we meet the real world needs across the globe. And we'll continue to do so, when we look at our CapEx spend we want to make sure that the data center regions meet the needs of our customers globally across both consumer workloads and enterprise workloads, where real data sovereignty requirements and speed-of-light issues are already relevant.","Having said that, the way it fills up is by the value-add that we can do. So that's why the mix of these higher level services especially around data and AI is definitely driving a lot more consumption of our higher level services. And even something like IoT, they're not just at the consumption meters, but they're also got SaaS like qualities to them.","So I feel very, very good about ultimately having innovation that drives both the consumption of more higher level services and then also making sure that we are available in all parts of the world, where the demand is going to spread to, because we are in the very, very early innings of essentially this new cloud growth, and there's only going to be increasing demand as there's more digitization of every city, every factory, every hospital and so on. So I think we have a long way to go to still fill up.","Amy Hood","And I would say, the way to think about that and you see it in the gross margin percentages and the improvements we've continued to see is the Azure premium revenue growth exceeding the overall revenue growth that actually is a benefit to the gross margin rate. Then again all the work we have done through the supply chain. So while we have a signal come in, you see a very quick turn from demand signal to us having servers in place and ready to be utilized very quickly. That work continues and the team has done a really nice job.","And then as well software improvements, they continue to go on to increase our ability to run more or less. Those taken together continue to show gross margin improvement.","Raimo Lenschow","Thank you.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Reimo. We will go to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay. Thank you very much. Amy, I'd like to follow-up on Heather's question, because it's really difficult to grow commercial bookings by mid-single-digits constant currency in the face of 20% or so declining EA expirations. And so I'm wondering, looking beyond this quarter, if you could expand on how commercial bookings growth ex-renewals is trending? And in other words, are you getting more separation, if you will between reported growth and growth excluding renewal activity?","Amy Hood","Let me take a shot. The way I think about bookings growth every quarter, as you tend to look at a couple of things. And I would say, I start with renewals, not just that we renew the contract but how many new products, new services did we add to that contract? Do we expand our footprint, our percentage of the IT budget at a customer? Do they rely on us for more products and more services? This quarter is a good example of that happening.","And if you think about the connection to why that happens it's not just a terrific engineering work that we've done in product value, it's also the investments that we've made to put resources and some of these larger accounts to continue to add new workloads that are only possible in the cloud and we've added resources that we're seeing the revenue get recaptured in that way. So that I think feels very good from a resource allocation and return perspective.","And so, then the next component obviously is being able to grow just brand new accounts. Are we growing customer bases? Are we penetrating segments and you also saw that in the quarter. So at a high-level you can either sort of add more, expand your footprint or you get to add a new customer and both of those are motions that we focus on and I feel good about our execution.","I think there is and you'll see that dynamic, so if the expiry base is a little bigger, you'd expect obviously a number bigger than that on the booking side and when the expiry rates' growth - it's really about the delta between the two as you know. And our execution this quarter was quite good. But it's come from sustainable investment and our sales, technical resources, and in the engineering to deliver a differentiated value at the customer.","Gregg Moskowitz","Very helpful, thank you.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Gregg. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Kash Rangan","Hi, Satya, my nine-year-old kid insists that the Minecraft is the best thing for his brain development. So whatever it is congratulations. But serious question is with cash repatriation obviously Microsoft has the ability to bring back a lot of money. I'm wondering what the priorities of the company are with respect to doing a large strategic deal or not so perhaps, and perhaps even share repurchases and dividends. Clearly, this is once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and there is a lot that can be done. Curious, how you think about this. Thank you so much.","Satya Nadella","I'll actually let Amy.","Amy Hood","Yeah, why don't I take this. Number one I would say, we have - when we have seen an opportunity to invest, we have not really waited for tax reform to do that. Our opportunity, the TAM, really the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity is really the technical transition and digital transformation that's occurring now. And so, we've invested to make that happen. We made acquisitions when they made sense. We have used the capital markets and the debt market to fund those to make sure that we made the right investments to grow our business.","And so for us, we also didn't wait when we thought about capital return. Even this quarter, we returned almost all of our free cash flow generation in dividends and share repurchase. And we've been on that path for a number of years. Now, that being said, I am pleased obviously, to be able to access the cash more easily and not has to go through the debt market to be able to make these choices. Whether it's investment in ourselves, and the returns you've seen in this quarter in revenue growth, whether it's the acquisitions like LinkedIn that are performing better than we expected. And I think today, we would even say it's a more strategic asset than we even maybe thought a year ago in terms of the power of it to add to our graph and our understanding.","And then, be able to return capital. So for me, while I appreciate the spirit behind the question, for us we have felt a necessity to do that for years, as a part of total shareholder return and our commitment to do that. And I think we've done a good job. And I'm proud of what we've done, and I'm proud and excited for what we can continue to do.","Kash Rangan","Terrific. Thanks so much.","Chris Suh","Thank you, Kash. We'll take one - the next question, please. We'll move to the next question please, Ria.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Michael Nemeroff","Well, thanks for taking my question. This one's for Amy, about the Office 365 commercial. Are there any limitations other than storage-related workloads that would limit Office 365 commercial gross margin from reaching, say, 80% over time? And what are some of the current limitations on that gross margin that you'd think could be improved upon, for that to work higher than 70% over time? Thanks.","Amy Hood","Thanks. You're right. In general, workloads like Exchange and increasingly SharePoint, which we have seen some really great encouraging numbers on usage of SharePoint in our Office 365 commercial base. Those do have storage requirements. And so, you're absolutely right. They are slightly different than many of the very high-level SaaS workloads that you see. But we still do have room, which I think is really the core of the question.","We still have some room to improve that Office 365 commercial gross margin, from the new workloads we've added, which have even more of this pure SaaS like workloads, and aside from Office, in that same segment is Dynamics who - or LinkedIn, which both have those SaaS like margins, and can, and we see opportunity to both improve those as well.","So I don't think there's necessarily a level, but there's certainly room even within these storage-heavy workloads.","Satya Nadella","I mean, I'd just add, this is not specifically to the gross margin question, but the expansive nature Microsoft 365, first of all, we think of it all up in that context. Amy already referenced how small businesses that perhaps never did advanced workloads are now able to do so. Emerging markets that never did are able to do so.","So first of all, whether it's - on firstline workers, we never had any solutions for firstline workers. So there is a market expansion in terms of users and the sophistication of the workloads that they can use or the higher-level services. The other thing is Office by itself. You talked about storage. It's an interesting question to say, what is being stored in Office, in meetings going forward, at home office or people calling in, things like mixed-reality being used in meetings.","It's very different. It's not about you sitting in front of Word and entering text. That's not the full limit of Office. Office is about any people collaborating in voice or in - with even computer vision and many other ways that I think collaboration will happen. So we have a very expansive view, much like Azure for infrastructure, and data and AI. In terms of human activity that gets digitized at work and at home is something that we're going after with Microsoft 365.","Michael Nemeroff","Thanks for taking my questions.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Michael. We'll go down to our last question now please, Ria, if we can move to it.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Alex Zukin","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Satya, I wanted to ask you about Azure Stack adoption. You mentioned it was ahead of your expectations on the call. And, I guess, if you think about your early traction with service providers and how you're empowering them to build these Azure capable datacenters globally, maybe longer term how should we think about the impact of this on Azure hyper-growth durability beyond fiscal 2018 as you scale?","Satya Nadella","See, our overall vision for how computing evolves is that it's going to be more distributed, not less distributed. Let's just take for example what's happening in a factory. In a factory, one thing that is secular is that they're putting lots and lots of more sensors. Lot of the sensors today are in fact rendezvousing some of that data straight to the cloud.","As you do more of that, what happens is you need to - and then you start doing sensor fusion, which is your multiple sensors that you want to be able to fuse and take action. The speed of light gets in the way. So they want local compute. And so, in order to have that local compute in some of these factories with millions of sensors, you may in fact need Azure Stack. So it's not just about old workloads and service providers and essentially hybrid computing as we understand it.","When I think about hybrid computing at least in the fullness of time, it's more the future of distributed computing, where there is a cloud, there is an edge. And even the edge is not just one single edge. But it's got a topology associated with it, going all the way to the sensors, whether it's at home, whether it's in a hospital, whether it's in a factory.","So that's where we're going to end up, which is a true distributed computing fabric that the world needs in order to be digitally transformed. How - and quarter to quarter will there be volatility, shifts, changes, that's all going to be the case. But we see the pattern emerge pretty clearly in terms of where we need to go.","Chris Suh","Okay. Thank you, Alex. So that wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at the coming months at various investor conferences and events. You can find the details on the Microsoft IR website.

As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel.","On our website, microsoft.com\/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our website also includes information related to our new financial reporting segments announced in September.","This is also the first quarter that reflects the revenue recognition accounting for Windows 10. As a reminder, we report Windows revenue prior to any accounting adjustment in our More Personal Computing segment. The corresponding revenue deferral for Windows 10 sales is then reported in corporate and other in our segment reporting.","Earnings commentary today and going forward will focus on results prior to the net deferral impact as we believe this is the best reflection of business health. Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of last year's integration and restructuring charges and the current Windows 10 net revenue deferral. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's first-quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results.","Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q and includes research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative but exclude the impact of last year's integration and restructuring charges.","All growth comparisons we make on the call relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying business has performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. At the segment level we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to the recent change in our segment reporting groupings we aren't able to provide segment-level constant currency operating expense growth, and consequently cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant currency operating expense and income growth at the company-wide level.","We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission and in the transcript and any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until October 21, 2016.","During this call we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm looking forward to today's call. This quarter we delivered $21.7 billion in revenue and group profit. Also as part of our commitment to balance capital returns, we meaningfully increased our quarterly dividend and continued our stock repurchase plan.","More importantly, we are focused and making progress towards the goals for fiscal year 2018 that we shared six months ago. Now more than 110 million active devices are running Windows 10. We are well on our way to reaching 1 billion Windows 10 active devices. People are moving from needing to choosing to loving Windows.","Similarly we are making great progress towards our goal of $20 billion in annualized commercial cloud revenue run rate, which now exceeds $8.2 billion. The results speak to our differentiated cloud strategy, expanded market opportunity and the speed at which customers are adopting our service.","As I reflect on the quarter, it is important to note that we are investing in significant addressable markets where we also have meaningful differentiation. Today we'll walk through our financial results for the first quarter and discuss how we are delivering new innovation and growing users and usage across each of our three segments.","Let's start off with productivity and business process. Clearly, how people work has changed dramatically but one thing remains true, everyone wants to get more out of every moment of their life. After all, time is our scarcest commodity. That's why we set out to reinvent productivity and business process. The recent release of Office is a big step forward. We designed Office 2016 and Office 365 to take the work out of working together. We want to help change the nature of work within organizations of all sizes by focusing on the mobility of the person's experience, enabling collaboration and building a rich service that spans all aspects of how people work today.","This approach is resonating with both our consumer and commercial customers. More and more consumers are using Office across device platforms, which is driving Office 365 growth. There are now more than 18 million consumer Office 365 subscribers. We surpassed 200 million downloads of Office Mobile, more than 1 billion to-do lists have been created so far in Wunderlist and more than 0.5 billion people manage their documents and photos in OneDrive.","We continue to see strong adoption in the commercial space as well. From our largest customers, such as Kraft, GE, Louis Vuitton, to schools and small businesses around the globe. Of note, commercial Office 365 monthly active users grew to 60 million with nearly 60% of our installed base using premium workloads. And we added 50,000 new small business customers in each of the last 19 consecutive months.","As customers move to our cloud, it enables us to deliver even more value and push for new growth by entering new categories. Information protection is a great example where we have done this because of natural synergies with our existing services. In fact, nearly 20 million people already use our new premium information protection capabilities in Office 365. That's a tremendous validation of how the cloud accelerates the adoption of new workloads and grows our ability to monetize new value in the $10 billion information protection market.","The new organizational analytics market is another area where we see growth opportunity so we are investing with our acquisition of VoloMetrix, a powerful cloud-based tool for analyzing organizational productivity. The ability to visualize how people engage with others inside and outside an organization is something the cloud is uniquely suited to do. It is exciting to be on the forefront of creating a new technology category. This illustrates how our vision for productivity goes beyond helping individuals to empowering groups of people and entire organizations to accomplish more together. Our addressable opportunity will expand further as we launch more advanced security, voice and analytics workloads in our new premium Office 365 SKU next quarter.","Let's talk about business process. With Dynamics we are making great progress in breaking down the boundaries between business process, collaboration and productivity to truly empower organizations. The companies I talk with every day are under pressure to grow revenue while differentiating themselves on customer experience. It's one reason usage of CRM is growing. Dynamics CRM Online enterprise seats more than tripled year over year. Dynamics AX revenue also grew double digits as the operational system for agile business processes. And we have a new release for Dynamics NAV for small businesses that is tightly integrated with Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics CRM.","Moving to the intelligent cloud. Before I talk about the great progress we are making with our intelligent cloud platform, I want to pause and reflect on where we are as an industry. While many companies are developing commercial cloud offerings, there are really only two driving enterprise cloud platform innovations at massive scale, Amazon and Microsoft. We push each other and we each have a unique approach. Microsoft has bet on a strategy to build a hyper-scale public cloud as well as reinvent servers as the edge of our cloud. This approach gives customers a true hybrid distributed computing platform that reflects their real world needs. Our unique hybrid approach coupled with high value services is clearly a structural advantage.","It's great to see our customers like Walmart, jet.com and Alaska Airlines seize the benefits of the cloud to transform and push for growth. Azure revenue and compute usage more than doubled year over year and we are continuing to channel our innovation into high growth scenarios with new features and services. In the last quarter alone, we have made major updates spanning Azure app services for building enterprise web and mobile apps, Azure Data Lake for infinite data management and analytics, advanced threat analytics which help organizations identify breaches and threats using behavioral analysis.","CIOs are increasingly adopting our Azure premium service for security and manageability. Enterprise Mobility services has more than doubled to 20,000-plus customers. Our installed base has increased nearly 6 times year over year making EMS the largest mobility and identity management solution in a new and growing market.","Our acquisition of Adallom, an innovator in cloud security, will bring customers with ability and control over application access and company data stored across popular cloud applications including Office 365, Salesforce, ServiceNow and many more.","To be a worldwide cloud player, global scale is a must. With that in mind, we launched new data centers in India bringing our global total to over 20 regions, more than any other major cloud provider. We aren't just selling into these countries, we see the cloud as an accelerator of local economies by offering tools that empower emerging businesses, transform public sector services and create value for new local partners. Our differentiated hybrid capabilities mean customers get to choose how they adopt the cloud and distribute their workloads. This in turn is driving the growth of our server business. Premium versions of Windows Server, SQL Server and System Center all grew double digits.","Lastly, we reached a big milestone with SQL Server, one that has been 20 years in the making. The database software market is still one of the largest and now we are an unparalleled leader in Gartner's Operational DBMS Magic Quadrant. That speaks to our differentiated vision in the category and the value we deliver to customers and we are certainly not done innovating. This milestone with SQL juxtaposed with our rapid growth in Azure and its position in the cloud Magic Quadrant shows the overall strength and progress we are making with our intelligent cloud platform.","Now let's shift to progress in our More Personal Computing segment, specifically how the launch of Windows 10 is sparking new growth opportunities for the entire Windows ecosystem. As a platform company, we think about bringing the needs of multiple constituencies together, developers, IT professionals and users, and we have seen great response from all three. There are now more than 110 million monthly active devices running Windows 10. The majority of the upgrades in the first 10 weeks were naturally from consumers and are three times that of Windows 7 over the same time period after launch. We are also seeing a fast start to business adoption with more than 8 million business PCs now running Windows 10. We are adding more enterprise features and we are making it easier for businesses to buy and support Windows devices.","Our early success in attracting developers' apps and store visits is also growing. Our stores have seen 1.25 billion visits and developer revenue per download has grown four times since the Windows 10 launch. Developers are responding to the opportunity, including Facebook, which will release universal apps for Facebook, Instagram and Messenger.","Windows 10 is also driving increased usage of other Microsoft services. Specifically, Bing's share is up to 20.7% in the US and advertising revenue grew 29% worldwide, helped by Windows 10 users asking Cortana more than 1 billion questions.","Further in gaming, we have also seen an increase in active users as we extend our gaming experiences from the console to Windows 10 PCs. Xbox Live continues to grow active usage and every day nearly half of the Xbox One user base is engaged in the service. It'll be a great holiday for all gamers. The beta release of Minecraft for Windows 10 is off to a strong start, with players having already placed over 0.5 billion blocks. And next week we are excited to launch one of the most anticipated new games this holiday with Halo 5: Guardians. This new Halo includes an epic hunt for Master Chief along with groundbreaking multiplayer matches on Xbox Live. As a result, I confidently predict that time will become much more scarce for Xbox One owners starting on Tuesday.","We see all of this Windows 10 usage as an early indicator of our ability to drive growth over the lifetime of a device. Two weeks ago we took the next major step in our journey with announcement of new Windows 10 premium devices from us and from our OEM partners. It's an incredible lineup across a broad spectrum of categories from the new Surface Pro 4, Surface Book to Lumia 950, 950 XL, to Microsoft Band 2 and HoloLens developer edition. Early reviews are generating excitement with customers and we are delighted that our preorder sales are reflecting the positive sentiment in the market.","We're also seeing hundreds of new device designs from our partners, the widest range ever for this holiday. It's clear that by bringing together our applications, operating system and hardware, we will invent new personal computers and new personal computing.","Overall, I'm proud of our results this quarter and I'm optimistic about our growth prospects. We are poised to seize the opportunity of the largest technology shift of our generation with the enterprise cloud. We are increasing users and engagement in services that cross every aspect of a person's life, from Office at work to Xbox at home, while at the same time we are positioning Windows for growth. Our transformation is well underway. Quarter after quarter we build new capability, we enter new markets, scale our new businesses and new business models and we are being disciplined in our execution.","I'll now handed off to Amy to talk about this quarter's results in greater detail and I look forward to rejoining you after to answer questions.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. Before addressing this quarter's results, I want to briefly comment on the reporting segment change we announced during the quarter. We believe our new segments in combination with the supplemental metrics and the profit measure of operating incomes provide transparency into our progress against our ambitions. As Chris mentioned, my commentary today on our results and outlook will reflect the new segments and excludes the net revenue deferral impact of Windows 10.","Last quarter, we discussed the material impact that foreign exchange movement would have on our financial results through fiscal 2016. In Q1, the FX impact on total revenue was 5 points, with most of the impact in the Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes segments given their high annuity mix. This was in line with the expectations we shared in July.","This quarter, revenue was $21.7 billion, down 7% and 2% in constant currency, primarily due to the changes we've made in our phone business. Gross margin declined by 3% but was up 3% in constant currency. We were thoughtful with operating expenses, realizing savings but investing as well. As a result, operating income grew 1% or 11% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $0.67 growing 3% and growing 15% in constant currency.","We continued to see solid performance across most developed markets while the challenging macro conditions in Brazil, China, Japan, and Russia persisted this quarter.","Commercial results are now included in each of the reporting segments, therefore each quarter I will cover overall commercial results in my commentary. Our commercial business continues to be healthy, with momentum in cloud services and a higher annuity mix across all segments. Commercial bookings were slightly better than we expected and grew 10% in constant currency. We executed well on expirations and commercial unearned revenue came in as expected, growing 3% to $21 billion, up 10% in constant currency. Our contracted not billed balance was more than $23.5 billion, in line with seasonality for the quarter.","As Satya remarked, our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate surpassed $8.2 billion, growing nearly 70% year on year and in line with our expectations. Consistent with the revenue pattern across our commercial business, we typically derived the largest volume of renewals and new agreements in June and consequently see a lower sequential growth rate in Q1. Importantly, our commercial cloud gross margin percentage improved again sequentially from Q4 as we benefited from increasing scale and efficiencies. As I will talk about shortly, our leading indicators around usage, new cloud services and customer demand remain healthy, and we are clearly on track for our $20 billion goal in FY 2018.","Now, let's turn to the detailed results of each segment. Our Productivity and Business Processes segment, which is made up of commercial and consumer Office including Office 365 as well as Dynamics delivered $6.3 billion in revenue, declining 3% and growing 4% in constant currency.","In Office commercial, revenue grew 5% in constant currency and was slightly better than we expected. Increased channel sales capacity, a higher adoption of premium services and continued installed base growth all contributed to our performance. We saw broad-based Office 365 seat growth across both large enterprise and the SMB customer base.","Office consumer revenue declined 4% in constant currency, better than the underlying consumer PC market and slightly better than we had expected. This quarter, recurring subscription revenue more than offset the impact of customers transitioning to Office 365.","Our Dynamics business grew 12% in constant currency, slightly better than we expected. Growth was driven primarily by Dynamics CRM Online. We continue to make progress by investing in product innovation organically as well as adding capabilities through acquisitions like FieldOne and FantasySalesTeam.","Segment gross margin declined 6% but grew 1% in constant currency. Gross margin percentages have been impacted by the mix shift toward our rapidly growing cloud services, including our consumer properties like OneDrive. As Chris mentioned, this year we can't provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses and therefore operating income. That said, FX in general as at the company level had a favorable impact on operating expenses, which declined 6%.","The Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes our portfolio of server products, Azure cloud services and Enterprise services, delivered $5.9 billion of revenue, up 8% and up 14% in constant currency, in line with our expectations. Our differentiated cloud platform offerings and rapid pace of innovation continue to be compelling to both new and existing customers.","Segment gross margin grew 8% or 15% in constant currency. We continue to invest in research and development resources to realize the large and growing addressable market opportunities and are accelerating our plans to add incremental sales capacity to support growing customer demand for cloud services. Segment operating income grew 14%.","Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing, which includes Windows, devices, gaming and search. Revenue was $9.4 billion, declining 17% and 13% in constant currency, mainly due to the changes in our phone strategy. As Satya mentioned, since the launch of Windows 10 in late July, we have seen solid momentum in our ecosystem and with our customers. And importantly, we saw positive engagement and usage signals across services like search and gaming that provide post-sale monetization opportunities.","Overall, our OEM business declined 6% this quarter, outperforming the PC market and better than we had anticipated, driven primarily by non-Pro OEM. As we discussed previously, this was a transition quarter as the ecosystem moves to Windows 10 and we believe overall inventory in the channel is at normal levels as we head into holiday. OEM non-Pro revenue declined 4% as we saw OEMs focused on premium devices aligned to the Windows 10 launch. This drove a richer mix to market leading to improvement in the average revenue per license. OEM Pro revenue declined 7% slightly ahead of the overall commercial PC market.","Windows volume licensing grew 4% in constant currency with annuity growth in mid single digits. Search revenue increased to more than $1 billion this quarter and we passed an important milestone as our search business reached profitability.","In our devices portfolio, revenue declined 49% and 45% in constant currency, mainly due to phone revenue which decreased $1.5 billion. As expected, Surface revenue slowed with the market anticipation of a new Surface Pro device for the holidays. Surface continues to gain ground with businesses and schools, creating opportunities for our rapidly growing partner channel which includes Accenture, Dell and HP. Both the number and size of deals in our commercial segment for Surface have increased double digits year on year.","This quarter in gaming, revenue grew 6% in constant currency. We saw growth in Xbox Live transactional revenue and our first-party game portfolio, offset by declines in hardware revenue due to lower volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold. Government gross margin declined 10% or 4% in constant currency. Gross margin percentages were flat year over year, excluding the phone. Segment operating expenses declined 13% due primarily to lower phone expense. As a result, segment operating income decreased 4%.","Now back to our overall company results. As usage of our cloud service grows, we will continue to invest capital into our data centers and servers globally. This quarter we invested $1.5 billion to support that demand-driven growth. Other income was negative $280 million due in part to foreign currency remeasurement and interest expense. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21%, below our guided range. This was driven by the change in geographic mix of our earnings and lower nondeductible operating losses associated with phone. This quarter, we returned $6.9 billion to shareholders, up 51%. This includes our recently announced 16% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.36.","With that overview of the quarter, let's move to the outlook. I'll start with some overall comments and then move to a discussion by segment. First on FX. Based on the current rates and the forecasted geographic mix of revenue, we expect 4 points of negative impact on total revenue in Q2. By segment, we expect a 7 point drag in Productivity and Business Processes, 6 points in Intelligent Cloud and 3 points in More Personal Computing. In H2, we expect the impact to lessen to around 3 points in total, weighted toward our segments with the highest percentage of annuity.","Next to our commercial business, which we expect to remain healthy in Q2. Our annuity mix should trend up with good execution on contract renewals and continued adoption of our commercial cloud services. Accordingly, we expect commercial unearned revenue to be within a range of $19.5 billion to $19.7 billion, benefiting from these positive trends. With the ongoing increase in cloud demand, we expect to accelerate our investment in data centers and capital equipment for the remainder of the fiscal year, expanding geographic coverage and capacity.","Now let me share some additional thoughts on each segment. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion. Adjusted for 7 points of expected FX impact, the revenue growth reflects the continued momentum of Office 365 and our Dynamics portfolio. And as Satya discussed, with our new E5 SKU in Q2, we're expanding our opportunity into security, analytics and voice.","For the Intelligent Cloud segment, we expect revenue of $6.2 billion to $6.3 billion, including a 6 point FX impact. Our hybrid approach continues to drive growth in our server licensing business and robust growth in our services. Gross margin in this segment will reflect the accelerating mix of cloud services.","We expect More Personal Computing revenue to be $12 billion to $12.4 billion, including the 3 points of FX impact. Because of the mix of devices and software in this segment, let me provide a bit more context. First on Windows. Overall in Q2, we expect our OEM business to look similar to Q1 with non-Pro outperforming the underlying PC market. As we move deeper through the fiscal year, the device mix should evolve as our OEM partners produce more models at a wider range of price points. In search, we expect Bing's strong trajectory to continue, remaining profitable for the remainder of the year.","We will continue to see the impact of the phone restructuring. Revenue declines and gross margin percentages in Q2 should look similar to Q1. And with the strong holiday Surface lineup, we expect revenue to grow in Q2. Gross margins will reflect the mix of device life cycles between Surface 3, Surface Pro 3 and a growing mix of Surface Book and Surface Pro 4.","We expect COGS to be $9.7 billion to $9.9 billion, with variability driven by the device sales. We expect operating expenses between $8 billion and $8.1 billion in Q2. For the full year, we are lowering our guidance to $31.9 billion to $32.1 billion. We are and will continue to thoughtfully reinvest operating expense savings to accelerate growth in key areas, to expand our addressable market and transform how we work, to better deliver products and services to our customers.","We expect other income and expenses to be negative $300 million in Q2, similar to Q1. This includes the net cost of hedging and interest expense offset by dividend and interest income. We expect our Q2 and full year tax rate to be between 19% and 21%. Similar to Q1, this reflects the changing geographic mix of revenue as well as lower nondeductible operating losses associated with phone.","In closing, during Q1 we exceeded our own expectations across many of our businesses and more importantly, we saw healthy indicators of future growth. Through business model transitions and strategic shifts, our solid execution paired with a focus on achieving our bold ambitions has enabled us to take share in existing areas while we enter new ones.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris for Q&A.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and a very nice quarter indeed. I wanted to ask about the Azure in particular and the public cloud performance that you saw this quarter. It again seems like you're seeing an acceleration in that overall business and more broadly it seems like industry-wide both you guys and AWS are seeing something of an inflection point going on in terms of more and more business accruing to those public cloud environments. So my question is just that, would you agree with that statement that there is an inflection going on in the business? And if so, what do you think is causing that and is there a changing nature in how people are using that cloud? And then maybe for Amy, is there something we should bear in mind in terms of your traditional business, sort of the on-premise business that may be impacted as that inflection takes place that we should bear in mind as you go forward?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah, I'll start, Keith, thanks for the question. Overall what we have seen is the public cloud or cloud infrastructure makes it much more possible for businesses of all sizes and developers of all sizes to get at infrastructure with much less friction than ever before. I grew up in our server business in the past. We were definitely the one to democratize servers by bringing servers to small businesses. But when I think about what's happening for example in Office 365, where we are adding 50,000 small business customers who now get the most sophisticated server technology, but now as a SaaS service, that's what's really happening world over with all application categories and that's where the growth is.","I don't know long-term whether there is a zero-sum equation, but right now and in the intermediate timeframe, we see in our case growth in both sides. And in our case the vision also we have for distributed cloud infrastructure is just that, it is distributed. So we don't think of our server as a legacy business. I think of it as the edge of our cloud. If you look at what we are doing with SQL, we will have the ability for any customer of SQL to stretch even a single table from between their on-premise to the cloud. Those are the kinds of things that we are excited about.","But we clearly are seeing very rapid growth and adoption of our Azure cloud. But in our case there are two unique aspects. One is this true distributed hybrid. And second is we don't think of Azure in isolation. We think about it in the combination of Office 365, Dynamics, EMS, because really it's one cloud infrastructure first of all from a capital perspective that sort of serves all of these and there's a virtuous cycle between all of these for our customers as well.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And Keith, your second question, the place you'll actually see it will be in the gross margin percentage. As Satya said, I do expect both to grow, both the on-premise and the cloud. But I expect the mix to increasingly shift toward the cloud given its sort of robust growth rate, which will impact the gross margin percentage over time.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. That's very helpful, thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Keith. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter everyone. Two questions, but related. Let me give you the first one. The commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate grew slightly from $8 billion to $8.2 billion or a little more than each of those. You had Office 365, Azure, Dynamics CRM Online, and all of them seem to be growing very fast. How should we think about the difference? Should we figure that the run rate reaccelerates next year? Next quarter, excuse me. And then I have a follow-up.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","The way to really think about that number just because of some of the seasonality in our business, Mark, is to think about the year-over-year growth rate of 70%. For me that is more symbolic of how you should think about the pace. And that is a very fast number on a increasingly growing base.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That makes perfect sense. Thank you. The second one is the cloud margins improved nicely. Given the data that's in here, it looks like they've all started to move up. Azure seems to move up. You'd said in the FAM the gross margins for 2015 (37:31) should be about 44%. How should we think about cloud gross margins for 2015? I know you don't know obviously the mix of all the cloud products, but how should we think about the improvement there?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Mark. Looking in the old segments, I know you all have done, we saw a year-over-year improvement in the overall commercial other segment that we disclosed this time too of about 10 points year over year. We saw sequential improvement from Q4 to Q1. We're still focused on continuing to have that sequential improvement, and especially as some of the things Satya talked about, which is the addition of premium services, the pace of innovation especially on the premium end. And if you think about our launch of E5, which is a premium SKU in Office 365, it continues to give us the opportunity to both get more efficient in the infrastructure and to add higher margin products especially at the fast end.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah, just one thing that's structurally I think, that we think a lot about and we're very disciplined about is our capital allows us to build all of the cloud services from Office 365 to EMS to Dynamics to Azure. And that diversity of workloads long term is what lead to margin improvement. And there will be changes in seasonality from quarter to quarter, but structurally those two things, the diversity of what we are doing and how capital is utilized across all of it is I think a big structural differentiator for us.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Beautiful. It's great to see that improvement happening. Thank you very much.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Mark. We'll go to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks guys, and congrats on a great quarter. Just a question for Satya then a follow-up to Amy. Satya, you talked about your good adoption of Office 365 on the commercial side both in SMBs and large enterprise. I wonder if you could just break that down and where you're seeing the faster adoption as you start to get into the enterprises, especially that might have enterprise agreements with Microsoft. How is that sales motion going and what is the pitch there?","And then to Amy, I thought this was a key point, something that we've been looking for. You noted that the subscriptions recurring business now has offset the cannibalization on the license. Is that something that we should think about going forward or was there something specific about this quarter that would push that out? Thanks.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah first, as far as the Office 365 usage itself, I talked about some of the numbers of 60 million monthly active users, the fact that our seats grew 66% year over year. The small business number I talked about, the 50,000 per month additional customers that we're adding to Office 365. These are all the growth numbers and the usage growth numbers. The mix even, that information protection, I mean that's just another very important point which is amongst the customers who are using Office 365, already 20 million are using some of these premium services like information protection. And of course we're going to further expand that with new SKUs and new categories that are going to become part of Office 365. So I see that stretching on both sides, which is to small business on one end and then these premium SKUs on the other end. And we see nice attach as far as EAs to the cloud as well and that's definitely a big driver of our growth.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And so let me take the second and I'll add something to what Satya said. One of the important things that's distinct about the small business market is that there tends not to be much of a lag in terms of buying and deployment. They want to be able to instantaneously use and get value very quickly and that's something we've actually seen and a real testament to our ability to add so many customers in every quarter. And what you've seen in consumer side, which it was an important point. Once we've built this installed base up to 18 million users on the consumer side, that recurring rate does in fact offset the deferral from new, and so it is an important inflection point for us this quarter.","Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks guys and congrats.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you. I just had two quick questions. I was wondering, Satya, if you could give us a sense for just a high level commentary about the split of IaaS versus PaaS and Azure and maybe some color on the growth you see in each of those and how you see them evolving. And then the second question would be related to the launch of Windows 10. You gave the Bing example for the month of September and the solid pull forward there, or pull along there. I'm just wondering if you could share with us any other areas where you're seeing a similar kind of pull along with Windows 10 adoption. Thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Sure, Heather. On the first one, on the mix between IaaS and PaaS and SaaS, the thing that we are seeing is, quite frankly, all of these are growing but the most interesting thing for me as a pattern is growth in IaaS leads to growth in other PaaS services or SaaS services. I mean to put it very concretely, take something like Azure Active Directory. That's probably the best manifestation of the virtuous cycle that we see in any of the cloud adoption that we have, right. It could be as someone coming from Office 365. It can be someone coming from Azure, Dynamics, EMS. All of those tenants get into Azure Active Directory which is our largest PaaS service because it's got even developer API, so that means more developers are using it.","More IT professionals are using it as the control plane. So that's the network effect that we see when it comes to the PaaS services. And then in terms of infrastructure itself, as again I said, there's people who are tiering, even applications people who build hybrid applications where the storage could be even on premise in some cases, but the mid-tier and the web and the mobile back ends are in the cloud. We see a lot of growth there. We see a lot of growth in our data, both in terms of infrastructure but in the new services like our Data Lake services which are PaaS services. Hadoop is another good example. We see lots of Hadoop usage inside of IaaS but we also see HD inside growth. So I would say there is a real good mix of those two.","And then on Windows 10, I mean I'm very, very excited obviously about what's happening with Bing. I think Amy talked about we have a $1 billion quarter with 29% growth and good share position growth in the United States. That's fantastic to see. But gaming is the other place where we talked about Xbox Live now that spans both console and PC. We see increased engagement because of that. We see in fact increased engagement with titles like Minecraft. So we have some high hopes for what we can achieve with engagement around Xbox Live across the console plus PC.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Heather. We'll go to the next question, please, operator.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed","Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Satya, Michael Dell mentioned with you on stage a week ago that he's seen from his perspective stronger Windows 10 adoption among enterprise customers faster than he had seen in the past. And I'm curious if you're starting to see a halo impact where those that are looking to move up are saying we want to go with more of the complete infrastructure set? And are you seeing different sales motions among those enterprise customers as those customers are coming back to you?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Brent. I mean that is absolutely the fact, case, that is we are seeing a much faster adoption cycle, obviously starting with the consumer side but even the 8 million business PCs that are already running Windows 10 before we have started in fact the push on enterprise. We expect the enterprise deployment to start in earnest the beginning of next calendar year or the second half of this fiscal year. But to your point, the fact that there is pull already is a very, very good indicator of, and a good sign, and it's even better than what we saw with Windows 7.","And so to me that's all positive news, and but yet we're very, very focused on delivering I think new value to the enterprise customers. Because if you look at Windows 10 we've already talked a lot about all the consumer value. But just take security itself, I think that Windows 10 represents a real breakthrough in terms of security on the endpoint as well as in embedded, which we are really excited about in terms of driving the enterprise upgrade cycle.","Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Real quick just for Amy on cash flow, is there anything that we should take into account this year versus what happened last year?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","I don't think anything unique that I would bring up, no.","Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Brent.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Beside Azure in the intelligent cloud, you obviously have very, very good momentum on the classic server and tools business. Can you talk a little bit about the volume versus price effect that you see playing out here and how is it now and how do you expect that to play out going forward? And one of the things on Azure was usage, and you mentioned how that kind of improved quite significantly. Satya, can you talk a little bit where you see that current usage standing and where do you think that can go? We obviously didn't get a number, just a growth rate. But where do you see usage? Because that's obviously one of the things that one of your competitors keeps talking, trying knock on you. Thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah, I mean I think the usage number is the one that, Raimo, that we talked about, which is doubling of compute, doubling of storage. We talked about the growth of our EMS, which is a higher level service. We talked about the growth in Active Directory. So we have usage growth in Azure which is very, very healthy.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And on the server question you asked at the beginning, let me say that we did see I think around 9% constant currency growth of the core server product, and a lot of that was premium driven. Now, I have a distinction between a price question that you sort of asked versus seeing the value of a premium SKU. And so I do think it was premium driven as opposed to sort of a price driven in particular.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. That's helpful thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Raimo. Next question please","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks very much. I wouldn't mind going back to Windows 10. Three months ago on the June quarter call, the messaging was that Windows 10 would not likely lift Microsoft's performance results until the second half of fiscal 2016. Yet it feels like as early as this first quarter, it's creating a lift at least to the Windows OEM business. And I just wanted to understand what's changed in the last three months such that it's having an earlier than expected positive impact on Microsoft. Thank you.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Karl. Why don't I take that and Satya can add. In particular what we saw this quarter was really as much about the mix of the devices that the OEMs are bringing to market as it was in the absolute unit distinction. And you saw that in the non-Pro revenue performance. And so for us I think really the way to think about the early signs of the impact were the strong device mix, some higher priced units across a wide variety of OEMs as we build into holiday, did provide some slightly better than expected results, as you noted in the non-Pro business. But really some of the other upside that we saw in the quarter was from things that are the second sort of derivative of that, which was our search results were better than we had thought. Because of some of these results about where the PCs were upgraded and the pace at which they were upgraded.","And so I do think we are encouraged, as Satya said. But we're a quarter in. And I think what's exciting for us is really the opportunity we have going forward. We're excited about Q2 when the devices hit the shelves. We're excited to have so many first party devices in Q2. And then the next stage after that which is really the enterprise deployment, which as Satya mentioned, we expect in the second half of the year. So it's early, but you're right, we did see some incremental improvement over what we expected.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Karl.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Amy.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. Amy, I'm wondering if you could talk about on the computing side, the personal computing side, you talked about this quarter seeing growth ahead of the PC market. You alluded to a diversity of devices coming in the second half. How do you think about that variable in the model say beyond this sort of launch period where you have a little bit of a differing mix going on in devices and you get to more of a steady state out in kind of years two and three of the Windows 10 launch? Do you think you can grow ahead of the PC market? Or do you think \u2013 I know for the last few years you've grown below the PC market. Just wondering how we should think about that.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Walter. Let me talk a little bit about what I said in my outlook. This quarter, as I just talked about, the non-Pro outperformance versus the market was really due to a higher revenue per license. I expect that actually to continue in Q2. I expect our overall Pro business to remain in line with business PCs. Once we work through sort of the end of XP bump, that really should be in the line. And as we talked about, as we move through the year, I do expect things to more normalize overall in terms of RPL comparisons. But I do think that's probably the best way to think about the curve over the course of the year.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And then on the commercial licensing part, specifically within productivity, I know you sort of had an old breakout and a new breakout where we don't see commercial licensing necessarily within Productivity. But would you expect that piece, the commercial licensing within Productivity given the transition going on to be stable? Or would that decline as you see the transition over to the cloud in Productivity specifically?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Let me try and if I missed the question or misunderstood it, you can help me again. I think you're asking about our core Office commercial business, the product side versus the service side.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Correct.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And really, okay good. The trend we saw there, as I said, we're 5% up in a constant currency basis. That was 70% cloud minus 8% on prem. That's a trend that's not new for us. We've thought about making this transition as quickly as possible, but what we're seeing, which you heard us talk about, was a transition to increasing premium mix, selling more workloads, doing all of that while we're growing the installed base.","So if you think back to how we've talked about the long term, the lifetime value equation, it's those components that I really think about proving out over time, and we had lots of encouraging signs about that. New users, Satya referenced on the small business and mid-market side. Premium mix, we talked about how many premium services we're now selling. And then in terms of renewals, they're quite good, which we talked about. And so I think all of those, when you talk about should we expect the traditional business to be in decline, I don't think that's new. I think what's important is our ability to switch it to the services and add more over time that really I focus on.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Great. We'll move to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, thank you very much. Amy, I see the commercial bookings numbers in the KPI sheet, but I do not see the total bookings numbers. I'm wondering if you could just comment on that so that we can try to maintain a consistent analysis there if it's relevant. And also, Satya, now that SQL Server has taken over this number one position in the Gartner Quadrant for the database market, could you help us understand how the roadmap evolves from here? As we did notice Amazon made its debut also in the leader's Quadrant, and I think we're trying to understand how the movement to cloud platforms like Azure could further alter the database landscape and how you could capitalize on that.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Why don't you go first.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah, I'll go first. I think the data architecture that underlies what's happening in the enterprise underneath applications is going through a dramatic change. That said, the relational database itself remains still a very strong component, but not the only component anymore, in both on-premise and off-premise. And what we want to make sure as a company is to cover all of that landscape with a very rich data platform. So if you look at what we're doing, the length and breadth of our ambition as well our delivery today, everything from what SQL itself is doing, we have now all in-memory workloads for OLTP, BI, data warehousing built in. We have the ability to now tier even the database with the cloud. This is all the things that are coming in SQL 2016 and we're excited about that.","When it comes to the cloud itself, we have a PaaS service with SQL, which is very unique in terms of SQL Azure. We have now the Data Lake service for basically petabyte, exabyte scale data management. We have higher level data services like Azure ML, which is about advanced analytics, a category we didn't even participate in the past. So we've entered that category, Revolution R fits into that.","So we have a very rich story and this is not even talking about some of the other end-user BI capabilities like Power BI. So I think we have a very rich vision and execution on what is an expanding data platform opportunity. And it's nice to see us innovate on the new services while we also in what is still the big market, which is the relational database market, claim a leadership position.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And Mark, on the total bookings number, the reason we moved to commercial bookings is it's a far more comparable number to look at period to period. Total bookings, because the volatility frankly in consumer businesses in times like the holiday periods, it can make it far more volatile than usually what many of you have been asking for, which is the continuity and health of the overall commercial business. If you want to get to total bookings, you just add back in all the consumer revenue, is technically is how you would do it. But I do think the more helpful KPI for us in terms of bookings is the commercial one.","Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Great. Thanks, Mark. Operator, we'll have time for one final question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much for squeezing me in and congrats on the quarter. Amy, I just had a couple. The first one, just your comment that the consumer Office business you're seeing, basically the subscription revenue now being larger than the offset, if you will, the license side, where do we stand with regard to that on the commercial side of the Office transition?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","The way to think about that how is I look at \u2013 well, the way I would generally say it is you look at each of the KPIs we give. So the Office commercial business grew 5%. It was negative 8%. If some transition earning back off the balance sheet, the total cloud is 70%. When we start to get to this point and the percentage we already have in the cloud, it is really an offset. And that's probably frankly been true a little bit longer than we talked about technically in terms of what goes off and what comes on given we've now got, as Satya said, 60 million users and more than that in terms of seats sold. Now that can technically, Ross, be interesting in certain quarters of the year where we have very heavy expirations. And so it just depends year over year, but that's why the commercial is slightly harder to do it on because there's some volatility in the ins and outs based on seasonality.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just if I think about the incremental subscription revenues from the commercial side versus the license declines, it sounds like this year, this fiscal year, we're making that pivot like we have made on the consumer side. Would that be a fair statement?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","I want to make this simple and unfortunately it's just slightly complicated. Because so much of our installed base was already on an annuity contract, it makes the transition mathematically hard. I think what you're asking is specifically for a transactional component when the old transactional component has gone. But it's a very hard \u2013 but that's a component of the number, not the total. So it's why it's technically difficult to answer the question you're specifically asking, Ross. But the way I would think about it is we are moving such a substantive piece of our EA business and with our annuity mix all up in commercial, up to 86% percent, we're feeling very good about our ability to transition people at LTV and grow the business overall at a very high level.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Ross.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you very much.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","So that wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Satya.","Satya Nadella","Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon everyone.","Today I'll focus my topline thoughts on our progress this quarter and the progress we're making in transforming our business. This quarter we reached $26.5 billion in revenue, with an operating income of $7.8 billion. This quarter's results show the product and business transformation underway at Microsoft.","We saw success in a number of our strategic areas including cloud adoption, redefining and revitalizing the Windows Ecosystem and improving economics in our hardware portfolio.","We also saw some challenges this quarter. As expected, the one-time benefit of Windows XP end-of-life PC refresh cycle has now tailed off. Additionally, we ran into unexpected issues in select geographies. Where there are execution issues, we will address them. Where there are macroeconomic challenges, we will weather them. With that in mind, I'll walk you through the quarter.","Let's start with our Cloud business, an area where we're extending our leadership position and accelerating our innovation. In commercial cloud, we saw continued customer and revenue growth across a growing footprint of cloud services, Office 365, Azure, Enterprise Mobility Suite and Dynamic CRM Online.","In fact this quarter is the sixth consecutive quarter of triple digit revenue growth in commercial cloud and we're now at a run rate of $5.5 billion. Azure services continue to grow in appeal to enterprise IT and developers with rapid improvements across hybrid services, premium cloud storage and virtual machine offerings, enhanced data and data analytics offerings.","Microsoft Enterprise Mobility Suite is one key area of product innovation that I would like to highlight given the growth and the uniqueness of this offering. Microsoft offers a comprehensive solution for all devices that brings together mobile device management, mobile application management, hybrid identity management and data protection into one unified offering through EMS.","Office 365 now includes new application experiences on all phones and tablets for mobile productivity. Further we've released completely new scenarios. This includes Office Sway for visualizing and sharing ideas, Delve to help search and discover content, Office 365 Groups to make it easier to collaborate, Office 365 Video for secure media streaming for businesses.","Finally we continue to invest in enterprise value by integrating MDM and Enterprise Mobility Suite into Office 365. New encryption technologies, compliance certification and new e-discovery capabilities in exchange.","In Dynamic CRM Online, we added 53 markets this quarter, bringing us to 130 markets around the world. We're bringing together CRM with Cortana, Yammer, Power BI and Skype to add unique value to customers.","We're expanding our capabilities in the Cloud through five new acquisitions. Last week we announced an agreement to purchase revolution analytics, the leading provider of statistical computing and predictive analytics, which will enable our customers to unlock big data in size.","We bought HockeyApp, a leading mobile app testing and development service to enhance Azure services for mobile developers. Our acquisition of [Orato] [ph] accelerates our ability to give customers unique security capabilities by tapping into behavioral intelligence on identity and access spanning on-premise and the cloud.","We're bringing on new capabilities in machine learning as applied to e-Discovery and other enterprise compliance processes with the acquisition of Equivio and we also welcomed Acompli, a provider of innovative mobile email applications for IOS and Android.","The common theme across all these acquisitions is advanced data analytics and machine learning driven capabilities that improve with more customer adoption and usage of the cloud.","We're also making progress in our consumer cloud services. Office 365 home and personal revenue grew nearly 150% year-over-year as we added 2.1 million net new subscribers since last quarter.","Bing U.S. search share continues to grow, as does search revenue with 23% growth this quarter. I will talk about our progress in Xbox live later in my comments. Now let's turn to Windows.","To start, the overall Windows Ecosystem is driving more innovation. Over the holiday season at SCES, our partner showcased a diverse lineup of Windows devices, including more premium device choices than ever.","Last spring we made a strategic decision to introduce new Windows pricing programs to drive unit growth in opening price point PCs as well as tablets and this quarter year-over-year growth.","Also businesses continue to value Windows. We're seeing healthy demand for Windows Pro even though we faced challenging prior year comparables in Q2 as well as in the second half of the year, following the Windows XP end of support related PC refresh.","Now let's talk about Windows 10. Last week was an important milestone on our path to release Windows 10 and ushering an era of more personal computing. The heritage of Windows was about enabling one single device, the PC.","With Windows 10, we're building a device platform for the mobile-first, cloud-first world. It's a world where the mobility of a person's experience is paramount, requiring a platform that spans devices from small screens to large screens, to no screens at all. It's a world where interacting with technologies as natural as interacting with other people and it's a world that demands trust and security.","It is also a world with rich opportunity for developers and Windows 10 will be the most attractive windows development platform ever, with our free upgrade offer and with universal application and unified store for developers, we'll have a large unified up to date user base to target.","We want people to love Windows and have made this our most collaborative project yet with more than two million insiders giving us feedback every day. I am very optimistic about Windows 10.","We're making progress with our own devices, for those in the market today and also the ones that we've recently announced. This quarter we surpassed the $1 billion revenue mark with surface for the first time. The value proposition of being the most productive tablet is resonating.","Further the sales for Lumia phones top 10 million units growing 30% year-over-year this quarter with strength in devices such as Lumia 500 and 600 series, our affordable smartphone. In this segment of the market, the combination of our brand and value standout and we plan to continue to build a beachhead here.","We're also creating new device types that open up new markets and opportunities for Microsoft. In October we launched our first wearable, the Microsoft band and just last week we revealed two new hardware with Windows 10 with Microsoft Surface Hub and Microsoft HoloLens.","Microsoft Surface Hub will revolutionize group collaboration and meetings, HoloLens and Windows holographic computing will make mix reality applications part of everyday life across work and home.","I want to talk briefly about Xbox. Xbox One console adoption accelerated this holiday and was the top-selling console in the U.S. and fans on Xbox Live were engaged with the service more than ever before. However, it's our strategies coming together with Windows 10 that give me the greatest optimism.","The vibrant social gaming community on Xbox Live will span Xbox, Windows PC, Tablets and phones. With Windows 10 gamers on a PC, tablet or Xbox console can play together and games on Xbox One can easily stream through a Window 10 PC or tablet.","It's also getting clear how games people love today will evolve to mind-blowing experiences in the future when designed for mixed reality that Windows 10 and HoloLens create. Just imagine what's possible with Minecraft. Gaming truly is a valuable part of millions of people's lives and Microsoft will excel and increase our lead.","Before closing, I wanted to share a few thoughts on capital allocation. Over the past several quarters and certainly with last week's Windows 10 announcements you've seen us unleash new innovation in our cloud services with Windows and our hardware. We did all of this without materially growing our cost base.","This required clarity and purpose and value proposition, realignment of talent and disciplined execution. Our increasing innovation and competitiveness in today's growth markets and the creation of new categories is how we will most positively impact the returns for our investors.","Earlier today, we announced our intention to complete the existing $40 billion share repurchase authorization by December 31, 2016. This is another step in our ongoing commitment to increase capital return for our shareholders while investing in the growth of our business.","It too shows our optimism for the future growth of Microsoft. As we move forward we will certainly continue to be thoughtful in our capital return decisions balanced across dividends and share repurchases.","In closing, I am encouraged by the progress we are making in our transformation to become the productivity and platform company with a mobile mobile-first, cloud-first world. I'm proud of how our teams are stepping up to both change and execute to make this transformation happen.","I'm confident of the decisions and choices we're making to drive our business and products forward to serve our customers and partners in the future.","With that, I'll hand over to Amy to go through the quarter's results in further detail and share our outlook for the next quarter. I look forward to rejoining you after that to answer your questions. Thank you.","Amy Hood","Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone.","As Satya shared in Q2 we again made solid progress on our business transformation. We had strong growth in our cloud and subscription businesses, our annuity renewals were healthy as customers remained committed to our enterprise portfolio and our hardware products performed well during the holiday season.","As we expected our year-over-year growth rates were impacted by the prior year benefits that we realized in our OEMs and office transactional businesses following the Windows XP end of support refresh cycle.","Beyond that, our results in China and Japan fell short of our expectations. In Japan, the PC market lagged due to the macroeconomic environment along with the combined impact of XP end of support and the VAT increase last year.","Our Office attach rate to PCs is very high there, so the weak PC market also impacted Office revenue. With that said, let me take you through the financial highlights of our second quarter.","Revenue was $26.5 billion up 8% and would have been one point better without the impact of foreign exchange. Gross margin grew slightly this quarter even when comparing against a year ago that benefited from the XP Refresh cycle.","Our commitment to ongoing execution improvement and thoughtful folio management helped improve the gross margin percentage in each of our operating segments.","Operating income declined 2% which included $243 million of integration and restructuring expenses. Excluding that, operating income grew 1%. Our reported GAAP earnings per share was $0.71, which included $0.02 negative impact from integration and restructuring expense and $0.04 income tax charge for an IRS audit adjustment. Foreign exchange had $0.01 negative impact on EPS.","As we discussed last quarter, FX movement first impact of bookings growth and unearned revenue on our balance sheet are contracted but not billed balance was adjusted down to reflect current FX rates. Therefore our bookings were flat this quarter.","Unearned revenue was up 9% year-over-year to $21.2 billion, but the sequential decline was slightly larger -- slightly higher than we expected due to the larger than anticipated impact from FX. Adjusting for that FX impact our commercial unearned balance is in line with historical trends and our expectations.","From a geographic perspective relative to our expectations the U.S. outperformed in Europe was generally in line. As I mentioned earlier, China and Japan were below our expectations.","With that backdrop I will now move to a detailed discussion of our results. Last year we ended support for Windows XP. That simulated a PC Refresh cycle in particular in developed market and with business customers.","During the period from Q2 through the end of our fiscal year Windows Pro revenue growth was over 10% and meaningfully outpaced business PC growth.","As expected in Q2 PCs have reverted to a more normal live mix between developed and emerging markets and Pro attached Business PCs has returned to the levels we saw prior to FY '14.","Also to drive revenue growth in academic institutions we lowered the price of Windows Pro for that customer segment. This pricing change along with the impact of XP caused Windows revenue growth to be lower than the relatively stable business PC market we have seen the end of FY '13.","We again grew Window non-Pro licenses and saw year-over-year growth in activations. This was driven by particularly strong demand for opening price point PCs related to the strategic decisions Satya just spoke of earlier.","The harbor mix shift opening price point PCs impacted license mix and therefore aggregate revenue per license in the quarter. The mixed shift was the main driver of our Windows non-Pro revenue decline.","Inventory in the channel is a bit higher than normal which we expect to work through in Q3. Office consumer products and services revenue declined 12% and was impacted by the ongoing transition to Office 365 and by the dynamics in Japan where PC growth was lower than we expected in a geography where the paid attractive Office is high. Adoption of Office 365 home and personal remained strong and we now have over 9.2 million subscribers.","In our computing and gaming segment we are proud of the continued progress we are making in our service portfolio. Strong interest in Surface Pro 3 helped to drive record revenue as well as improved gross margins. Surface Pro 3 volumes are pacing over three times the rate of what we saw for Surface Pro 2.","In gaming, Xbox One was the console sales leader in the U.S. Xbox live users grew and those users increased their purchases of third party publisher content and consumables. Sales of the Xbox platform exclusive Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Forza Horizon 2 were strong and this quarter we welcome Minecraft.","We articulated our plan for the phone business back in July and we are executing to plan. With our Lumia portfolio of phones we are driving volumes in the low priced device category. We sold 10.5 million Lumia phones this quarter an all-time high.","We also sold over 39 million non-Lumia phones even while we make changes to the product portfolio and manage this business for profitability. We are looking forward to bringing new products to market that will showcase the features that we presented at our Windows 10 event last week.","Revenue in our devices and consumer other segment grew 30%. As noted earlier, Xbox Live transactions and first party game performed well and contributed to this growth. Additionally, search revenue growth was strong with improvements in both rate and volumes.","Within display, revenue declined our MSN portal though we saw revenue growth across other Microsoft properties. We are also pleased by our gross margin expansion in this segment.","Transitioning now to our consumer results where revenue grew 5%. Our annuity revenue remained strong growing double-digits and renewal rates remained high. Customers are continuing to move from transactional purchasing to long-term annuity contracts as they showed increased commitment to our product roadmap.","Our transactional revenue declined over 15%, slightly more than we expected primarily in Office and mostly due to our performance in China and Japan, which I detailed earlier. Additionally, FX had a greater negative impact on commercial revenue than we had anticipated.","Our commercial cloud services delivered triple digit revenue growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. Office 365 continues to be priority for CIOs as both existing and new customers move to the cloud. This transition accelerated with 45% of our renewal season Office moving to the cloud this quarter.","We are seeing great growth in revenue from premium Azure services driven by both increasing customer base and an expansion in the number of services that those customers deploy. Within Dynamic CRM Online, customer growth accelerated and revenue nearly doubled.","From a product perspective, commercial Office product and services revenue declined 1%, slightly below our expectations. Annuity revenue remained strong with high renewal rates and continued adoption of Office 365.","Within our Office transactional business year-on-year comparables are difficult given the benefits from last year's XP Refresh where customers chose to update their desktop productivity solutions along with their PC.","Additionally the shift to Office 365 continues to impact transactional revenue. While these dynamics were consistent with our expectations, revenue in China and Japan both fell short given the factors that I noted earlier.","Server products and services revenue grew 9%, again outpacing the broader IT markets. Growth in premium mix helped to drive double-digit revenue growth in SQL Server and system center. Windows Server annuity revenue grew double-digits again this quarter.","Our transactional revenue was down primarily due to a declining traditional server market. Additionally, we are pleased with the performance in our Dynamics business which grew revenues 13% driven by growth in both on premises and cloud offerings.","Operating expense grew 1% to $8.3 billion and was favorable to our expectation. These results are inclusive of investments that we made in our strategic growth areas, a few of which were showcased last week at our Windows 10 event. Excluding approximately $750 million from the addition of NDS operating expense would have declined 8%.","Relative to the guidance that we provided for the quarter, roughly half of the favorability resulted from FX changes with the balance driven by our continued prioritization of spend.","Our integration and restructuring efforts have been focused on optimizing resources across the company which includes reducing the expense base in our phone business. To date, we have integrated the manufacturing and supply chain teams across Microsoft while also rationalizing our phone manufacturing capacity.","In operating expense we committed to reducing $1 billion from the phone cost base which we have done. We continue to look for opportunities to drive further efficiencies.","Our effective tax rate was 25% and higher than expected due to previously mentioned income tax charge for an IRS audit adjustment. Beyond that, the increase was driven by the inclusion of phone results and our changing geographic mix.","Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion driven primarily by investments to increase our capacity as we expanded existing and added new data centers, as well as made server purchases and support of our fast-growing cloud business.","This quarter we increased our capital return by 5% with $4.5 billion returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends and as Satya reinforced in his comments we will continue to take thoughtful steps to increase capital return to shareholders with a focus on value.","With that overview of the current quarter, let me now turn to our outlook. Our guidance is based on our current view of FX rates. Should the U.S. dollar strengthen beyond those assumptions as it did this quarter, we would see additional negative impact to earnings, revenue, our balance sheet and our contracted but not billed balance.","As a reminder, in our annuity businesses the FX impact is first reflected on our revenue, which is recorded at rate when the contract is billed, then revenue comes onto the P&L at that same rate as it is recognized, generally over the next year.","Therefore in Q3 we will start to recognize a higher percentage of revenue from periods with a stronger U.S. dollar than the prior-year comparison. In total, we expect that FX will negatively impact revenue growth by approximately four points in Q3. The majority of this impact is in our commercial business.","In FY '14 it was our Q2 through Q4 results that most benefited from Windows XP end of support. As such, our growth rates across Windows Pro and transactional Office will be impacted as our business moves back to pre-XP levels.","On a geographic basis, we expect year-on-year revenue declines in China, Russia and Japan. In Japan Q3 represents an even tougher comparison with the anniversary of the VAT, which again will create different comparables, difficult comparables in Windows and Office.","We currently expect that these geographic dynamics, challenging comparables from XP and FX headwinds will be in place throughout the remainder of our fiscal year.","With that overall background, let me move to our specific Q3 guidance starting with devices and consumer. Our revenue guidance includes approximately four points of drag from FX. In licensing we expect revenue to be $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion.","This range seems the more challenging comparables I mentioned earlier. The range also includes a reduction in channel inventory for Windows non-Pro opening price point PCs.","Within consumer Office we expect to see similar trends to Q2 and within our IP licensing business we expect lower per unit royalties with the changing mix of devices filled by our licensees.","In computing and gaming we expect revenue to be $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. This range reflects normal seasonality coming out of the holidays for our Xbox and Surface businesses.","In phone hardware we expect revenue to be $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. This range anticipates accelerating year-over-year growth in Lumia units driven by our affordable smartphone devices.","We also expect both volumes and ASPs of non-Lumia devices to continue to decline in Q3. With this lower aggregate revenue base, we expect gross margins, which include non-cash amortization to be lower for the next couple of quarters.","In devices and consumer other, we expect revenue to be about $2 billion reflecting continued progress in key areas like Office 365 Home and Personal, Xbox Live and Search.","In our commercial business we expect our significant momentum in annuity and commercial cloud services to continue. Within our commercial licensing segment we expect revenue to be $9.7 billion to $9.9 billion. In addition to the factors that I discussed, which impact our year-over-year comparability, we anticipate a four-point drag from FX.","In Commercial Other, we expect revenue to be $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. Even after considering the impact of FX, growth will remain robust with expected momentum across our commercial cloud portfolio, Office 365 Azure and CRM Online and in corporate, we don't expect any revenue impact.","As we continue to work towards the launch of Windows 10, we will share additional detailed information regarding any accounting impacts from the Windows 10 free upgrade offer and Windows as a service.","I would like to reiterate that our OEM royalty model, which is paid upfront will remain in place. We expect COGS to be $7.1 billion to $7.4 billion with variability driven by both hardware segments. We expect third-quarter operating expense to be $8.2 billion to $8.4 billion. We are lowering our full-year guidance to $33.2 billion to $33.6 billion which reduces full-year growth including NDS to 4% to 5%.","Our Q3 plans include investments in advertising and customer facing roles to continue to accelerate our momentum with commercial products such as SQL and the cloud. These investments are a direct result of prioritization decisions made during first half.","Over the remainder of the fiscal year we expect to incur an additional $200 million of restructuring expense. This results in total charges of roughly $1.4 billion which is lower than our previous guidance.","Separately, we still expect integration expense of $100 million per quarter for the remainder of the fiscal year.","As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. Given the current FX environment, we expect other income and expense to be negative $100 million in Q3.","We now expect our full year tax rate to be between 22% and 24%, this includes the Q2 income tax charge for an IRS audit adjustment as well as the changing geographic mix of our business. In Q3 we expect CapEx to sequentially increase in support of our growing cloud business.","Unearned revenue will continue to benefit from customers moving to our subscription services and high contract renewal rates. We expect to see low single-digit sequential decline in our unearned for Q3 which includes one point drag from FX as new billings will reflect the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Our commercial unearned balance will follow recent historical seasonality when adjusted for FX.","In closing, this quarter was another example of the progress that we are making across this company. Our execution continues to improve and we are making data-driven decisions to improve more investments both shorter-term as you have seen in our marketing and sales adjustments as well as for the longer-term as we adjust our product portfolio.","There are certainly short-term comparability challenges as we anniversary last year's XP Refresh cycle and see the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar, but we are confident in the underlying health of our business out of the significant innovation we are funding within our prioritized operating budgets and excited to continue gaining share in key strategic markets.","Before I hand it back over to Chris, I would like to announce that we will be webcasting a briefing for the investor community on April 29, in conjunction with our Build Developer Conference in San Francisco. We will share more details as we get closer to the date.","With that, I will turn it back over to Chris and we can move to Q&A.","Chris Suh","Thanks Amy. With that, we will now move to the Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you very much. I appreciate. Amy, can you give us a bit more details on what's driving the increase in cloud margins within the commercial other segment as well as any sense for how accretive the cloud is becoming? And then I have a follow-up question.","Amy Hood","Sure, why don\u2019t I talk a little bit about that from a math perspective and I'll let Satya add from some more engineering improvements, which I think are important.","Mark, as I talked a bit about, we've seen a mix shift as we have moved Office 365 and Azure to our premium service and to premium SKUs within our cloud environment, that is one of the drivers that helps improve margin growth.","In addition, we've done a lot of hard engineering work I believe over the past six quarters to be able to take advantage of more utilization and capacity over time and I'll let Satya maybe add a little bit technically.","Satya Nadella","Overall, the shift to the higher layer services is the real driver here, which is obviously Office 365 and its various levels is one factor. The other one is what I talked about in the Enterprise Mobility Suite, that's really got fantastic momentum in the marketplace because the solution has really come together and is fairly unique, as well as Dynamic CRM.","So these are all got a different profile in terms of margin and they are all now pretty high growth businesses for us. So when you think about our cloud, you got to think about the low-level infrastructure. Even there we now have premium offerings and then we have higher level services. So that aggregate portfolio is what helps us move up the margin curve.","Mark Moerdler","Excellent and one quick follow-up, how should we think about monetization Satya for the Windows devices sub 9 inch?","Satya Nadella","One of the comments I had made in my remarks was some momentum we're seeing in our consumer cloud services. So for example, the store monetization, Bing monetization, Xbox Live monetization as Xbox Live monetization as Xbox Live now in fact is going to span devices are all things that drive monetization for below 9 inches.","So I think of device gross margin in some cases because we are building devices like the phones as well as this post sale monetization using our consumer cloud services as the two additional levers that we have in order to be able to monetize Windows devices.","Chris Suh","Excellent, thank you, I appreciate Mark.","Chris Suh","We'll move to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.","Brent Thill","Thanks. Amy, just on the XP tail-off, are there other commercial products that you're seeing being impacted? I just wanted be clear there are a lot of questions that is there some type of Halo impact from the XP taking drop down on the other solutions?","Amy Hood","Sure Brent, thanks for the question. I think it's the exact product portfolio that we talked about last year when the impact was happening, so let me take this opportunity to sort of walk you through those components again.","Obviously there's a very direct impact, which we've talked the most about in terms of Windows Pro and its mix would attach to business PCs.","The other important component of that was when people bought a PC as we talked through the year, they often took the chance whether generally in the business segment which impacts in our world commercial licensing as a reporting unit to buy Office and generally on a non-annuity basis.","So if you think about that being the next major transactional type purchase that was driven a year ago as the first externality, the second was in Windows [DL] [ph] we also saw non-annuity purchases in Windows DL which again is in our commercial licensing segment.","So if you think about it from a product portfolio, it really is Windows and Office. If you think about it from our reporting segments it's the D&C licensing segment as well as our commercial licensing segment and specifically our transactional revenue growth year-over-year.","Brent Thill","Okay. And just a quick follow-up, just on the reduction in operating expenses for the full year, is this across the Board Amy? Is there a particular area that you're finding more opportunity to cut?","Amy Hood","Brent, thanks again. I actually think of it as a general concept. I think really we're trying to invest behind opportunities where we see them. Some of those are more public as we talk about in terms of our sales and marketing adjustments or Ad campaigns that we run by the commercial cloud.","Others I think you don't have the opportunity to see until we launch products like we did last week where we were able to reassert our product portfolio and really move our talent to invest in, I guess mind blowing is the word Satya used, in terms of product portfolio in that way.","So I'm not sure that all of it Brent I would say is across a line in that way. They're short-term optimizations and longer-term portfolio optimizations that I think we've talked about this before.","I think the entire Senior Leadership Team views it as an opportunity to think about where we can best innovate and drive the highest value of every dollar that we invest and I think we've made great progress as a team and I think you're seeing that both in the long-term guidance and in frankly our day-to-day execution through the quarter.","Brent Thill","Thank you.","Satya Nadella","And I will just add that we're also making pretty significant changes in just the very workflow of our engineering teams and that also leads to us getting more out of our current investments. So there is significant I would say combination of culture change as well as how we work change that drives more innovation for the same dollar.","Brent Thill","Thank you.","Chris Suh","Thank you, Brent. We will move to the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Please proceed.","Walter Pritchard","Hi thanks. Two questions, just one on execution it sounds like you highlighted some issues in Japan and we've heard about VAT from companies. Can you just talk about what you're doing to address some of those issues and is there any concern that that might spread beyond what you've seen in Japan and China?","Amy Hood","Thanks Walter. Is that both your questions, I just want to make sure I get them?","Walter Pritchard","No, I'm just trying to understand generally that issue, I had one other, but it's just on\u2026","Satya Nadella","I'll just start by just talking about China. We have in China currently a set of geopolitical issues that we are working through. We're very committed to China as a market. We have in fact pockets of good growth in China with our cloud doing fairly well, but at the same time we're grounded that in the fact that we need more work to do and we're working through them and then as and when they will work out, we will let you know.","Amy Hood","And I'll talk a little bit about Japan and Walter to answer your question, I don't have any concerns if that expands such that in this unique issue beyond Japan, with the Windows end of XP plus the VAT increase, I do think, as well as some of the macroeconomic environments, it tightened far faster than we had anticipated and Japan in particular because of its model for us, it is a non-annuity geography for us.","So impacts in Japan more directly come to the P&L as opposed to on our under C&B balances and that's why this quarter, you saw some weakness in commercial licensing, but when adjusted for FX, our unearned balance and bookings actually felt quite good from our commercial perspective.","Walter Pritchard","And then just question on the Office 365 commercial, can you talk about deployment rates. I know you've done a good job of getting those into contracts, how many customers are actually running it, running their email and share point and other products in the cloud versus just having the rights to it.","Amy Hood","Thanks Walter. I think with all products, I think about the complete sales cycle and I am really encouraged by the fact that we're doing a good job of moving from the initial sales through deployment, through adding on services and back to renewals and I think the importance of that customer lifecycle is really how we think about our workloads and our workload health in the cloud.","The workload that we're furthest along on is obviously exchange. It happens also come with directory implementation and so we generally think of a fast deployment also and then adding on workloads and premium workflow cycles.","And then as you might imagine, that provides an interesting environment for us to add on some of the products actually that Satya mentioned very directly in his comments such as EMS or Enterprise Mobility Suite.","So while I think there is always a lag, the actual goal is the commitment that the customers show to the movement to the cloud and then moving them quickly as we can, but also at their own pace through deployment.","Walter Pritchard","Great. Thank you.","Satya Nadella","Thanks Walter.","Chris Suh","We'll move to the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Keith Weiss","Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking our question. I just wanted to dig into Windows OEM ASPs a little bit and just trying to sort of better understand the dynamic theme of what we see in the marketplace when we look at industry analysts that we're looking at basically sort of flat to slightly down unit growth and the down 13% OEM revenue growth that you guys are seeing.","Some of this mix and some of this ASP, I was wondering if you could help us with a little bit more color in terms of exactly what that ASP dynamic is going on in terms of these lower entry level additions what's that doing to the overall ASP of what you're able to extract from the market?","Amy Hood","Thanks Keith. I'll take the opportunity actually to do it for both Pro as well as non-Pro because I wasn\u2019t sure which category you were talking about. Let me start at the highest level, which is if I work at industry analyst as well as many of our peers in the ecosystem, I actually think we agree with most of the benchmarks in terms of PC unit health across business, which has been stable since FY '13 and across consumer where we see meaningful progress made in unit growth both last quarter and especially this one.","So then I'll take a second and talk about sort of the distinction between the revenue growth versus the unit growth. Let me start first in Pro. There they're really two key dynamics, the first is the return to the XP levels that we saw prior to the XP refresh.","They're consistent, the dynamic mix in terms of emerging markets and developed as well as enterprise sizing is not an ASP problem in Pro. It is a return to the attach level we saw before.","The component that actually has impacted -- the second component in Pro that is a quote unquote \u201cASP\/mix comment\u201d is the academic licenses that I referred to earlier where we did lower the price and saw an increased unit number. So that was a second component of the revenue piece, but the larger component was the XP reversion and again that's not an ASP comment.","When you come to non-Pro, I think this really refers back to Satya's comments, which is we saw device growth in low price devices opening price points, we actually made I believe a strategic decision to increase our ability to put devices on the shelf, especially at retail at prices under $200 to $249 is how to think about the price points that were the most impacted.","We do have the Windows with things skewed there. It is a lower RPL than our traditional non-Pro OEM licenses, but I do believe it drove meaningful ecosystem health and as well drove good competitive dynamics in the channel.","And so overall while it did have an RPL impact, which does explain along with mix shift, the minus 13% in non-Pro OEM versus the PC license growth that we saw, I think really Satya covered the actual logic to that in terms of overall ecosystem health as we feel quite good about.","Keith Weiss","And if I could squeeze in one follow-up, have you guys done any assessment in terms of the set you're seeing in Surface Pro 3 definitely is a real productivity device. To what extent is that cannibalistic from what would have been Windows PC sales and to what extent do you think you're expanding the market opportunity with that device?","Satya Nadella","I think it's definitely expanding the market opportunity. One of the things that I feel very good about is the risk we took to introduce the two-in-one category and I feel now that we see that in fact inspire even a lot of activity in our own OEM ecosystem and we see many good designs coming because it's viewed as a category that drives growth.","And so from that perspective I feel good about leading because that's one of our strategic goals, which is we want to create new categories, foster more demand for the entire ecosystem.","Keith Weiss","Excellent. Thank you very much guys.","Amy Hood","Thank you.","Chris Suh","We'll take the next question please operator.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please proceed.","Rick Sherlund","Thanks for Satya, could you talk about the implications of Windows 10 for a moment? I am thinking in terms of the new platform for innovation and maybe you can talk about post-sale monetization. What do you think the impact is on demand in the industry and the opportunities for Microsoft around the new platform?","Satya Nadella","Thanks Rick for the question. As I said in my remarks, I am very optimistic about what Windows 10 means for our customers, partners and Microsoft. The core idea of Windows 10 is to build a device operating system that spans the gamut from no screens to small screens, to PCs and even large screens.","In fact if you look at our innovation, we're perhaps unique in the large screen innovation that we're doing with Surface Hub, Hollow Lands as well as some of the two-in-one form factors.","So overall I think the most strategic objective for us is to get developer momentum with Windows 10 and that's where we're focusing on with a lot of different actions. One is the one unified developer platform, which I think is perhaps the most strategic piece of Windows 10 along with the unified store.","And now couple that with the call we've made to provide an upgrade offer. We're creating great opportunity for every developer to write these universal windows application that will run on the desktop as well as on our phone and tablets, as well as on Surface Hub and in fact Hollow Lands runs universal applications.`","No one else provides that kind of a unified market place for developers and especially the changes we've made to the desktop user interface means these universal applications are in fact very naturally discoverable right where we have high usage, which is the desktop.","So that's the combination of things that we think are going to play out effectively and of course we're in beta right now or previews right now and getting daily feedback across the length and breadth of Windows 10, but overall I am very optimistic of what it means, both as a platform as well as a set of end user features.","Chris Suh","Thanks Rick. Operator, we'll take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Phil Winslow","Thanks guys. Just got a question on the commercial other line, obviously that continues to show strong growth and have been climbing up in the cloud business whether it be Azure, Office 365, but I just wanted to double click on the Azure side.","Wondering if you could help us parse through sort of the infrastructure server as in the platform as server side and the trends there and any sort of joint benefit I guess that you're seeing and being able to offer both as to and also such as this business does scale and then Amy. I would love you to chime in hereto, how do you think about the gross margin and just operating margin characteristics once again as the revenue just continues to grow here?","Satya Nadella","Thanks Phil. So let me start. Overall, what we're seeing is, clearly there is increased usage of infrastructure as a service because a lot of people will move an existing workload into the cloud.","But the interesting thing that happens once you move your initial workload is you build around it. Especially for example, if you move a VM with some data into the cloud, you may want to use the same data to build a mobile front end and that\u2019s when you're starting to use some of our platform as a service components like our Azure Mobile Services, Azure Media Services.","So we see the combination and they're not all happening coincident, but there is time lag in it but therefore that\u2019s one of the reasons why we want to be very aggressive in getting the workloads on to Azure both storage and compute; and even in the storage and compute, we now have premium offerings for higher SLA, for higher performance, higher VM sizes and then on top of that, we have these managed services which have a different margin profile.","So media services, mobile services, WAB which is another place where we actually have lot of traction. And then that\u2019s all just on Azure.","Once you get beyond Azure, you have things like CRM Online, you have enterprise mobility suite and of course the Office 365 line up and when we think about our capital and in fact the core infrastructure, we don\u2019t have different infrastructure for these different services.","It\u2019s one common infrastructure and one common data center footprint between O365 Azure, CRM, Xbox Live everything. So that\u2019s why utilization of that entire infrastructure is how we think about even total return on invested capital for our cloud business.","Phil Winslow","Great.","Chris Suh","Thanks Phil. We'll move to the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up Amy, your commercial other business continues to have fantastic growth and I am just wondering when you juxtaposed that with the growth in the commercial licensing business, I heard you in terms of the headwinds that you faced.","But when we think about it more than one quarter out and think about the revenue transition as you guys continue to build market share in the cloud, how do we think about the trends in the commercial licensing business in the next year or so?","Amy Hood","Let me -- I think in general, let me start by saying all -- all up right. So in our commercial business, I think we\u2019ve done a very good job of continuing to outpace IT spend on an overall basis by continuing to push customers to our annuity business whether they are on -- on premise or the cloud. That is our strategic goal as well as impacts in both segments.","Now let me talk about sort of uniquely commercial licensing and how to think about it. While I won\u2019t give specific guidance, I will talk about how to think about the impact in particular from XP.","Our transactional revenue will have a headwind from XP. That doesn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as customers not continuing to be committed or not committing to move to annuity over the longer term, which is exactly I think the question that you're asking.","And so while we have a comparability issue that will show itself most directly as weakness in commercial licensing and most specifically as weakness in Office transactional licensing which will be a headwind, the overall goal of continuing to have more customers every quarter move to the cloud or whether or not they move, adding cloud services even if they have on prem because they believe in a hybrid model, is actually the structural guide post we have on a multi-year -- on a multi-year journey.","Chris Suh","Thanks Heather. Operator, we'll move to the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.","Raimo Lenschow","Okay. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick questions. Satya, I wanted to follow up on Phil Winslow\u2019s question earlier on the -- on Azure and the used cases there. In theory you have a huge opportunity given your install base on the server side.","Can you talk a little bit about what -- what you're seeing the SMB customer base doing. Are we kind of in it? People trying bursting or where is that huge customer base in terms of adoption on Azure?","Satya Nadella","On Azure itself, one of the other elements that I did not actually talk about in response to Phil\u2019s question is the hybrid offering. One of the products that's doing very, very well for us is the store simple product, which is essentially a storage product that cloud Tiers virtualization storage from on-premise to the cloud.","We also have built now into windows server backup and disaster recovery, same thing with SQL server. So that's the first thing that we're seeing is increased usage of our servers with the cloud component.","Bursting is something for sure a lot of people do but that\u2019s more on the high end because in the SMB segment, the real movement there is more to Office 365.","In fact, one of the things in Office 365 is we're getting people to effectively use servers, which now happens to be in cloud who never bought servers from us ever before because they didn\u2019t have exchange, they didn\u2019t have link, they didn\u2019t have any of the core capabilities of Office 365. So those are the two trends we're seeing.","Raimo Lenschow","Perfect, and a quick follow-up for Amy, if you look at the changes on the operating side that you talked about, it obviously seems to -- as a cultural shift. What\u2019s more, if you budget, it\u2019s more dynamic budgeting it's very much a return base culture that you seem to be introducing here.","But it\u2019s something that kind of needs to be feed through the organization and it\u2019s more a cultural change. Where are you in terms of like innings in terms of having it fully through the organization?","Amy Hood","Thanks for that question. I think we've talked about this in prior quarters while I think many people want to see it as a finance concept, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a senior leadership team concept and the leadership environment that I think we're making collective decisions faster.","I think we are applying our resources to opportunities when we see them. I think we have a freedom to make those choices quickly and I feel very good those about the decisiveness that comes with it, but also the empowerment that we give to people within our organizations to make those calls, to increase our performance without waiting to an annual budget process.","I think some people call it dynamic budgeting. I think for us, I think it\u2019s more about -- thinking about opportunities we have and stack ranking those every day to improve both our execution and our returns.","Raimo Lenschow","Thank you.","Chris Suh","Thanks. We'll move to the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed.","Brendan Barnicle","Thanks so much. Amy, when we first started talking about Office 365, I think at that time, you were suggesting that the move from an Office CAL to an Office 365 license would increase gross profit by about 50%.","Now that you had a couple of quarters with Office 365, do you think those changes to the model still make sense and more importantly, are there may be other changes that you're seeing that are more accurate?","Amy Hood","Thanks for the question. In general, I think we're still on the early ends of seeing the opportunity that we have in that segment.","As you pointed out, there is a couple components that make gross profit dollars per seat or the life time value of a customer depending on the terms you want to use improve and increase over the life cycle.","The very first thing and I think Satya even mentioned it in its most direct in SMB is moving from buying a copy of Office, which was a very static concept to the idea where you could buy Office and frankly get all the benefits that those who used to deploy servers used to get only with IT departments of their own.","So as you move Office, it\u2019s simply the first step. So, even though obviously it comes at a little lower gross margin percentage, our ability to add workloads, add premium services and to increase our overall footprint inside a customer is really where the life time value goes up.","And frankly over time and watching, I think both the creativity and the pace of innovation we\u2019ve seen coming out of our engineering teams particularly in Azure and Office 365 and our CRM team online, I actually even have more confidence in our ability to attach and grow that gross profit over time.","We mentioned simply one that didn\u2019t exist I think Brendan when we first started having this conversation, which was our EMS suite and I look and say, those opportunities as well as the creativity of our people I think gives me more confidence if not less in the structural integrity of the lifetime value of a customer argument.","Brendan Barnicle","Great. Thank you so much.","Chris Suh","Thanks. Operator, we will have time for one last question please.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please proceed.","Ed Maguire","Yes. Thank you. Over the last several quarters and particularly Satya, you\u2019ve opened up a number of the products to different platforms, Office in Android and with Minecraft and Skype, you've got a number of really multiplatform products and services.","Could you quantify so far to what extent you\u2019ve seen benefit and as this plays into the free upgrade for Windows 10 at least for a limited period, how you expect this to play out benefitting the business case of your products across the portfolio?","Satya Nadella","Yeah so overall at the highest level, our strategy here is to make sure that the Microsoft Services i.e. cloud services be it Azure, Office 365, CRM Online or Enterprise Mobility suite are covering all the devices out there in the marketplace.","So that, that way we maximize the opportunity we have for each of these subscription and capacity based services. So that\u2019s the core rational for why we are doing cross platform.","Now the next question is what\u2019s the uniqueness of Windows? And the uniqueness of Windows comes because we don\u2019t think of these services and their application end points as apps, but fundamentally core to the Windows experience. So we are building them natively into windows.","So for example, when you log into Windows, you are logging in with Microsoft account or Azure ID. When you have files, they are synching with one drive. Outlook is the email client for Windows. So that\u2019s how Windows will differentiate and not to mention, our Gaming and Xbox Live experiences.","So overall, we will build a differentiated Windows because our application experiences for our cloud end points will be native in windows and at the same time, we will make sure that our services are available on all end points driving more usage, more subscription growth. So the best way to measure our progress is Office 365 subscription growth, Azure growth and EMS growth.","Ed Maguire","Great. Thank you.","Chris Suh","Great. Thanks.

Thanks for joining us today. In many ways, our fourth quarter results reflect the trends we saw developing throughout the fiscal year. The consumer x86 PC market declined as users continued to prioritize devices to touch and ability. At the same time we saw continued strength in our enterprise product and cloud solution and increased adoption of our consumer services.","This quarter our Windows business declined as the device market continued to evolve beyond the traditional PC. We are working to transition the business into this modern era of computing taking advantage of the new scenarios enabled our Windows 8. As we said before, given the complexity of the ecosystem this journey will take but we continue to make incremental progress.","In June, we released the public preview of Windows 8.1. It blends the desktop and modern experience. It has new features and improvements in areas such as personalization, search, built-in app and cloud connectivity. Windows 8.1 will be a free update to existing Windows 8 users and will be made available to OEMs in August, less than one year since launch.","To increase and improve retail distribution, we entered into a strategic partnership with BestBuy to create a Windows store in over 600 BestBuy locations. These store-within-a-store locations provide a large scale hands-on consumer experience that showcases Microsoft devices and services. The percentage (inaudible) devices available at retail continues to improve. The first 8x Windows tablet became available at retail a few weeks ago. It has legacy application compatibility, includes Microsoft Office and retails for less than $400. We expect additional compelling small screen devices to be available in the coming months.","Less than a year ago, we launched Surface RT and Surface Pro, each with a unique value proposition. Surface is one part of our journey to bring innovative, compelling Windows devices to market in a modern era of computing. (Inaudible) analyze our progress and fine-tune our action plan as needed.","Hear what we did this quarter. We reduced the price of Surface RT by $150 to $349 per device. As a result of this price change as well as inventory adjustments for related parts and accessories we recorded a $900 million charge to our income statement. While this resulted in a negative $0.07 impact on earnings, we believe this pricing adjustment will accelerate Surface RT adoption and position us better for long term success.","We also increased retail distribution in the quarter. Surface is now available in 29 markets and 10,000 retail locations. We expanded the availability of Surface to our business and institutional customers. Through our new channel expansion program, commercial customers are able to purchase Surface devices from authorized resellers in the U.S. Over the next few months we will authorize commercial distributors and resellers in more countries.","So in summary on Windows, we are working hard with our partners to gain share in the evolving and growing device markets. I want to be very clear, we know we have to do better and that's one reason we made a strategic and organizational changes we made last week. With over 1.5 billion Windows users around the world, a transition of this magnitude takes time. We are confident we are moving in the right direction.","Now on to our enterprise business which continues to be strong. We closed out the year with record on our revenue up $22.4 billion as businesses continued to make long term commitments to the Microsoft platform. Within our server and tools business, we continue to make significant improvements in performance reliability and scalability with SQL server. As a result, customers are increasingly moving mission critical and BI workloads to the platform. Our SQL Server has been the unit share leader in the market for some time. It has consistently outgrown in the market over the past 12 months and is now the second largest database in revenue share.","We recently announced the next versions of Windows Server and System Center which will continue to deliver on our Cloud OS vision. With new features and enhancements in virtualization, storage and networking, we are empowering our customers to more officially manage their application services and their private, hosted and public cloud infrastructures.","In Windows Azure, we continue to innovate and broaden our cloud platform offering. We recently announced an important enterprise partnership with Oracle. It will enable customers to our Oracle software on Hyper-V and in Windows Azure. In June, we announced the public review of Windows Azure in China, operated by 21Vianet making Microsoft the first multinational organization to offer public cloud services in China.","As a result of the greater choice and flexibility, we are seeing increased customer tractions, those in terms of an increase in Enterprise customers but also the average deal size. Our productivity solutions continue to be a top priority for CIOs. As Enterprise customers look to modernize their productivity infrastructures, they are increasingly turning to Office 365.","We recently announced the expansion of commercial availability into several new markets, making Office 365 available in over 125 markets worldwide. I\u2019m pleased to share that momentum is accelerating. An Office 365 is now on a $1.5 billion annual revenue run rate.","During the quarter, we saw ongoing momentum for our consumer services such as Office 365 Home Premium, SkyDrive, Xbox LIVE, Skype and Outlook.com. By giving consumers rich, high value experiences across productivity, litigations and entertainment, these services can help you about products and our overall ecosystem, our strategic advantage in today\u2019s marketplace where the line between home and work is boring for many customers.","Our unified communication offering of Skype and Lync are great example of our customer enterprise products can be mutually reinforcing and create more opportunity for Microsoft. In summary, the third quarter contains many of the trends we saw developing throughout the fiscal year.","We continue to make important stride for our strategy, to create a family of devices and services for individuals and businesses, to empower them for the activities they value the most. Some of our investments are already paying off while others reinforce the foundation that positions us for future growth and profitability.","With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Chris to get more details about this quarter before I come back to share thoughts on the first quarter of fiscal 2014.","Chris Suh","Thanks Amy. First, I\u2019m going to review our overall results and then I'll move onto the details by business segment. Revenue was up 3% to $19.2 billion and operating income declined 11% to $6.2 billion. Earnings per share declined 19% to $0.59. Foreign exchange had $257 million or 1 percentage point negative impact revenue this quarter and $177 million or 3 percentage point negative impact to net income.","From a geographic perspective, revenue in the U.S. was strong relative to other regions. Annuity revenue continued to be strong growing 13%. We have record unearned revenue of $22.4 billion and our contracted-not-billed balance was approximately $21 billion.","Now, to the result of the Windows division, our revenue declined 5% this quarter. The x86 PC market continued to decline while business PC showed modest growth. We estimate consumer PCs declined more than 20%. As a result, OEM revenue declined 15%.","OEM revenue lagged the PC market primarily due to market dynamics in China and lower ASPs reflecting the introduction of our small screen touch offering in the current period incentive program. Non-OEM revenue grew 22% driven by sales of Surface and continued double-digit growth in volume licensing as businesses across all areas and segments continue to value the Windows platform.","This quarter we saw continued progress in the transition from Windows XP and today almost three-quarters of enterprise desktops are running Windows 7. Volume licensing of Windows delivered more than $4 billion in revenue this year.","Next, I\u2019ll walk through our Server and Tools business which posted another solid quarter with 9% revenue growth and double-digit bookings growth. Product revenue grew 9%, driven primarily by growth in premium versions of Windows, Server and SQL Server .Our cloud momentum continues with strong customer adoption, upsell the higher level services and increased innovation. We released a number of Azure services, including mobility, media and website services and a growing number of customers who are already using multiple services for the cloud platform needs. We added 25% more enterprise customers this quarter and now over 50% of the Fortune 500 are using Windows Azure.","In the data center, system center revenue grew 14% and the premium version of Windows Server continued to see significant revenue growth. Hyper-V, our virtualization product, continued to gain market share over the past year. Companies such as Aston Martin and Grant Thornton continue to look to Hyper-V and System Center to deliver their critical business application.","In the data platform business, SQL Server revenue grew 16% and again outpaced the broader market. Last month, we announced SQL Server 2014, the next version of our data platform which has in-memory capabilities built right into the core database. We also announced Power VI for Office 365, a cloud based BI solutions that combine power of SQL server with the familiarity of Office.","Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 2%. Within that, business revenue grew 7%, driven by 10% growth in annuity revenue. Consumer revenue declined 27%. Results in our consumer business were driven by declines in the consumer x86 PC market and the shift to subscription, offset in part by attach gains. As our customers transition to the new subscription model, there is a short term impact to revenue due to the changes in the timing of revenue recognition but over time we expect our revenue to grow and become more recurring and predictable.","With the subscription model, we are providing greater value to our customers with the frequent product updates, new cloud services and attractive pricing. We saw strong early adoption of the subscription offering and now have more than 1 million Office 365 Home Premium subscribers. It's been a big year for Office 365 and as Amy said, it's now on a $1.5 billion annual revenue run rate. This was our strongest quarter ever with more net fee adds in the quarter than all of fiscal 2012. We are seeing strong upsell with one in three Office 365 now running premium workloads.","In terms of our productivity offerings, we continue to see strength of Exchange, SharePoint and Lync each growing double-digits. Lync revenue grew over 30% driving our enterprise communication business to deliver more than $1 billion revenue in this fiscal year. Additionally, we met a key milestone in the Lync and Skype integration and users can now seamlessly communicate in voice and IM across the two services.","Next, I'll move on to the Online Services division where revenue grew 9% and operating performance improved by $107 million or 22%. Online advertising revenue was up 11% driven by both rate and volume improvements in our search business.","In the Entertainment and Devices division, revenue grew 8%. Xbox LIVE transaction revenue grew nearly 20% and is providing economic opportunities for publishers in the soft console market. This quarter we announced our next generation gaming and entertainment console Xbox One and at E3 we showcased in impressive line of games that will be coming to the new platform.","Progress with Windows Phone continues as our partners, including Nokia, Samsung, Huawei and HTC are delivering new phones at a broader range of price points. Telefonica also recently announced an enhanced marketing effort to promote Windows Phone 8 devices and with the recent Sprint announcement, Windows Phone 8 devices will now be available on all major U.S. operators.","Now I'll cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 14% principally driven by Surface and growth in cloud infrastructure. Operating expenses grew 9% primarily related to sales and marketing for Surface and Windows 8. This quarter, our CapEx increased as we continued to invest in our cloud infrastructure and expand our geographic footprint to support the growth in our online businesses. And finally we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Amy for our outlook.","Amy Hood","Thanks Chris. Before I discuss our expectations for the first quarter, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes discussing last week\u2019s announcements on One Microsoft. If you haven\u2019t already done so, I encourage you to read out strategy memo and Steve Ballmer's email to employees. Microsoft is rallying to hide a single strategy. As a part of this, we implemented a new organizational structure that will allow us to advance our strategy more quickly and more efficiently.","We are currently in the process of determining what changes, if any, will be made to our reporting segment. In late September, we will host an analyst event, here in Redmond, at which point we will discuss our strategy, our new organizational structure and any changes to our reporting segments. We will also give more thoughts on our full-year outlook at that time. Please look for additional details from Chris over the coming weeks.","Now, moving on to our expectations for the first quarter. In Windows, we expect revenues to continue to be negatively impacted by the decline in the consumer x86 PC market. Excluding the impact of the Windows upgrade offer in the prior year, OEM revenue should account for approximately 65% of the division's revenue and should decline mid teens. Non-OEM revenue should account for approximately 35% of the division's revenue primarily reflecting revenue from volume licensing and Surface including Surface RT at new price points.","While updating your model, please keep in mind that in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, prior to the launch of Surface, OEM accounted for 75% of the division's total revenue. Within Server & Tools, product revenue including transactional and multi-year licensing is about 80% of the division's total. Our Enterprise services is the remaining 20%.","We expect both product and enterprise services revenue to grow high-single digits. In the Microsoft Business Division, we expect business revenue to account for approximately 85% of the division's total. Our consumer revenue should account for the remaining 15%. Business revenue should grow mid-single digit reflecting low double-digit growth in annuity and the shift from transaction licensing to Cloud services.","With the ongoing shift to subscription, consumer revenue will lag the x86 consumer PC market by approximately 5 percentage points, even as the tax continues to grow. This excludes the impact of the Office upgrade offer in the prior year. As a reminder, business revenue accounted for 80% of total revenue in the prior year.","In the online services division, we expect revenue to grow low double digits reflecting growth in service revenue partially offset by lower display revenue. With the Entertainment and Devices divisions, we expect revenue to decline low-single digits as the industry waits the next generation console.","For the first quarter, cost of goods sold will reflect surface as well as the impact of the capital expenditures we made in fiscal 2013. As a result, COG should grow over 20%. Other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset the interest expense and the net cost of hedging. In the current low interest environment, we expect these items to generally offset.","For the first quarter regarding CapEx, we expect continued growth in our investments and our global data centers. Excluding the impact of the Windows and Office upgrade offers, unearned revenue should roughly follow historical seasonal pattern.","Now, turning briefly to the full fiscal year, we are reducing our operating expense guidance. We now expect fiscal year 2014 operating expenses to be $31.3 billion to $31.9 billion with growth in the low teens for the first quarter. We expect our tax rates to be between 18% and 21% for the full fiscal year.","In summary, as we look back on the year, fiscal 2013 was a pivotal time for Microsoft. With Windows 8, we increased our addressable market. Our OEM partners have started capitalizing on the new opportunities delivering a wide range of new Windows hardware, from phones, the tablets to new PCs.","We extended our first party devices through Surface and the announcement of Xbox One. We modernized productivity with Office 365 changing our business model. For the first time, both businesses and consumers can now access Office through subscription. We took share from key competitors and key enterprise markets. We added several new features, including infrastructure as a service capabilities for Windows Azure. With Azure we are fundamentally changing the way businesses manage their IT infrastructure and we continue the expansion of our data center footprint which enables us to deliver high value services and experiences globally.","As we look to fiscal 2014, we are focused on a single strategy. With our new organizational structure, we believe we'll be able to execute more quickly and more efficiently driving long term growth profitability and shareholder value.","With that I'll turn it back to Chris and we'll take some questions.","Chris Suh","Thanks Amy. We want to get to question from as many of you as possible, so please just stick to one question. Operator, please go ahead and repeat your instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we do have our first question from Walter Pritchard from Citigroup.","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","I am wondering if you could talk a little bit about -- you talked about COGs in Q1 and you don\u2019t mention COGs, obviously you have Xbox One launch in the second quarter. Could you give us some guidance about how we should think about that product having an impact on margins, maybe comparing it to 360 or anything else you could do to help us directionally with the COGs impact on Q1?","Amy Hood","So as we transition to a device services company, I think you need to keep in mind that we expect CapEx continue to grow throughout our business, specifically the Xbox One and the new generation of consoles and launches I think you should think about that, as to think about all console life cycles, and so keep that in mind as you model COGs and seasonality throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.","Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein","Can you give us some color on the short term revenue impact of the move to the cloud, is it just MBD, is it also server and tools, how does the license revenue convert to cloud revenue?","Amy Hood","Mark, thanks for that question. It is primarily an MBD where we had a higher percentage of our revenue, that was accounted for transactionally both on the business side and in the consumer side. So I think that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen us in our outlook for Q1 try to start to explain that transition to consumer by saying that we expect to lag the PC market by approximately 5 percentage points while attaching pieces.","Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein","Is there a similar lag on the transactional side on the enterprise?","Amy Hood","Yes, you can see it when we gave the guidance for the business segment. We said 10% growth on the annuity and so that would clearly say that part of that is a transactional move from recognize upfront revenue to multi-year licensing agreement.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse","Just a follow up on (inaudible), first, Amy, obviously you go to a subscription model, you have less upfront, lower billing versus license, why don\u2019t you give us a sort of a backdoor, a dollar of cloud or 365 revenue would have been, and that for sure should have been $3 relative to license, so just we can turn it back on to help with that transition and also actually to Walter\u2019s question about Xbox COGs, maybe you could add a sense for -- if this cycle really should be any different than previous cycles when you thought about pricing relative to the cost of the console?","Amy Hood","I will try to remember both of those questions. Let me take the second question as it\u2019s the most recent in my mind. I would not think about this console cycle being any different from prior cycles. So let me go back to the first question, which is can I give examples, I believe we probably think about the transition front, we used to recognize revenue when we bought something upfront transactionally versus buying a subscription from us. I will give an example. If you used to buy a license from us as a consumer and paid up for example $100 for (inaudible), we recognize $100 in the period in which it was purchased.","Now if that same person went and bought Office 365 Premium, and once it\u2019s activated, we recognize the revenue over the period of the purchase which is 12 months, we recognize it ratably.","Chris Suh","Yeah, thanks. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","Excellent. Thank you guys for taking my question. I was wondering focusing on the Server & Tools division you guys came in with high single-digit growth versus the guidance of low double-digit growth. Also can you walk us through some of the elements that perhaps transpired during the quarter than caused that gap of why it came in slightly below expectations there and to what extent was the shift towards subscription a part of that.","Amy Hood","Let me start by saying Server & Tools had a very good quarter. We continue to win share in virtualization, the SQL Server and could continue to go faster than both Oracle and IBM. Revenue did grow 9%, which importantly far outpaced the underlying hardware market. And over the period of the quarter, we did see the hardware market fundamentally coming a bit lower than we had expected.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","Okay.","Chris Suh","Great. Thanks Keith. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you very much. Amy, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the incentive pricing you\u2019ve been doing, not just on your own devices like Chris mentioned in his prepared remarks but also in the OEM market. And if you haven\u2019t done incentive pricing at the OEM level, is there a chance we could see the strategy going forward at a way to help lower the price points of consumer PCs and then hence trying to spur demand? Thank you.","Amy Hood","Thanks Heather. I think it\u2019s a great question. I do think that we should think about incentives and all of our programs, including a Small Screen Touch view that we\u2019ve launched, as a way to increase the breadth of our Windows devices available across all price points.","Chris Suh","Thank you, Heather. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Your line is now open.","Rick Sherlund - Nomura","Thanks. I wonder if you have any perspective for us on you got Intel\u2019s Haswell chip shipping now 8.1 coming in probably October. Are you sensing that OEMs are trying to manage inventories down for the time being and waiting cautiously Intel suggested that maybe you\u2019re seeing some inventory liquidation. So I wonder if you could just give us a sense of what you\u2019re hearing from the OEMs?","Amy Hood","Thanks Rick. I think like the rest of the ecosystem, we are excited about the advances Intel has made with the fourth-generation core processor. And we\u2019re also looking forward to the next ADAM chip but was launched a little less than a month ago. I think it\u2019s little bit too early for me to say and like to wait and see how the quarter plays out.","Chris Suh","Rick, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes to us from Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is now open.","Brent Thill - UBS","Amy, on the expenses you are realizing next year down and it looks like your expense growth will materially slow from what it was this year. I\u2019m just curious if you could just help us understand where that\u2019s coming from and how you\u2019re thinking about that for next year.","Amy Hood","Well, actually I think this is I feel good because I think in some ways the re-org we announced last week along with our increased focus and our new single strategy has allowed us to really look and say what are the things we\u2019re going to put behind and focus to improve our execution. And so I feel quite good about our ability to do that and you heard us say before many of the reasons we did this re-org are about doing things better and more efficiently.","Chris Suh","Thank you. Thanks Brent. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Maguire with CLSA. Your line is now open.","Ed Maguire - CLSA","Hi. Good afternoon. Amy, you had discussed your increased CapEx this quarter and I was wondering if you could address the margin profile of your cloud services. In the comments, you discussed how you have higher datacenter cost and what I\u2019d like to understand is whether this is temporary as you are ramping up this transition towards subscription business or whether this actually changes the growth margin profile of these revenues. Thanks.","Amy Hood","Thanks Ed. It\u2019s a good question. Every transition to device and services company that is a multiyear commitment to evolve our business. You should expect the CapEx will continue to grow as we ramp that business. With the expansion of Azure service offerings and the continued momentum and Office 365 as well as our consumer services, investing in this global footprint to meet customer demand is incredibly important and quite strategic. And really the question is, our ability to feel smart way and that will create an advantage for us, we can pass along to our customers. And so I look forward to being able to move these datacenters globally to reach more people with more services.","Chris Suh","Okay. Thanks, Ed. Operator next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from John DiFucci with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","John DiFucci - JPMorgan","Thank you. Amy your CapEx this quarter was about $700 million, greater than $700 million, greater than you guided just 90 days ago. Why was there such a sudden change, I know, Chris I think explained why it was high -- higher and why it\u2019s going to be higher going forward? But why was it such a sudden change so dramatically just in this quarter and will this planned increase going forward affect your ability to do things like buyback shares?","Amy Hood","Yeah. Our -- in Q4 really as we continue to add Azure services, in fact we added over 80 this quarter and with this increase demand of Office 365 and then $1.5 billion annual run rate, up from just a $1 billion in Q3. I would think about that as our ability to increase demand and meet demand globally with our services, and so doing that in Q4 was important, because you want to be ahead of demand there.","John DiFucci - JPMorgan","So was that something that was unexpected, you just said, higher demand in Q4?","Amy Hood","We are accelerating.","John DiFucci - JPMorgan","Okay. Okay. And will this affect your ability to buyback shares going forward, this increase in CapEx?","Amy Hood","No. I mean, our cash returned $2.9 billion this quarter, I recall for the year and we\u2019ll continue take a balanced approach to capital allocation with those investments, acquisition really make sense and return the capital to shareholders.","Chris Suh","Okay. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open","Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thank you very much. Amy congrats on your first conference call as CFO. My question had to do with Windows side of the business. I know that you had a impairment charge for the inventory clearance. But even if I backed, if I add that back, it looks like the operating margin of the Windows business were sequentially lower, quite materially just wanted to get some insights into what drove that from the March quarter into the June quarter?","As you look further out into the operating margins of the Windows business, given that you are going to be focusing on Surface? How should we think about the margin structure, I guess you have a volume threshold to clear before you can start to make a margin, given that it\u2019s more of a product? But really two parts to that question, love to get your answers? Thank you so much.","Amy Hood","Thanks Kash. Let me address, I think were the two components. The first component, like a general question about margins this quarter for Windows, as you said they were impacted by Surface. And the second one is, by the marketing investment we continue to make in the ecosystem to move forward.","Overall, I think, as you think about the Windows division as we reported, obviously since there was mix between hardware and software, you should continue to expect margins to reflect that mix.","Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Chris Suh","Thank you, Kash. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies","Thanks a lot. Amy, I just wanted to drill into the billings growth, where we adjust for the unearned and it\u2019s a lot higher for the server and tools business, which is obviously going through a condition towards more a subscription arrangements then it a lot higher there in the MBD segment?","I\u2019m just wondering if you can compare and contrast why that might be, I understand the consumer piece in MBD. But is the other piece of it just that there are more sort of conditional licensing arrangements in MBD with enterprise customers and so the impact from the transition is all the greater and that\u2019s why you see that more subdued billings growth rate in MBD? Thanks.","Amy Hood","Ross, thank you. It\u2019s always terrific when someone answers their own question. You actually have it exactly correct.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies","Great. Thank you.","Chris Suh","Thanks. Thanks Ross. Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen","Hi. Thank you very much and good afternoon. Just a follow on a bit on Kash\u2019s question. With Windows revenue coming in where it did. We are getting a few questions from investors about how Windows fared this quarter relative to the PC unit? If we were to exclude tablet revenues both Surface and otherwise. Just wondering Amy if you might be able to say roughly on year-over-year basis how Windows PC revenue compared to the low double-digit PC unit decline cited by the IDC\u2019s and Gartner\u2019s?","Amy Hood","Yeah. Chris actually covered that a bit in his comment but let me reiterate, because I do understand the question I think, which is relate to our OEM revenue 15%, down 15%. It was related, I believe to China, lower ASPs on the small stream SKU that we mentioned, as well as some of the incentive programs that we had in place during the quarter.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen","Thank you.","Chris Suh","Thanks Gregg. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays","Yeah. Thank you and Amy welcome on the first earnings call. And I had a question on the business PC side, that was an area of strength for the Windows division and you saw some growth there? Can you talk a little bit about that, if that\u2019s kind of, if you see that as a sustainable number or is that still driven by the end of life for Windows XP? Thank you.","Amy Hood","As we mentioned, our Windows business didn't make incremental progress in the business side. We expect that to continue in Q1. And with the end of life for Windows XP next year, we expect continued migration and today in the Enterprise about three quarters of desktops already run Windows 7.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays","Okay. Thank you very much.","Chris Suh","Yeah. Thank you. Next question please, operator?","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks so much. Amy contracted-but unbilled was down sequentially from Q3, the first time we have seen that in the last two years, what is attributing to that shift?","Amy Hood","Thank you. Actually I think our strong annuity growth, as well as our record unearned balance, I do believe -- support our belief that the strong performance of our multiyear license agreement is in place.","Chris Suh","Thank you, Operator. I think we have time for one more.","Operator","Okay. The next question is going to come from Karl Keirstead with BMO Capital Markets. You line is open.","Karl Keirstead - BMO Capital Markets","Thanks. I just wanted to ask a question about the mix shift multiyear licensing across Microsoft that\u2019s been a big part of the story. It has been up about 5 percentage points year-over-year each quarter in fiscal 2013? Amy, I\u2019m just wondering as we look forward to fiscal \u201914, can we expect it to increase at that cliff or is the software assurance attach rates now getting high enough that that mix shift should start to moderate?","Amy Hood","We have -- I continue to believe we will have double-digit annuity growth next year, so I think that shift you have seen especially if we continue to move people to our Cloud services, will continue.","Karl Keirstead - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks","Chris Suh","Thanks, Karl. Okay. So that will wrap up our Q&A portion of today's earnings calls. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months at various investor conferences and at our financial analyst meeting to be held in late September where we will share more details about our long-term strategies, the organizational structure and outlook for the rest of the fiscal year.

Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today\u2019s earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Satya.","Satya Nadella","Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining.","I\u2019m proud of our strong results this quarter and even more proud of what we have accomplished over the last 12 months. We delivered more than $110 billion in revenue for the full year with double digit topline and bottom line growth. And our commercial cloud business surpassed more than $23 billion in revenue for the year with gross margin expanding to 57%. The strength of our results reflects accelerating innovation and the trust customers are placing in us to power their digital transformation.","I shared our vision for the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge a little over a year ago, a vision that is now quickly becoming reality and impacting every customer in every industry. Everything we have accomplished this year has been about accelerating our lead in this new era and the tremendous opportunity ahead. We focused on the right secular technology trends and growing markets and followed that up with solid roadmap execution.","We reorganized our engineering teams to break free of the categories of the past and better align with the emerging tech stack from silicon to AI to experiences, to better serve the needs of our customers today and long into the future. We reoriented our sales and marketing teams, adding industry and technical expertise to partner more deeply with our customers on their digital transformation journeys. And, most importantly, we drove innovation to deliver differentiated value across the cloud and the edge.","Now, I\u2019ll briefly highlight some of our innovation and momentum. We introduced Microsoft 365 to empower employees in the modern workplace. Microsoft 365 is now a multi-billion-dollar business that gives our customers a path to the cloud and broadens our reach with new and underpenetrated markets, including more than 2 billion first-line workers, and industry-specific workflows.","Across Microsoft 365, we are helping people be more productive, collaborate and stay secure on any device with AI infused experiences they use every day, and it\u2019s driving usage. We have more than 135 million users of Office 365 commercial. Outlook mobile is being used on more than 100 million iOS and Android devices. And more than 200,000 organizations are using Microsoft Teams as the hub for teamwork.","We invested to make Windows 10 the most modern, secure, always-up-to-date operating system. Windows 10 is now active on nearly 700 million devices, and the growth of the enterprise deployments this year exceeded our expectations.","It was a record year for LinkedIn, now with more than 575 million members and revenue growth of 37% in Q4, the fifth consecutive quarter of revenue acceleration. We saw record levels of engagement and job postings again this quarter, with sessions growth up 41% year-over-year. This strong engagement is driven by quality of the feed, video, messaging and acceleration of mobile usage, with mobile sessions up more than 55% year-over-year. We will continue to invest to make LinkedIn the essential platform to connect the world\u2019s professionals and help them achieve more with experiences powered by LinkedIn and Microsoft graphs.","Dynamics 365 gives organizations an alternative to monolithic, siloed suites of business applications with modular, modern, extensible, and AI-driven apps that unlock insights across every part of the organization, from sales to HR. It\u2019s gaining traction as our third commercial cloud growth engine, with revenue up 61% year-over-year. Our investments in Power BI, PowerApps and Flow as the new analytics and application platform are gaining significant momentum with ISVs and enterprise customers.","Azure is the only hyper scale cloud that extends to the edge across identity, data, application platform, security and management, and our differentiated architectural approach drove another strong quarter of growth. We are investing aggressively to build Azure as the world\u2019s computer.","We expanded our global datacenter footprint to 54 regions, more than any other cloud provider, and with the most comprehensive compliance coverage in the industry. We added nearly 500 new Azure capabilities in the last year alone, focused on both existing workloads and new workloads such as IoT and AI at the Edge. We introduced Azure Stack and Azure Sphere, two first-of-their kind cloud-to-edge solutions that are already seeing strong customer demand.","We are democratizing data science and AI with Azure Cognitive Services, Azure ML, and data services such as Azure Cosmos DB to help organizations of all sizes convert their data into insights and experiences for competitive advantage. The world\u2019s leading companies are running on Azure, and I\u2019m especially proud that Walmart chose Azure and Microsoft 365 to accelerate its digital transformation for their associates and customers.","In Gaming, we are pursuing our expansive opportunity from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed, surpassing $10 billion in revenue this year for the first time. We are investing aggressively in content, community and cloud services across every endpoint to expand usage and deepen engagement with gamers. The combination of Xbox Live, Game Pass subscriptions and Mixer are driving record levels of growth and engagement.","Not only are we investing to grow organically but we are also investing inorganically in opportunities that expand our total addressable market and accrue value to our platforms and our customers. Take LinkedIn. We have united the world\u2019s leading professional cloud with the world\u2019s leading professional network and proved that we have an integration model that works, enabling LinkedIn to accelerate growth while retaining its member-first ethos.","With GitHub, we recognized the increasingly vital role that developers play in value creation and growth in the era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge. Our pending acquisition will enable us to bring our tools and services to new audiences, while enabling GitHub to grow and retain its independence and developer-first ethos and community.","PlayFab accelerates our vision to build a world-class cloud platform for the gaming industry across mobile, PC and console. And the addition of five new gaming studios bolsters our first-party content development to support our fast-growing gaming services.","Microsoft has always been a partner-led company, and partners increasingly see more opportunity on our platforms, inspiring leading companies like SAP, Adobe and GE, as well as fast-growing start-ups like InMobi to play an even larger role in our vibrant and growing partner ecosystem, an asset that gives us scale in this new era.","In closing, our opportunity has never been greater. We will continue to innovate and invest across our solution areas in serving our customers and their unmet and unarticulated needs. With this tremendous opportunity comes great responsibility. We\u2019re relentlessly working to instill trust in technology across everything we do. It\u2019s why we will continue to lead the industry dialogue on trust, advocate for customer privacy, drive industry-wide cybersecurity initiatives, and champion ethical AI.","Our investments and business model are fundamentally aligned with our customers\u2019 long-term interests and success. This opportunity and responsibility grounds us in our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. I\u2019m proud of our progress, and I\u2019m proud of the more than 100,000 Microsoft employees around the world who are focused on our customers\u2019 success in this new era.","Now, I\u2019ll hand it over to Amy who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining you for the questions.","Amy Hood","Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone.","This quarter, revenue was $30.1 billion, up 17% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 19% and 16% in constant currency. Operating income increased 30% and 24% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $1.13, increasing 7% and 3% in constant currency. As a reminder, FY17 included a $1.8 billion tax benefit related to previously non-deductible phone losses.","In our largest quarter of the year, our sales teams and partners delivered exceptional commercial results. We saw strong performance in most of our geographic regions against a backdrop of favorable macroeconomic conditions and positive IT spending trends.","Customer commitment to our cloud platform continues to increase. In FY18, we closed a record number of multi-million-dollar commercial cloud agreements and more than doubled the number of $10 million-plus Azure agreements. Our annuity mix increased 3 points year-over-year to 89%. As a result, commercial bookings increased 18% even with a strong prior year comparable. Commercial unearned revenue was $29 billion, growing 23% and 21% in constant currency, significantly higher than anticipated due to stronger than expected cloud billings.","Our commercial cloud revenue was $6.9 billion, growing 53% and 50% in constant currency with strong performance across the U.S., Western Europe, and the UK. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 6 points to 58%. In line with our commitment at the beginning of the year, we improved the gross margin percentage in each cloud service, with Azure seeing the most significant improvement.","Our company gross margin percentage was 68%, ahead of our expectations, and up 1 point year-over-year from improvement in our More Personal Computing segment, driven by Surface.","FX increased revenue growth by 2 points, 1 point lower than anticipated, due to a stronger U.S. dollar. At the segment level, FX had a positive impact of 3 points on Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point on More Personal Computing revenue. The FX impact to COGS was immaterial.","This quarter, operating expenses grew 9% and 8% in constant currency, above our expectations due to revenue driven expense, such as sales compensation given the strength of the quarter, and severance expense, primarily in our sales organizations, offset by FX favorability. Strong revenue growth, improved device gross margin percentage, and continued targeted investment in cloud engineering, cloud sales capacity, and LinkedIn created operating income leverage. This quarter, operating income increased again, up 3 points year-over-year.","Now, to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $9.7 billion, increasing 13% and 10% in constant currency, in line with our expectations even with the headwinds from a stronger dollar and a higher than anticipated mix of cloud billings in our Office commercial and Dynamics businesses during the quarter. As a reminder, under ASC 606, cloud revenue is ratably recognized while annuity on-premises revenue has a component of upfront recognition. A higher mix of cloud billings is reflected in more unearned revenue and less in-period recognition in a quarter.","Office commercial revenue increased 10% and 8% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 38% and 35% in constant currency and Office 365 commercial seats grew 29%. We continued to see healthy installed base growth and ARPU expansion from customer adoption of premium workloads in E3 and E5. Office consumer revenue increased 8% and 6% in constant currency, driven by recurring subscription revenue and growth in the subscriber base, now at 31.4 million.","Our Dynamics business grew 11% and 8% in constant currency, with double digit billings growth. Dynamics 365 grew 61% and 56% in constant currency.","LinkedIn revenue grew 37% and 34% in constant currency with strong execution across all businesses. As Satya highlighted, engagement continued to accelerate, and we also saw record levels of job postings, benefitting from a robust U.S. job market.","Segment gross margin dollars grew 13% and 10% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year even as cloud mix increased, driven by margin expansion in Office 365 and LinkedIn.","Operating expenses increased 7% as we continued to invest in LinkedIn, cloud engineering, and commercial sales capacity. Operating income increased 20% and 13% in constant currency.","Revenue from the Intelligent Cloud segment was $9.6 billion, increasing 23% and 20% in constant currency, with better than expected results in both our on-premises and Azure businesses. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 26% and 24% in constant currency, driven by continued strong Azure revenue growth of 89% and 85% in constant currency. Azure per user services performed ahead of expectations with our Enterprise Mobility installed base growing 55% year-over-year to over 82 million. Our on-premises server business grew 8% and 6% in constant currency, with double digit growth in premium server products revenue and healthy renewals, benefiting from the significant value customers see in our hybrid solutions.","Enterprise Services revenue grew 8% and 7% in constant currency, as growth in Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services was partially offset by a decline in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003.","Segment gross margin dollars increased 23% and 20% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged as material improvement in the Azure gross margin percentage was offset by a growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue. Operating expenses increased 11% with ongoing investments in cloud engineering and sales capacity to support top-line growth. Operating income grew 34%, up 30% in constant currency.","Finally, More Personal Computing. Revenue was $10.8 billion, up 17% and 16% in constant currency, with better than expected results in Windows commercial, OEM Pro, and Surface.","In the commercial space, we saw an accelerating pace of Windows 10 enterprise deployments this quarter. Customer demand for modern and secure hardware and stronger than expected PC growth in geographies where Pro mix is high contributed to OEM revenue growth of 14%, ahead of the overall commercial market. Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 23% and 19% in constant currency, driven by double digit billings growth as well as a higher mix of in-quarter recognition from multi-year agreements.","In consumer, OEM Non-Pro revenue declined 3%, slightly below the consumer PC market, driven by continued pressure in entry-level price category, even as we continued to take share in the premium category. Inventory levels were within the normal range.","Search revenue ex-TAC increased17% and 16% in constant currency driven by enhancements to our advertising platform and Bing volume growth across both U.S\/ and international markets. Surface revenue increased 25% and 21% in constant currency, driven by strong performance of the latest editions in the portfolio against a low prior year comparable.","In Gaming, revenue grew 39% and 38% in constant currency. Xbox software and services grew 36% and 35% in constant currency, mainly from a third-party title. Xbox Live monthly active users increased 8% to 57 million. Segment gross margin dollars grew 21% and 18% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased driven by new Surface editions, offset by sales mix to lower margin businesses.","Operating expenses grew 9% and 8% in constant currency, driven by seasonality changes in advertising spend versus the prior year and investments in engineering across Search and AI. Operating income grew 38% and 32% in constant currency.","Now, back to total Company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $4.1 billion and increased on a sequential basis, in line with expectations. Cash paid for property, plant, and equipment was $4 billion, reflecting investments to support growth in our cloud business as well as a $250 million real estate acquisition.","Free cash flow was $7.4 billion and down 15% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures in support of our cloud business. Cash flow from operations grew 4% year-over-year and included tax payments related to the adoption of ASC 606 and TCJA, as well as an earlier start to the hardware inventory build for holiday than in the prior year. Excluding the impact of these items, operating cash flow grew approximately 13%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections.","Other income and expense was approximately $300 million, lower than expected due to FX re-measurement. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 18%, higher than anticipated due to the geographic mix of our revenue. And finally, we returned $5.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, an increase of 16%. Our Q4 share repurchase was $2.1 billion, up 31% year-over-year, but down sequentially, given the suspension of share repurchase activity in advance of the announced GitHub acquisition.","Now, let\u2019s move to the outlook. My commentary, for both the full year and next quarter, does not include any impact from GitHub which we still expect to close by the end of the calendar year. Overall, the key drivers and trends of our business for the next fiscal year remain largely unchanged from April and assume a consistent macro environment.","First, on FX. Assuming that rates remain stable, we expect no impact to full year revenue growth, with any FX benefit in H1 offset in H2. FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by 1 point. Second, our commercial business. Given corporate IT spend optimism, an increasing demand for cloud services, our strong competitive product position, and consistent sales execution, we expect another year of strong revenue growth and higher annuity mix across our commercial business. As customer commitment to our cloud increases, we are seeing larger and longer term agreements. As a result, we may see increased quarterly volatility in commercial bookings growth and commercial unearned revenue.","Productivity and Business Processes should continue to grow double digits driven by Office 365, Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn. Customer demand for our hybrid offerings should drive high-teens growth in our server products and cloud services revenue KPI. And in Azure specifically, we expect an increasing mix of IaaS and PaaS consumption-based revenue. In Windows, we expect strong business fundamentals in our OEM Pro and Windows commercial businesses, though the rates of revenue growth will slow through the year against a strong FY18 comparable.","Third, commercial cloud gross margin percentage. We expect continued improvement in each commercial cloud service, as well as in the overall commercial cloud gross margin percentage. The rate of improvement will moderate relative to FY18 as revenue mix continues to shift to Azure IaaS and PaaS consumption-based services, and we realize less year-over-year improvement in our per-user services.","We will continue to increase our investments in CapEx to meet the growing demand for our cloud services, although we do expect the growth rate for the year to moderate.","Next, operating expenses. Given our strong execution, we will continue to invest in the trends and growing markets we believe are fundamental to long-term shareholder value creation. Investment in commercial cloud, LinkedIn, gaming, and AI should result in operating expense growth of roughly 7%. Even with these strategic investments and the continued shift to our cloud businesses, we expect operating margin to be up slightly year-over-year.","Other income and expense should be slightly negative, in line with prior guidance, and with quarterly variability primarily due to changes in FX remeasurement, interest rates, and valuation changes with the adoption of the new accounting rules for financial investments.","And finally, tax rate. We\u2019ve refined our estimates of the impacts from TCJA, the mix of service versus license revenue, and the geographic mix of revenue and now expect our FY19 effective tax rate to be roughly 17% with quarterly variability.","Now, to the outlook for our first quarter. First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by approximately 1 point and decrease COGS and operating expenses by 1 point. Second, our commercial business. We expect another healthy quarter with commercial unearned revenue down approximately 10% sequentially, in line with historic seasonality. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will improve slightly on a sequential basis. Third, we expect another quarter of sequential growth in capital expenditures as we continue to support growing, global customer demand.","Now to the segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $9.25 billion and $9.45 billion, driven by double digit growth in Office Commercial and Dynamics. LinkedIn revenue growth should remain high on a stronger prior year comparable. In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $8.15 billion and $8.35 billion. Azure revenue growth should reflect a balance of continued strength in our IaaS and PaaS consumption-based services and a moderating rate of growth in our per-user services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $9.95 billion to $10.25 billion. In OEM Pro, we expect revenue growth in line with the commercial PC market. And in OEM non-Pro, we expect similar dynamics as seen in Q4.","In Surface, we continue to expect strong performance from our latest editions, including the new Surface Go, to drive growth similar to Q1 of the prior year. Search ex-TAC should see another quarter of mid-teens growth with consistent execution against rate and volume growth opportunities. In Gaming, we expect mid-teens revenue growth with continued strong user engagement on our platform. The software and services growth rate will moderate due to strong third-party titles launched a year ago. We expect COGS of $9.5 billion to $9.7 billion and operating expenses of $9.2 billion to $9.3 billion. Other income and expense is expected to be approximately negative $100 million. And finally, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be slightly lower than our full year rate due to the volume of equity vests that take place during our first quarter.","Mike, let\u2019s go to Q&A.","Michael Spencer","Thanks, Amy. We\u2019ll now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Weiss","Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And congratulations on a really nice quarter. I wanted to dig into Azure a little bit. I think growth overall in Azure this quarter is probably ahead of most peoples\u2019 expectations. And it sounds like the type of business that\u2019s being done on Azure is becoming more strategic and changing a little bit. So, Satya, I was hoping you could talk to us a little bit about the types of workloads, the type of sort of services that are being used on Azure, how that\u2019s evolved over the past year. And Amy, for you, maybe there is a new KPI, I believe. You gave us sort of the growth in the Enterprise Mobility of 55%. Was that in line with your expectations? Because I know you were sort of tempering our expectations on growth in that part of the business. Is that growing in line with kind of the slowdown you were expecting or is that better than you had imagined?","Satya Nadella","Yes. So, let me -- first of all thanks Keith for the question. And so, let me start. Overall, in terms of the workload mix, it\u2019s been fairly stable, which is our hybrid value proposition really has continued to resonate. So, that means there\u2019s a bunch of workloads that are migrating to the cloud, people use both Azure Stack plus Azure. So, that continues to drive a lot of IaaS growth for us as people are sort of looking basically to lift and shift a lot of their current data center workloads. Then, on top of it, we even have modernization of apps that is accelerating. And that drives a lot of the higher level services, in particular our data services as well as our AI services when AI services are essentially compute, but what happens is all this compute then requires storage and data, and that\u2019s another place where we see increasing acceleration.","The one thing that I would say that I am increasingly seeing is Tier 1 workloads. In some sense, when you think about some of the commitments being made by some of the biggest brands in the world in terms of what they\u2019re doing, one, it\u2019s very core to their operation; and two, they are running it in the cloud. And so, that\u2019s one thing that definitely is a market difference for us.","Amy Hood","And to your question on the per user services, specifically Enterprise Mobility, Keith, it was a bit better than I had anticipated in Q4. And really, driver of these per user services, such as EMS, actually is the value proposition that Satya refers to, and we refer to as Microsoft 365 and we saw strength broadly. And if you think about that, it\u2019s the Windows commercial, it\u2019s Office 365 commercial and EMS. And really that I think what we heard a lot was the value of the security and management continue to add more supported endpoints, offer really tremendous value to customers. And we did see a bit more strength than I was anticipating in Q4.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Karl Keirstead","Amy, the commercial unearned revenue and bookings were again super strong, and evidently Microsoft is benefiting from fairly strong EA renewal activity. So, when you look out into fiscal \u201819, how would you compare the degree of renewal activity versus fiscal \u201818 and fiscal \u201817? It sounds like you\u2019re still constructive, but I\u2019d love to hear some color whether it feels as good as the fiscal year you just ended? Thank you.","Amy Hood","Thanks, Karl. Let me break up that question a little bit, because you actually asked a couple of things that are important. Number one, the unearned strength that we saw at the end of Q4, you\u2019re right, was very good execution on renewals on a reasonably large renewal base. But, there was also very good execution of adding new workloads, adding new opportunity in Q4, things such as Azure, as an example or Dynamics 365, as an example. So, really Q4 wasn\u2019t just renewal activity, it was also new workloads and new value. So, when you look into \u201819, I am optimistic on both of those fronts, good execution continuing on renewals as well as adding new value, new opportunity. And the third component of the question was really how did the renewal base correlate FY18? And the answer is, it\u2019s a little bigger, but it actually has the same amount of volatility quarter-to-quarter, so Q1 renewal base is actually almost equivalent to last year.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Heather Bellini","I was wondering, Amy or Satya, if you can help us think about how Azure Hybrid Benefit has changed the type of net expansion rate, you are experiencing on your ELAs that come up for renewal? And I know you are kind of a little bit touching on that with Karl, but is there any way to help to think about how that in particular might be helping the expansion rates of those accounts? And can you help us to think about how this might be -- how that might be helping drive growth in your existing contracts? And then the other question would be. You've mentioned that you are moving some per user consumption that you are going to see more growth in consumption based services versus per user Azure workload growth. And I\u2019m just kind of wondering, if you could share with us, is there any gross margin impact there? Does one have higher gross margins than the other? Is there anything that we should be taking from how you are parsing those comments about how we think of Azure's gross margin progression going forward?","Satya Nadella","So, on the first one, I actually think that these hybrid used benefits are being sort of best kept secrets. So, I\u2019m actually hoping that going into this next fiscal year, we do a much better job and customers do a much better job, but they don\u2019t benefit because the advantage Azure has because of the hybrid used benefits across the entire workload are pretty phenomenal, and we had a good set of sessions at our partner meetings this week just really making sure that everybody understand those benefits. So, I don\u2019t think that, that is really played out. If anything, all the growth we have seen is in spite of that not being broadly revenue driving growth.","But to your second question I\u2019ll even say the following which is that, I think that there is clearly difference in GM between the per user and consumption. But the key is even the consumption services come in different forms, there is the IR services, there is the data services, and some of the higher level services. Some of these IoT services now even have SaaS components to it. So, therefore, I think that the mix will be different by quarter-by-quarter, but increasingly our strategy is in many times to get our customers to get going with what is core storage or core compute, but then they scale into these higher levels of services.","Amy Hood","And I\u2019d say, Heather, the two components just to add. The Azure has a benefit. I think we are starting, as Satya said, we started to see some impact from that in my opinion in Q4 in the on-prem KPI. But it really was more in Windows. And the value as we continue to see in SQL next year I do think there is some opportunity for customers to realize the real value from these hybrid benefits. And so -- as to add confidence to my high teens KPI growth for the year is that this is a very customer value oriented offer.","To your question on GM, Satya has obviously correct on that one. And I\u2019d say the way we think about it is actually more -- we're talking about Azure per user, it really does move more with M365 per user. It's almost better to put that in your mind as behaving more and having more structures more like Office 365 and behaves quite similarly; tends to have good quarters, when we do good execution on Office 365, and so my comments were more and continue to be around having people understand that sales motion, and that it tends to move in that direction.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Moerdler","So, I\u2019ve two related questions. And the first is, if you look at this quarter, the intelligent cloud revenue grew 23% and the gross margin dollars grew the same 23%, given the SaaS growing lower margin Azure business, we\u2019re not seeing any longer negative margin impact. Have you reached the point where the incremental dollar for Azure revenue is closed to the overall intelligent cloud margin? And then a second, apologize, a slightly long question. CapEx spending in the quarter and the full year were both strong. We could argue the possibilities here, it\u2019s driven by all the capacity of the demand or you having to spend a lot of it on replacing equipment as they\u2019re ageing out. How should we think about the mix in CapEx between building demand and replacing with there?","Amy Hood","Let me take both of those. On the first one, in terms of the GM this quarter, you're right. The improvements particularly in the IaaS and PaaS, gross margin of Azure did offset the cloud mix to Azure within the segment, going forward continuing to see that. I think looking more pressured on gross margin just because the amount of Azure in the mix at the rate is growing, we\u2019re still not at that point where a $1 of gross margin in the cloud is equivalent to a $1 on-prem. That being said, we\u2019ve a lot as you saw this quarter room to grow gross margin dollars, in that even within that frame going into FY\u201919.","On your second question in terms of capital spent, if you think about it at a high level, our capital expenditures are growing at a lower rate than our overall cloud revenue is growing, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re starting to see leverage, right, flow through the P&L. And I think that the rate of CapEx growth, as I said in FY\u201919 will moderate, that happens because of course we\u2019re doing some replacement overall. We're adding regions and seeing a lot of global demand, and so -- and improving margin, so I think that\u2019s clearly the very high level as you asked the question. I tend to think revenue is growing faster than the capital. You\u2019re seeing leverage through the P&L and we\u2019ll see a moderating rate in FY\u201919 even if Q1 is the big quarter. It\u2019s just going to be volatile as CapEx tends to be quarter-to-quarter based on both supply chain and demand.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.","Walter Pritchard","Amy, wondering on the Office side, product and services on the commercial side, you had I think 8% growth. The lowest you\u2019ve seen, I know 606 drive some volatility in that business. Could you help us understand, what drove that in the quarter? And I know you\u2019re making some changes like this support and so forth as you get into the out years. Is there any impact that you expect to the gross rate in that businesses as we look forward from those changes?","Amy Hood","The entire impact in that KPI, I actually feel very good about that number because if you think about the $1 billion plus beat we had for the unearned, it was due to the fact that we had very good mix shift Office 365 in terms of billings in the quarter, almost very little of that gets recognized in quarter. Now, this all goes to the balance sheet. So, my confidence for FY19 in that number being the double digits we talked about in the full year guide, only gets raised by seeing that execution. So, it is really 606 related, if the way to think about it plus a mix of billings and billing strength. So, I don\u2019t really think of that as being negative, and you saw the exact same behavior and dynamics. So, it's a pretty similar in period in quarter impact.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Phil Winslow","Amy, question for you. You've commented on the positive spread that you're seeing in the Windows OEM business, both overall, but particularly on the commercial side. When you start to think forward in the next, call it, couple of quarters, here obviously, you told us what the positive drivers were. But how do you see this playing out? And can we maintain that positive spread? And if so, why, and if it does maybe narrow sort of how do you think about the narrowing?","Amy Hood","So, let me frame it first as this thing that I and we're are seeing really customers driven, which is, if you started Windows 10 and the value the customers seek. And what we're seeing is accelerating enterprise deployment of Windows 10. When that happens, it does create demand for new devices and modern devices that improved security. So that then in turn results in a better and stronger overall OEM PC commercial market. In addition because of the macroeconomic conditions are actually quite good on this front and with the business optimism creating some wind at our back, I also think people look and say if security and value are important, this is a great time to invest in modern PCs. And particular in market where pro mix has been strong, I continue to expect to see all of those things happen, through the course of next year.","Now, what you will see however, if all those things even do remain true which I expect them to, if the economic environment stays the same. H2 where we've had really strong revenue growth and a really strong market will I think moderate growth wise, just because the base it was coming off in '17 was just a lot lower. So, even if I see all the good things and good trends happening that I feel really create a great opportunity for us to sell Microsoft 365, you will see growth rates moderate next year.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Lionel Renshaw with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Lionel Renshaw","Amy, can I go back to the server product, you partly answered it with the whenever ask and I believe hybrid cloud will be a factor here, but the growth was the best we've seen for a long time. Can you just talk about the drivers that kind of were at play here?","Amy Hood","You're right. The first one was the benefit that we saw from hybrid, in particular, with an outsized impact on Windows Server. The second has been a trend we also talked about a little before. We saw a strong double-digit growth in premium. So, it was mix shift as well as I think strikes in the hybrid benefits as a value across the customers, those two would have otherwise I\u2019d actually call out as drivers for the quarter.","Lionel Renshaw","I mean they should be relatively sustainable, if I listen to them to you?","Amy Hood","I believe the one -- I think really important thing for us is continuing to focus on creating customer value. The concept of adding a lot of value by having and giving comfort to the customers that as they make a commitment to the Microsoft platform that they can move between a commitment to on-prem to the cloud in a high value way, I do believe is a unique thing that we offer at this time.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Q - Gregg Moskowitz","Satya, this is more of a big picture question, but over a longer term period, I am curios how large you think edge computing will become relative to centralized cloud computing?","Satya Nadella","Yes, I think vision that we have always had is that distributed computing in some sense will remain distributed. So, we don\u2019t split this into, there is an edge computing, there is a cloud computing. The need for computing is on the secular basis going to increase. And as you need to reason over larger amounts of data, you need not only storage and compute to be co-located all over as the world get them embedded with computing, that\u2019s what we are building for.","So if you think about our real competitive advantage and differentiation is, we have one programming model, one identity model, security, management. So that modern developers as well as IT can use the compute available from Azure Sphere to Azure. And the reality is these modern workloads in fact lose it all.","So it's not like I just build and Azure Sphere application. I build and application that\u2019s fundamentally distributed that also happens to ransom and compute on Azure Sphere. That I think the future which is distributed computing going back to what needs to be truly distributed, even driven server-less even versus this thing about let's just have one-time migration to something new.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Bachman","Satya, I wanted to direct this to you, if I could. I\u2019d like to understand how you view dynamics current positioning compared to the market opportunities? And the context of the question is, dynamics remains a fairly small part of Microsoft revenues as well if you look at the market share of where dynamic serve, it's a fairly small part of the markets served. So, what do you think Microsoft needs to do to have a larger impact against the market opportunities?","Satya Nadella","Overall, we are very committed and very bullish about the opportunity in dynamics. With Dynamics 365 for example, what you even to see in this last fiscal year which has been the first full fiscal year where we have this modern, modular approach to business application. I think it's very disruptive in the market place because it brings a very different value proposition. It has a price advantage and the value advantage for customers. And in it what is fundamentally fragmented mark, this is not a business application never was and never will be a winner-take-all. I know folks think about it best state, it\u2019s not I mean it\u2019s about one small category in one segment called enterprise.","There\u2019s a share -- high share consider it 25%, 35% of what have you. So in some sense, this one has always been about being able to serve customers especially in an increasing digitization work, right, which is the need for more business process automation is increasing. Take an IoT project, translate into a preventive maintenance in Azure and then ends up as fields service and Dynamics, that\u2019s been one pattern and we\u2019ve seen a ton of traction with. So to me us going in fact to these new secular growth opportunities while being disruptive to the status quo of anyone who has high margins and very high price monolithic products today is basically our strategy going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our final is coming from the line of Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Murphy","So, Amy, we keep expecting the Office 365 commercial seat growth to decelerate materially at some point, based upon the penetration level. But this quarter that seat growth actually accelerated about a 1 point to 29%. And when we look back on it the trajectory really isn\u2019t too different than where it was even a year ago. So I was just curious, is there some underlying driver there that would keep that deceleration relatively manageable going forward? Or what you continue to see that flowing in a way that overtime would exert a little drag on Azure through this per user Azure services?","Amy Hood","This is one where overtime there\u2019s certainly is going to be a deceleration. This is a per user business. And 365 has that characteristic and Office has it, EMS has it, and so this quarter actually what we saw, was actually some strength in education was added a good amount seats this quarter as well as good execution across our other segments. And so, we did see a bit of growth that we were excited to see frankly on a segment where we\u2019ve been working hard to make additional progress and add value. The team has actually done nice job in that segment, created some really modern offers, to get back and to enhance market that as well.","But over the long term and as we continue to move aggressively, we will continue to seek growth dissipate, but I would also say this is going to take longer than I think many people would have thought, there\u2019re lots of users as we continue to redefine what Office is that you add to the base. Whether that's first client workers, whether that\u2019s an increasing number of small businesses who finally have access and value that we\u2019re creating for them across things from scheduling all the way to being able to work through minor business process adjustments like Satya has talked about. So, really as we continue to redefine what Office means from something that people will always associate with Word, Excel and PowerPoint, to things that mean in mobile or video would stream, or collaboration with teams, I think we have opportunity to continue to add those new users, new types of users that we haven\u2019t had access before and the capability even to users we have.","Michael Spencer","That wraps up the Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you all of you soon. You can find additional details on the Microsoft Investor Relations website.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are: Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.","On our website, microsoft.com\/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.","Microsoft completed the acquisition of LinkedIn this quarter and is reporting its results in the Productivity and Business Processes segment beginning on December 8, 2016. Accordingly, our key investor metrics do not include the impact of LinkedIn. Additionally, for Q2 only, we are providing non-GAAP results excluding LinkedIn to help investors compare results to the guidance previously provided for the quarter. Our press release and slide deck contain supplemental information regarding the impact of LinkedIn on our financial results.","Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results.","Additionally, any mention of operating expenses refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q, which include research and development, sales and marketing, and general administrative but excludes the impact of integration and restructuring charges. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.","We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following today's call until the complete transcript is available.

These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Today I'll share the results of the second quarter and discuss what's ahead.","We had a solid quarter overall, delivering $26.1 billion in revenue, up 4% in constant currency. More importantly, we are making progress by innovating in new areas, growing our addressable market opportunity, and transforming our culture.","Wherever I go in my travels, whether it's in conversations with heads of state, NGOs, or CEOs, the common thread is the transformative power of digital technology to unlock new opportunity. Everyone I meet is talking about building their own digital capability to transform their products, service, and business model. They're looking to Microsoft for security, productivity, business process, cloud, and AI platforms to help drive their own transformation.","In this last quarter, we have continued to build momentum across all of these areas, and in particular AI. Just this month we acquired an AI deep learning startup, Maluuba, whose work in natural language processing will help advance our strategy to democratize AI for everyone.","With that as a backdrop, I'll turn to progress we have made this quarter by segment, starting with Productivity and Business Processes. Office 365 commercial seats grew 37% year over year and revenue is up 49% in constant currency. We're changing the nature of work, with Office as the universal tool kit to help people and teams accomplish more together. To that end, this quarter we introduced Microsoft Teams, our new chat-based workspace for Office 365. It brings together the full breadth and depth of Office 365 as well as connections to third-party services, all in a secure hub for teamwork. We are seeing strong demand for the preview from our existing Office 365 customers due to the deep integration of the rest of the Office platform. And at the same time, customers not yet on Office 365 are excited about this new way to work to see Teams as a potential first cloud workload.","In addition to collaboration, our innovation and security and compliance continues to drive customer preference for Office 365. This quarter we added new capabilities to give IT better ways to help their users safely connect to third-party applications. And for compliance, new eDiscovery capabilities make it easier and faster for organizations to find and analyze information related to legal and regulatory requests.","Customers also find value in the integration of SharePoint with PowerApps and Microsoft Flow to quickly and easily build mobile apps and automate workflows. In fact, just eight weeks after availability, we have seen more than 0.5 million people use PowerApps or Flow. This combination of productivity, security, and agility is incredibly valuable to customers, particularly in sectors like financial services and healthcare.","Take Willis Towers Watson, a global financial services firm, who chose our premium enterprise offering, including Office 365 E5. Global Fortune 500 companies TD Bank and AXA as well as Partners HealthCare and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center all chose Office 365 for its powerful security and productivity platform. And AstraZeneca recently upgraded Office 365 E5 for its advanced voice capabilities.","We're also expanding our growth opportunity beyond information workers by creating productivity solutions for retail, restaurant, hospitality, and manufacturing employees, who have traditionally been underserved by technology providers. Microsoft's StaffHub, a new application in Office 365, provides shift scheduling, messaging, and sharing capabilities for all these front-line workers.","Now let me talk about the second part of our ambition in this segment, reinventing business process. We completed the acquisition of LinkedIn in December, marking the start of our journey to bring together the world's professional cloud with the world's leading professional network. Our top priority is to ensure we innovate and drive value for LinkedIn members and grow their daily engagement. The LinkedIn business solutions, hire, market, sell, and learn, represent an expanded market opportunity for Microsoft, and we plan to diligently execute on this opportunity, keeping the member-first ethos in focus.","We are seeing good results with the core experience, with our revamped mobile app driving significant engagement growth in 2016. This quarter, the sessions on LinkedIn grew more than 20% year over year, a consistent level of growth throughout 2016. We also achieved record levels of mobile page views and feed interaction, creating a healthy foundation for LinkedIn's marketing solutions, which include the rapidly growing Sponsored Updates.","We also saw members engage with LinkedIn's hiring products at record levels as part of talent solutions. And LinkedIn's sales solutions have also seen rapid growth, with Sales Navigator seats up more than 20% year over year during the quarter. Sales Navigator's success on multiple CRM platforms makes it an essential tool for every B2B salesperson and one of our first integration scenarios will be to redefine social selling by enhancing Dynamics 365 with LinkedIn capabilities. The combination of LinkedIn's business solutions and Dynamics 365 gives us a more comprehensive portfolio of business SaaS solutions and strengthens our position in this growing and competitive market.","Dynamics 365 paid seats more than doubled again this quarter and new enterprise customers are increasingly choosing our cloud solutions, with more than 80% choosing Dynamics 365. DefenseReady is using Dynamics to give military leaders a 360-degree view of their organizations to quickly make informed decisions about capacity planning, and operations. Amway is using Dynamics 365 to modernize and empower their entrepreneurial sales force around the globe.","Now let's talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $14 billion, and we're on track to achieve our $20 billion in fiscal 2018.","Customers choose the Microsoft Cloud for the following reasons. They want a trusted global hyperscale cloud provider that meets enterprise-grade needs. They want hybrid support that is architected into the hyperscale service as well as the cloud service. They want higher level services to help build their own digital capability across IoT, enterprise app dev, advanced analytics, and AI capability. Moreover and most importantly, CIOs, CSOs, BDMs, and developers are all seeing the benefit from operational consistency, productivity, and security across their entire digital estate, spanning Windows 10 Cloud and Security Management, Office 365, Dynamics 365, Enterprise Mobility, and Azure.","A prime example is Mars, a $35 billion business with 60 brands. An early adopter of Office 365, Mars is using Office and Windows 10 to transform how its 80,000-strong global workforce collaborates while staying secure. And more recently, they have begun running mission-critical workloads on Azure with hundreds more on the way, including inventory management using Azure IoT. Swift Transportation, one of the largest trucking companies in the United States, is digitizing work for nearly 20,000 drivers with Office 365 and Skype and is using Azure to harness the data from their sensor-equipped trucks to optimize driver productivity and safety.","Across industries, we continue to see strong customer demand for our differentiated cloud solutions. Azure revenue grew 95% in constant currency this quarter. Azure premium revenue grew triple digits for the 10th consecutive quarter, and more than three out of four Azure customers are using Premium services.","We are also leading the next-generation programming model in developer services innovation with conversational bots, microservices, and event-driven serverless compute to help businesses rapidly gain the benefits of cloud infrastructure. Our bot framework is being used by more than 77,000 developers to do everything from e-commerce to customer service. Azure functions is helping companies like AccuWeather and Plexure to quickly and easily implement business-critical event-driven serverless processes. And everyone from game developers to financial services companies are using Azure Service Fabric for their low-latency high-scale microservices applications.","We're also rapidly expanding our portfolio of data and AI capabilities in Azure. Cognitive services, now deeply integrated with Azure Data Lake, enables customers to use industry-leading AI capabilities to easily analyze images, text, emotions, speech, sentiments at terabyte scale.","In our push to meet the needs of any developer on any platform, we joined the Linux Foundation, welcomed Google to the .NET Foundation, and announced a new Azure partnership with OpenAI to accelerate our vision.","At the edge of our cloud, Windows Server 2016 and SQL Server 2016 give enterprises Azure-inspired scale and innovation for secure infrastructure and cloud applications. Customers have already deployed more than 1 million instances of Windows Server 2016, and the new SQL Server drove a 5X increase in developer downloads in Q2 versus Q1.","Now I'll turn to our progress in More Personal Computing. This quarter, we saw growth across Windows broadly. First, Windows 10 commercial customers are rapidly adopting Windows 10, driven by their need for a secure and trusted platform. In fact, this quarter enterprise and education deployments increased 52%. Accenture, Broward County School District, UnitedHealthcare Group, are just a few that are choosing Windows 10 as their modern, secure enterprise-grade platform. These three commercial customers alone have already deployed more than 300,000 seats with commitments to deploy over 0.5 million.","The consumer PC market is also stabilizing. Gamers are increasingly turning to Windows 10 premium PCs for the best gaming experiences, logging more than 26 billion hours of game play on PCs and tablets this year. One reason gamers love their Windows 10 PC is because they can connect to their favorite games and social network on Xbox Live. Xbox Live monthly active users grew to 55 million this quarter, a new record, with growth across PCs, mobile, as well as the console.","Windows 10 Creators Update will bring 3D, mixed reality and game broadcasting to all Windows 10 customers. Partners like Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Acer are investing to deliver cutting-edge virtual reality experiences for customers using Windows 10 Holographic platform.","We are also broadening our opportunity through partnerships with chipset makers Intel as well as Qualcomm, who have committed to build the next generation of modern Windows PCs with advanced security, connectivity, AI, mixed reality, and gaming.","Our services innovation and user engagement on Windows 10 continues to grow. Users have asked Cortana more than 18 billion questions to date, and we are opening up new addressable markets with Cortana Devices SDK. BMW, Renault-Nissan, Harman are all using Cortana to embed voice-activated intelligence into their portfolio of products.","Finally, let's talk about devices. I'm excited about the customer reception to Surface Studio, our latest innovation in the Surface line and a new device category. Overall commercial demand for Surface remains strong, with three consecutive quarters of more than 25% growth. Organizations across industries are looking to Surface to help them achieve more, such as Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs in the United Kingdom rolling out Surface to more than 25,000 of its employees.","We're expanding into new markets with HoloLens. Commercial customers like ThyssenKrupp Elevator are using HoloLens to enable servicing up to four times faster than ever before, and we look forward to making HoloLens available in China in the first half of this year.","As customers embrace these new computers and computing experiences, we're generating enthusiasm for Windows 10 and new forms of expression, creativity, and gaming that it can unleash.","I'm proud of the progress we made this quarter and during the entire first half of the year. We look to the second half with a clear focus on execution and innovation. We have a significant opportunity this year and beyond for growth across every one of our segments. We're uniquely positioned to build the technology to help every person and organization take advantage of new innovations like AI and use them to drive their own growth and transformation.","Now let me hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you for questions.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to reiterate that my commentary reflects our performance inclusive of approximately three weeks of LinkedIn results. For this quarter only, I will comment on our results excluding LinkedIn for consistency with the guidance provided last quarter. I encourage you to reference our earnings slides for supplemental information.","Our second quarter revenue was $26.1 billion, up 2% and 4% in constant currency. Gross margin grew 3%, up 5% in constant currency. Operating income grew 5% or 8% in constant currency. And earnings per share were $0.83, an increase of 9% and 13% in constant currency. Excluding LinkedIn, our second quarter revenue was $25.8 billion, up 1% and 3% in constant currency. Gross margin increased 3% and 4% in constant currency. Operating income grew 8% and 11% in constant currency. And our EPS was $0.84, increasing 11% and 15% in constant currency.","Our investment agility and execution focus resulted in strong performance this quarter. From a geographic perspective, our results were largely in line with macroeconomic trends, with additional benefit from a healthier PC market, particularly in the commercial segment.","Our commercial cloud services drove our annuity mix up slightly year over year to 84%, even with better than expected transactional revenue performance. Commercial bookings increased 7% or 12% in constant currency. Commercial unearned revenue met our guidance range at $21.1 billion, growing 8% and 9% in constant currency, even with an FX headwind of approximately $150 million due to the strengthening U.S. dollar through the quarter. And our contracted-not-billed balance reached an all-time high, exceeding $28 billion.","Our commercial cloud revenue run rate grew to more than $14 billion, up 49%. Our commercial cloud gross margin percentage was 48%, up 2 points from last year, largely driven by improvement in the Azure gross margin percentage. And gross margin dollars grew again, increasing 62% across the commercial cloud. We remain on track for material gross margin percentage and dollar improvement this fiscal year.","Now to company gross margin, gross margin was approximately 62% inclusive of LinkedIn, up slightly from the prior year. This quarter, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to major currencies created additional negative FX impact on total and segment level revenue. On total revenue, FX had a 2-point negative impact, a point more than expected, with no additional impact from LinkedIn. In both Productivity and Business Processes and the Intelligent Cloud segments, the FX impact was 2 points, 1 point more than expected. And in More Personal Computing, FX had a 1-point impact, in line with expectations.","Total operating expenses grew 1% and 2% in constant currency. Excluding LinkedIn, operating expenses declined 2%, also 2% in constant currency. Operating expenses were under our guidance range primarily due to a favorable one-time legal settlement and FX benefits.","Now let's turn to each segment. This quarter, revenue from our Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes LinkedIn, grew 10% and 12% in constant currency to $7.4 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue increased by 5% and 7% in constant currency, as Office 365 growth again outpaced the shift from the on-premise business. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased by 47% or 49% in constant currency, driven by a combination of install base growth across all workloads and ARPU expansion.","We also continued to see higher than expected results from our transactional business, in part due to an improving commercial PC market. Office Consumer revenue grew 22% or 21% in constant currency, as we continued to see an increase in our subscriber base and growth of recurring subscription revenue. In addition, the higher growth rate this quarter was aided by post-launch inventory drawdown in the prior period.","Our Dynamics business grew 7%, up 9% in constant currency, and our Dynamics 365 install base more than doubled. LinkedIn revenue for the three-week period from December 8 to the end of the quarter was $228 million. Segment gross margin dollars grew 5% and 6% in constant currency, while segment gross margin percentage declined due to increasing cloud sales mix as well as roughly a point of impact from LinkedIn. Operating expenses grew 13%, 14% in constant currency, driven by the LinkedIn acquisition. Operating income declined slightly but was up 1% in constant currency and up 7% in constant currency excluding LinkedIn.","The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $6.9 billion of revenue, growing 8% and 10% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services grew 12% and 14% in constant currency, with strong momentum in our Azure business and another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth. Post-launch demand and purchasing ahead of currency driven pricing adjustments contributed to a higher than expected transactional revenue, mainly from Windows and SQL Server 2016.","As expected, Enterprise Services revenue growth declined this quarter 4% and 2% in constant currency due to lower volumes of Windows Server 2003 service agreements. Gross margin dollars grew 2% and 4% in constant currency. And segment gross margin percentage declined due to an increasing cloud revenue mix and a lower Enterprise Services gross margin, partially offset by material improvement in Azure gross margin. We grew operating expenses by 12% and 13% in constant currency, with continued investment in cloud engineering, sales capacity, and developer engagement. Operating income declined 7% and 4% in constant currency.","Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing, revenue exceeded our expectation at $11.8 billion, primarily from stronger than expected performance from our Windows business. Overall, revenue declined 5% and 4% in constant currency. Our OEM business grew 5% this quarter. OEM Pro grew 6%, better than we anticipated, driven by an improving commercial PC market and enterprise demand for Windows 10. OEM non-Pro grew 5%, ahead of the consumer PC market, as our partner ecosystem continued to see growth and share gains in the Windows premium device category. Inventory levels remain normal. Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 5% and 6% in constant currency, with double-digit annuity billings growth and install base expansion.","Patent licensing declined this quarter, driven by lower unit volume and revenue per unit.","Our search business ex-TAC grew 10% and 11% in constant currency, with improving profitability and continued growth in Bing from higher revenue per search and search volume.","In our devices business, revenue declined 35%, down 34% in constant currency. Phone revenue declined 81%, and we closed the sale of our feature phone business during this quarter. Surface revenue was down 2% and flat in constant currency, as we continued to phase out the Surface 3 device. Importantly, Surface gross margin dollars grew 6% and 17% in constant currency from an increasing mix of Pro 4 and Book replacing Surface 3 in the portfolio.","In gaming, revenue declined 3% and 1% in constant currency due to lower console hardware pricing and Xbox 360 volumes. In this holiday quarter, as Satya mentioned, we reached an all-time high of active Xbox Live users, which helped to drive our gaming software and services revenue to 18% and 21% growth in constant currency. This marks our first $1 billion quarter of digital transactions for our gaming business through our Universal Store across Windows 10 and Xbox One.","Segment gross margin percentage and dollars both increased this quarter. Gross margin dollars grew 3% and 5% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage expanded with the continued shift to higher-margin products and services. Operating expenses declined by 12%, also 12% in constant currency, from lower phone expense, a one-time legal settlement, and reduced marketing spend. Growth from Windows 10, the shift toward higher gross margin products and services in devices and gaming, and disciplined operating expense management resulted in operating income growth of 33% and 37% in constant currency.","Now back to our overall company results, we invested $2.5 billion in capital expenditures, inclusive of capital leases, as we continued to support customer and partner demand across our commercial and consumer services. During the quarter, other income and expense was $186 million. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%. We returned $6.5 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends, completing our prior $40 billion share repurchase program this quarter, as we committed.","Now let's turn to the outlook, first FX. We had originally expected FX rates to lessen going into H2. However, given current rates, we expect continued currency headwinds for the rest of the year. For Q3, we now expect about 1 point of negative impact on total revenue. Within the segments, we anticipate about 2 points of negative FX impact in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud, and 1 point in More Personal Computing. In Q4, we anticipate about 2 points of negative FX impact on total revenue, 3 points in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud, and 1 point in More Personal Computing.","Second, our commercial business, we expect our commercial cloud services to continue to drive annuity growth as we expand our install base, grow consumption, and execute well on renewals. We expect commercial unearned revenue of $20.2 billion to $20.4 billion, in line with historic seasonality. We continue to expect some volatility in our transactional business due to macroeconomic conditions and the ongoing shift to the cloud.","Third, CapEx, we will continue to meet customer demand by expanding data center capacity while driving efficiencies through new technologies. With the addition of LinkedIn, we expect our capital expenditures, including capital leases, to grow sequentially to support a broader portfolio. For the full year, including LinkedIn, we continue to expect the CapEx growth rate to be lower than last year.","Let's turn to our outlook for the individual segments. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $7.65 billion to $7.85 billion. This reflects the continued annuity shift to the cloud with Office 365, Dynamics double-digit billings growth, and LinkedIn revenue of approximately $950 million, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting.","In Intelligent Cloud, we expect $6.45 billion to $6.65 billion of revenue, with continued annuity strength and double-digit revenue growth across our server products and cloud services.","Enterprise Services revenue should decline again due to a lower volume of Windows Server 2003 service agreements. And in More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $9.05 billion to $9.35 billion.","In our OEM business, we anticipate revenue growth will exceed the overall PC market. Continued growth in Pro, driven by enterprise momentum for Windows 10, should be roughly in line with the commercial PC market, with some additional benefit coming from the prior-year inventory build. Our OEM non-Pro performance should grow ahead of the market due to strength in the premium device category.","In Search, we expect Bing's revenue growth ex-TAC to be similar to Q2. As a reminder, total search revenue growth will slow now that we've passed the one-year anniversary of our Yahoo! deal and the associated change in revenue recognition.","And in Gaming, we expect normal post-holiday trends, with declines in hardware console volumes and pricing balanced by higher engagement, usage, and transaction volume.","In Devices, we expect revenue to decline, driven primarily by phone. Surface revenue is expected to decline slightly with our ongoing Surface portfolio mix shift to Pro 4 and Book.","We expect COGS of $8.35 billion to $8.45 billion, including approximately $400 million of LinkedIn expenses. LinkedIn COGS include approximately $220 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets.","We expect operating expenses between $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion, with about $970 million from LinkedIn. The LinkedIn expense includes about $160 million for the amortization of acquired intangible assets. For the full year, we now expect operating expenses of $33.1 billion to $33.3 billion, with about $2.3 billion from LinkedIn. The LinkedIn expense includes roughly $360 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets. Other income and expense should be $150 million.","We continue to expect our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be 20% plus or minus 2 points, with variability driven by the proportion of services revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue, and the timing of equity vests.","Before moving to Q&A, I'd like to announce that we will hold a financial analyst briefing for the investor community in conjunction with our BUILD Developer Conference in May here in Seattle. We will share more details as we get closer to the date.","Chris, let's move to Q&A.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to the Q&A portion of today's call. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent, very nice quarter, guys, and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask a question about LinkedIn and what our expectation should be for achieving revenue synergies on LinkedIn. It seems like there's a lot of really interesting things you can do with that asset in combining it with your own portfolio. And how should we think about the potential for achieving some expense synergies? Obviously, there's a big cloud base that you could utilize under their assets, and Amy, you've always been very good at keeping expenses very well managed. So just as we go forward past the forward quarter, how should we think about the timeframe for achieving those benefits?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah. Let me start, and then I'll turn it over to Amy to talk about the specifics of the synergies. The core focus, Keith, for us to start with is to ensure that the innovation roadmap we have is all driving member value. The core ethos of LinkedIn needs be about member-first. How do we increase the engagement on the mobile flagship application as well as the revamped desktop experience that's now rolling out? We think that's at the core of being able to in fact then have all of the revenue \u2013 have revenue growth in their business solutions with across higher market sell. So that's how I see it. It's a two-sided market which starts with the health (35:02) of membership and member engagement.","And that is where the product roadmap, whether it's the integration with Office 365 or Dynamics 365, we'll be staying focused on it. We expect to see that roll out pretty rapidly. And as far as the guidance we have given at close in terms of what to expect, for example around EPS impact, those are things that we'll stay committed to. And I'll let Amy add more to it.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah, I think Satya is correct. The guidance we gave at the time of the announcement in terms of EPS dilution on \u2013 excluding the impact of purchase accounting, being minimally dilutive, 1% plus or minus, stands, including the goal to achieve synergies where they make sense as we continue to focus on growing the core business and keeping it incredibly healthy and realizing the revenue synergies that we know exist across the businesses.","As a reminder, the two biggest impacts of purchase accounting, one is it does impact the deferred revenue. So the in-quarter revenue and the guidance will look a bit lower due to that, as well as the amortization of intangible expenses, which will also hit. We'll take care to give you insight into those so that you can continue to hold us against the goals we set for ourselves.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Keith. We'll move to the next question, please, operator.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.","Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. There are a number of investors that had been wondering about the sales reorg that takes place February 1. Perhaps this has been a worry that's been overstated. Can you just give us a sense? Are there changes that are happening that will take place February 1 that are different, or is this a minor tweak to the go-to-market going forward?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","I can comment on it. I'm not particularly sure exactly what's happening on February 1. I would say the overall change that we are going through, and this has been ongoing for I would say the last multiple years, is transforming our field engagement model, where we're putting a lot more technical depth in the front-line sellers so that they can engage, whether it's data specialists, cloud specialists, security specialists, or even productivity specialists. Because it's super-important for us in this phase when people are looking for solutions to help them visually transform, for us to have a very fundamentally different type of capability in terms of our sales, and that's the transformation. And so we have really reorganized ourselves, both in the headquarters and in the field, to be able to recognize that shift.","What used to be large accounts for us, for example, are not by PC count anymore, and that's a pretty fundamental change. It's by consumption of cloud capacity in many cases. And this is happening all over the world. So that's the transformation that you will increasingly see us push forward, and no status quo on any part of Microsoft's organization should be counted on. If anything, we'll push to make sure that we are addressing what is our growth opportunities pretty aggressively.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And I think, Brent, in terms of there being a date, a very particular date, this is something, to Satya's point, we've been doing in a step function improvement over time for the past couple years, and we'll continue to do it. And the guidance certainly doesn't imply any type of slowdown in the commercial business. In fact, in some ways, it actually includes an acceleration in certain areas. So I think that's how I tend to look at it.","Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Brent. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you very much. Amy, you noted a material improvement in Azure gross margins this quarter. I was just wondering if you could share with us. I guess given how quickly revenue is growing in this area, how fast can we see margins ramp, which obviously were negative? And now that you're getting to some big revenue numbers, is there any reason why at a similar revenue scale you shouldn't be able to match the gross margins of what AWS, what you can back into from the financials of AWS? Can you walk us through the puts and takes? And then once you hit that scale point, is it something that we should see inflect pretty quickly? Thank you.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Heather. Let me start by saying we really do think about and talk about our cloud as containing all of the components, from the IaaS layer to the platform layer to the SaaS layer. You'll hear us talk about Dynamics 365, Office 365, as well as our Azure core and premium services.","And so when I think about the material gross margin improvement we saw in Azure, it continues the path we've actually been on where we've been discussing, as you continue to see customers ask for us and our help in managing their digital estate, consistently, securely through one interface, you'll actually see growth across all components of that cloud. It benefits margin, not just in Azure but across actually the entirety of the cloud. That 2-point year-over-year increase in the commercial cloud gross margin really, even with the massive growth in Azure over the course of the year, certainly implies the improvement that we expected. But I tend to think you will consistently hear both Satya and I refer to our cloud in its entirety. But I do respect people always wonder, so I did comment that we saw material improvement in Azure specifically.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you. Thanks, Heather. We'll take the next call, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Amy, I'm going to ask another question on gross margins, but this time at the Microsoft level. So your prior guidance was for ex-LinkedIn fiscal 2017 gross margins to be down 100 basis points. So the quarter you just posted gross margins ex-LinkedIn were actually up. And if I ran the math accurately, it looks like for your March quarter ex-LinkedIn, you're expecting gross margins to be about flat. So it feels like you're outperforming the core Microsoft gross margin guidance you gave before. So are you sticking with the down 100 basis points or has that improved? And if it has, what are the one or two biggest drivers of the gross margins feeling a little bit better ex-LinkedIn? Thank you.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Karl. I am sticking with it being about a point. That's the guidance we gave. And even inclusive of LinkedIn, I continue to believe it's about a point. So in some ways, I guess you could say it implies slightly better at the company level, if that's how you're thinking about it.","Really, Karl, what can drive that in addition to the overall gross margin improvement we talk about in the cloud, it's also really the strength we see in our Windows business. And I mean that not just in our OEM business but also across the commercial business for Windows. That tends to have a very good margin profile. And as we continue to improve the margin profile of our devices, we continue to see the OEM business health improve. And actually, we continue to see the growth in the consumer services around the transactions that run through Xbox is also good margin business for us that looks quite different than the hardware profile. So all of those can impact it, Karl, as we look through the rest of the year. But in general, inclusive of LinkedIn, I'm still around 100 bps.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thanks, Amy.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Karl, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you, congrats on the strong quarter and thanks for taking the question. So, Amy, the on-premise Server & Tools business grew 5%, 7% in constant currency. It was obviously helped by Windows Server 2016 and SQL Server 2016. How should we think about on a longer-term horizon over the next 12 months or even longer how those two should help on the on-premise license or annuity business, on the cloud in Azure? How should we think about the impact of that? Thanks.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Mark. Let me start by saying it's why we tend to focus all up at that server products and services KPI being double digits generally an easier way for us to talk about it all up between Azure and the on-prem business. But let me talk a little bit about what impacted the transactional business this quarter, and then we can talk about how to think about it in Q3 and maybe going forward.","We did and we're encouraged by the customer reaction, even our transactional customers, to the security and management value prop as well as the hybrid nature of our SQL and Windows Server 2016 releases that have taken place this year. That value prop is resonating. We saw some growth. I feel very good about that. And so I do think that can have an impact in H2. You heard me talk a little bit about it. With the major currency changes we saw in Q2, we've also done some price adjustments between certain geos for us. It did pull forward a bit of revenue into Q2. And so it will be a bit of a drag on Q3, which is taken into account in the guide. But I would reiterate the biggest driver of the transactional performance this quarter was really the value prop people saw.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Excellent, thank you so much. I appreciate it.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Mark.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Mark. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Amy, I'm wondering if you can talk about \u2013 we're still seeing the majority or really all the growth in operating profits come from MPC on a year-over-year basis. And I'm wondering how we should think about the factors impacting and the timing in the handoff of profit growth from MPC to IC and PBP, if that's something that you expect. What are the factors and timing there?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Right, I would say actually we've also seen some operating income growth in our PBP segment this quarter, up in constant currency, 7% before LinkedIn. So I do want to say some of that impact is absolutely landing as well as growth.","But the heart of your question is really about the MPC transition and IC. The way I think about it, we really \u2013 Satya and I and the leadership team decided, gosh, about 18 months ago \u2013 it's been a little longer than that now, to over-index on investing because of the TAM we saw in the Intelligent Cloud. We increased hiring and we invested in direct customer acquisition cost. We invested in many of the things Satya just talked about in terms of technical capabilities and our sales force. We're starting to see the benefit of that already in our top line numbers. That 12% or 14% in the server product and services KPI is a very good number. And I continue to expect that we'll see growth in revenue as those resources both get hired, get up to speed, and add value at accounts.","A lot of that account value frankly, Walter, today is coming in the form of consumed revenue. Consumed revenue is actually a great leading indicator for what we expect our Azure growth going forward to be. And so some of the confidence I think that we have in the transition of that investment in operating expense into even more revenue growth comes from seeing the consumed revenue trend that we're seeing today as well as the pipeline of projects and customers that we have. And so I do think about that being an 18-month investment we've been making. It's starting to pivot to consumed. It will then land as billings and ultimately in our P&L as GAAP revenue in-quarter off the balance sheet.","But I think you're right. We have been working and continuing to reinvest and save through the year as we look to get everything here more efficient. People often think we focus on cut here, add here. It's also about, are we putting every dollar most efficiently to help customers be successful? And I think that's a lot about what you heard Satya talk about the sales transition we're going through, whether it's how we build products. And so I actually am confident you'll start to see that transition land.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","I think Amy described it well in answering the very specific technical question about segment reporting and the margins in it. But architecturally, some of the examples I used are about the digital estate that actually doesn't start with Azure. In many cases, it starts with advanced set protection of Windows 10 estate. And then how does that relate to Office 365? How does that relate to Azure Active Directory? And then the workloads that they want to put, which are Tier 1 workloads in Azure.","It's very similar to what happened even in the client server era, but of course the starting points and how this progresses is very different. So we are always thinking at least of the technical architecture that makes us unique and differentiated spanning all of it. And so I don't think of it as margin shifts across the segments, and that's why we think of all of this as one digital estate at least from a customer-end perspective.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Walter. We'll go the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, thank you. Satya, I'm wondering what you think would be required to extend the hyper-growth trajectory for Azure into the future. For example, are there incremental waves of activity on the horizon that you would tie to Tier 1 workloads or large data center migrations or serverless usage which would enable that?","And separate from that, Amy, I'm curious just philosophically. How do you plan to handle price cuts for compute and storage when they occur? Do you think you're better off matching them, exceeding them, or does it make sense perhaps warranting a premium in many cases due to the differentiated IP that you have up the stack?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah, let me start. Overall, I think some of the trends that you've referenced, whether it's Tier 1 workloads or serverless or even complete data center migrations, all of that is happening. Even the customer examples I gave, they were littered with example after example.","For example, in FinServ, some very Tier 1 trading applications now using some of our capabilities in service fabric, which is really a PaaS service, which allows you to manage microservices with low latency and high scale, that's a place where we are seeing in fact activity, whether it's game development or trading applications. We are seeing even interesting use cases of Azure functions, which is completely serverless. In fact, you can think of it as a price cut for anybody who cares about being very, very smart about cloud consumption. Going serverless is something that we in fact advocate.","So across the board, I feel we have the right mix of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and per user SaaS services like Azure Active Directory, which gives us the right mix to be able to even have the right margins long term. We're not concentrated in any one layer of the stack, which is something we do by design because our vision has always been that we want to of course offer all of these layers, and customers will choose depending on their needs and their scenarios. And we are now seeing even a single customer estate spanning all of these.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And, Mark, I'm not sure I want to get into our pricing theory on the call on a go-forward basis in terms of whether or not we match competitors. But what I would say is really fundamentally related to Satya's point around differentiation of the entire stack and what customers are doing in their digital estate. And the ability to earn margin through that is actually more impactful than whether or not you match pricing at the core.","Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Mark. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, congrats on finishing up a great quarter as well. One for you, Amy, and one for you, Satya. One, Amy, when I look at your comments on gross margin, clearly you're not in a position to break out Azure-only gross margin. But I'm wondering if we can take a composite of (52:37) your commercial cloud. Targets are about $20 billion. So if I take what I believe could be a rough split between Azure versus the SaaS segment and look at the best-of-breed companies, I could get about 70% \u2013 75% gross margin when you hit your targets. I'm curious what you think about that. Is that too aggressive or within the ballpark?","And for you, Satya, as cloud computing moves to the enterprise, there's some belief among investors that AWS is going be a big, strong competitor in the enterprise, which is typically not a stronghold for them. How do we think of Microsoft's enduring strength in the enterprise? And how confident can we be that you should be able to capture your fair share of enterprise workloads as they move to the cloud? Thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Let me start with the second part, and then you can add.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Yes.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","So, Kash, the way I think about it is, even in the client server era, we had tough competition. We had Oracle. We had VMware, and we had many other players we competed with and I grew up competing with. And we now have AWS I think who is going to be a credible competitor. So I feel that, as I said, we have a cloud strategy that is not just about infrastructure. It is about really SaaS and infrastructure. And we want to uniquely think about what are the things that we can do to differentiate and add value to our customers' digital estate in the cloud in that context. And that's where, if you will, our fair share will come from by competing hard where we have to but also mostly thinking about differentiation.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And in terms of is there a long-term gross margin cloud number that is industry-leading, I think right now there's a benchmark in the SaaS community that's probably around the number you talked about in terms of more SaaS applications. And then as you go down through the layers from PaaS to IaaS, that margin declines, obviously much as it did when that was run as a hardware solution. The margins weren't as high either. And so I do think it will be a blend of those. But certainly at the SaaS end, I understand where you get that benchmark from.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Great. Thank you, Kash. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Just wanted to focus back in on Office 365 on the commercial front. You had another strong quarter of revenue growth obviously at 49% constant currency, but it continues to meaningfully outpace the seat growth, which is still strong, about 37%. So that commentary that you all had given about premium mix in the past, two questions here. First to Satya, when you think about where we are in the progression, call it up to E5 so to speak or E3, how do you think this plays out? And how do you think about the mix of unit growth versus that premium mix and translating it to revenue?","And then to Amy, I guess I'd argue that maybe we've done the low margin or low gross margin parts of the Office 365 transition. And now as this mix goes up, you're actually not just increasing revenue, but the margin is better too. Is that fair? And then how do you tie that back to your commercial cloud gross margin expectations long term?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah. I can start. On the product side, we think of actually three things we are trying to do on a continuous basis in Office 365. First, even for the customers who are already on Office 365 at any given licensing level, we focus quite a bit on their increased usage and intensity. So for example, one of the comments I made in my remarks was, for example, SharePoint with PowerApps and Flow. That's to us to the best way for us to keep having that recurring value. And so we focus quite a bit on adding additional value even to the existing licensing levels and increasing intensity of usage.","Then things like what we are doing to even go to non-knowledge worker audiences in retail or in manufacturing with some of the things that we're doing with staff scheduling for example. That's a way to expand seats even beyond what is the traditional knowledge worker. Of course, we have significant more opportunity in small and medium sized businesses, although we have had good healthy growth there. I think seat growth will come more from material increases internationally as well as with some of the regulated segments of the market finally moving to the cloud. Those are all opportunities ahead.","And then the last one of course is the new value in things like E5 with voice or analytics and security. So all those three dimensions, there will be variability quarter to quarter in terms of what's happening. But in terms of our investments in that core product value, it is actually happening on all those three.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And to your point on where we are and what's driving that delta and its consistency, frankly, over time, actually still the biggest impact is from the transition to E3. Transitions take time. And so you're just starting to see some of the impact from E5. We're excited about all the customers in trial and are already starting to use the value, whether it's security, increasingly analytics, and ultimately voice. But really from an ARPU perspective, the biggest driver continues to be the transition to E3.","And so then that leads to your question on do you continue to believe there's some margin expansion possible as you add newer and higher value workloads. And of course, the answer to that is we do believe that, but it certainly comes over a period of time and run through our annuity base over that pace.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Great, thank you, Phil. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillian with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much and congratulations from me as well, two questions, one for Amy first. When we look at CapEx, it actually declined year over year ex-capital leases, but even with capital leases the growth rate decelerated. And for the full year, it's obviously a pretty wide range, roughly zero to 40% growth. I'm just curious, Amy. With LinkedIn, have you made any changes to your CapEx assumptions for core Microsoft? And I guess I'm pointing to the fact that it did seem to decelerate quite a lot this quarter. And I wondered if there's any additional color you could frame around the growth rate for all-up CapEx plus capital leases. Thanks.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Sure. Let me first comment on that I've said it will be lower than it was previously. I certainly would help you in that number and say a little lower, just so that you're getting into something closer. I realize zero to 40% is not as helpful.","I would also say that it does tend to be lumpy, and it's why I don't give very specific guidance every single quarter, and it was not at all impacted by LinkedIn. Our real goal for LinkedIn is \u2013 over time of course I'm sure they'll want to take advantage as we build new services together of some of our infrastructure assets. But in the short term, the most important thing is they continue to add value and usage and great experience for their members. And so I have really no intention of messing with that in terms of capital expenditures in the short and next six months for sure. So I think what you're seeing in terms of year over year and what does it mean for next year, this next quarter, it will be a sequential increase, but again, it is a bit lumpy.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Okay. Thank you, Ross.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","We'll have time for one more question, please, operator.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in and congratulations as well. I wanted to ask on Windows 10. Satya, you talked at the beginning about customers starting to adopt it, and you mentioned three large ones already. Can you talk a little bit about that cycle and how you see everything that's unfolding and what the customer feedback is in terms of their intention to adopt it now versus waiting for a little bit? Thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","I think the overall adoption cycle of Windows 10 in the enterprise is perhaps the best that we have seen in the enterprise for any new release of Windows, and primarily driven by security and manageability of the new Windows, and that's what's been the driver.","But in addition to that, I must say there are two other things that are increasingly becoming fairly relevant in the adoption cycle, which is moving to both Office 365 and Windows 10 and getting essentially to this new frontier for productivity, which is an always up-to-date operating system, which is secure, and an always up-to-date Office experience that is a SaaS service. We're increasingly seeing that resonate, not just in small business and some of the high-tech industry as it has been in the past, but now even in the regulated parts of the enterprise. So we are very excited about that.","The other piece also that's driving is hardware innovation by the entire ecosystem. In fact, the work that we did with the Surface line has really stimulated the entire ecosystem to do some of the best innovative work, and you saw that even at CES.

Chris, please proceed.","Chris Suh - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel.","On our website, microsoft.com\/investor, we have posted a document summarizing our quarterly results, as well as a slide deck, which is intended to follow the quarterly results document and provide a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Please keep in mind that all growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last year. Unless otherwise specified, all impacted numbers have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of last year\u2019s revenue deferrals and recognition related to the Windows Upgrade Offer, the Office Deferral, the Video Game Deferral, and the expense related to the non-tax deductible European Commission Fine. As a reminder, in our segment reporting structure, we have consolidated revenue adjustments of this nature into Corporate and Other to provide better comparability of operating results.","We will post this call\u2019s prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today\u2019s call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft Investor Relations website until April 24, 2015.","During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today\u2019s earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Satya.","Satya Nadella - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Chris. It\u2019s great to have the opportunity to join today\u2019s call. From my first day, I have said I am committed to an ongoing dialogue with investors. Joining these investor calls going forward is going to be a big part of that, and I am enthusiastic about today\u2019s call. It\u2019s been an incredibly busy couple of months. In addition to executing on our plan and announcing new products and services, I have spent a lot of time gathering feedback and exchanging ideas with customers, partners, employees and investors. It is important and valuable to see the company with a fresh perspective to get grounded both our current realities and future opportunities.","As I have told our employees, our industry does not respect tradition, it only respects innovation. This applies to us and everyone else. When I think about our industry over the next 5, 10 years, I see a world where computing is more ubiquitous and all experiences are powered by ambient intelligence. Silicon, hardware systems and software will co-evolve together and give birth to a variety of new form factors. Nearly everything we do will become more digitized, our interactions with other people, with machines and between machines. The ability to reason over and draw insights from everything that\u2019s been digitized will improve the fidelity of our daily experiences and interactions. This is the mobile-first and cloud-first world. It\u2019s a rich canvas for innovation and a great growth opportunity for Microsoft across all our customer segments.","To thrive in this world, we will continue to zero in on the things customers really value and Microsoft can uniquely deliver. We want to build products that people love to use. And as a result, you will see us increasingly focus on usage as the leading indicator of long-term success. To that end, we are already making progress.","Amy will provide additional detail, but I wanted to say a few words about the quarter itself. Today\u2019s results demonstrate the breadth and strength of our overall business. We saw strong momentum in cloud services. Our commercial cloud business more than doubled year-over-year with Office 365 and Azure both performing extremely well. Business customers continue to make Windows their overwhelming platform of choice, with solid growth in both Windows Pro and Windows volume licensing revenues. We saw continued improvement in search, with our U.S. search share growing to 18.6% and search revenue increasing by 38%. Bing continues to deliver platform capabilities across our products. One recent example of this is the recently announced Cortana virtual assistant for Windows Phone. And very importantly, across all our businesses we continued to have a rigorous focus on execution and cost discipline, resulting in solid revenue and earnings per share.","I sum up this quarter in two words execution and transition. We delivered solid financial results and we took several steps to reorient Microsoft. In recent weeks, we talked about how we are advancing Office, Windows and our data platform and how we think holistically about the constituencies we serve IT, developers and people at the center in a mobile first cloud, first world. We will continue to invest in our cloud capabilities including Office 365 and Azure in the fast growing SaaS and cloud platform markets. We are committed to ensuring that our cloud services are available across all device platforms that people use. We are delivering a cloud for everyone on every device. At the same time, we have bold plans to move Windows forward. We are investing and innovating in every dimension from form-factor to software experiences to price. Windows platform is unique in how it brings together consistent end user experiences across small to large screens, broadest platform opportunity for developers and control and assurance for IT. And with the addition of Nokia\u2019s talented people and their depth in mobile technologies we will enhance our device capabilities.","The past two and a half months have been a period of significant change at Microsoft, but also a period of nailing the basics and delivering against our product and financial plans. In the months ahead, we will continue to be intensely be focused on two things rock-solid execution and pivoting the company towards the future. We will continue to push hard and move quickly and you will see the proof of that month after month in the products and services we build for the mobile-first, cloud-first world. What you can expect of Microsoft is courage in the face of reality. We will approach our future with a challenger mindset. We will be bold in our innovation. We will be accountable to our customers, partners and shareholders.","And with that, I will turn it over to Amy to go further into the details of our quarter. And then we will be happy to take your questions after that.","Amy Hood - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Satya and good afternoon everyone. Let me start with a few things I think are notable this quarter. Then, I will give our outlook before moving on to Q&A. We had a very good third quarter with solid results across our businesses and strong momentum in our most strategic areas. At the same time we remained focused and disciplined in our spending. Total revenue was $20.4 billion, up 8%, and earnings per share grew 5%. We had outstanding momentum and results in our cloud services. As Satya mentioned, Commercial Cloud revenue more than doubled again this quarter. Office 365 is now on an annual revenue run rate of $2.5 billion and Azure revenue grew over 150%, driven by both new customers and increased usage.","In our Office 365 Home service, we added nearly 1 million new users this quarter and now have over 4.4 million subscribers. We continued to enhance its value proposition with new features, premium services and cross platform functionality. As we cross the one year anniversary since launch, we are pleased with the renewal rates we are experiencing thus far. With Bing, we made clear progress again this quarter. We grew our U.S. share and improved RPS significantly. Display revenue related to portal and email declined, while we saw ad revenue growth in products like Skype and Xbox.","Importantly, we are innovating while expanding our cloud gross margins through both improved scale and continuous engineering efforts to drive efficiency. Businesses are clearly expressing their overwhelming preference for Windows. Windows Pro revenue grew 19% driven by growth in business PCs, mix shift to developed markets where attach is higher, continued strength in the enterprise, and an increased mix of Pro in small and medium businesses. Windows Volume Licensing also had a solid 11% revenue growth. Windows XP End of Support contributed in part to this growth we saw this quarter as did a general hardware refresh."," ","Our commercial results reflect ongoing strength and we again outperformed the enterprise IT market. Customer movement from transactional purchasing to subscriptions and multi-year agreements was better than our expectations. Therefore, our commercial unearned revenue grew 12% this quarter, which was above our expectations and our contracted not billed balance exceeded $22 billion. We had double-digit growth in SQL, System Center, Windows Server Premium and Lync. Clearly, our value proposition and product roadmap is resonating.","Xbox One has sold in over 5 million units since launch and engagement has been high with users spending nearly 5 hours per day on their console. We will continue to extend the unique entertainment value proposition of Xbox One, particularly in markets outside of the U.S. where some services aren\u2019t as mature. Xbox 360 sales exceeded our expectations this quarter. And across the platform, Xbox Live members continued to embrace the service with transactional revenue growing 17%. We do expect to work through some inventory in Q4. We continue to enhance the value proposition of Surface through both hardware and software innovation, which makes Surface one of the best high value productivity devices available. This quarter, the mix of sales moved to our second generation and Pro devices. And this change had a positive impact on gross margin.","Now, let\u2019s turn to operating expenses. As a result of our ongoing prioritization efforts, OpEx was favorable to what we expected in January. Across the company, we are focused on continually aligning our resources to our top priorities, which includes investing in the next wave of innovation for our customers. We are devoting resources to our sales team and partner ecosystems to ensure they are positioned for the migration to cloud services. And finally, our agility is also improving. As planned, marketing spend was redeployed from Q3 to Q4 in support of a commercial cloud campaign.","With that summary of Q3 results, I would like to talk about our outlook. Given the Nokia Devices and Services transaction is closing tomorrow, the guidance I will walk through next excludes any related impact. Let\u2019s start with Devices and Consumer. In licensing, we expect revenue to be $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. This range reflects an expectation that the benefits of XP End of Support will moderate. In hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in what is a seasonally slower hardware quarter. This number also reflects channel inventory drawdown for Xbox consoles. In devices and consumer other, we expect revenue to be about $1.9 billion. We expect to see continued growth in Office 365 Home and Bing as we drive additional usage.","Moving on to commercial, we expect revenue across our two segments to be $13.1 billion to $13.3 billion. Within this, we expect commercial other revenue to be about $2.1 billion on the strength of the transition to our cloud. And in Corporate, we expect to defer revenue of about $100 million. We expect COGS to be $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion, with variability primarily due to hardware.","And moving on to operating expenses. For the fourth quarter, we expect OpEx to be $8.4 billion to $8.6 billion when adjusting for the prior year European Commission Fine. This represents full year operating expense growth of about 4%. This is on the low end of our original guidance that we provided a year ago of 4% to 6%, as we invested in R&D and sales efforts while rationalizing our marketing spend. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. We expect these items to generally offset each other.","We expect a higher tax rate in Q4 and the full year tax rate to be between 18% and 20%. We expect capital expenditure to be about $1.5 billion as we build out our cloud infrastructure. We are concentrating on hardware, software and datacenter optimization and supply chain efficiencies to maximize the benefits of our cloud scale. The benefits of this work are realized in improving gross margins. We expect unearned revenue to grow in line with normal seasonality.","Now, let me share some thoughts regarding Nokia Devices and Services. The acquisition will close tomorrow, which is about four months later than the deal economics we outlined in September assumed. Since then, the Nokia business results have also changed. We are focused on the transition from planning to implementation which accelerates with the deal closing tomorrow. Given this is a complex body of work that will take time we do not intend to update our financial guidance for any Nokia impacts during the quarter. However, I want to share the following to help as you update your models.","Under the existing commercial agreement between Microsoft and Nokia, license sales and platform payments are reported in the D&C Licensing segment. Once the acquisition closes, results for Nokia Devices and Services will be reported in the D&C Hardware segment. For Q4, we will clearly show the impact of the ending of the commercial agreement, Nokia\u2019s ongoing operations and any one-time integration and severance costs. And we remain committed to achieving annual cost synergy targets of at least $600 million within 18 months of close.","Now, looking towards fiscal 15, Satya and I, along with the rest of the senior leadership team are working together to solidify our plans for the year ahead. Our goals are clear get more out of the tremendous resources we have available, drive innovation in products that people love to use and execute in areas where Microsoft can uniquely succeed in today\u2019s mobile-first, cloud-first world.","And with that, let me turn it back over to Chris and we can move to Q&A.","Chris Suh - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thanks Amy. And with that we will move to Q&A. Operator please go ahead and repeat your instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Brent Thill - UBS","Good afternoon. Question for Satya, just if can reflect on your initial time as CEO and maybe give everyone a sense of how you prioritized your near-term objectives here in the next several quarters that would be helpful? Thank you.","Satya Nadella","Thank you, Brent. The first 10 weeks or so have been extremely energizing and as I have said for me what was important to us to reach out, talk to lots of different constituents and relearn the place and see it for the first time and just get a different fresh perspective even in spite of having spent 22 years here it\u2019s been fascinating to get that fresh perspective. And the way I look at it is even from day one I have had this deep conviction that our vision is about being going boldly into this mobile-first, cloud-first world. And we feel that we are well on our way and if there is anything that I want to do is how do we make sure we would remain focused on it with every device launch, with every service launch we keep coming back and reinforcing that vision, because at the end of the day, it\u2019s the purpose with which we approached the vision and the execution behind it which is what counts. And to me being able to think about that deeply what does it means for us culturally, what does it mean for us in terms of our plans. And then just getting behind it, leaning into it as an entire company is what\u2019s my priority and that\u2019s what I obsess about, that\u2019s what I focus about.","Chris Suh","Thank you, Brent. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you very much. Satya welcome on board and thanks for joining on the call. If you don\u2019t mind I am going to ask an overall question either of Amy or of Satya. Looking at commercial license business, how much of the shrinkage year-over-year in commercial license is driven by the move of traditional license players from license or license paying customers from license to the cloud, how much is related to guys moving from software assurance, how much from license, can you give any color on that?","Amy Hood","Thanks Mark for that question. Why don\u2019t I take that one, overall in commercial licensing I often talk as you know about the commercial business all up, mostly because I think some of the core dynamics really reinforce that we see a bit of what you are talking about, which is that renewal rates have remained high and in line. Our ability to recapture revenue in those contracts remains strong and our ability to attach cloud products has grown. And so what we see in this quarter and what you see even in the commercial licensing line itself is that continued switch. And in fact it was faster this quarter than we had thought. Really, when you look at our commercial on our revenue along with the C&B balance that we talked about last quarter, we have so many billings at the end of last quarter when you really normalized for those in the quarter billings, bookings were also better than we had expected in terms of the annuity stream. So, I think both a transition to long-term agreements is encouraging, the addition to premium product, the addition of new product as well as the transition to a cloud is really core to thinking about the health of the segment all up.","Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Amy Hood","Thanks Mark.","Chris Suh","Next question please operator?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","Actually, thank you for taking my question guys. And Satya, again, thank you for joining the call, it\u2019s great to have your views and inputs here. One of the questions I get most often from investors is trying to understand sort of how you are going to approach the role and what you are doing initially in terms of is there a strategic review that\u2019s going on? Are you reviewing the businesses? And should we expect any big changes in the strategy of Microsoft? So I am going to pose that question to you, in terms of over the next couple of weeks, months, quarters, even is there anything of a strategic review going on? Is there any big changes in the Microsoft strategy that we should be expecting from that review?","Satya Nadella","Thanks Keith for the question. The framework I have in terms of how I am approaching my job and how we as a leadership team and as a company are going to execute and plan, because one of the things that I strongly believe in is you are planning on a continuous basis, you are executing on a continuous basis. It\u2019s not episodic if you will. The only way we are going to succeed here is by having this notion that you are planning all the time and you are also making the changes to your plan based on the change circumstances. And I think that\u2019s the way to run a company like ours in a marketplace that\u2019s as dynamic as ours. But that said, I start with though a vision that\u2019s very grounded on what the future opportunity is. So this mobile-first cloud-first thing is a pretty deep thing for us. When we say mobile-first, in fact what we mean by that is mobility first. We think about users and their experiences spanning a variety of devices. So it\u2019s not about any one form factor that may have some share position today, but as we look to the future, what are the set of experiences across devices, some ours and some not ours that we can power through experiences that we can create uniquely. So that notion of having a central focus and the central purpose is what, I think we have already signaled and we are well on our way to execute on it.","Now you also need to continuously build some new capability. When you think about mobility first, that means you need to have really deep understanding of all the mobile scenarios for everything from how communications happen, how meetings occur. And those require us to build new capability. We will do some of this organically, some of it inorganically. A good example of this is what we have done with Nokia. So we will \u2013 obviously we are looking forward to that team joining us building on the capability and then execution, even in the last three weeks or so we have announced a bunch of things where we talked about this one cloud for everyone and every device. We talked about how our data platform is going to enable this data culture, which is in fact fundamentally changing how Microsoft itself works.","We always talked about what it means to think about Windows, especially with the launch of this universal Windows application model. How different it is now to think about Windows as one family, which was not true before, but now we have a very different way to think about it. And so we are well on our way to execute on it, but your core question of are we going to review, we are all of the timing reviewing. And one of the things that I feel as the leadership team we have really picked up the pace on asking the hard questions, what is the believability of any of our plans and pushing ourselves, because at the end of the day to me, I want to be very accountable to you all to our customers, to our partners as a team by executing on our plans very well, because at the end of the day that\u2019s what matters. But so that at least gives you a framework for how we are approaching it.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","Excellent. Thank you very much for that.","Amy Hood","Thanks Keith.","Chris Suh","Thank you. Next question, please operator.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.","Rick Sherlund - Nomura","Thanks. First Satya on Platform-as-a-Service I am kind of curious how aggressively you plan to maybe change your business model to a subscription model and drive kind of like Adobe did, less upfront revenue, more encouraging subscription and cloud based and whether we should begin to anticipate what it might look like to Microsoft as you make this transition to more of a subscription business, I am just not sure what the margins are on your cloud business. And as you transition most SaaS companies have 70%, 80% gross margins, I am not real sure where you are on your cloud businesses today. Do we think this is going to be a smooth transition or might we expect it to be a little more disruptive as you gain more and more traction on a subscription in cloud basis?","Satya Nadella","Great Rick. Thanks for the question. I will start and maybe Amy you want to even add. The way I look at it Rick we are well on our way to making that transition, in terms of moving from pure licenses to long-term contracts and as well as subscription business model. So when you talked about Platform-as-a-Service if you look at our commercial cloud it\u2019s made up of the platform itself which is Azure. We also have a SaaS business in Office 365. Now, one of the things that we want to make sure we look at is each of the constituent parts because the margin profile on each one of these things is going to different. The infrastructure elements right now in particular is going to have different economics versus some of the per-user applications in a SaaS mode have. It\u2019s the blending of all of that that matters and the growth of that matters to us the most in this time where I think there is just a couple of us really playing in this market. I mean this is gold rush time in some sense of being able to capitalize on the opportunity. And when it comes to that we have some of the best, the broadest SaaS solution and the broadest platform solution and that combination of those assets doesn\u2019t come often. So what we are very focused on is how do we make sure we get our customer aggressively into this, having them use our service, be successful with it. And then there will be a blended set of margins across even just our cloud. And what matters to me in the long run is the magnitude of profit we generate given a lot of categories are going to be merged as this transition happens. And we have to be able to actively participate in it and drive profit growth.","Amy Hood","And let me add a bit Rick. I think specifically as you think about the transitions and where you will see it. First, I would say year-over-year we had flat to improving gross margins in all segments but hardware, where we had a mix shift to the Xbox console, which from our business model perspective obviously drives gross margin decline. With that being said, within the Office 365 business, I will start from the fact and a principle which is having a user whether they be in the consumer or in the enterprise have access to our most recent, most innovative, most secure product which is always going to be for us probably the one born in the cloud will be a driver of satisfaction and a driver of usage. Those two things lead to revenue. You are already seeing that transition in the enterprise where we already sold that way. The transition is quite easy from an economic standpoint. In the transactional business you saw the impact of it this quarter. We had a bigger mix shift to annuity more went on the balance sheet. We still had strong growth, but you do see the impact inter-quarter. And in the consumer side of the business which you also referenced with Adobe, I think we have just launched another SKU in addition to Home called Personal as we continue to drive consumer usage that way. The launch of Office on the iPad is an example of where we will add the most value which is in the subscription.","Chris Suh","Thank you, Rick. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you. And Satya I will echo everybody\u2019s thoughts but it\u2019s great to have you on the call and share your perspective. I was wondering if you could share with us the decision recently to offer Windows for free for sub 9-inch devices and how you think this impacts your share in that arena? And also how should we think about Windows pricing, given your comment about how Windows is going to kind of play in different market segmentations, how do we see Windows pricing evolving, if at all, for other types of form factors over time?","Satya Nadella","Overall, first of all, thanks Heather for the question. Overall, the way I want us to look at Windows going forward is what does it mean to have the broadest device family and ecosystem? Because at the end of the day it\u2019s about the users and developer opportunity we create for the entirety of the family. That\u2019s going to define the health of the ecosystem. So, to me, it matters that we approach the various segments that we now participate with Windows, because that\u2019s what has happened. Fundamentally, we participated in the PC market. Now we are in a market that\u2019s much bigger than the PC market. We continue to have healthy share, healthy pricing and in fact growth as we mentioned in the enterprise adoption of Windows.","And that\u2019s we plan to in fact add more value, more management, more security, especially as things are changing in those segments. Given BYOD and software security issues, we want to be able to reinforce that core value, but then when it comes to new opportunities from wearables to internet of things, we want to be able to participate on all of this with our Windows offering, with our tools around it. And we want to be able to price by category. And that\u2019s effectively what we did. We looked at what it makes \u2013 made sense for us to do on tablets and phones below 9 inches and we felt that the price there needed to be changed. We have monetization vehicles on the back end for those. And that\u2019s how we are going to approach each one of these opportunities, because in a world of ubiquitous computing, we want Windows to be ubiquitous. That doesn\u2019t mean its one price, one business model for all of that. And it\u2019s actually a market expansion opportunity and that\u2019s the way we are going to go execute on it.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Okay, thank you.","Chris Suh","Operator, next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","John DiFucci - JPMorgan","Great, thank you and welcome Satya. I am going to give Amy a question here for numbers. Amy, we see our sales and marketing expense declined 7% year-over-year in this quarter. Can you remind us if there is anything unique last year or is this just better controls? And along these same lines free cash flow, excluding acquisitions grew 2%, which is a bit of a surprise, given the direction the company is going and the first time in seven quarters we have actually seen growth in free cash flow. So, can you tell us how we should be thinking about this going forward?","Amy Hood","Thanks, John. I was getting lonely. I didn\u2019t have any questions. So I appreciate it. Let me start with your first one, which was there any sort of unique thing that resulted in that comparable in sales and marketing. We didn\u2019t have more a launch expense going on a year ago, but we also focused on rationalizing and focusing our marketing dollars in quarter. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I think it\u2019s a combination of both. And I would probably say more of the latter, which is really thinking and prioritizing more effectively throughout the year to earn the highest ROI on the dollars we are spending. We also did invest in sales year-over-year. So most of that is specifically around marketing, so I want to make sure that you understand that where we see opportunity, we are investing in our selling engine to get it, which is, I think an important caveat to make sure is clear when you see year-over-year sales and marketing decline. The second half of that, in terms of cash flow, I think as we remain focused on prioritizing and really thinking about the return on the dollars we spend, you did see also as I talked about earlier margins increase year-over-year. All of that had a positive impact on cash flow.","John DiFucci - JPMorgan","And going forward, should we \u2013 how should we be thinking about that, just continued discipline I guess around expenses, but also investment where it\u2019s needed?","Amy Hood","Yes, I think when we talked at the end about how I think about \u201815 maybe it\u2019s a better set of how we think about everyday, which is what can we do today, this week, this month to better invest behind places where we feel like we are uniquely capable of success and not being afraid to make those changes and finding the agility and the empowerment here to do those things is incredibly important. And I would say culturally Satya mentioned about being more data driven. I think in addition to the day-to-day, which was more focused on customers, I think really it\u2019s a cultural statement about how we are going operate more internally as well. And so maybe that\u2019s the most forward-looking comment I could tell you which is that being empowered to look weekly, monthly and see how we can get better and better and better. And I think that\u2019s actually driven a lot of excitement around here.","John DiFucci - JPMorgan","Okay, great. Thank you.","Chris Suh","Thanks John. We will move to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse","Hi. Thanks guys and congrats on a great quarter and Satya great to have you on the call as well. I wanted to focus in on Office 365 I mean if you compared this quarter to last quarter you added 1.1 million Home Premium users, last quarter I think it was 500,000. In September you talked about run rate of I think $1.5 billion, now you are $2.5 million. I wonder if you can just talk about the momentum that you are seeing in Office 365 and maybe give us your thoughts on sort of business versus the home\/consumer side of that. And then Amy when you think about Office 365, how do you think about the difference in sort of lifetime value of an Office 365 customer versus a traditional Office user?","Satya Nadella","Let me start and then Amy you should definitely add on to it. Office 365 I am really, really excited about what\u2019s happening there, which is to me this is the core engine that\u2019s driving a lot of our cloud adoption and you see it in the numbers and Amy will talk more about the numbers. But one of the fundamental things its also doing is it\u2019s actually a SaaS application and it\u2019s also an architecture for enterprises. And one of the most salient things we announced when we talked about the cloud for everyone and every device and we talked about Office 365 having now iPad apps, we also launched something called the enterprise mobility suite which is perhaps one of the most strategic things during that day that we announced which was that we now have a consistent and deep platform for identity management which by the way gets bootstrapped every time Office 365 users sign up, device management and data protection, which is really what every enterprise customer needs in a mobile-first world, in a world where you have SaaS application adoption and you have BYOD or bring your own devices happening. So to me the Office 365 growth is in fact driving our enterprise infrastructure growth which is driving Azure growth and that cycle to me is most exciting. So that\u2019s one of the reasons why I want to have to keep indexing on the usage of all of this and the growth numbers you see is a reflection of that.","Amy Hood","And Phil, specifically to some of your \u2013 how do we think about the lifetime value, maybe I will use the consumer actually SKUs which you started with as a good example. First, whenever we launch a new machine, a new SKU in this instance especially a subscription. I do think it takes some time both for the customer to understand the value proposition as well as the retailers and partners to really hone their motion, to pivot, to selling a new subscription model I think you are starting to see some of the acceleration as well as increasing awareness of the product which I think is terrific. And maybe more importantly as we think about the value we are adding the Office on the iPad announcement certainly brought attention as we continue to drive people to the subscription. And I made a comment around renewal rates and we are happy with them as we have just sort of passed the one year anniversary of the launch. And I think when you look at the LTV we will be better off for many reasons including financially. When a person moves to the subscription, my deep belief is the most important thing we will do is continue to think about how we can modernize, add features, add innovation so that it\u2019s more valuable to them everyday they use it. And that is far easier in a cloud world than it is on premise. And so I think that\u2019s probably the most important driver of LTV long-term.","Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse","Thanks guys.","Amy Hood","Thanks Phil.","Chris Suh","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","Hi, thanks. Amy, just a question for you. I know you\u2019re not providing updated guidance for Nokia. I\u2019m just wondering maybe a little bit of thought behind that decision, I know the deal closes tomorrow, you probably could easily move things around here a bit and reported on early next week and how that benefit? Is the lack of guidance there, is it just simply you haven\u2019t been able to get your hands into that business at this point? Is there something else that changed in that business? Just trying to get a sense because it does sort of open up quite a bit of variability in terms of how people are going to model things over the next three months?","Amy Hood","Thanks, Walter. It really wasn\u2019t a choice. The reality is we\u2019ve not had the type of access on tool close where we could confidently begin to give the type of guidance that I believe we have come and you have come to expect from us in terms of the depth and analysis required to get there. They do report the different accounting system; it needs to be converted to GAAP. We\u2019ve not had access to forward projection; I haven\u2019t had a deep access to their system and so until we get that which really starts tomorrow. It\u2019s not really a question of whether it was this week or next week, it\u2019s really a question of us getting the confidence and access to be able to report at the level of details I know you all would expect me to do.","Satya Nadella","Thanks, Walter. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank","Yes, hi thanks. I\u2019d like to focus on that server product revenue number of 10% and Satya I think you know a thing or two about this group so perhaps I\u2019ll direct that to you. But that growth rate is so far still above what a lot of your mega-cap tech vendors, peers I should say are posting. And I just wanted to ask you if you could try to outline for us the couple of factors that have enabled Microsoft to continue growing that server business well above your peers? And secondly if you think that kind of 10% ish growth is sustainable over fiscal 2015?","Satya Nadella","Thanks, Karl. So I\u2019ll start in fact both Amy and I looked on that business. So we\u2019ll both take a crack at it. It\u2019s a pretty exciting change that\u2019s happening, obviously it\u2019s that part of the business is performing very well for a while now, but quite frankly it\u2019s fundamentally changing. One of the questions I often get asked is hey how did Windows server and the hypervisor underneath it becomes so good so soon. You\u2019ve been at it for a long time but there seems to have something fundamentally changed I mean we\u2019ve grown a lot of share recently, the product is more capable than it ever was, the rate of change is different and for one reason alone which is we use it to run Azure. So the fact that we use our servers to run our cloud makes our servers more competitive for other people to build their own cloud.","So it\u2019s the same trend that\u2019s accelerating us on both sides. The other thing that\u2019s happening is when we sell our server products they for most part are just not isolated anymore. They come with automatic cloud tiering. SQL server is a great example. We just launched a new version of SQL which is by far the best release of SQL in terms of its features like it\u2019s exploitation of in-memory. It\u2019s the first product in the database world that has in-memory for all the three workloads of databases, OLTP, data warehousing and BI. But more importantly it automatically gives you high availability which means a lot to every CIO and every enterprise deployment by actually tiering to the cloud.","So those kinds of feature innovation which is pretty boundary less for us is breakthrough work. It\u2019s not something that somebody who has been a traditional competitor of ours can do if you\u2019re not even a first class producer of a public cloud service. So I think that we\u2019re in a very unique place. Our ability to deliver this hybrid value proposition and be in a position, where we not only run a cloud service at scale, but we also provide the infrastructure underneath it as the server products to others. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving the growth. The shape of that growth and so on will change over time, but I feel very, very bullish about our ability to continue this innovation.","Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank","Great. Thank you.","Satya Nadella","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","Ed Maguire - CLSA","Hi, good afternoon and it\u2019s great to hear you Satya on the call. I had a question about the device and consumer licensing. First of all the Windows Pro revenue is very strong and Amy I know you had alluded to receding impact of XP upgrades, but I wanted to get a sense of how sustainable you think that growth can continue? And also noticing that the particularly Office Consumer revenue is improving on attach rates and there had been a bit of a disconnect there because of the transition to Office 365. Wanted to get your thoughts on how long that might be sustainable or whether this is related to sort of the broader XP expiration? Thank you.","Amy Hood","Thanks, Ed. Let me take those in reverse actually. On the Office Consumer performance I will always first and foremost think about the combination of Office 365 Home as well as our consumer performance. And that grew obviously at a higher rate than 15% that we talked about this quarter that and increasing attach. There were some dynamics this quarter that I think were important. Some stabilizing that we\u2019ve seen in the consumer developed world PC market also benefits as you might imagine our Office business. We have the highest attach rates in developed markets and so that tends to be an important driver of Office revenue whether earned as a license or as a subscription.","The second thing is related a bit to your first question. These are \u2013 it\u2019s sort of hard to separate oftentimes made the dynamics in our market. As we\u2019ve seen Pro, Windows Pro mix increase, for example in small business, when people buy PCs with Windows Pro they\u2019re more likely to purchase a form of Office whether it would be a subscription or a license. That\u2019s another dynamic you saw this quarter. A final dynamic that I\u2019ll talk about relating to Office was around Japan. We did see some pull-forward due to the tax increase and so that did have an impact on Office Consumer growth, but even without that as we talked about we still had increasing attach and very good performance for the quarter.","Now backing up because it\u2019s complicated was the Windows sustainability and in the business segment. As we said it\u2019s very hard to separate cleanly the impact of XP from what is an improving business PC refresh cycle as well as some positive macro-economic trends that we\u2019re seeing. So as I said my comments \u2013 the end of XP does create a bit of a moderation in growth. That being said the differentiation and value proposition of Pro is clearer than it has been. The investment in that SKU and the value proposition of Pro has had mix increasing within segments of the market. For example in small business and in the enterprise for people who buy Windows PC. And so I think that\u2019s an important dynamic that we\u2019ll continue to invest in and we\u2019re excited to say.","Ed Maguire - CLSA","Thank you.","Satya Nadella","Thanks, Ed. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays","Thanks for taking my question. Question for Satya as we think about the new world in terms of more usage and more software driven rather than device driven. Can you talk a little bit how you want to reengage or further engage with the developer community with the big theme of your presentation at Build? I noticed (indiscernible) submarine was kind of mentioned by a lot of guys and saw a lot of attention. But talk a little bit about that, how the developer community is really important for you and what you\u2019re doing around that to kind of get the software future of Microsoft going again?","Satya Nadella","Great. So thanks for the question. Developers are very, very important to us. If you\u2019re in the platform business which we\u2019re on both on the device side as well as on the cloud side, developers and their ability to create new value props and new applications on them is sort of likes itself. I would say couple of things. One is the announcements we made at Build on the device side is really our breakthrough worked for us which is we\u2019re the only device platform today that has this notion of building universal apps with fantastic tooling around them. So that means you can target multiple of our devices and have common code across all of them. And this notion of having a Windows universal application help developers leverage them core asset, which is their core asset across this expanded opportunity is huge. There was this one user experience change that Terry Myerson talked about at Build, which expands the ability for anyone who puts up application in Windows Store to be now discovered across even the billion plus PC installed base. And so that\u2019s I think a fantastic opportunity to developers and we are doing everything to make that opportunity clear and recruit developers to do more with Windows. And in that context, we will also support cross platforms. So this has been one of the things that we have done is the relationship with Unity. We have tooling that allows you to have this core library that\u2019s portable. You can bring your code asset. In fact, we are the only client platform that has the abstractions available for the different languages and so on.","And then on the cloud side, in fact one of the most strategic APIs is the Office API. If you think about building an application for iOS, if you want single sign-on for any enterprise application, it\u2019s the Azure AD single sign-on. That\u2019s one of the things that we showed at Build, which is how to take advantage of list data in Sharepoint, contact information in Exchange, Azure active directory information for log-on. And those are the APIs that are very, very powerful APIs and unique to us. And they expand the opportunity for developers to reach into the enterprises. And then of course Azure is a full platform, which is very attractive to developers. So that gives you a flavor for how important developers are and what your opportunities are.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays","Thank you.","Chris Suh","Thanks Raimo. Operator, we have time for one more question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Ross MacMillan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies","Thanks very much for taking my question as well. Amy, I just wanted to go back to D&C licensing, because I think the guidance for the next quarter suggests a relatively modest decline at the midpoint, certainly more modest than we saw prior to this quarter for the last few quarters. And I guess I have two questions. One is, are you able to separate the XP End of Life impact from the broader improvement in corporate PC refresh, for example? And then two, Satya, what thought have you given around how you could potentially make what has been traditionally a unit model with Windows OEM revenue into something potentially more recurring in nature? Thank you.","Amy Hood","Thanks, Ross. Let me take the first part of that. I think our guidance for the D&C licensing segment takes into account a moderate decline as I said in the benefit of the end of XP as well as some of the impact of the pull forward in Office for Japan. So I think in general, it\u2019s pretty reflective of the trend lines that we discussed. And I do think it is hard to really separate completely the difference between a general and the improving business PC environment and the end of XP. We tried our best to do that in the guidance and we will obviously learn more over the coming weeks.","Satya Nadella","And the thing I would add is this transition from one time let\u2019s say licenses or device purchases to what is a recurring stream. You see that in a variety of different ways. You have back end subscriptions, in our case, there will be Office 365, there is advertising, there is the app store itself. So these are all things that attach to a device. And so we are definitely going to look to make sure that the value prop that we put together is going to be holistic in its nature and the monetization itself will be holistic and it will increase with the usage of the device across these services. And so that\u2019s the approach we will take.","Amy Hood","Thanks, Ross.","Chris Suh - General Manager, Investor Relations","Thank you, Ross. So thank you all.

It was another strong quarter with double-digit top and bottom line growth driven by the strength of our commercial cloud. Stepping back from the quarter and reflecting more broadly on the next decade, the defining secular trend will be the increasing rate of digitization of people, places, and things. This malleable power of software will drive productivity growth across all industries, leading to more inclusive economic growth far beyond the domains of consumer tech today.","Tech spend as a percentage of GDP is projected to double over the next decade. At Microsoft, we are focused on building the most differentiated tech stack to enable every organization in every industry to build their own digital capability and tech intensity, with a business model that is trusted and aligned with their success in this new era.","Now, I'll briefly highlight our innovation momentum, starting with Azure. Every customer will need a distributed computing fabric across the cloud and the edge to power their mission-critical workloads and meet regulatory as well as operational solvency needs. We have more data center regions than any other cloud provider and will be the first to open in Israel and Qatar, expanding our footprint to 56 in total.","Azure is the only cloud that offers consistency across operating models, development environments, and infrastructure stack, enabling customers to bring cloud compute and intelligence to any connected or disconnected environment.","This quarter, we expanded our portfolio of edge appliances. Azure Stack Edge brings rapid machine learning inferencing closer to where data is generated and the new ruggedized Azure Stack form factors provide cloud capabilities in even the harshest of conditions like disaster response.","With Azure Arc, we are defining the next generation of hybrid computing. Arc is an industry-first control plane built for a multi-cloud, multi-edge world, helping partners like HPE meet their customers' complex hybrid needs.","Our differentiated approach across the cloud and edge is winning customers. The U.S. Department of Defense chose Azure to support our men and women in uniform at home, abroad, and at their tactical edge. And our exclusive partnership with SAP makes Azure the preferred destination for every SAP customer with large migrations in every industry from Accenture to Coca-Cola to Rio Tinto to Walgreens Boots Alliance.","We're also going beyond conventional computing architecture ushering in a new era with Azure Quantum, a full stack open ecosystem that enables customers like Ford Motor Company to apply the power of quantum computing today.","There will be 175 zettabytes of data by 2025, up from 40 zettabytes today. Processing this data in real-time will be an operational imperative for every organization. Azure Synapse is our limitless analytics service. It brings together big data analytics and data warehousing with unmatched performance, scale, and security.","In concert with Power BI, it enables data scientists to generate immediate insights from structured and unstructured data and build custom AI models. Walgreens Boots Alliance is using Synapse to analyze more than 200 million item-store combination, so millions of customers can rely on items always being in stock.","In AI, we are seeing rapid adoption across our comprehensive portfolio of AI tools, infrastructure, and services. 6 billion transactions on Azure Cognitive Services each month, 7 billion documents processed daily with Azure Cognitive Search, 2 billion predictions a month using Azure Machine Learning, and 3,500 new conversational agent bots created each week with Azure Bot Service.","Nationwide is using Azure Bot Service to simplify how millions of customers submit claims, and KPMG is using Azure Cognitive Services to transcribe and catalog thousands of hours of calls reducing compliance costs for its clients by as much as 80%.","Now to security, Cybercrime will cost businesses, governments, and individuals $1 trillion this year.

And at CES, our partners showcased innovative Windows 10 devices from incredibly thin and light laptops to powerful gaming rigs to new dual-screen designs.","Finally, gaming. We continue to invest to reach gamers across every endpoint, mobile, PC and console. xCloud is off to a very strong start, transforming how games are distributed, played and viewed with hundreds of thousands of people participating in initial trials. We set a new record for Xbox Live monthly active users again this quarter, led by the strength of console. Xbox Game Pass subscribers more than doubled this quarter, and Xbox Series X announced last month will be our most powerful console ever.","In closing, we are expanding our opportunity across all our businesses. Along with this opportunity, we recognize the responsibility we have to ensure the technology we build is always inclusive, trusted and is creating more sustainable work.","Our customers see this urgent need and are looking to us in partnership with them to take action. That's why we announced an ambitious new sustainability commitment. Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2030.

I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.","Amy Hood","Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $36.9 billion, up 14% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 22% and 25% in constant currency. Operating income increased 35% and 39% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $1.51, increasing 37% and 41% in constant currency, when adjusting for the net charges related to TCJA from the prior year.","Our sales teams and partners again delivered strong commercial results, and we continue to benefit from favorable secular trends. From a geographic perspective, we saw broad-based strength across all markets.","In our commercial business, we continued to see strong demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings with increased customer commitment to the Azure platform. And the unique value of Microsoft 365 bringing together Office 365, Windows 10 and enterprise mobility and security, as a secure intelligent solution, again drove adoption by both new and existing customers. As a result, commercial bookings growth was ahead of expectations, increasing 31% and 30% in constant currency, with a high volume of new business and strong renewal execution.","Our commercial remaining performance obligation was $90 billion, up 30% year-over-year, driven by long-term customer commitments. Commercial cloud revenue was $12.5 billion, growing 39% and 41% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased five points year-over-year to 67%, driven again by material improvement in Azure gross margin percentage, which more than offset sales mix shift to Azure.","Company gross margin percentage was 67%, up five points year-over-year driven by favorable sales mix and improvement across all three of our segments. In the quarter, gross margin percentage benefited from lower console sales, stronger than expected software licensing results and improvement in our commercial cloud gross margin percentage.","In line with expectations, FX reduced revenue growth by one point and had no impact on operating expense growth. FX impact on COGS growth was slightly more favorable than expected and reduced growth by one point. Operating expense grew 9%, slightly below expectations, primarily driven by lower program spend. And operating margins expanded this quarter as a result of higher gross margins and operating leverage through disciplined decisions to invest in strategic and high growth areas.","Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $11.8 billion, increasing 17% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by both our commercial and consumer businesses.","Office commercial revenue grew 16% and 18% in constant currency with roughly three points of on-premises benefit, primarily from transactional strength in Japan. Office 365 commercial revenue growth of 27% and 30% in constant currency was again driven by installed base growth across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU.","Office 365 commercial seats grew 21% with an increasing mix from our Microsoft 365 suite. Office consumer revenue grew 19% and 20% in constant currency, driven by growth in Office 365 subscription revenue. This quarter, growth was also impacted by roughly seven points of benefit from transactional strength in Japan and five points of benefit from the low prior year comparable related to the timing of the Office 2019 purchases.","Office 365 consumer subscriptions grew to 37.2 million. Dynamics revenue grew 12% and 15% in constant currency. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 42% and 45% in constant currency, with continued momentum in the number of customers adopting multiple Dynamics 365 workloads.","LinkedIn revenue increased 24% and 26% in constant currency, with continued strength across all businesses, highlighted by marketing solutions growth of 42%. LinkedIn sessions grew 25% with record levels of engagement again this quarter.","Segment gross margin dollars increased 21% and 23% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased two points year-over-year as improvements in Office 365 and LinkedIn margins more than offset, an increase in cloud revenue mix.","Operating expense increased 12%, driven by continued investment in LinkedIn and cloud engineering. And operating income increased 29% and 33% in constant currency.","Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $11.9 billion, increasing 27% and 28% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued customer demand for our hybrid offerings. On a significant base, server products and cloud services revenue increased 30% and 32% in constant currency. Azure revenue grew 62% and 64% in constant currency, driven by another quarter of strong growth in our consumption-based business across all customer segments.","In our per user business, our enterprise mobility installed base grew 35% to over 127 million seats, with continued benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. And our on-premises server business grew 10% and 12% in constant currency, with roughly four points of benefit from the end of support for Windows Server 2008, in addition to the continued strength of our hybrid and premium solutions.","Nearly one-third of our Windows Server and SQL Server enterprise customers are already using our hybrid use benefits to deploy Azure, reflecting the value and flexibility of these offerings.","Enterprise Services revenue increased 6% and 7% in constant currency, driven by growth in premier support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 28% and 31% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased one point year-over-year as another quarter of material improvement in Azure gross margin more than offset the growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue. Operating expense increased 18%, primarily driven by continued investments in Azure. Operating income grew 38% and 42% in constant currency.","Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.2 billion, increasing 2% and 3% in constant currency, ahead of expectations as better-than-expected performance across our Windows businesses more than offset lower-than-expected search and surface revenue.","In Windows, overall PC market growth was stronger than we expected and benefited from the low prior year comparable related to the timing of chip supply to our OEM partners. OEM Pro revenue, which makes up roughly 40% of total Windows revenue, grew 26%, driven by continued momentum in advance of Windows 7 end of support and strong Windows 10 demand.","The benefit from the low prior year comparable drove roughly 11 points of that growth. OEM non-Pro revenue, which makes up roughly 20% of total Windows revenue, increased 4%. This quarter, continued pressure in the entry-level category was more than offset by roughly seven points of benefit from the low prior year comparable and the timing of license purchases from an OEM partner. Inventory levels ended the quarter in the normal range.","Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue, which makes up roughly 30% of total Windows revenue, grew 25% and 27% in constant currency, again driven by strong demand for Microsoft 365, which carries higher in-quarter revenue recognition. The remainder of the Windows business is made up of our other licensing and services components.","Surface revenue increased 6% and 8% in constant currency, lower-than-expected as continued strong momentum in the commercial segment was partially offset by execution challenges in the consumer segment. Search revenue ex TAC increased 6% and 7% in constant currency, below expectations, primarily driven by lower Bing volume.","And in gaming, revenue declined 21% and 20% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by lower console sales as we approach the next Xbox launch. Xbox content and services revenue declined 11% and 9% in constant currency as the impact from a strong third-party title in the prior year more than offset continued growth in Game Pass subscribers and Minecraft.","Segment gross margin dollars increased 18% and 20% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased seven points year-over-year due to higher-margin sales mix. Operating expense declined 5% as redeployment of engineering resources to higher-growth opportunities was partially offset by gaming investments, primarily in first-party content. As a result, operating income grew 41% and 45% in constant currency.","Now back to total company results. In line with expectations, capital expenditures including finance leases were $4.5 billion, up 17% year-over-year, driven by an ongoing investment to meet growing demand for our cloud services.","Cash paid for PP&E was $3.5 billion. Cash flow from operations was $10.7 billion and increased 20% year-over-year, driven by healthy cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $7.1 billion and increased 37%, reflecting the timing of cash payments for PP&E.","Other income was $194 million higher than anticipated due to the recording of mark-to-market gains in our equity portfolio. Our effective tax rate was slightly above 17%, in line with expectations. And finally, we returned $8.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","Now, let's move to our outlook. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to decrease revenue at both the company and individual segment level by approximately one point and have no impact on total company COGS and operating expense growth.","In our commercial business, we expect consistent execution and continued demand for our hybrid solutions to drive another strong quarter. Commercial bookings growth should again be healthy, but will be impacted by a materially lower growth in our Q3 ex-rebase.","Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will continue to improve year-over-year, although at a lower rate than last quarter given the growing mix of Azure consumption-based services. And we expect a sequential dollar increase in our capital expenditure as we continue to invest to support growing demand.","Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $11.5 billion and $11.7 billion, driven by continued double-digit growth across Office Commercial, Dynamics, and LinkedIn.","For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $11.85 billion and $12.05 billion. In Azure, revenue growth will continue to reflect the balance of our strong growth in our consumption-based business and moderating growth in our per user business, given the size of the installed base.","Growth in our on-premise server business should be high single digits, again driven by strong hybrid demand as well as some continued benefit related to the end of support for Windows Server 2008.","In Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be slightly higher than last quarter. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $10.75 billion and $11.15 billion.","In Windows, overall, OEM revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single-digits and continue to reflect healthy Windows 10 demand, end of support for Windows 7, and the supply chain's ability to meet demand. The wider-than-usual range in More Personal Computing segment reflects uncertainty related to the public health situation in China.","In Windows, Commercial Products and Cloud Services, we expect another quarter of healthy double-digit revenue growth, driven by continued Microsoft 365 suite momentum and some benefit from Windows 7 extended support agreements.","In Surface, we expect revenue growth in the low single digits as we work through the execution challenges in the consumer segment. In Search ex TAC, we expect revenue growth similar to Q2.","And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the low double-digit range, driven by the continuation of the console trend as we near the launch of Xbox Series X as well as lower transaction volume on a third-party title.","Now, back to the overall company guidance. We expect COGS of $11.05 billion to $11.25 billion and operating expense of $11.2 billion to $11.3 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And finally, we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be slightly below our full year rate of 17% due to the timing of equity vests.","Now, let me share some additional comments on the full year. At the company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth, driven by the continued strength of our commercial business. For operating expense, as a result of lower spend in H1, we now expect full year growth between 10% and 11%.","And finally, given our strong H1 results, particularly in high margin businesses, as well as the expected sales mix for the remainder of the year, we now expect operating margins to be up roughly two points year-over-year, even as we invest with significant ambition in strategic and high-growth areas in the second half of this year.","With that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.","Mike Spencer","Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. As respect to others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Please proceed.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you very much and congratulations on a really strong [technical difficulty]. I'd like to look at Azure. Can you give a little bit of more details on what's driving the Q-over-Q acceleration in the revenue growth? Are we seeing large contracts starting to ramp? Are there other factors that are kicking in that are helping that? And Satya, can you also give us some sense of what you think about the impact if xCloud is accessible on Azure. Thank you.","Satya Nadella","Sure. Thanks Mark for the question. I think, overall, in terms of the Azure momentum, it's sort of the thing that we have seen even in the previous quarters so, which is we have a stack that is from infrastructure to the PaaS services, that's fairly differentiated. I mean, I went through some of the things that we even announced at our Ignite conference.","Take something like Azure Arc. The fact that we have a control plane for hybrid computing that is multi-cloud, multi-edge, that's a pretty differentiated aspect of it. And the data side, both on the transactions, on the OLTP side as well as on the analytics side, we now have cloud-native databases, and Azure Synapse, I think, is a very competitive product. So that's what you see play out in terms of a customer adoption and the growth there.","xCloud, I think, is a great workload. I mean, we\u2019ve always had the mantra of first party equals third party, whether it is any of the workloads internally, it is really helping us understand the new patterns, which then of course third parties can use. And you can see that even in terms of how Sony will use some of the same infrastructure capabilities. So, we are excited about what xCloud teaches us, but more importantly, we're excited about how others in the ecosystem can use the same capability for their streaming needs.","Amy Hood","And, Mark, to your question on -- a little bit about the reacceleration in the Azure growth rate, let me divide that into its components. We did have a very good and healthy, broad-based consumption growth, especially in IaaS and PaaS. I think, actually, Satya touched on one of the important parts that we started to see this quarter was not only good workload migration work, strong growth in the optimization of the workloads already running, but also some of these new PaaS workloads like Synapse and Cosmos DB and Arc are really starting to add some momentum in that part of the stack as well, which is important.","The SaaS component or the per-user component also tends to be where you'll get some variability as well. We did have a good SaaS component quarter in addition to the healthy base, and that does result in some movement in that number from quarter-to-quarter. And in particular, I think Microsoft 365 suite actually, and the momentum we've got in security and management and mobility is a big contributor to that.","And of course, just the type of contracts that get signed, whether that's for the consumption layer, in particular, can have some impact quarter to quarter in a couple of points. So, there will be some variability in that number, but the underlying fundamentals across both the consumption and per user were quite good.","Mark Moerdler","Perfect. I really do appreciate. Thank you, and again congrats.","Satya Nadella","Thank you, Mark. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Keith Weiss, your line is live. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Weiss","Sorry, guys, I was on mute. Thanks for taking the question, and a very, very nice quarter. Coming out of the Ignite conference, I wanted to sort of get your views on progress with developers broadly, particularly after the GitHub acquisition. Can you talk to us a little bit about how that's kind of impacted your traction with stuff like DevOps Studio and your Developer Tools? And also, how that's kind of changed the dynamic around Azure? Has that become a real competitive differentiation and changed at all the competitive dynamic with guys like AWS and GCP out there in the marketplace?","Satya Nadella","Yes. First of all, thanks, Keith, for the question. We are very, very excited about what's happening with the developer offering. I mean, at some level, I think of what we're doing between Visual Studio and Azure DevOps and GitHub as effectively coming together as a compelling developer SaaS solution in the same class as any other SaaS solution from Microsoft around productivity and communication, because as one of the data points I love to use is the number of developers in the non-tech sector is now more than in the tech sector. This is software engineers and that's going to only increase in the world going forward. So we want to build the best tool chain. After all, that's who we are as a company. We love building tools for developers.","And so -- and by the way, we're not focused only on Azure. For developers who use our tool chains, they can target any cloud, any edge device, and so this is not sort of means to some end. We've always been clear about it. It's an end to itself.","But that said, of course, having this tool chain will help us overall, both with essentially what is, by itself, high-margin tools as a SaaS business as well as, of course, developers who are going to be in our ecosystem. But we want to stay true to that ethos of open source, GitHub and do the best tools. In fact, just this last quarter, you saw even some of the tools being adopted by Facebook engineering and that's, I think, a testament to the progress that's been made by Microsoft.","Amy Hood","And I would just add to that, Keith, this is an important area for us to continue to invest in. The opportunity Satya talked about is at the developer SaaS level. And so whether you see us investing in GitHub or in the Azure tool chain, this will be a place that we'll continue to see as an opportunity for growth.","Keith Weiss","Excellent. Thank you.","Satya Nadella","Great. Thank you. Operator, we\u2019ll move to next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Karl Keirstead","Thanks. Amy, I'd love to ask you a gross margin question. Beginning in your third quarter or the current March quarter, we've been bracing for gross margins to trend flat or even down year-over-year, given the sales mix shifts that you and your IR team have long warned us about.","Yet when I take your Revs guide and your COGS guide, it equates to 3Q gross margins of 68%, which are actually up about 150 bps year-over-year. So I just wanted to understand what's going on. Is it that the higher gross margin businesses are decelerating at a slower than expected pace in your second half? Or perhaps the pace of Azure gross margin improvement is greater than you thought? A little color there might be helpful.","Amy Hood","Thanks, Karl. Really, when you see the gross margin changes, it all comes down to sales mix. So at a fundamental level, I feel very good about the execution of each service to their -- own gross margin goals. We saw improvement across every cloud service, not just Azure in terms of their ability to deliver growing gross margin as they focus not only on cost, but also on continuing to see ARPU growth and attach growth.","So -- and I could say that about many of the product lines, right? I focus on them at the -- what can each products line do to be its best and most competitive? What you saw in H1 and what you'll see in H2 is simply mix in Q2. There was a lot of mix into Windows away from, for example, the console, right, since we're heading into the next console cycle.","At a company level, if you thought about what gross margins would have looked like without gaming, it's a couple of points of impact. And as we head to H2, what you'll see is that, the mix will shift a little bit. The sort of end of support impacts tail off, whether that's in OEM or on the server side. And the contribution from gaming as well as other components in our hardware portfolio go up a little bit.","So that still does result, as you said, in a higher gross margin implication in Q3, and you'll see that continue to have a slightly different impact as we head into Q4, if that helps to give you a little sense.","Karl Keirstead","Yes. Thanks Amy.","Satya Nadella","Yes, thanks Karl. Operator we\u2019ll take the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Heather Bellini","I just wanted to follow up on a little bit what Karl was just asking relating to gross margins. I was wondering if you could maybe help us think about the mix between PaaS and IaaS and kind of what -- if you can give us a sense of the mix shift or just kind of how that's been trending?","But also, I wanted to ask about -- you've been -- it's been unbelievable, every quarter, you're able to call out material gross margin improvements in Azure. And I guess ultimately, what I'm asking is, given the success you've seen there, has your view for -- if you look 2 to 3 years down the road, do you just think Azure is going to be a higher gross margin business than maybe what you would have thought 3 years ago?","Amy Hood","Specifically on Azure, I think the Azure gross margins are trending where we thought they would trend actually on the IaaS and PaaS layer. And they're trending where we thought they would trend on the per user-like assets. And what you're seeing is continued improvement on that trend line that we expected. But you'll also see as we go forward in time, those improvements will flow at the IaaS and PaaS layer. It will get better but the nature and the rate of improvement will flow. And you'll see that increasing mix toward IaaS and PaaS in a way from the per user just as in terms of the opportunity and the TAM.","So for the long run, Heather, I think my view is unchanged, frankly, about what that should look like. And, of course, over the same time period, how it would impact commercial cloud gross margins all up.","But what -- I think if you separate this from this gross margin implication, it goes to the fact of just how much revenue opportunity exists in cloud. And so if we can continue to capture the revenue growth, continue to meet customer needs and scenarios, pick and thoughtfully invest in industry level solutions to grow those things, I worry less about the mechanics of the GM, which can continue to improve by service and more really about our opportunity to grow revenue.","Satya Nadella","Yeah, and I would say when we think about whether it's our R&D and operating leverage there or sales or CapEx for the cloud, we don't separate out these categories of IaaS, PaaS and even SaaS. I mean, just to put it practically for you, we might do an infrastructure service around IoT. We then have PaaS services around IoT. We have apps around IoT and Dynamics 365. Similarly, we have the xCloud and Game Pass subscriptions and we have the streaming capability in Azure.","So we think about our investments holistically in that sense, and I think that's what's going to define the long-term margin profile of our company is how well we manage all layers and collectively get leverage across the investment.","Heather Bellini","Very helpful. Thank you.","Mike Spencer","Thanks, Heather. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Brent Thill","Thanks. Amy, you called out the strength of on-premise software. I'm just curious; I know you have the tailwind from the expiration. But maybe talk through some of the other drivers that you're seeing in the business that's causing such great growth even on the on-premise as the cloud continues to grow?","Amy Hood","Thanks, Brent. What we've seen has been relatively consistent is the drivers on the on-prem side have absolutely been the hybrid value prop and also premium. And they're actually related because ultimately, the really things that we've seen that has value for customers is that flexibility, and so the flexibility to deploy where they need it and when they need it. And if that makes sense on the edge, which some people may call on-prem, and whether that makes sense in the cloud, which people may call Azure were relatively indifferent as long as it meets the customer solution in the way that the solution demands.","And so that hybrid value prop, you start to see that flexibility in the data point I gave, which is that one-third of the Windows and SQL Server customers are already starting to use that right to be able to take advantage of that flexibility for their workload solutions.","And so those trends, I see is relatively durable. And that's why we talked about, I think, now for a number of years. And I think if we think about the end of support and the tail on that, it was probably two points on IC for the quarter as I called out. So, I feel very good about the underlying trajectory.","Brent Thill","Thanks.","Mike Spencer","Thanks, Brent. Operator, we\u2019ll move to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Mark Murphy","Yes, thank you. Satya, a few quarters ago, you had commented that Teams is the fastest growing app in the company's history. Wondering if you could clarify, if that is a reference to daily active user growth or bookings impact? Or is that a comment on user engagement and the time being spent in Teams or some other criteria?","As well, Amy, wondering if you could offer any kind of directional thoughts on just how to model the Windows OEM line, post-Windows 7 end of support and going into fiscal year 2021. And any high-level thoughts on how you think that could trend versus what happened in the prior cycle?","Satya Nadella","Yes, thanks for the question, Mark. My comment was mostly around deployment engagement, the depth of engagement. There are very few types of products which have these platform effects. Teams is a scaffolding that is obviously related to messaging, which has significant usage. It's also driving usage of the rest of office, because rest of office gets integrated in the usage patterns around channels. It's obviously used in meetings. It's also the place where business process workflows in context of messaging happen and both for knowledge workers and first-line workers.","So when I look at all of that cumulative effect, it's much broader than any other user experience scaffolding and in terms of its ability to drive that type of platform effect and engagement. So we're excited about it. And we continue to see that, and you saw that in my remarks as well.","Amy Hood","And to your question on OEM, I think what's important is if you try to take out, which is challenging, some of the comments we've had on either chip supply constraints or some of the uncertainty related to the public health situation in China, you would say, what we have in terms of what the cycle would look like compared to prior cycle ends, would actually be quite similar.","If not, we probably have a little more opportunity in the mid and small business segment to have the tail last a little longer probably than it did the last time. So we feel very good. We'll still need to work through that as we work through both the situations I've talked about, frankly, now for quite a few quarters and then looking forward. So we'll continue to give you guidance on what we see in the market each quarter.","Mark Murphy","Thank you very much.","Mike Spencer","Thanks, Mark. Operator, we\u2019ll take next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.","Brad Reback","Great. Thanks very much. Amy, you mentioned a couple of times this evening about one-third of customers using hybrid rights. Within that customer base, any sense of what percent of workloads that represents for those clients? Thanks.","Amy Hood","Brad, there's not really a good way for me to know that. For me, the way I think about this is a top of funnel. It means that we've got solutions or workloads, where all the corporate developers that Satya mentioned are really starting to make that transition and making decisions for themselves about how to use Azure and how to get to experience it.","For me, that is a great sign. We've always said a lot of these hybrid use rights were about investing in skilling and learning and teaching the environment and having the adoption happen for the workloads that make the most sense. And then we can continue to partner with customers to help them through this process and continue to have more meaningful workload transition. So for us, I think I tend to start at the top and say, if we've got more going into the funnel, more opportunities to partner with customers, that's a good thing.","Brad Reback","Great. Thank you.","Mike Spencer","Thanks, Brad. Operator, we\u2019ll take our last questioner, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Phil Winslow","Hey, thanks guys for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on dynamics. I guess a question for Amy and Satya. I mean, Amy, you called out both seat growth but also increasing attach to multiple products with the Dynamics driving that growth rate.","Wondering if you could help us sort of parse that out. And then to Satya, when you think about just SaaS in general, how important is sort of Dynamics to the overall Microsoft strategy, particularly with what you're trying to do with the AI platform in Azure because, obviously, over the past 12 months, we've seen rollouts of some of those insights, AI products where you have \u2013 you can use the Dynamics of data, but also data from Salesforce in desk, et cetera, but as a sort of a side car there. So wondering if you could just sort of walk us through just sort of the, call it, the application strategy and then that in the context of what you're trying to do in the AI world?","Satya Nadella","Yes. No, great. Thanks, Phil, for the question. Let me start, and then Amy, you can. I mean, we are very excited about what's happening with Dynamics 365 in particular, because when I look at what the world needs is it needs a business application suite that is more comprehensive. That can turn what is the real currency of this next era, which is data into predictions, insights and automation without boundaries. I mean, take even the Canada Goose, example that I had in my remarks, which is actually a pretty fascinating story of how they've been able to take the end-to-end nature of Dynamics 365, and really bring together the manufacturing, wholesale and retail operations to the next level of efficiency. That's I think, what is needed. And the way, we have architected it on top of Azure, its cloud native in terms of its use of databases. It's for example, all these insights modules, I referenced and you'd referenced are all built on Azure Synapse, so it's sort of deeply integrated into Azure. It integrates into LinkedIn. It integrates into Microsoft 365, Power platform the extensibility model for both Microsoft 365 and Dynamics is the same, which is Power platform.","And that's a pretty \u2013 no, there's no such thing as a canonical business and no such thing as a canonical business over time, right? The business processes change. The question is how rapidly can people and domain experts keep up with the change and that's where Dynamics 365 absolutely shine. So we're excited about what's happening there. You mentioned a point about Sidecar. We think that, that's a very legitimate use case. There is a new category, in fact and a new race starting with CDP, and we are leading. And so I feel excited about that as well.","Amy Hood","And to your question on how the Dynamics 365 sort of the excitement we have. When I think about the comment I made around adding workloads, what's so important about what Satya just talked about is, how this reaches into new budgets for us, new opportunity for us in terms of being able to tap growth that we had not been able to access before. And the way, I tend to think about that is not dissimilar from how I think of most per seat businesses. You add a seat and then you add workloads and the more you can do that in terms of tapping into new budgets, that's a great opportunity for us. So I think that's a frame that, I'll start to talk a little bit more about as we learn more about Dynamics 365 and its momentum. This is another place, I would call out, where I do think we can sort of focus and continue to make some investments in H2 based on the momentum we have seen in H1.","Phil Winslow","Thanks.","Mike Spencer","Thanks, Phil.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to Mike Spencer, General Manager of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please proceed.","Michael Spencer","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and Carolyn Frantz, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.","On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.

Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.","Satya Nadella","Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone for joining on the phone. We delivered $32.5 billion in revenue this quarter with double-digit top line and bottom line growth driven by strength across all of our commercial cloud. Our commercial cloud revenue grew 48%, anchored by Azure revenue growth of 76%. These results speak to us picking the right secular trends in large and growing markets, many of which are still in their infancy, as well as focused innovation and execution.","Leading companies in every industry are partnering with us to build their own digital capability to compete and grow. This is creating a broad opportunity for everyone, including our ecosystem. As one example, the co-sell program we introduced 18 months ago has already generated $8 billion in contracted partner revenue.","Now I'll briefly highlight our momentum and innovation across our businesses. Microsoft 365 empowers everyone, enterprises, small businesses and then more than 2 billion first-line workers with an integrated secure experience that transcends any one device. We are helping every business build out their system of communication and collaboration to drive their productivity as well as their business transformation. Microsoft Teams is the hub for teamwork and a powerful on-ramp for Microsoft 365, and we're seeing increased usage of OneDrive, SharePoint, Yammer and the entire Office Suite of applications.","Teams is the only enterprise-grade solution that brings together messaging, meetings, video conferencing as well as document collaboration. And as of this quarter, enhanced voice capabilities like group call forwarding, delegation, location-based routing are all being brought into Teams.","We are seeing rapid adoption of Teams with more than 420,000 organizations of all sizes and 89 of the Fortune 100 using Teams, including customers like Pfizer, who chose Teams as the collaboration platform for their 115,000 employees, and we are expanding into new and underpenetrated markets. This quarter, we introduced new capabilities to empower first-line workers in the service and task-oriented roles to communicate and collaborate more effectively on the go with mobile schedule management, location sharing as well as the ability to easily record and share secure audio messages.","We're expanding our opportunity in education with Microsoft 365, innovating in hardware and software to improve learning outcomes from the more collaborative classrooms with Teams to personalized learning tools in OneNote, to social learning with Flipgrid, to affordable easy-to-manage Windows 10 devices.","Cybersecurity is a central challenge, and Microsoft is leading the way, helping all organizations operate in what is known in the industry as a zero trust environment. It all starts with Azure AD Active Directory and the deep work we're doing with Microsoft Threat Protection to provide an integrated solution for our customers that extends across identities, device endpoints, e-mail, information, cloud applications and infrastructure. And this quarter, we introduced new advanced capabilities for identity and threat protection and for information protection and compliance. A comprehensive approach to security and compliance is another reason why customers are adopting Microsoft 365. Customers from Neiman Marcus to Brooks Running to global biopharmaceutical leader, Sanofi, all chose our solutions.","Surface had its biggest quarter ever this holiday, delivering strong double-digit growth in both consumer and commercial. We continue to innovate and expand our family of devices, setting the bar for the industry with newest Surface Pro, Surface Laptop and Surface Go. More broadly, Windows 10 continues to gain traction in the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system. And at CES, our OEM partners showcased always connected Windows 10 PCs that deliver break-through levels of performance to enable powerful new scenarios like immersive gaming.","Moving to business applications and LinkedIn. Dynamics 365 grew 51% this quarter as we win customers with our differentiated approach to systems of record and systems of engagement by making them more modular, extensible and AI-driven. Increasingly, business process automation includes digitizing physical spaces, activities and interactions. Dynamics 365, along with advances in Azure IoT, AI and Mixed Reality are leading the way for organizations to create these new systems of observation and systems of intelligence that drive end-to-end business processes and bridge the online and off-line worlds.","For example, we now have the capability for customers to manage inventory in real-time from the shelf to the warehouse to the farm. But we're not stopping there. Our Power platform spanning Power BI, Power Apps and Flow enables anyone in an organization to start building an intelligent app or workflow where none exists. It is the only solution of its kind in the industry, bringing together no code or low code app development, robotic process automation and self-service analytics into a single comprehensive application platform. And it enables extensibility across Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 as well as leading third-party SaaS business applications.","With Power platform, Microsoft is fundamentally demarketizing business processes, empowering everyone to make smarter, faster decisions, and I'm energized about the tremendous opportunity in this space. Already, Centrica is relying on Power BI, Power Apps and Flow along with Dynamics 365 to transform scheduling and dispatch of its first-line workforce in the United Kingdom. Virgin Group is using Power Apps and Dynamics 365 to generate a single view of its passengers' surfacing insights to improve customer service and increase operational efficiency. And in Italy, postal service is using Dynamics 365 to jump start the digital transformation of thousands of the post offices across the country.","Moving to LinkedIn. We continue to generate strong revenue growth across all businesses, with sessions growth of 30% year-over-year fueled by record levels of engagement in the feed and content shared across the platform. We also saw record job postings again this quarter. We introduced new brand and community building tools for marketeers with LinkedIn pages, making it easier for organizations of all sizes to foster strong connections with LinkedIn's 610 million members.","Finally, Glint broadens our market opportunity with its industry leading employee engagement platform. At a time when competing for talent and skill development is a priority for every leader, the combination of LinkedIn Talent Solutions, Talent Insights, LinkedIn Learning and now Glint helps every business attract, retain and develop the best talent in an increasingly competitive jobs marketplace.","Now turning to Azure. Azure is the only hyperscale cloud with a consistent computing stack that extends from the data center to the edge, and customers across every industry recognize this architectural advantage. In retail, Azure was front and center at the NRF. Kroger is partnering with us to redefine customer experience in stalls and provide employees with AI-driven insights, while the Gap chose our cloud to accelerate the digital transformation. And just this week, Albertsons chose Azure as its preferred cloud.","In financial services, MasterCard is partnering with us on a new, more secure way to verify digital identities. BlackRock is applying the power of the Microsoft Cloud to reimagine retirement planning, and UBS is using Azure to increase agility across the organization while meeting the highest bar of compliance and security.","In health care, Walgreens Boots Alliance chose Azure to put people at the center of their health and wellness with digital solutions to improve health care outcomes and lower costs. In addition, they will roll out Microsoft 365 to more than 380,000 employees in stores globally.","We're accelerating our innovation in emerging workloads like IoT and edge AI. At CES, our partners showcased how Azure IoT and Azure AI are enabling them to build new connected devices and experiences that span the cloud and the edge from connected homes to cars to smart cities. Just this month, Starbucks chose Azure Sphere to secure its business-critical edge devices in the stores.","Developers will increasingly drive the influence business -- and influence business processes and functions across every organization. And we are committed to drive at giving developers the tools they need to be productive on any platform. More than 12 million developers around the world use Visual Studio to build applications, and new features enable them to collaborate in real-time and spend more time driving innovation. We closed our acquisition of GitHub this quarter, enabling us to bring our tools and services to new audiences while enabling GitHub to grow and retain its developer-first ethos. GitHub has more than 31 million developer accounts and recently surpassed 100 million code repositories, a major milestone. Development teams at more than half of the Fortune 50 do their work in GitHub Enterprise. This month, we announced significant updates to make GitHub accessible to even more developers, introducing unlimited private repos as well as new, simpler and unified enterprise offering already available through the Microsoft global sales force, and we're not stopping there. Just last week, we announced our acquisition of Citus Data, the leading provider of PostgreSQL, enhancing our overall data platform differentiation and building on our investments in Azure and making it the most comprehensive cloud for open source and proprietary workloads at any scale.","And now I'll turn to gaming. We continue to pursue our expansive opportunity to transform how games are distributed, played and viewed. Our investments in content community and cloud services across every endpoint drove both record user engagement and record average revenue per user and contributed to our largest gaming revenue quarter ever, driven by software and services.","We acquired two new studios this quarter, bringing the total to 13 and more than doubling our first-party content capacity in the past 6 months. Xbox Live monthly active users reached a record 64 million, with the highest number of mobile and PC users to date. Xbox Game Pass subscribers and Mixer engagement also hit new all-time highs. And Minecraft, which continues to be one of the most popular and durable gaming franchises in the industry, delivered record revenue as we expanded into new platforms, geographies and segments like education. PlayFab surpassed 1 billion player accounts this quarter, and xCloud will be public trialed later this year as we make progress on our ambition to build a world-class gaming platform spanning mobile, PC and console.","In closing, our accelerating customer momentum is driven by our deep and growing partnerships with leading companies and differentiated innovation across our portfolio. Every company is becoming a digital company, and they're looking for a trusted partner to help them build tech intensity. Microsoft is that partner.","With that, now I'll hand over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you for questions.","Amy Hood","Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. First, as a reminder, my comments across our results and outlook include the impact from GitHub, inclusive of purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related expenses. This quarter, revenue was $32.5 billion, up 12% and 13% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 12%. Operating income increased 18%, and earnings per share was $1.10, increasing 15% and 14% in constant currency when adjusting for the net charges related to TCJA. Strong execution and continued customer demand for our hybrid cloud offerings drove another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. We continued to benefit from favorable secular trends and IT spending conditions. From a geographic perspective, our performance was in line with macroeconomic trends with strength across the U.S., Western Europe and the U.K. partially offset by weaker performance in Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East and Africa.","In our commercial business, annuity mix grew 3 points year-over-year to 89%. Commercial unearned revenue was $25.3 billion, growing 20%, slightly above our expectations. And commercial bookings were strong, growing 18% and 22% in constant currency driven by solid renewal execution and an increase in the number of larger, longer-term Azure contracts.","As a reminder, strong performance in larger long-term Azure contracts, Azure consumption overages and pay-as-you-go contracts will drive bookings growth and in-period revenue but will have a limited impact on unearned revenue. Commercial cloud revenue was $9 billion, growing 48% and 47% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 5 points year-over-year to 62% driven by significant improvement in Azure gross margin.","Our company gross margin percentage was 62%, flat year-over-year as improving cloud margins were offset by sales mix shift to commercial cloud and Surface hardware. The U.S. dollar was a bit stronger than anticipated, which resulted in a slightly greater impact to our results. FX reduced revenue, COGS and operating expense growth by less than 1 point. Operating expenses grew 7%, slightly lower than expectation as some marketing spend shifted to Q3. We again expanded operating margins as a result of focused investment, solid execution and improving gross margins in key product areas.","Now to segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $10.1 billion, increasing 13% driven by Office 365 Commercial, LinkedIn and Dynamics 365. Office Commercial revenue grew 11%. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 34% and 33% in constant currency driven by seat growth of 27% and ARPU expansion from continued customer migration to higher value E3 and E5 offerings. We saw installed base growth across all workloads and customer segments.","Office Consumer revenue grew 1% and 2% in constant currency, below our expectation. As discussed on our last earnings call, Q2 revenue growth was impacted by channel inventories normalizing after the prelaunch builds in Q1 but was further negatively impacted by a smaller-than-expected consumer PC market and execution challenges through the quarter. Office 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 33.3 million, a sequential slowdown primarily due to changes made in how Office 365 is sold in Japan. Our Dynamics business grew 17% driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 51% and 50% in constant currency. This quarter, more than 9 out of every 10 new Dynamics CRM customers chose our cloud offering.","LinkedIn revenue increased 29% and 30% in constant currency with continued strong execution across all businesses. LinkedIn sessions grew 30% as engagement once again reached record levels. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11%, and gross margin percentage declined slightly year-over-year as increased cloud mix offset the benefit from improvements in LinkedIn and Office 365 margins. Operating expenses increased 3% and 4% in constant currency as we continued to invest in LinkedIn and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 20% and 19% in constant currency.","Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment, which now includes GitHub. Revenue was $9.4 billion, increasing 20% and 21% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued strength in our hybrid solutions. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 24%. Azure revenue increased 76% with strong growth from both the consumption and per user base businesses. In our on-premises server business, continued customer demand for flexible hybrid solutions and our premium offerings drove growth of 3% and 4% in constant currency.","Enterprise Services revenue increased 6% and 7% in constant currency, driven by growth in premier support services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20%. Gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged as revenue mix to Azure IaaS and PaaS was offset by material improvement in the Azure gross margin percentage. Operating expenses increased 26% with continued investment in cloud and AI engineering as well as commercial sales capacity and the addition of GitHub. Operating income grew 16% and 15% in constant currency.","Now to the results for More Personal Computing segment. Revenue was $13 billion, increasing 7%. Results in our Windows OEM business were lower than expected, partially offset by strong Surface results. In Windows, the overall PC market was smaller than we expected primarily due to the timing of chip supply to our OEM partners, which constrained an otherwise healthy PC ecosystem and negatively impacted both OEM Pro and non-Pro revenue growth. Windows OEM Pro revenue declined 2%, roughly in line with the commercial PC market. OEM non-Pro revenue declined 11%, below the market with continued pressure in the entry-level category.","Inventory levels ended the quarter below the normal range. Windows Commercial products and cloud services grew 13% and 14% in constant currency with continued customer adoption of our premium offerings. Windows 10 deployments across new and existing devices remained strong.","Gaming revenue grew 8% and 9% in constant currency. Xbox software and services revenue increased 31% and 32% in constant currency, primarily driven by continued strength from a third-party title. Additionally, strong subscriber growth across Xbox Live and Game Pass helped to offset lower-than-expected performance from other third-party titles on the platform. Xbox hardware performed better than expected but declined year-over-year given the holiday launch of the Xbox One X a year ago.","In Surface, revenue increased 39% and 41% in constant currency to nearly $1.9 billion, ahead of our expectations, driven by strong growth across both our consumer and commercial segments. Search revenue ex TAC increased 14%, driven by Bing rate growth and increased volume in U.S. and international markets. Segment gross margin dollars increased 6% and 7% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased due to sales mix to our lower-margin Surface and gaming businesses. Operating expenses declined 4%. As a result, operating income increased 18% and 19% in constant currency.","Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were down sequentially to $3.9 billion, lower than originally planned mainly due to quarter-to-quarter variability and the timing of cloud infrastructure build-out. Cash paid for plant, property and equipment was $3.7 billion.","Cash flow from operations increased 13% year-over-year driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $5.2 billion and decreased 2% year-over-year, reflecting the timing of higher cash payments for plant, property and equipment.","Other income was $127 million, higher than anticipated, driven by interest income and investment gains partially offset by interest expense and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was slightly above 17%, in line with expectations.","And finally, we returned $9.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 91%. Our Q2 share repurchase was $6.1 billion, higher than our normal quarterly pace and aligned to our commitment of incremental buyback to fully offset stock consideration issued in the GitHub transaction by the end of the fiscal year.","Now let's move to the outlook. For Q3, first, FX. With the stronger U.S. dollar and assuming the current rates remain stable, we now expect FX to decrease revenue and operating expense growth by approximately 2 points and decrease COGS growth by approximately 1 point. With the segments, we anticipate about 2 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth and Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing.","Second, continued strong customer demand, healthy bookings growth and increasing revenue annuity mix should drive another solid quarter in our Commercial business. Commercial unearned revenue is expected to decline approximately 2% to 3%, in line sequentially with historic trends. We expect commercial cloud gross margin percentage to continue to improve year-over-year as material improvement in Azure gross margin will again be partially offset by the mix of revenue toward Azure consumption-based services. Third, CapEx. We expect a sequential dollar increase in capital expenditures as we continue to invest to support increasing demand.","Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $9.9 billion and $10.1 billion, driven by double-digit growth in Office Commercial and Dynamics as well as healthy LinkedIn growth on a strong prior year comparable. We expect Office Consumer revenue growth to continue to be in the low single digits as growth in Office 365 will be partially offset by the continuation of the consumer PC market headwinds.","For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $9.15 billion and $9.35 billion, with our hybrid demand continuing to drive strong growth in server products and cloud services. Azure growth will continue to reflect the balance between strong growth in our consumption-based businesses and moderating growth in our per-user business. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $10.35 billion and $10.65 billion, with a shift in revenue mix to our Surface and gaming businesses.","In Windows overall, OEM revenue growth should be in the low single digits as we anticipate continued market demand -- market impact from constrained chip supply in Q3. In Surface, continued momentum from Surface Pro 6, Surface Laptop 2 and Surface Go will drive another strong quarter of over 20% growth for Surface. In search ex TAC, we expect revenue growth similar to Q2. In gaming, we expect revenue growth to be slightly higher than last quarter. Sales mix will shift to software and services where we expect healthy growth.","Now back to overall company guidance. We expect COGS of $10.35 billion to $10.55 billion and operating expenses of $10.1 billion to $10.2 billion dollars, inclusive of marketing spend that moved from Q2 to Q3. Other income and expense should be approximately $50 million as interest income is partially offset by interest expense. And finally, we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be in line with the full year rate of 17%. Now a few comments on our outlook for Q4 and the full fiscal year, which are unchanged from October. First on FX. In Q4, assuming rates remain stable, we expect FX to decrease revenue growth by approximately 2 points and COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point.","Second, in Q4, we expect continued strong performance in our commercial cloud business; but as a reminder, we also have several challenging comparisons from the prior year, specifically in on-premise server, LinkedIn, Windows OEM and the strength of a third-party title in gaming. In terms of operating expenses, we continue to expect full year growth of roughly 8%. We will continue to invest in strategic growth areas like Azure, GitHub, Dynamics, the Power platform, LinkedIn, Teams and gaming content given our significant growth opportunities, competitive advantage and growing momentum. We still expect full year operating margin to be up slightly year-over-year, inclusive of the full GAAP impact of GitHub. For CapEx, we continue to expect the growth rate for the year to moderate, even as we meet the high demand for our cloud services. We remain committed to an incremental share buyback beyond the normal quarterly pace that will fully offset stock consideration issued in the GitHub transaction by the end of the fiscal year. And finally, we still expect the full year effective tax rate to be roughly 17% with quarterly variability.","With that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.","Michael Spencer","Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss","Nice quarter. A question on Azure, and it's a two-parter, one part for Satya and one for Amy. Satya, there's been a lot of press releases of you up on the stage with CEOs from guys like Albertson and Walgreens talking about these large strategic deals that you're doing with these companies. Can you help us understand sort of how do these large strategic deals translate into sort of the services being used on Azure changing? Like is there a mix shift in the type of services that are supporting these large digital transformations that we should be sort of aware of on a going-forward basis? And to Amy, one of the sort of big investor debates is a lot of suppliers into -- on the big cloud vendors like yourself are talking about weaker shipments into the suppliers. But you guys have seen very stable growth. I mean, Azure growth was dead solid from Q1 to Q2. Can you help us understand how the sort of capital intensity of some of these cloud businesses has been changing over time?","Satya Nadella","Sure. First of all, thank you, Keith, for the question. It is very true that, at this point, we have seen these very large digital transformational efforts and projects that we are partnered with. And they span, quite frankly, all the industries. I think in the last quarter, you saw in health care, in retail, in financial services. In fact, I sort of internally think of them as what our relationships with our traditional OEM partners in the PC ecosystem were. At this point, some of the partnerships we have with customers are of that same magnitude. And that just speaks to, I think, what's happening in the economy, which is every company is becoming a digital company, and essentially what used to be COGS and operating expense is all going digital. From a mix of services, it starts always with, I would say, infrastructure, so this is the edge and the cloud, the infrastructure being used as compute. In fact, you could say the measure of a company going digital is the amount of compute they use. So that's the base. ","Then on top of that, of course, all this compute means it's being used with data. So the data estate, one of the largest things that happens is people consolidate the data that they have and so that they can reason over it. And that's where things like AI services all get used. So we definitely see that path of -- where they're adopting the layers of Azure. But it doesn't stop in Azure. In fact, if you take Walgreens Boots Alliance, it was Microsoft 365 as well as Azure. In many cases, it's Dynamics 365. Any IoT project on Azure leads to a Dynamics field service project in most instances. So we're seeing the breadth and depth of our cloud offering, which is what we are really architected to have real synergies in the context of what our customers want to achieve, and that's what we are seeing. And one comment before I throw it over to Amy. Even on that -- our own demand for it, we don't see any change. In fact, it's very healthy and we think that it'll continue to be healthy. And if anything, at our scale, as you can imagine, we are becoming much more efficient in how we use software to utilize the capacity we have. So we have significant gains in utilization across our estate. So with that, I'll turn over to Amy.","Amy Hood","And Keith, the thing I would add in addition to Satya's comment about investing and investing materially to make these improvements in performance and utilization, we've always had and seen, as you all have gotten a bit used to, it can be a little bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter, and so we expect a sequential growth into Q3, which is really just a movement that happens from time to time. Our guidance, really, in terms of overall capital spend is unchanged from 90 days ago even if the timing of that can move month-to-month.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.","Karl Keirstead","Amy, I just wanted to ask you a question about your March quarter guidance. The total looks terrific. The only area that might decelerate a little bit appears to be the Intelligent Cloud segment, where 17%, I think at the midpoint, it implies still amazing but down from 20-plus percent the last 3 quarters. So I'm wondering if you could just focus on that for a second and help us understand what some of the variables inside that Intelligent Cloud business are that might be impacting next quarter growth.","Amy Hood","Thanks, Karl. The first place to start is obviously FX. We've got a 2 point headwind on that range of 16% to 18%, so if you think about that and move your midpoint up to 19%. And then I think within that guidance, there's a reasonable amount of confidence that the server products and services KPI will remain quite healthy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.","Mark Moerdler","I have a question for Satya and then one for Amy if you don't mind. Satya, in the different documents related to the earnings this quarter you have on product launches, et cetera, there's a discussion in there on the Microsoft launch of the Quantum Development Kit. Can you give us a bit of color on how you're thinking about quantum computing today, where the -- how soon the opportunity, where is it in the maturation? And then I have a follow-up for Amy.","Satya Nadella","Sure. Thanks, Mark. So the way we think about our overall investment, I think of this as a systems investment because at the scale at which we operate, the Intelligent Cloud and the intelligent edge infrastructure, which you all track as Azure, you got to remember it's the core platform that's powering everything from our gaming ambitions to what we are doing with Microsoft 365, to what we are doing with Dynamics 365 and of course, our third-party business in Azure. So that's the core platform. And now when you think about the scale at which we operate, it is very important for us to make sure that every new breakthrough that happens in the system architecture that can improve efficiencies in what is distributed computing is something that we stay on the forefront of it. So that's why we have a very long-term view on Quantum, and the things that we did even in this last quarter is take things like the quantum simulator stuff and bring it to Azure. In fact, we are seeing very good adoption in scientific labs, in universities and some pharma companies and others who are looking at really building their quantum algorithmic promise long before the quantum computer cloud is real so that they are ready to be able to take advantage of that computing resource. So that's how we look at it, but you got to remember that before Quantum, there are many byproducts of a quantum effort that have significant implications on how we get more competitive, efficient in terms of providing computing to the world. So that's one of the reasons why you hear us talk about quantum as the long-term goal, but you can fully expect us to take a lot of learnings, advances in that roadmap and bring them to market earlier.","Mark Moerdler","I really appreciate it. Amy, you gave a lot of color this quarter, but in the quarter, there was overall transactional weakness. Can you give us a little more color? Is there something structural driving it, U.S. government, China weakness? Were there just simply less contracts up for renewal? Or is it the cloud? Any additional data would be helpful.","Amy Hood","Thanks, Mark, for the question. The only transactional weakness I felt in the quarter at all was what we covered, which was the OEM impact from the chip supply, which was about 1.5 points of growth on MPC, and the Office Consumer impact, which was secondary impact of the PC environment plus some execution challenges we had that I feel really good that we've gotten to the root of and will get handled in H2. Outside of that, our transactional execution was really precisely as we expected. Office Commercial actually had a pretty reasonable quarter given some of the impacts we had in Q1, a couple of points of impact of extra growth that we talked about. And the product and services KPI on prem and server was also quite good when we think about the balance and what that represents for hybrid demand. We continue to see good demand on DC -- sorry, data center modernization as well as some of the premium SKUs.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.","Philip Winslow","Congrats on the great quarter. Just wanted to focus on Windows. Amy, I think you've guided to low single-digit growth in Windows OEM revenue for Q3. And just wondering if you can sort of help us bridge that because you also talked about inventory levels, Windows being low in the OEMs as well as some mix. So maybe kind of help us bridge the gap between your comments about maybe continued storage as a component but -- the revenue growth. And then the other side of Windows, the Commercial, obviously it's been super strong, but we're starting to lap some -- there's some pretty big growth numbers Q3, Q4 last year, and then, obviously, there's some accounting change with 606. Maybe give us some color there. So I guess, one, on the OEM side and then, two, on the commercial side.","Amy Hood","Great. Thank you. On the OEM side, the way to think about those comments is we do expect inventory levels to likely remain low as we exit the next quarter as well. So think about there having -- because your -- we do expect chip supply to remain constrained. I don't expect to see any impact from changing inventory levels through the next quarter. So I would sort of remove that as one of the mechanisms you're thinking about on overall OEM demand. I do think what we will see in Q3 is we're expecting a little better performance in the Pro side of the market in terms of seeing growth there, and that's probably helping a little bit. To your second question on Office -- I'm sorry, on Windows Commercial overall, our real investment -- and you're right, we are starting to reach some tougher comparables. But a lot of that comparability, which you referenced, is due a little bit of how it's licensed, which is a lot of this is new and gets recognized more upfront in quarter. That's going to continue to have some lumpiness still as we go over the years. As that business continues to grow, it'll get less of that impact. The primary driver in terms of billings is how I tend to think about that, has been pretty consistent. It's been double-digit consistent growth. It tends to look a lot like our Office 365 motion. It's sold with Microsoft 365. It's about the selling motion of E3 and E5 that we talk about. If you could almost take out that 606 impact in the billings team to almost mirror the Microsoft 365 SKUs we sell.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS.","Jennifer Lowe","I appreciate getting the sort of visibility you have into the, as someone earlier alluded to, transactional businesses. It sounds like you feel pretty good or at least stable about the PC outlook for the remainder of this year. But given that Windows is a pretty material driver of profitability at Microsoft, if we do start to see a more protracted decline in PC unit sales and you think about your investments going out through the remainder of this calendar year, are there opportunities to sort of flex down the cost structure at this point to preserve profitability in margins? Or should we assume that much of the investments happening right now are really tied to the commercial cloud and some of the lower margin but higher opportunity businesses and maybe there isn't so much of an offset? Just how should we think about contingency planning if we do see a weaker -- an extended weakening in the global economic climate?","Satya Nadella","Let me start, and Amy, you can add to it. See, first of all, I'd say the opportunity for our shareholders when they think about Microsoft has never been better. When I look at every business becoming a digital business and then take that opportunity and map that to our capability, we have the broadest platform of anyone in the tech sector to really help every customer in every country become that digital business. And we have the business model that aligns with them and their interests and the trust. And so therefore, from a secular perspective, we are all in on making sure that we invest in our commercial cloud as well as our investments in things like gaming and going after the opportunity that is there in front of us. And as you even think about Microsoft 365, the value proposition of Microsoft 365 transcends Windows and Office on Windows. We think about the relevance of our applications across all device sockets. We think about the security, identity management, information protection and all that value across all device sockets, so therefore, I feel very, very good about the product investments and the go-to-market investments we are making to really help our shareholders realize that growth potential that's available in what is going to be an increasingly digital world. And I'll let Amy answer.","Amy Hood","Let me just add a little bit, Jennifer, when it comes to really your question around OEM. We know that the signals we get from especially our commercial customers is that there's a healthy demand for the value that exists in Windows 10. We're seeing it in terms of deployments on new and existing devices and the security and manageability value prop that comes with a modern device and the experiences that employers want their employees to have and be able to take advantage of, along with some of the end-of-support deadlines that we have talked about, there is still an opportunity for us to remain focused on and execute on through this calendar year. And I still feel quite good about that, including the signals we're getting in the market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow","I wanted to focus on the data and database side of your business. We saw the acquisition this quarter of the Postgres company. If you think about the ecosystem around the world, a lot of the cloud guys are talking a lot about database. Can you kind of maybe talk a little bit what you see around Cosmos, the whole database offering that you have and what you see in terms of client adoption there?","Satya Nadella","Yes, we feel very, very good about the data platform and the portfolio we have, whether it's on the relational side with obviously SQL and now Postgres support. And then our Cosmos DB has become the leading multi-model, multi-region database. And so therefore, I feel very, very good, as I said even earlier, whenever these customer digital transformation projects start, they start by really getting their data into shape. And what that means is you bring all the data in its native format. You need the full comprehensive platform and then the ability to able -- to do things like AI and analytics on top of all of this data. So our data platform growth as well as competitiveness is very good and increasing. And we're the only provider still who can do this in a hybrid way. That is the consistency between what happens at the edge to the cloud when it comes to data tier becomes even more important as edge scenarios become very, very real. So therefore, I feel very good about our data story in Citus, which is the company we just bought for the Postgres capability, is something that we are very excited about.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter Pritchard","Question on Azure and growth numbers this quarter were very strong. I'm wondering if you can talk about just your visibility into the growth in that business. A lot of that comes from enterprise agreements and commitments customers are making. Some of that's on sort of credits that they have to consume. I'm not sure if you're willing to give us sort of a growth kind of trajectory as you look out forward, but I think there's a lot of investor interest in terms of how much visibility [Technical Difficulty] your perspective.","Amy Hood","Maybe I'll start, Satya. In terms of the Azure growth, most of the Azure growth is really driven by consumption. So this is about getting projects started, making those projects successful, making sure customers feel the value and get the value of their investment. And increasingly, that's why we've been talking a bit about the form of these contracts changing, larger commitments being made that are -- that land in bookings but not in unearned, right? So it's a bit different mechanism than you think about having in our standard EA, where it goes to the balance sheet and gets earned off. These are contracts that unless it is used and deployed and a customer gets value from, it does not land into the P&L. And so the part that looks a little bit more EA-like is the part we've talked about on a per-user basis, right? That's something you're going to deploy, whether that's EMS, is the best example. And so those have the characteristic you talk about, which is that it really comes from the EA and the recognition is more predictable. But on the IaaS and PaaS layer, that's about our execution each quarter and especially making an impact. The way that -- the only other way that, that Azure number, to think about it, is when we've talked about the Azure Hybrid Benefits that exist, those show up actually in the on-prem number, right, even if they ultimately get used on the Azure side. So there actually is some Azure Benefit revenue ultimately that shows \"is on-prem.\"","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.","Mark Murphy","Satya, in the last couple of quarters, you have announced a number of these large multiyear Azure wins with companies, including Walmart and Albertsons and Walgreens, as Keith mentioned earlier. I'm just curious whether you're sensing an amplified tailwind there due to Amazon's ambitions to actually compete with grocers and retailers and health care providers and other industries. And then, Amy, I am assuming that those wins are captured by this robustness that we're seeing in the commercial bookings growth, which is up 22%. But I guess, I don't understand if they're fully captured, if this is a consumption-based structure. Or are we only seeing a portion of those bookings if we look in the unearned revenue and in the KPI?","Satya Nadella","Okay, I'll start. I mean, the first thing is to -- we need to have product truth and product competitiveness and capability to, first of all, play, and that's where I'll start. We have a very, very good compelling platform across our commercial cloud. That's what's really leading us to be able to do these types of partnerships that you referenced. It's clear that we also have a fantastic alignment of our business model with the interest of our customers. In other words, we want to make sure that we are, in fact, making our customers fully capable digital companies in their own right, whether they're in retail, whether they're in oil and gas, whether they're in health care because that's really what's in our long-term interest, which is to ensure that they have full digital capability, and then they'd use the subscriptions and the consumption capabilities of our cloud. And of course, that means we have a trusted relationship, which is a competitive advantage in a world where some of our competitors have more complex business models, where in some cases they give them platforms, in other cases where they compete with them or tax them. That's definitely something that I'm sure our customers pay attention to. But we are very focused on making sure that we have the right product that's competitive in the marketplace and then our business model that's long-term aligned with the interest of our customers, and we'll stay focused on it.","Amy Hood","And to your second question, most of these larger contracts are showing up in that commercial bookings number, and we referenced that on these -- when we say the longer -- larger, longer-term contracts, that is where they show up. Very little shows up in unearned, and that's the distinction that we're starting to see in many of these Azure contracts. It will, as it gets used, go straight to that Azure revenue growth number on the P&L.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel.","Brad Reback","Satya, of late, you talked about Microsoft 365 being the new operating system, and I know you talked a bunch about that today. But as you think about going after the front-line worker, people you could not get to previously, how should we think about the TAM expansion from that from a seat standpoint?","Satya Nadella","Yes, a good example of the first-line opportunity was something that you could have seen at NRF this January. We launched, for example, Teams for first-line workers, which had things like shift worker capabilities, secure messaging. One of the challenges in retail and in many other industries is what's that messaging tool that has actually got the security framework that they expect of any other enterprise tool as opposed to using one of these consumer messaging tools, which then all the liability is with the enterprise. So that's the opportunity we see, whether it's -- for all front line, whether it's in manufacturing, whether it's in retail, whether it's in healthcare. So that's the TAM expansion. So in other words, it can be -- start with Teams. It can start with some of our devices in the first-line worker. For example, one of the things that we see the most traction for HoloLens is with first-line workers. People in manufacturing and other in field service, where they were never issued a standard laptop or even a phone are being issued a HoloLens as their first computing device, and that's just because of the productivity it drives. So those are the kinds of TAM expansion we see across Microsoft 365.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray.","Aleksandr Zukin","Satya, you guys reorganized the sales and customer service organization about 18 months ago quite substantially, and you're now seeing the benefits both around much larger deals and broader deals that we've discussed on this call for your products across the portfolio. I wanted to ask, as the deal complexity increases, are you seeing any impact to your sales cycles as a result? And is there any impact that you're seeing on sales cycles maybe not from that but from kind of the macro volatility that we've seen in the headlines?","Satya Nadella","I mean, overall, a lot of our transformation, whether it's on the engineering side or on the marketing side or on the sales side, have all been driven by the opportunity we see with the broad platform capabilities we have across all of our commercial clouds, whether it's Azure or Dynamics 365 or Microsoft 365. So it is true that the deals are much broader, deeper. The relationships with the customers that we have now signed up with span a lot more of our capability and also drives a lot more of their own ambition. So for sure, the sales cycles are different. But at the same time, you've got to remember, at Microsoft, we do have a lot of different business that we do with the customers, which may include some things like refreshes of their on-premise infrastructure all the way to some very high-ambition digital transformation projects. So I would say we are well equipped to deal with that complexity and the variability of what our customers want us to be helping them with. And that's where a lot of the transformation we have done internally is helping us accelerate our Cloud business.","Amy Hood","And I think the way we've seen this in the field is -- and our sales organization has been not unlike some of these Dynamics transactions or the Power platform transactions that require a fundamental understanding of business process and the changes you're trying to implement. Those do naturally have longer sales cycles. Azure has many of those same attributes at the higher end of the complexity and digital transformation Satya's talking about. And in these very large transactions, many of which we've been signing recently, where you'll see some of that volatility would be in bookings. But I think, in general, the goal is to have -- and continue to build on that business, but certainly, that would be where the \"volatility\" would show up.","Michael Spencer","Okay. Well, thanks, Alex. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.","Satya Nadella","Thank you all.","Amy Hood","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation."],"14545":["Microsoft Corp.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we will share the results of the final quarter of the year and our optimism for the year ahead.","We delivered $22.2 billion in revenue this quarter and $93.6 billion total revenue for the fiscal year 2015, an increase of 8% year over year. We pushed forward in our transformation by focusing our investment in areas where we have differentiation and significant opportunity for future growth in large addressable markets. We galvanized around our mission and ambitions. We aligned our structure to deliver better products at a more rapid pace. We focused our advertising business on search. We focused our mapping efforts on higher-level experiences and development services. We restructured our phone portfolio so that we can operate more efficiently near term while driving reinvention long term. We invested more in new mobile applications like Wunderlist, Acompli, and Sunrise. We also strengthened our enterprise cloud platform by acquiring Revolution Analytics, Datazen, and BlueStripe in this quarter alone. And we are at the threshold of the Windows 10 launch.","I'm proud of these steps and I'm proud of the results we delivered in tandem. In cloud alone, our annualized commercial cloud run rate surpassed $8 billion this quarter, and the revenue grew 88% year over year. We are on a strong trajectory towards our goal of $20 billion in fiscal year 2018.","With that as the backdrop, I want to walk you through the progress we are making in each one of our three ambitions. Let me start with reinventing productivity in business processes, including our efforts across Office 365 and Dynamics. We continue to see strong demand for Office 365 and Dynamics products. We now have more than 15 million Office 365 consumer subscribers, and customers are signing up at a pace of nearly 1 million per month. In addition, we surpassed 150 million downloads of Office Mobile on iOS and Android and have introduced a new version of Office for the Mac.","In the commercial space, the number of Office 365 users continues to climb, with seats growing 74% year over year. Office 365 now is in four out of five Fortune 500 enterprises, and more than 55% of the installed base is on premium workloads. It is clear that we have success moving customers to the cloud, given half of all the enterprise agreement renewals were for Office 365 this quarter.","Small and medium businesses offer one of our best opportunities for new growth in the cloud. In fact, for more than a year now, we have seen 50,000 new SMB customers adopt Office 365 every month.","Last week at our Worldwide Partner Conference, we announced our new Office 365 Premium SKU for business, E5. Now our customers will get rich new voice functionality in Skype for Business with Cloud PBX and PSTN Conferencing, deep analytics with Delve analytics and Power BI Pro, and advanced security features such as lockbox and advanced threat protection. With E5, we have expanded our market opportunity for Office 365 by more than $50 billion. This new E5 SKU and the launch of Office 2016 will drive one of the biggest new businesses for us.","Let's now turn to CRM. This market alone is $20 billion-plus and has massive opportunity for reinvention. Mainstreaming Dynamics into our engineering sales and marketing efforts gives us the ability to participate in this large and growing market in a more meaningful way.","Last week we announced the acquisition of FieldOne, which helps strengthen our Dynamics CRM customer service offering. This quarter, total paid seats for Dynamics CRM online increased 140% year over year, and we have more than 8 million paid Dynamics seats across CRM and ERP in total, up 25% year over year. This creates a great foundation for future growth in our Dynamics business.","Next, I want to share our progress in building the intelligent cloud platform with Azure. Again this quarter, we have seen proof that preference for our cloud staff services creates a flywheel of growth for our cloud platform services. In Azure, both revenue and compute usage increased by triple digits year over year. We tripled our revenue from Azure premium services this quarter. In the enterprise mobility services, we now have 17,000 customers.","Appeal for Visual Studio Tools has grown to include developers beyond our traditional base with some of the decisions we made to embrace open source with .Net and support across platform development. Since November, we have seen more than 5 million downloads of Visual Studio Community, the fastest ever adoption of a Visual Studio product. Visual Studio Online continues to gain momentum, with over 3.1 million registered users.","Business intelligence and analytics is another large, rapidly growing market for us with an opportunity of more than $15 billion. We are focused on strengthening our offers in this space. Just last week we announced the availability of Cortana Analytics Suite, our fully-managed big data and advanced analytics solution. We're not only building the tools but are also delivering the insights customers need to transform their businesses.","Security is a key priority for our enterprise customers and another $30 billion market opportunity for us, and we are building capability to meet customers' need. For example, we've made significant investments in security with Azure Key Vault, enabling customers to protect data in the cloud with secure key management and encryption customers can control. We have four new certifications for Azure, bringing our certification and at the station total to 22 globally, more than any other cloud platform today.","Our third bold ambition is to create more personal computing experiences with Windows and our devices. I am thrilled we are just days away from the start of Windows 10. It's the first step towards our goal of 1 billion Windows 10 active devices in the fiscal year 2018. Our aspiration with Windows 10 is to move people from meeting to choosing to loving Windows. Based on feedback from more than 5 million people who have been using Windows 10, we believe people will love the familiarity of Windows 10 and the innovation. It's safe, secure, and always up to date. Windows 10 is more personal and more productive with Cortana, Office, universal apps, and Continuum. And Windows 10 will deliver innovative new experiences like Inking on Microsoft Edge and gaming across Xbox and PCs, and also opens up entirely new device categories such as Hololens.","Windows 10 will deliver significant value to enterprise customers as well. Windows 10 provides advanced security capabilities with additional features for hardware-based security, mobile work and data protection. It also provides a single device management platform across all devices, from phones to laptops to Internet of Things devices. And Windows 10 helps enterprises stay up to date with Windows Update for Business and Windows Store for Business.","While the PC ecosystem has been under pressure recently, I do believe that Windows 10 will broaden our economic opportunity and return Windows to growth. First, we have an OEM ecosystem that is creating exciting new hardware designs for Windows 10. In fact, our OEM partners have over 2,000 distinct devices or configurations already in testing for Windows 10 upgrades as well as hundreds of new hardware designs. We are delighted that the first of these exciting new devices will start to be available on Windows 10 launch day, and by this holiday we will be selling the widest range of Windows hardware ever available.","Second, we will generate new growth through gross margin on our own differentiated first-party premium device portfolio. We will also significantly reduce our losses on the phone by operating more effectively and efficiently with a more focused portfolio.","Third, we will grow monetization opportunities across the commercial and consumer space. In the enterprise, customers will continue to value our unparalleled management security, app dev, and servicing capability. And for consumers, Windows 10 creates monetization opportunities with store, search, and gaming. We are confident that these are the right levers to revitalize Windows and restore growth. The progress we made this quarter and the forward-looking guidance that Amy will share shows the opportunity for renewed growth is real.","In hardware, both Surface and Xbox had an incredible Q4. We more than doubled Surface revenue to nearly $900 million this quarter, capping off a year in which it delivered more than $3.6 billion in revenue. Both consumers and enterprise customers love this device. Surface is clearly a product where we have gotten the formula right, earned fans, and can apply this formula to other parts of the hardware portfolio.","Gaming is an important scenario for Windows 10, and our success with Xbox this quarter gives us a strong starting position heading into launch. Xbox Live users grew 22% this quarter and logged nearly 3.5 billion hours of gameplay. Our growing fan base is excited for the best games lineup in our history. All of this comes together with Windows 10, when fans can connect with each other, stream all of their Xbox One games to Windows 10, and experience the best virtual reality platform given our partnership with Oculus Rift and Valve.","In search, Bing will now power both differentiated experiences on Windows 10 such as Cortana as well as search and search advertising across the AOL portfolio sites in addition to the partnership we already have with Yahoo!, Amazon, and Apple. With advertising revenue growth of 21% year over year, Bing will transition to profitability in the coming fiscal year.","It's been a strong year of progress. Above all else, I'm optimistic about our future. Our cloud services are accelerating fast, and Windows is positioned for renewed growth.","With that, I'll hand it over to Amy to talk about this quarter's results in more detail. I look forward to rejoining you after that for questions. Thank you.","Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks and good afternoon, everyone.","Our fourth quarter results demonstrate the strong progress that we've made as a company over the past year. Key strategic initiatives such as cloud, first-party hardware, and consumer services delivered significant growth as well as improved profitability.","Commercial customer renewals remained healthy with strong adoption of cloud services and a higher mix of annuity than we expected. And our disciplined approach to resource allocation has allowed us to increase investment in the growth initiatives Satya mentioned while reducing the company's operating expenses. This allows us to better compete in markets with structural growth where we feel we have unique competitive advantages. With that said, I will start with an overview of our financial performance before moving into a more detailed discussion of the results.","This quarter we recorded an impairment charge related to our phone hardware business and incurred integration and restructuring expenses. Additionally, like most multinational companies, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to have a significant impact on our reported results. Accordingly, when applicable, I'll give results and growth rates adjusting for the impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses, but also in constant currency to help you better understand the underlying business fundamentals.","Revenue was $22.2 billion, down 5% and down 2% in constant currency. As a reminder, last year included $382 million of revenue that we recognized at the conclusion of our commercial agreement with Nokia. Significant gross margin improvement across commercial cloud, Surface, and our consumer services helped to mitigate the impact on gross margin from the decline in D&C licensing. Total gross margin declined 7% and 3% in constant currency. Operating income declined 3% and 1% in constant currency. Earnings per share were $0.62, growth of 11% and growth of 8% in constant currency. Unearned revenue grew 1% to $25.3 billion and 7% in constant currency. Commercial unearned was better than expected, as we saw a higher mix of annuity in the quarter.","From a geographic perspective, the majority of markets performed in line with our expectations. The notable exception was Brazil, where inflation and macroeconomic volatility weighed on our performance. Overall, macro conditions remain a challenge in some large opportunity markets like China, Russia, Japan, and Brazil. There was slightly less impact from currency than our expectation.","With that backdrop, I'll move to a detailed discussion of our results. Q4 last year effectively marked the end of the XP refresh cycle. It impacted our Windows OEM and non-annuity volume licensing as well as our Office non-annuity volume licensing results. During that time, OEM revenue exceeded that of the underlying PC market, driven by a higher attach of Pro, particularly within the developed markets. This quarter Pro declined by roughly 21%. And similar to last quarter, we saw Pro attach remain at pre-XP levels, even with the underlying softness in the business PC market.","The annuity portion of Windows licensing grew again on a constant currency basis, with non- annuity revenue declining due to XP. Windows non-Pro revenue declined 27%, as OEMs tightly managed PC inventory ahead of the Windows 10 launch, particularly in developed markets. In our view, this is a healthy state for the channel as we head into a transformational launch that starts next week.","Consumer Office 365 had another strong quarter of net subscriber growth. Overall, consumer Office revenue results reflected the decline in the underlying driver of that business, developed market consumer PC sales. Within D&C licensing, the transition to Office 365 accounted for 13 points, and the impact of Japan's PC market accounted for another 19 points.","We had another impressive quarter in search, with revenue growth of 21% and 25% in constant currency, driven by increases in both volume and revenue per search.","As Satya said, revenue from Surface more than doubled this quarter, with continued strength of Surface Pro 3 and the launch of Surface 3. Enterprise sales accelerated this quarter, and sales of Surface 3 were particularly strong to educational customers. Our differentiated products as well as improved discipline and execution helped to improve gross margins by $450 million this quarter and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2015.","Within Xbox, strong growth in consoles, online transactions, and first-party games helped to drive revenue growth of 27%. This progress as well as the excitement we generated at E3 with Xbox exclusive gaming content and backwards compatibility demonstrates the building momentum that exists within the Xbox ecosystem.","In phones, we sold 8.4 million Lumias, which is an increase over last year's full-quarter sales. ASPs, however, have continued to decline. Gross margin declined this quarter, driven by lower per unit margins on Lumia devices as well as reduced volumes in non-Lumia phones.","As announced on July 8, we are changing our approach in this business and are focused on delivering differentiated experiences for our targeted customer segments while improving our operating results.","Moving to our commercial results, total revenue across our two segments grew slightly in USD and 4% in constant currency. Our contracted-not-billed balance, which is a key indicator of customer commitment, reached an all-time high of over $24.5 billion, and it reached this level even with the significant appreciation in the U.S. dollar. Constant currency bookings were flat to the prior year, though as a reminder, last year commercial bookings grew 23% on the strength of a large renewal base as well as the end of XP, discussed earlier.","Our Office commercial business continues to transition to Office 365. We again grew the installed seat base for Office, Exchange, SharePoint, and Skype for Business. Office 365 allows us to have a deeper ongoing relationship with all of our customers, which in turn provides us with the opportunity to expand and grow our business over time. Because of this transition as well as weakness in Japan and the impact of XP, Office commercial products and services grew 1% in constant currency, quite similar to Q3.","Dynamics revenue grew 15% on a constant currency basis, driven by the strong CRM results Satya talked about and our ERP business, which saw 35% growth in customers this quarter.","Server products and services grew 4% and 9% in constant currency, continuing to outperform our peers in the enterprise software sector. SQL Server share growth continued, as customers value its high performance and lower cost of ownership. Revenue and licenses of Windows Server grew against the backdrop of a declining server hardware market; and in the public cloud space, yet another quarter of significant Azure usage growth. Additionally, we significantly grew the gross margin percentage in our commercial other segment, increasing 13 points to over 43%.","Moving to operating expenses, which declined 9% or 4% in constant currency, our continued disciplined approach has allowed us to incrementally fund strategic initiatives without having to increase our expense base.","Other income was favorable to our expectations, driven by gains on foreign currency and sales of investments.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24% and was at the high end of our guided range, due in part to strong performance in our computing and gaming hardware segment in the U.S.","We returned $6.7 billion to shareholders this quarter, nearly double the amount from last year.","With that overview of the current quarter, let me turn to our outlook, starting with a few overall comments. As has been communicated over the past couple of months, the accounting for Windows 10 will change. We will be deferring a portion of Windows 10 revenue, primarily OEM, and recognizing it over time, generally two to four years. As shared previously, the initial deferral and the subsequent recognition of those deferrals will be netted in Corporate and Other in our segment reporting. Most importantly, underlying billings and cash flow won't change. Therefore, our commentary in this and subsequent earnings calls, including our guidance, will focus on results prior to the net deferral impact, which we believe is the best reflection of business health.","With that background, let me share some thoughts on fiscal 2016. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar will continue to have a significant impact on results over the course of FY 2016, assuming rates across our largest currencies, the euro, Japanese yen, and the British pound, stay in line with current rates, and that the geographic mix of revenue stays as forecasted. In our non-annuity businesses, the impact is immediate as the revenue is recognized in quarter. In our annuity business, revenue is deferred and the impact is delayed as we earn the revenue off the balance sheet.","In total, we expect FX will negatively impact total revenue growth by five points in each quarter of H1, with seven points of negative impact in our commercial segments. H1 would be the peak of the FX headwinds. And in H2, we expect FX to have three points of negative impact in total and roughly four points of negative impact on our commercial revenue. With Windows 10, we expect momentum to build throughout the year, as we and our partners bring new devices, applications, and services to market. We expect this to benefit our business results in the second half of the fiscal year.","With the strength in Xbox and Xbox Live along with the launch of Halo 5 in October, Xbox will continue to grow both fans and profitability.","With the recently announced changes in phone, there will be significant revenue declines year over year in the phone segment each quarter. With the proactive measures we've taken to reduce our cost structure, overall losses will also decline for the fiscal year. We would expect the majority of that improvement in the second half of the year once the restructuring efforts are materially complete. Bing will be profitable in FY 2016. And assuming the macro environment is stable, we expect that our commercial momentum will continue, highlighted by growth in our commercial cloud. We remain on track to achieve our $20 billion commercial cloud ambition in fiscal 2018.","We now expect operating expenses to be $32.1 billion to $32.4 billion, which is lower than the guidance we provided in April. The lower guidance reflects the savings from our restructuring of the phone business as well as important investments to drive top line growth as we support Windows 10, our first-party hardware efforts, as well as sales head count to accelerate our leadership position in the commercial cloud. We expect our full-year tax rate to be 24% plus or minus one point, excluding the net impact from the Windows 10 deferral.","Now to Q1, starting with Devices and Consumer. In licensing we expect revenue to be $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. This range reflects Windows revenue roughly in line with the PC market. Within Consumer Office, we expect to transition to Office 365 subscriptions to continue. In computing and gaming hardware, we expect revenues to be $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion. As a reminder, we launched Surface Pro 3 in late June last year, with launch benefits extending into Q1. As far as hardware, we expect revenue to be approximately $900 million, reflecting our change in approach. We expect gross margin in phone to improve sequentially in Q1. In devices and consumer other, we expect revenue to be $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, with continued growth in Bing, Consumer Office 365, and Xbox Live transactions.","And in commercial, as I discussed previously, we expect a significant FX headwind this quarter. Our constant currency growth is expected to be about 7% in Q1, which assumes we continue to take share in key markets and build momentum in the new areas we have entered. With the negative impact of FX, we expect revenue to be roughly flat.","On commercial licensing, we expect revenue of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, with a continued shift to annuity; and in commercial other, with the significant growth in our cloud revenue of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion.","We expect COGS to be $7.0 billion $7.2 billion, with the variability being driven by the hardware segment. We expect operating expenses to be $7.6 billion to $7.7 billion. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. Given the current FX environment, we expect our net cost of hedging to increase and other income and expense to be negative $200 million.","Excluding the Windows 10 deferral and the impact of foreign currency, we expect the sequential decline in unearned to be slightly better than historic seasonality, driven by the growing mix of annuity revenue.","In closing, I'm proud of the tremendous amount of progress that our company has made over the past year. We've improved how we operate in virtually every sense. These changes have allowed us to aggressively invest in areas that will drive future growth for the company. I'm looking forward for a better position to capitalize on the significant opportunities ahead of us.","With that, let me turn it back over to Chris for the Q&A.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Amy. We'll now move to Q&A. Operator, please repeat your instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Phil Winslow from Credit Suisse.","Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks, guys, and congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to double-click on Office 365. You guys showed another huge quarter of growth in terms of your consumer seat count, and I think it was 86% growth on the commercial other side for Office 365. I'm wondering if you could just drill into both the consumer and then enterprise side, just the trends you're seeing there. And obviously the guidance you all just provided, it looks like you expect those trends to continue in Q1, so any color there would be great.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yes, I'll take that. Overall, we are very excited about the growth we are seeing in Office 365. On the consumer side, as you noted, we are growing 1 million subs a month, and that's fantastic growth for us. The consumer value, especially now that we have even all the endpoints covered with Office, the definition of Office and where all it's present is also changed, and that all accrues to consumers being willing to have a subscription relationship with us.","On the enterprise side, the growth remains very exciting for us, and the growth comes in multiple forms. It comes in the form of just the EAs renewing more to Office 365. It also comes in the form of some of the more comprehensive suites, the E3 and the new E5. That's the commitment we are seeing. And we also see small businesses. I talked about the 50,000 businesses, small and medium-sized businesses each month signing up for Office 365. That's pretty unprecedented. Having been in the server business all my life, I've never seen a lot of the small business customers adopt some of the rich capabilities like it's possible now, and that's great growth as well. And that cloud revenue number that is the 88% is all up cloud revenues inclusive of Office 365, EMS, and Azure. And it's good to see that kind of growth at that kind of scale now with $8 billion.","Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.","One thing I would add, Phil, to that is an important dynamic that we're seeing in Office 365. As we are having this momentum build, in fact we talked about some of the new customers we're adding, and the way we see that is the install base growing. And we were able to see that this quarter across all the core workloads in Office. And when you think about why that's so critical long term, it's our ability to sell some of the workloads Satya actually referenced that will be in E5 when it launches. They have the capability of upgrading on a more consistent basis using more of these premium services. So when you can both add to your install base and add overall market opportunity, we do feel good about our line of sight in that business for our long-term goals.","Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys, and congrats again.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Okay, thank you, Phil. We'll take the next question now, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS.","Brent J. Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Satya, the server business continues a steady outperformance and, as Amy pointed out, better growth than your peers. I guess a couple questions as it relates to the Windows 2003 retirement and any impact you're seeing there. And then secondarily, if you could, just comment on some of the new product launches. It seems like there's a stack of new solutions that are coming on the server side that look pretty exciting. Your partners are excited about it. If you could highlight what you see as the most interesting from your perspective over the next several quarters. Thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Overall, I'd start even with the bold view that my server business is not a legacy business. We fundamentally think about servers as the extension of the cloud. I even describe it architecturally as the edge of our cloud. Every server, for example, has things like disaster recovery, backup, and tier-ing with the cloud. And so we will continue to push that differentiation because I think that view architecturally and the delivery of it is what makes us pretty unique. And you see it in the numbers. Our servers even this quarter grew 9%. And compared to the industry peers, we're obviously gaining share with Windows Server, on SQL Server, and pretty much all of our management and security products as well.","And going forward, we have a fantastic lineup of servers, not just the infrastructure, but even SharePoint, Exchange, Lync Server continues to have significant on-premise deployment. So as our cloud continues to grow, obviously, we are getting where there is more capability in the cloud. We're incenting customers and our partners to move to the cloud. But at the same time, we are going to have a great server wave. I'm excited about our SQL product. I think it goes into the first preview next \u2013 in fact, tomorrow. And that product I think is a pretty revolutionary product because for the first time you can take a single table in a database and you would tier it with the cloud, and that kind of capability only we can provide, and that's something that I'm looking forward to.","Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And, Brent, to your specific question on Windows Server 2003, we did have a good quarter, as we talked about, in Windows Server. But in general, that business, unlike the quiet upgrades that we see, just because so much of the business is already on annuity, you don't see that type of incremental impact in an in-quarter release. That isn't to say there isn't ample opportunity for us to make sure we upgrade customers to the higher-value product and more secure and more manageable offerings we have in the server business.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Brent. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you, nice quarter. I want to drill in, in terms of the move to the cloud. This quarter the year-over-year server product and services revenue growth was slower than it was in the past quarters. How much of that is because you're seeing now some revenue shift to Azure, or is it not yet seeing any revenue shift going? And then I have a follow-up question.","Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Why don't I take that one, and we'll see what Mark's follow-up is? At 9% growth and continuing to take share, I feel like our performance in this continues to be a positive outlier to the peer group. And for me, that type of performance in double digits for the year, I still feel quite good about.","In general, what's interesting I think is you're getting to the crux of it is do we have incremental workloads that are unique to the cloud. We continue to see that. The very best example, frankly, as Satya mentioned in his comments, which is our EMS performance, Enterprise Mobility Suite offerings. It's taking something that's very unique, builds off of our core in the server business, and allows us to both grow and add new perspective there. So I don't think of it as reflecting a bigger shift than we've seen in particular this quarter. Also, if you'll remember, a year ago we had a very big base of expirations in Q4 and had very strong performance a year ago. So I don't look at it as a direct trend line.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","The only thing I'll add is when I look at the total growth of Azure, the growth that's coming now from some of the premium services, these are businesses that we actually did not ever participate on premise at all. Even EMS, when I think about our management, our management was just about Windows management. But we now have management data protection and identity systems that cross all devices in the enterprise, including the Internet of Things, and that makes it pretty exciting. And that growth is great to see.","Same thing on server management, we have a new suite called the Operations Management Suite, which also spans all the cloud units as well as on-premise units. Cortana Analytics, we never participated in any of the advanced analytics workloads at all in spite of all the success we had in the database business. So I'm excited about built new workloads that in many cases are born in the cloud workloads where we are expanding our market opportunity and continuing to outperform our peers and grab share when it comes to on-premise.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. Switching gears a bit, on Windows, obviously you're seeing some amount of delay due to Windows 10 on the OEM side. Can you give maybe a little more higher color in terms of how you're thinking about that, how big a delay is it, how much we could see that starting to be replaced next quarter and beyond?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","I'll take that and, Amy, you can add to it. The way the Windows ecosystem works is there are phases to it. And in fact, if anything, this release of Windows 10, just the way we have built it with the Insider program, everything is of course speeding up because in some sense we've taken a very different approach with this Windows-as-a-service even when it comes to OEM relations and how they're able to co-create the products with us.","But that said, there are three distinct phases. The first phase is what I will describe as the upgrade phase. That's what starts in a week's time, and that is a more retail execution and upgrade. Then come the fall, you will see the devices from all the OEMs going into the holiday quarter. And then the enterprise upgrades; in fact, we have a release of enterprise features, which I mentioned in my script, which will ship in that timeframe. And I expect piloting to start and deployments to start in the second half of the fiscal year. So that's how I would think about the OEM as well as enterprise adoption. So my bullishness for Windows 10 is more in the second half of the fiscal year, and of course it will build. It will build starting in a week's time in retail and in the upgrades, but I see this in three phases.","Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And to your specific question, Mark, before every launch we tend to have a tightening in the channel as they prepare and run reasonably lean. This is a healthy state. It's within the range of normal. So I don't think of it as a delay in the way you're talking about it. It is pretty standard in fact, as Satya talked about, in terms of the dynamic. And he mentioned we are feeling I think a lot of excitement from the ecosystem about what's possible with some of the new devices that will come. And so I don't really think of it in that way. I think about it as an encouragement that they want to fill the channel as quickly as they can over the coming quarters with new machines.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you, I appreciate it.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Mark. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.","Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent, nice quarter, guys, and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to drill into the new strategy around the phone business a little bit. The revenue expectation for Q1 I think was below our expectations and I think a point below what the Street was looking for. Can you give us a sense of how you see that business trending over a longer period of time? Because there is a significant restructuring going on and I think \u2013 I would think a lot of guys have a good view in their head of what your expectation is for this business on a revenue run rate basis? Or what do you expect to be selling this year on a going forward basis is right now?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Let me start and then, Amy, you can add to this. The big shift that we are making when it comes to phones is to not think about phones in isolation. That's perhaps the biggest shift because I think about Windows 10 in its entirety, the Windows ecosystem in its entirety. We clearly are going to have premium first-party portfolio, and you've seen some of the numbers, some of the progress we have made in Surface. I feel that we have a formula there that I would like to apply more broadly in terms of growing, just delivering innovation, growing our own economic return for it, stimulating demand, creating categories. All of that is what I want to do broadly. And it applies to phones, it applies to Surface hardware, it applies to Hololens, and that's how I view it.","I believe our participation in the phone segment by itself with Windows phones and Lumia phones being there is important, and that's why we picked the three areas where we have differentiation and we want to focus on it. We're going to have great flagship phones for Windows 10. That's actually a segment we don't today have good devices, and we hope to change that with Windows 10. We have in fact good traction in the business segment. This is business customers who are actually buying phone devices, which is basically a radio with essentially a smartphone to be able to deploy their line-of-business applications. That's where we have pretty unparalleled value, which is we have Visual Studio Online and some of the tools I talked about, so you can generate these apps at a low cost of ownership, manage them, secure them, and deploy them to our phone endpoints, and then of course, management and security. So that's a place where we want to continue to focus.","And in the value smartphones, that's the place where I want us to be much more efficient. We clearly have some value to add there because of the uniqueness of Office and Skype and our services. But at the same time, I think we want to be smart about how many of these phones do we want to generate, how many, which price points we want to participate. That's where you will see the most significant operational changes from how we operated last year to the coming year.","Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And so, Keith, the way that I think about it and I tried to outline it in my comments is that the significant revenue declines quarter over quarter through the year are a reflection of the focused approach we're going to take in phone. It's an approach that we've executed in other hardware segments that I feel is a proven model for us. Our profitability will also improve. More of that comes in the second half of the year structurally as we complete some of the restructuring efforts and those costs come out of our operating expense run rate. But I think that's probably the way to more appropriately think about over time you expect to see gross margin improvement and operating profit improvement as opposed to focusing on the revenue line.","Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And if I could sneak one more in just on the security side of the business, I think a lot of guys have thought traditionally about security as something that Microsoft does to make their platform more secure, and it does provide more confidence in users using your platforms and your tools. On a going-forward basis, is there more of an opportunity for you guys to sell security as more of a standalone opportunity? It's something that's in very high demand today with those looking for more secure solutions. Is that something that could potentially be more of a standalone opportunity for Microsoft on a go-forward basis?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","In fact, we are adding significant value in security. It's much better for us, for example, to add capabilities. There are no (46:55) 365 in security, and that's all in, for example, this new suite that we have just announced called E5, the secure lock box. That's actually a pretty \u2013 a very cool set of features that allow both regulators and businesses to have, for example, audit ability and control over their movement in the cloud. Similarly Azure, where we launched a whole set of security offers around how people can encrypt and manage keys. So those are all security features. We bought a company in Colorado that's essentially a firewall on all your identity management.","So when we talk about enterprise management suite growth, a lot of it is just obviously is management growth, but it's also security and data protection growth. So the approach we're taking is we are essentially creating, to your point, security value around our products, which allows us to participate in essentially a security market that we never did in the ways that we are. So it's more than just launching one point security product. It's much more broadly participating in the security market, and you have seen some of that in the inorganic moves and the suites we have created.","Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you, guys.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Keith. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Amy, just for you on the annuity, it looks like annuity was about 82% of the commercial revenue for the last two quarters. How high do you think that goes? It sounds like you do expect that to continue to go up, although it probably never gets to 100%.","Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.","I do think over the long term you're right. That is how I think about it. And frankly, inherent in the conversation around moving to the cloud with the aggressive targets we've given, that is implied, to your point. And so I think 100% is not the logical answer. There will always be somebody who chooses to purchase on a one-time basis, or there's a logic to it. But I do think over time, we do expect that to trend in that general direction.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And then, Satya, you mentioned CRM in your comments, your prepared comments, which we haven't really heard you talk that much about as an area of interest in the past. I'm wondering. What changed in your view, or how do you look to bring that into it sounds like more the core productivity scenario that you deliver?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Overall, business process collaborations, communications, these category boundaries are things that I believe are going to change. I've always felt that in some sense, most of the time we even automate business processes, but we spend really getting our business done in our communication and collaboration tools. And this impedance is something that I've always dreamt of how do we go forward. And CRM has taken our own Dynamics product, has taken some pretty unique approaches. And quite frankly, I was the one who opened up our communications and collaborations for other CRM vendors.","One of the things that I'm very explicit about is we will have an open platform for other business process applications because it's a very fragmented market the world over, especially if you add SMB. And so we want to be having a platform play as well as our own business applications play, and both of them should be high-growth for us. And in the last year, we just added more focus and we put more selling capacity around it, more marketing capacity, and now for the mainstream that's across Microsoft because I'm a big believer in this because I think we have something unique to add. As opposed to driving our own top line\/bottom line growth, I think we can bring real innovation, and that's what is exciting to see.","And it's not just CRM. I'm actually excited about our ERP business. Some of the numbers that Amy talked about is growth in the seats. And when I think about data as the new currency, we have lots of managed seats and a lot of data which all will move to the cloud. And so things like Power BI and Cortana Analytics can help customers transform. So in fact, that's one of the reasons why we have been very optimistic about some of our new data capabilities because we have the attach capability go out even in the install base of Dynamics.","Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And, Walter, just quickly, this is one of the areas that we have invested in actually leading into this past fiscal year, FY 2015. And the results have actually been better than we anticipated when we first made the investment. So I think we both feel very good about the momentum that's built through the year.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great, thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Walter. We'll go to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, thanks, a question for Amy on the cost control front. It looks like you once again came in below your OpEx guide, but I think the COGS number came a little bit above what you had guided to three months ago, and I'm just wondering if you could talk through that. Obviously, it affects everybody's gross margin calculations. Was it the hardware mix shift? Was it the challenges with the phone business? Perhaps a little color there might help us. Thank you.","Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Sure, Karl. Because of the performance in Xbox and in Surface, you're right, it is a hardware mix shift a bit. We outperformed significantly in both those products in Q4, and that took us a little bit outside the COGS range but not as much as our revenue outperformed. So actually, margins structurally were better than I thought they would be. And so I actually feel quite good with that outperformance and our ability to see that outperformance fall to the bottom line through stronger executional gross margin percentage, particularly in that segment.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, good. That's helpful, thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Karl, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to Azure. You obviously have strong momentum there. Can you talk a little bit about the use cases you see from the enterprise and SMB customers? Is this very much a test and development situation, or are you thinking of broader adoption there as defined by obviously Office 365, et cetera? Thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","At this point, I would say it's pretty broad even use cases for even enterprise customers. There's definitely dev\/test happening. There is production IaaS infrastructure-as-a-service deployment given some of the new high-performance SKUs and storage options that we have. And we've seen significant adoption of SQL, so this is Azure DB, machine learning-as-a-service. One of the things that we realize is as every company out there becomes a software company, beyond even our traditional reach through IT, everyone has a digital office inside the company. They are, in fact, doing things in advanced analytics and using machine learning, and that's a place where we have some very unique capabilities. So that's another place where we're seeing wide adoption.","We are seeing adoption in the building of new front ends, back ends for new front ends, so essentially using Azure as the cloud back end for their mobile apps across Android, iOS, and Windows as well as their web. That's another use case that's high growth for us. And of course, Cortana Analytics; this is the big data side of it. This is happening in IT. It's happening, as I said, in digital offices within each one of the customers. So we have a pretty broad spectrum of use cases. And some of the customers have talked about it in their recent set of conferences, from our Partner Conference to our Ignite Conference. We have been in fact showcasing; even our ad campaign showcases some of these use cases.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect, thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Raimo, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.","Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you. I just had two questions, pretty quick ones. Just to follow up on Azure, I was wondering if you could share with us what you're seeing in the mix between IaaS and PaaS and how you've seen that shift evolve over the last few quarters.","And then secondly, just to follow up I think on Walter's question, yes, you've definitely been focusing on the customer relationship management opportunity and the financials market more. But given the big SaaS incumbent already competing in that area, can you share with us? Do you think you have the assets you need internally to execute against your long-term goals?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Sure. On the IaaS with the SaaS, it's an interesting question. I've not looked at it in isolation, because what happens is at least the use cases, what starts off as IaaS suddenly will start using Azure AD for identity management, will use a little bit of our media services, for example, just doing content and encoding. So there's a mix always. So there's nothing pure PaaS, nothing pure IaaS. That's the trend I see, but it's a split that we should go take a look at and then offline maybe even talk about it. But overall, we see significant amount of IaaS in the last year, because that's probably the place where we had more of a weakness which we have now overcome. And so we're seeing significant growth of IaaS in the enterprise. But the place where we continue to have significant differentiation is in some of these managed services and PaaS. And that I think is the mix on it.","And then on the Dynamics side, I absolutely believe we have a huge opportunity. Having worked in business applications for a long time, first of all, the market is very fragmented. I think people like to talk about leaders, and there are clearly leaders when you go to the very top of the enterprise customers and segments. But the way the market splits into verticals and into horizontals and then the platform affects it, there's plenty of opportunity. For sure, you've got to be one of the players. It will be three players, four players, whatever, but in every technology paradigm, you want to be one of them. We already have a $2 billion-plus Dynamics business. I talked about the total number of seats. And now we have this triple-digit CRM online growth. So I feel that we are in a good position. And I feel that things \u2013 we'll look at and even some of the inorganic means to keep growing it. In fact, the field service acquisition I talked about in my script is an example of that. So that's my bullishness on our business process prospects.","Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Heather. We'll go to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for taking my question. First on OpEx, the guidance, Amy, is impressive. I presume that fully accommodates the restructuring announced two weeks ago. And then last year, you said core Microsoft ex-NBS would be down slightly in OpEx. I wondered if you could provide a similar comment for fiscal 2016 for core Microsoft ex-phone.","Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Sure. Look, I talked a little bit about it, but let me go into a bit of detail on that. I think the first half of your question was does the $32.1 billion to $32.4 billion full-year OpEx guide reflect the timing of the implementation of our restructuring, and it certainly does. And so what you can then see, relating to the second half your question, is that we are taking some of those savings and investing them back into the business in some of these key growth areas we've seen. I outlined three on the call. The third one I probably could have expanded more on.","The first one is Windows 10. The second is the first-party hardware, where we just had such terrific performance again this Q4. And then finally, the third bucket was about accelerating our commercial cloud lead. And I do feel like in that area, we could invest in Office 365 some of the new E5 capabilities and look forward to adding sales capacity to take advantage of that. We'll also add sales capacity across some of the other opportunities we've seen broadly. And so I look and see that as an opportunity to accelerate top line growth.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","And one thing I would just add because a lot of folks even ask about our business process and business applications, I want to build a long-term profitable business. In other words, one of the keys in business apps is you can always get into the trap of overspending in sales and marketing and not having long-term leverage at all. One of the things I feel very good about our position is how do you really build a long-term profitable business; that's front and center to me. So we will not overspend there in sales and marketing because we do believe the products \u2013 in fact, there is a different way to sell even business process applications because of the cloud, and that's something that we want to take advantage of.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And I had have one quick follow-up, if I could. That's helpful. At Analyst Day you did talk about \u2013 I think it was 8% unit growth in the Office ecosystem over the last three years. And it sounds like you continued to see nice unit growth in Office. How should we think about that going forward? Are you fully expecting to continue to see unit growth?","And then also just a clarification, I think your customer lifetime value was based on existing SKUs. So as you introduce E5 and others, does that open up the potential for even higher customer lifetime value? Thanks.","Amy Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Great. I do think the work we showed at the analyst meeting on the importance of increasing the install base across Office and Exchange, that it did occur again this quarter. So I feel good that we're staying on the trajectory that we showed in the projections. I do continue to expect that to happen, as we shared back that last week in April.","On the second half of your question, I tend to think you're right. Generically, each of the examples was quite different. There were people that were upgrading from X to Y. There were people that were just simply moving to the cloud. But one of the things that the cloud, to your point, makes fundamentally possible is the opportunity for us to quickly iterate the opportunity's billed value and deploy it more quickly to customers. Generally, I do think that they will pay us for that, to your specific question. I also think the importance of it is that it tends to also come with higher margin. So our improvement and continued improvement in our commercial cloud gross margin portfolio, I think this is a key criteria of that. So I associate it, yes, with lifetime value, and I also associate it with our ability to move our gross margin percentage up.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great, thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Ross. We have time for one last question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Daniel Ives with FBR Capital.","Daniel H. Ives - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thanks, just one last one just on M&A. Maybe you could just talk through the change in the strategy. Obviously, given what's happened with the Nokia write-down, the security acquisition going to Pivotal-Cisco year, how you're thinking about M&A in the scheme of everything, especially as you guys have been pretty tight on cost controls and everything else. Thanks.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Overall, again, the way I look at it is, first of all I'm most focused on obviously our organic growth. And in there, Amy alluded to this. We've made significant changes in how we've allocated our own organic dollars, both in R&D as well as in sales and marketing. And we'll continue to do that because I think there are significant new opportunities for us to go after, and that will require us to reallocate aggressively, and that to me is core. But beyond that, we will look at inorganic means. When I look at all the acquisitions that we have made over the course of last year and our OpEx guidance for next year shows how disciplined we are in bringing new talent in, be it in R&D, be it in sales and marketing.","So we are not afraid to bring in new capability, but then also questioning what is the allocation we have. Of course, we have done smaller acquisitions, but they add up. They're pretty significant when you add up all the things that we have done in the Office 365 space, all of the things that we have done in the Azure space. So we'll continue to do that. And if anything comes up in M&A which allows us to pursue our strategic vision that we will need to even allocate more to on an OpEx basis, post-acquisition we will look at that. So I won't shy away from it because what's important to us is growth in areas where we have something unique to contribute and long-term profitability.","Daniel H.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.","Satya Nadella","Thank you, Chris, and thank you to everyone joining on the phone. This quarter, we delivered $24.7 billion in revenue, up 10% in constant currency. For the year, we\u2019re at $96.7 billion in revenue, up 5%. I\u2019m proud of the progress, particularly the strength of our commercial cloud results. FY 2017 all up was a tremendous year of customer momentum with cloud, AI, and digital transformation.","Our technology world view of an Intelligent Cloud and an Intelligent Edge is resonating with businesses everywhere. Every customer I talk to is looking for both innovative technology to drive new growth, as well as a strategic partner who can help build their own digital capability. Microsoft is that trusted partner.","Now let\u2019s look at the progress we have made this quarter by segment, starting with Productivity and Business Process. The workplace is transforming from changing employee expectations, a need for more diverse skills and globally distributed teams, and an increasingly complex threat environment. Only Microsoft gives customers a comprehensive approach for this new culture of work.","Earlier this month, we introduced Microsoft 365, which brings together Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility & Security in a complete, secure solution to empower employees, safeguard businesses, and simplify IT management. Microsoft 365 is a fundamental shift in how we design, build, and go-to-market to address customer needs.","Fortune 500 customers Fed-Ex, Dow Chemical, Staples, Progressive Insurance all chose Microsoft 365. The success of our Secure Productive Enterprise offering with its triple digit seat growth is one reason we are investing in Microsoft 365 for businesses of all sizes. We continue to see strong growth of Office 365 with customers like Nissan, Quicken Loans, Key Bank, Deutsche Telekom all choosing Office 365.","And importantly, customers are moving beyond core workloads to adopt higher value workloads. For example, we\u2019ve seen a significant increase in SharePoint usage, which nearly doubled year-over-year. The classroom is also transforming. This quarter, we introduced Microsoft Teams in Office 365 for Education, the digital hub for students and teachers. ","Microsoft Teams gives educators a whole new way to create and inspire modern classroom environments. With rich learning tools and the ability to have digital conversations with students, share materials and manage assignments, Teams gives educators more time to focus on doing what they love most, teaching.","Now I\u2019ll talk about the second part of our ambition in this segment, reinventing business process. We are investing in the LinkedIn flagship experience to create new value for members and customers and accelerate growth. We saw continued momentum in mobile and strong engagement across the platform, with sessions up more than 20% for the third consecutive quarter. And we continue to innovate new ways for members to maximize the value of the platform.","We launched a new messaging overlay resulting in record levels of messages sent on LinkedIn, and introduced a career advice marketplace that will let members easily tap into the professional expertise of more than 500 million members around the world. On top of that, Talent Solutions saw record level growth in confirmed hires and InMail response rates this quarter.","I\u2019ve talked about the opportunities with Dynamics and LinkedIn. Earlier this month, we launched Microsoft Relationship Sales solution, bringing together LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Microsoft Dynamics, as well as Dynamics 365 solutions for Retail and Talent. In a world where customers are increasingly digitizing every business process, we continue to invest and expand our portfolio of modern, modular business applications that are infused with AI.","We also introduced ISV Cloud Embed to make it easier for partners to modernize their existing business process applications, build new ones using Dynamics 365, Power BI, Power Apps, and Microsoft Flow. A global healthcare solution provider and partner Indegene is using it to create a mobile CRM solution for medical sales. Customers like HSBC, Best Buy, and Dolce & Gabbana all chose Dynamics 365 to transform their own businesses processes and experience the benefits of moving away from monolithic suites.","Now, let\u2019s talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $18.9 billion. This quarter\u2019s cloud growth puts us squarely on track to reach the goal we set a little over two years ago of $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR in fiscal 2018. More than ever before, customers are placing their trust in the Microsoft cloud.","Azure revenue accelerated this quarter, growing 97% year-over-year. CIOs and Business Decision Makers increasingly prefer Azure as they make decisions about their cloud strategy. They value our hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted approach. And we keep investing in cloud computing to create broader economic benefit and opportunity, as we\u2019ve done with our South Africa datacenter expansion, bringing Azure to 40 regions globally - more than any other cloud provider. And as part of our commitment to trust, we are helping our customers prepare to be GDPR compliant and meet the requirements of the European Union ahead of the enforcement deadline.","AXA Global, KPMG, Dun & Bradstreet, Hearst, Walgreens, T-Mobile and Sephora all chose Azure to transform their businesses. Box announced that it will bring its content and collaboration services to Azure and plans to use our AI to simplify discovery and use of all types of content across the enterprise. And Baidu will use Azure to take its autonomous driving platform worldwide.","The core currency of any business going forward will be the ability to convert their data into AI that drives competitive advantage. It all starts with having support for the comprehensive data estate spanning Azure Database, Cosmos DB, Data Warehouse, Data Lake, combined with SQL Server. Azure Cosmos DB is the industry\u2019s first globally distributed database service. It enables customers to securely and reliably power data-intensive applications at unprecedented scale and performance from IoT to AI to mobile and much more.","Retailer Jet.com is using Azure Cosmos DB to process trillions of transactions every day. Customers are infusing AI into their products & services using Azure AI infrastructure and services such as Bot Framework and Cognitive Services. Sabre, a leading technology provider to the global travel industry, is piloting AI-powered solutions for travel agencies to better serve customers. And Dixons Carphone is using Azure and our Cognitive Services to boost customer engagement and provide a more consistent, seamless experience across online and in their stores.","Azure is also unique in its support for this emerging intelligent cloud and intelligent edge applications. Azure IoT Edge extends cloud intelligence to edge devices. This means IoT devices can act locally at the edge, while taking advantage of the cloud for global coordination and machine learning at scale. Azure is the first cloud to provide true hybrid support that customers predominately choose. Azure Stack extends Azure to enable developers to build and deploy applications the same way whether they run on the intelligent cloud or at the intelligent edge, so customers can meet any regulatory requirement and bring cloud applications to remote or disconnected locations like cruise ships or oil rigs.","Now I\u2019ll turn to our progress in More Personal Computing. Against the backdrop of more than 500 million Windows 10 monthly active devices and continued broad progress across the Windows ecosystem, I want to highlight a couple of key strategic areas this quarter. Windows 10 is made to inspire the creator in all of us and is pivotal to enabling employees to transform the way they work. Increasingly, commercial customers value Windows 10 as the foundation for a secure, modern workplace. Enterprise and education deployments increased 33% over the last quarter, as companies like NASCAR, Emirates Airline, BMW Group, Bank of China all adopt Windows 10.","This quarter, we introduced Windows 10 S, streamlined for simplicity, security and superior performance and tailored for the classroom. Our goal for Windows 10 S is to develop a vibrant ecosystem with partners like Acer, ASUS, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, Samsung, and Toshiba to introduce a new class of modern devices that enables affordable, powerful new scenarios from Windows ink to 3D. We also introduced Surface Laptop and the new Surface Pro this quarter to continue to build and create momentum for new Windows device categories.","Now on to gaming. Our gaming business is now more than $9 billion, and growing profitably. The gaming world is evolving faster than ever before - from game play across multiple devices, to the explosive growth in streaming and eSports, to new subscription services and mixed reality scenarios. We are uniquely positioned to capture a large share of this opportunity because of our ability to unite the global community of gamers through Xbox Live, now 53 million strong and growing, and to enable new experiences across PC, console and mobile. Our approach is to let gamers play the games they want, with the people they want, on the devices they want.","At E3, we celebrated the passion of gamers by introducing Xbox One X, broadening our portfolio of gaming devices with the world\u2019s most powerful console. We launched two new services that broaden our reach and enrich the gaming experience, both of which are off to a very strong start. Mixer, our new live streaming service, makes it easier than ever before for gamers to create and share across platforms and to interact in entirely new ways. The Xbox Game Pass is a digital subscription service that expands our existing gaming value proposition.","In closing, I\u2019m proud of the progress this year, both in our own continued transformation and in how we are empowering customers to digitally transform. As technology disrupts every industry and has the power to make a difference in the lives of everyone, we strive to create local opportunity and growth and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness and public sector efficiency.","They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes and empower human ingenuity. Our sense of purpose lies in our customers\u2019 success. Transformation is a continuous process of renewal and reinvestment. We will continue to invest in the high growth opportunities, lead innovation in cloud and AI, and bring our technology and products together into experiences and solutions that unlock new value for customers.","Now, I\u2019ll hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter\u2019s results in more detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining for your questions.","Amy Hood ","Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $24.7 billion, up 9% and 10% in constant currency, with stronger than expected performance across all segments. Gross margin grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. Operating income increased 13% and 16% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $0.98, increasing 42% and 43% in constant currency, which includes $0.23 from the utilization of phone-related losses from prior years that were previously non-deductible.","At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 5 points of revenue and gross margin growth. LinkedIn\u2019s operating loss of $361 million was a 6 point drag on total company operating income growth, and is entirely attributable to the $371 million of amortization of acquired intangibles recorded in COGS and OpEx.","From a geographic perspective, our results were mostly in line with macroeconomic trends, though large markets like the US, Germany, and Japan performed better than we expected. We had a strong quarter in our commercial business, reflecting terrific execution from our sales teams and partners in the largest quarter of our year. We increased commitment to our commercial cloud and healthy renewals on a record volume of expirations.","We closed the highest number of multi-million-dollar Azure deals to date, and improved our annuity mix to 86%, up 3 points year-over-year. As a result, commercial bookings grew 30%, and commercial unearned revenue was $27.8 billion, significantly higher than we expected. Our contracted not billed balance increased to more than $31.5 billion.","As Satya mentioned earlier, our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeded $18.9 billion this quarter, growing 56%. We finished the year with nearly $15 billion in commercial cloud revenue. ","At the start of the year, we committed to material improvement in commercial cloud gross margin percentage and dollars. This quarter, our commercial cloud gross margin percentage was 52%, up 10 points year-over-year, with positive gross margin in each cloud service. Commercial cloud gross margin dollars grew 92% from strength across all services.","Our company gross margin was 66%, up 1 point from the prior year, as sales mix of higher margin products and services offset the impact of the growing mix of cloud revenue and $217 million of LinkedIn amortization costs. FX was mostly in line with our expectations, with 1 point of negative impact on total revenue growth even with a slightly weaker than expected US dollar.","At the segment level, FX had a negative impact of 2 points on Productivity and Business Processes, 1 point on Intelligent Cloud and 1 point on More Personal Computing. Total operating expenses grew 9% and 10% in constant currency, with LinkedIn contributing 12 points of growth, including $154 million of amortization of acquired intangibles expense.","Now, to our segment results. Revenue from our Productivity and Business Processes segment grew 21% and 23% in constant currency to $8.4 billion, with LinkedIn contributing 15 points of growth. Office Commercial revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 43% and 44% in constant currency with continued installed base growth across all workloads, ARPU expansion and emerging E5 momentum. For the first time, Office 365 Commercial revenue surpassed revenue from our traditional licensing business.","Office Consumer revenue increased 13%, driven by recurring subscription revenue and growth in our subscriber base. Our Dynamics business grew 7% and 9% in constant currency, and Dynamics 365 grew 74% and 75% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was approximately$1.1 billion, a bit better than expected.","Segment gross margin dollars grew 14% and 16% in constant currency, with 12 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $217 million of amortization. Gross margin percentage declined from an increasing cloud revenue mix and the impact of LinkedIn related amortization.","Operating expenses increased 41%, with 40 points from LinkedIn, including $154 million of amortization expense. Operating income declined 8% and 5% in constant currency, with 12 points of impact from LinkedIn. The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $7.4 billion in revenue, growing 11% and 12% in constant currency.","Our server products and cloud services revenue grew 15% and 16% in constant currency with double digit annuity revenue growth. Azure revenue growth accelerated to 97%, up 98% in constant currency. Azure Premium revenue grew triple-digits for the twelfth consecutive quarter. Enterprise Services revenue declined 3% and 1% in constant currency, driven by a lower volume of Windows Server 2003 custom support agreements, partially offset by growth in Premier Support Services.","Segment gross margin dollars grew 8% and 9% in constant currency, and segment gross margin percentage declined due to increasing cloud revenue mix and lower Enterprise Services margins, partially offset by material improvement in Azure margins. We grew operating expenses by 2% and 3% in constant currency with continued investment in sales capacity and developer engagement. Operating income increased 15%, up 18% in constant currency.","Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue from this segment was $8.8 billion, down 2% and 1% in constant currency, with 4 points of decline from phone. Our OEM business grew 1% this quarter, as both our commercial and consumer OEM businesses were slightly ahead of the PC market. OEM Pro revenue grew 3%, ahead of the commercial PC market, mainly due to a higher mix of premium SKUs. Windows 10 deployment cycles continue to drive commercial customer hardware demand.","OEM Non-Pro revenue was flat, ahead of the consumer PC market, with continued positive impact from Windows premium device mix. Inventories remain in the normal range. Windows commercial cloud products and services grew 8%, driven by annuity revenue growth. Enterprise customers increasingly chose Windows 10 on new and existing devices, which led to install base growth and higher adoption of our cloud security solutions.","Patent licensing declined this quarter, primarily from lower revenue per unit. Search revenue ex-TAC grew 10% and 11% in constant currency, driven by higher revenue per search and search volume. Devices revenue declined 28% and 27% in constant currency. Our Surface business performed better than we expected, declining 2% and 1% in constant currency, with strong sales execution on our Surface Pro product transition and early positive signals from customers and partners on our Surface Laptop launch in June.","Our gaming business grew 3% and 4% in constant currency. Xbox software and services growth of 11%, 13% in constant currency, offset declines in hardware. And our engaged user base grew 8% to 53 million monthly active users across console, mobile and Windows 10 platforms. Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and 10% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased, primarily due to sales mix shift to higher margin products and services.","Operating expenses declined 10%, and 9% in constant currency, from lower Phone expense, as well as Surface and gaming marketing spend in the prior year. As a result, operating income grew 68% and 72% in constant currency. Now back to the overall company results. This quarter, we invested approximately $3.3 billion in capital expenditures, including capital leases, up sequentially in part due to the planned Q3 datacenter spend pushed into this Q4. This includes approximately $2.3 billion of cash paid for property and equipment, which was down year-over-year as we utilized more capital leases.","Free cash flow grew 50% year-over-year, driven primarily by operating cash flow growth of 30%, as well as lower cash outlays for CapEx. Operating cash flow increased due to higher collections from customers following strong billings growth, as well as working capital improvements in our hardware business. Other income and expense was $215 million, more than originally planned, as we continue to see opportunities in the equities market to realize gains throughout the quarter.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was negative 6%, significantly lower than we expected, due to a $1.8 billion impact related to the utilization of prior years\u2019 losses from our phone business that were not deductible in the years incurred. Excluding this item, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19% this quarter and 20% for the full year. This quarter, we returned $4.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","Now let\u2019s turn to the outlook. The key trends for FY 2018 from the Financial Analyst Briefing remain largely unchanged. For the full year, we expect about 1 point of negative FX impact assuming current rates remain stable. In our commercial business, we anticipate that increasing demand for cloud services and healthy renewals will continue to drive a higher annuity mix. Our commercial transactional business will continue to decline driven by the transition to the cloud.","We remain focused on improving our commercial cloud gross margin percentage in each of our cloud services. As a reminder, given seasonality and revenue mix, commercial cloud gross margin will experience quarterly variability. Cloud migrations, deployments and new scenarios are driving greater customer usage. We will increase our capital investment to meet growing demand and capacity needs. Total CapEx spend will continue to have variability quarter-to-quarter.","At the company level, our gross margin percentage should decline about a point in FY 2018 with increasing cloud revenue mix, a full year of LinkedIn amortization and hardware launches, including our new console, Xbox One X. We expect LinkedIn quarterly amortization expense in COGS to be approximately $220 million, or about $880 million for the full year.","Next, operating expenses. You should think about our FY 2018 operating expenses in two categories. First, organic Microsoft expenses, which we expect to grow between 3% and 4%, reflecting the investments we are making to support our top line growth. Second, LinkedIn. We are making incremental investments in LinkedIn to fuel its continued strong revenue growth. Additionally, we will recognize our first full year of operating expenses, including $620 million of amortization expense.","Importantly, we expect our company operating margin to only decline by about a point as we continue to grow our cloud revenue, we fund new investment to support growth in strategic areas and absorb $1.5 billion of LinkedIn amortization in COGS and OpEx. Excluding the LinkedIn impact, operating margin should be flat year-over-year.","Next, our effective tax rate. As a reminder, our tax rate is impacted by at least three major factors: the proportion of services revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue, and the timing of equity vests. As cloud revenue mix increases, we anticipate our tax rate will move higher. With quarterly variability based on these factors, we anticipate our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 23%, plus or minus 2 points. And finally, we expect LinkedIn, ex-purchase accounting, to be non-dilutive in FY 2018, as it was in Q4.","Now, to the outlook for next quarter. Based on current FX rates, we expect less than 1 point of negative impact on revenue growth overall and for each segment. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be within the range of $24.85 to $25.05 billion. ","In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $8.1 and $8.3 billion. Office 365 commercial revenue growth will continue to be driven by install base growth, ARPU expansion, and adoption of premium services like E5, and should outpace the rate of transactional decline.","We expect a more moderate rate of growth in our Office consumer business given prior year comparables. In our Dynamics business, Dynamics 365 will continue to drive our cloud mix higher. And we expect approximately $1.1 billion of revenue from LinkedIn, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting.","For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $6.9 billion and $7.1 billion. Customer demand for Azure and our hybrid cloud offerings remains strong, and we anticipate another quarter of double-digit revenue growth across server products and cloud services. Enterprise Services should decline, given lower volumes of custom support agreements.","We expect More Personal Computing revenue between $8.6 billion and $8.9 billion. We anticipate OEM revenue will move more closely in line with the PC market. Devices revenue growth will continue to be impacted by the prior year phone comparable. Surface revenue will continue to be driven by the product lifecycle transition between Pro 4 and our new Surface Laptop and Surface Pro.","In Search, Bing\u2019s revenue growth ex-TAC should be similar to prior quarters. And we expect gaming to have the typical seasonality revenue pattern for a pre-holiday quarter. We expect COGS between $8.2 billion and $8.3 billion, including approximately $400 million from LinkedIn. LinkedIn COGS include about $220 million of amortization.","We expect CapEx, on an accrual dollar basis, to be similar to Q4 as we grow our investment to meet demand. We expect operating expenses of $8.6 billion to $8.7 billion, with about $1 billion from LinkedIn, of which roughly $155 million is related to amortization. Other income and expense should be about $250 million, as we expect to realize more gains from our equities portfolio.","Given the volume of equity vests that occur in our first quarter and based on today\u2019s stock value, we expect our first quarter non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 4 points lower than the estimated full year tax rate.","Finally, we adopted the new revenue standard, ASU 606, effective at the start of fiscal year 2018. To assist in the transition, Chris along with our Chief Accounting Officer, Frank Brod, will be hosting a conference call in early August to discuss these changes, present historical restated financial results, and share Q1 guidance converted to the new standard.","And with that let\u2019s go to Q&A.","Chris Suh","Thanks Amy. We will not move to the Q&A. Reyna, can you please repeat your instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Heather Bellini","Great, thank you very much for taking the question. Amy I had a question about commercial cloud COGS, and I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what percentage of these roughly is related to depreciation and how should we think about the pace of your CapEx deployments versus what you have been experiencing in commercial cloud to support the initiatives in the vast growth opportunities that you see ahead as we look out over the next 12 months to 24 months if there is anything you could share with us around that. Thank you.","Amy Hood","Let me break down the question in a couple of ways. Overall, when you think about COGS and the pacing, the depreciation rates of our servers don't change. It\u2019s generally over a three-year period and there is other pieces of equipment that have a longer, shorter depreciation life. So that piece of depreciation doesn't change per se. If you're looking to see how we see demand, obviously this quarter in Q4, we felt very good about cloud demand across all three services, but in particular with Azure. ","I feel confident in our ability to produce gross margin improvement across all those services. I feel confident in our ability to continue to make progress on our overall commercial cloud gross margin growth, and I am encouraged by the demand signals we are getting. All of those things I think, it\u2019s not really about the pace, it is much about the progress and demand and meeting those things as closely as we can and I feel really good about the team's execution.","Heather Bellini","Great, thank you.","Chris Suh","We will move to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Keith Weiss","Excellent, thank you guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. There\u2019s lot of rumors and speculation around sales reorganization of you guys sort of shifting around resources is sort of better distributed to cloud and new technologies, I was wondering if you guys could dig into that for us a little bit, what kind of changes are taking place in terms of go to market distribution heading into FY 2018?","Satya Nadella","Let me start, first of all thank you for the question Keith. Overall, the approach we have taken for multiple years now is to transform everything that we do inside the company, whether it\u2019s the product creation, how we\u2019re organized in the R&D, how we think about breaking down any silos and category definitions we may have had in the past, how we think about even marketing and the marketing approach, and then of course even with the go to market, and this transformation is ongoing.","This has been happening over multiple years, but we have now got very good customer momentum because ultimately this is all driven by the opportunity at hand, which is much bigger than anything that we have participated in the past, so the total addressable market is much bigger. And second, our customer expectations and our partner expectations of how we show up with them has changed, and so over the years we have been making changes and now that we have a lot more momentum and critical mass, we are going to that next phase and that\u2019s what you are seeing us in terms of changing the skill set, changing the scope of how we show up to support the digital transformation needs of both large customers, as well as small businesses.","Amy Hood","And I think in many ways Keith what we have done is a really a natural extension of some of the investments we\u2019ve made over the past 18 months to add technical resources to be more present in customer accounts, to really drive their transformation towards success outcomes. You are seeing it even in our intelligent cloud results for the last quarter and this quarter. We\u2019re taking that learning over the past 18 months and really applying it at a broader scale across the sales force to put those resources where we feel confident that they will have a good long-term return in that next phase of transformation.","Chris Suh","Thank you, Keith. We will take the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Karl Keirstead","Thank you. Question for Amy, Amy there were a lot of numbers in this print that look very strong, but one that stood out to me was the commercial bookings growth of 30%, you did touch on it a little bit in your remarks, but if you don't mind I\u2019d love to ask you a few questions, one is you mentioned that may be part of the strength was terrific execution on renewals, does it feel like maybe last quarter was a little bit of a renewal flush and in other words it might have been a one-time phenomenon? Secondly, is Microsoft doing anything different around contract, structure, or invoicing to that would result in bookings being unusually high, maybe collecting a little bit more upfront? And lastly, is it fair to interpret the strong bookings performance as giving us and I suppose you comfort in your revenue growth profile in fiscal 2018 as all those bookings obviously convert to reported revs? Thank you.","Amy Hood","Thanks Karl. Let me make sure I cover of on most of those. Let me start by saying, the biggest driver in commercial bookings growth this quarter was excellent execution on a large base of renewals. The second component of that is the execution on new revenue; in particular Azure, as well as Windows commercial, and billings in the quarter were very good and quite encouraging overall. There was no change in any way to invoicing people paying earlier, paying more upfront, that\u2019s definitely not an impact on that number.","And so overall, I think while it is certainly aided by the large expiry base because it tends to impact the CNB balance the most, it is really I think to your point; it is clearly encouraging because it gives us a very good base of support going into FY 2018 to come in to the GAAP reporting numbers.","Karl Keirstead","Got it. Thank you, Amy.","Amy Hood","Thanks Karl.","Chris Suh","Thanks Karl. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.","Walter Pritchard","Hi, thank you. Amy I\u2019m wondering on the gross profit growth, I was looking through the slide deck, and looks like gross profit growth in PBT was up about 2%, you saw some strong trends in different parts of that business and I think that 2% I would have thought would have been higher, could you help us understand the puts and takes around gross profit growth in PBT?","Amy Hood","There\u2019s a couple of things, but in general it is almost always mix shift. While we saw improvement in the gross margin percentage in Office 365 and continue to make progress on that it is also the balance, right. This is the first quarter where we\u2019ve actually seen the balance tip in terms of recognized revenue to online versus perpetual. So, I actually feel very good, but as we continue to accelerate the growth trajectory that you are not seeing frankly much impact on the gross margin line and we are seeing a lot of leverage in that through OpEx all the way down to the operating income line.","Chris Suh","Okay. Thank you, Walter. We will take the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you, and congrats on the quarter. Amy commercial cloud ARR grew 24% Q-over-Q, which is the largest Q-over-Q growth so far. Completely understand that Q4 is a big quarter for closing business, but 3.7 billion is a large number, can you give us some more color on exactly what is driving this growth and then I have a quick follow-up.","Amy Hood","Sure. When you think about, you are right, it is a big number, and I feel very good about it, and for the year on a pure basis it was $15 billion of commercial cloud revenue. So we are starting to get to that point Mark where you have a big base, which is still growing at a fast rate, and so especially ARR numbers can see big jumps in the one that you saw this quarter, and your right, Q4 is also historically quite a big quarter and this one certainly was as well. But you also saw - and what really does matter, especially in Azure is usage of growth, really consumption growth having customers use deploy, be successful, and really continue to get you think sort of meters up and running and that continues to build on itself, and so when you start to see that you can, and I do think and we will continue to see good growth in this number.","Mark Moerdler","Excellent. As a quick follow-up, how should we think of how that sets us up to 2018 in terms of hitting expectations, beating expectations, continuing, you know strong 40%, 50% year-over-year growth.","Amy Hood","Let me start by saying, first I feel very good about meeting our stated goal of $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR. Next, I think across every service the momentum we\u2019ve seen in Q4 and in particular, I would say, I think not many people focus on it, but even things like Windows E5, advanced threat protection services, those types of deployments really will add to momentum in our offerings. One of the things we often talk about is, we sell Microsoft 365. That\u2019s Windows 10 with securities and services. It is a modern workplace that includes up-to-date Office 365 and it includes EMS. We really did see strength across all of them. So I don't really think it\u2019s about a percentage, but it\u2019s about each of them continuing to make progress.","Mark Moerdler","Excellent and congrats.","Amy Hood","Thank you.","Chris Suh","Thanks Mark. We will take the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Philip Winslow","Hi thanks guys and congrats on another great quarter. Question first for Amy on Office 365, Office 365 commercial revenue continues to outpace the unit growth monthly active users, so are you still seeing that trend up to E35 cetera, I wonder if you could take us through where we are in that life cycle and also just to follow on your comments to the last question, you know Satya you launched at Inspire your Microsoft 365 that Amy just mentioned, how should we think about Microsoft 365 in the context of Office 365, also just given the fact that Windows commercial actually accelerated this quarter as well.","Satya Nadella","Yeah, maybe I can start and then\u2026","Amy Hood","Why don't you start and I will do the next one.","Satya Nadella","So one of the things that we are very excited about and have learnt a lot from is the secure productive enterprise offer that we have had now last year and impacted Q4, it really accelerated significantly, and so that has helped us in fact come up with Microsoft 365 at this very strong offering that brings together Office 365, Windows 10, as well as our enterprise mobility and security. And support even cross-platform devices. ","So we think of the modern workplace as having a very significant footprint of Windows, but also people will use phones of iOS and Android, but they need both productivity, creativity, and security across all of this estate of theirs, and that\u2019s where I think we have a competitive advantage and a great value proposition. So that\u2019s what Microsoft 365 embodies. ","It\u2019s today available for enterprises and in the fall you will have the midmarket version of it, which I think is a another very big opportunity because it really helps take what we have learnt in the large enterprises and scale it to where perhaps the need is even more acute and so we are excited about that and at Inspire the partner channel obviously is very excited about it as well.","Amy Hood","And so to your point and it\u2019s a nice transition from Satya's point about, especially the midmarket offering coming in the fall for Microsoft 365 is installed base growth. You are right, in terms of Office commercial 365 the primary driver is still installed base, both the transition as well as new. I think we are optimistic as we head into FY 2018 for the installed base growth possible in particular for some of these midmarket offerings that we\u2019re quite proud off","The ARPU growth that you saw and have seen in the past couple of quarters continues to primarily, Phil, be related still to the E1 to E3 transition. When we mentioned E5, I think that\u2019s frankly encouraging for us because all of these premium offers do best when you start the deployment motion. People start using E1 then they use E3 and then you start to see the momentum in E5, and we did see that. However, in terms of ARPU impact very, very small in quarter. So that\u2019s something that over time you will continue to see improvement in terms of impact on ARPU.","Philip Winslow","Awesome guys thanks a lot.","Amy Hood","Thanks.","Chris Suh","Thank you. We will take the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Kash Rangan","Hi, thank you very much. I'm curious if you can shed a little bit more light on commercial bookings growth of 30%, clearly that\u2019s off the chart and also when I look at the $18.9 billion of annualized revenue and judging from the fact that the commercial business non-Azure component of it was about steadying growth rate up [indiscernible] Azure went through some significant acceleration, which is yet to be reflected in your forward-looking revenues. If you could just shed a little bit more light and drill into any two or three products SKUs or areas or geographies that contributed to that on the chart performance that will be great? That's it from me, thank you very much and congrats.","Amy Hood","Thanks Kash. Let me go through the bookings, again with that 30% the first and best contributor to that is the strong performance on the renewals in quarter. It was a reasonably consistent Kash, there was not a geo in particular that I would say was a massive outlier although in two of our largest geos, the U.S. and Germany they did have very good years in particular in Q4. ","Now if you separate the fact that we had the larger base with clearly contribute to that bookings number being big, aside from that in particular Azure in the last year point did really show up in that 18.9, it didn't, the strong billings growth really showed up in that unearned outperformance, which you saw versus the guide and it was significant, a lot of that is the Azure fillings. I think we felt very good, those as well, I think we\u2019re pretty broad-based across industry. I would also say across geo. ","And so while we of course get some strength from our largest geos, and I would say they were probably the largest contributors if it was actually quite broad there is not only one place for me to say that we just saw it here, and then the final component that I would say was better than we anticipated and the way you\u2019d see that cash, again versus the unearned guidance and the beat that we had there with that final piece around our security value prop, ATP - Windows annuity growth was very good. That\u2019s in the KPI Windows commercial products and services. It is the place you will look and see that number and outside of that I mean those really are the biggest contributors.","Kash Rangan","Thank you.","Satya Nadella","Yes, I am going to - if I add one thing, I will just say that nothing shows up in just one quarter. We have been working on this for a long time whether it is the product and the approach we have taken from IaaS to PaaS to SaaS, even the diversity of our SaaS offerings, and also how we think about going to market. All of these have been multiple years of hard work, and clearly there is momentum across the board, and that I think is what you are seeing and we are excited about this quarter's execution and performance, and I think it bodes well for what we do in the future, but the key is for us to recognize that this is about the sort of long-term commitment to a big opportunity in making sure that you line up your execution against that.","Amy Hood","And I think maybe, I should have also mentioned, when you think about seeing that type of performance and Satya mentioned it is not just because of work done this quarter, it is a great point, but it\u2019s also the investments we\u2019ve made. We\u2019ve committed, we did sales overlays. We added technical resources. We put resources at customers ahead of the curve, we did that you saw that and the operating in the intelligent cloud OpEx growth over the past few quarters, that execution is what\u2019s landing.","Kash Rangan","Clearly something inflected and looks like you're gaining share. So congratulations thank you.","Chris Suh","Thank you, Kash. We will move to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Mark Murphy","Yes, thank you very much and I will add my congrats. Amy, going back to the size of the large size of the expiry base in Q4, when we look back three years to June 2014, in that quarter the commercial bookings grew 23%, I am just curious, is that representative of the portfolio that flowed through into this quarter on a three-year cycle, or is it more complex than that and also does it include or exclude LinkedIn contributions for the current period? And just finally, I\u2019m wondering again looking back three years, it was a different number in the September quarter that follows. And could you help us just with the year-over-year growth of the expiry base for the September quarter, I\u2019m not sure if you had commented on that?","Amy Hood","Okay, you are right, Mark it\u2019s not exactly if I said is the Q3 from three years ago exactly the expiry base it is not exactly, but it is directionally. And so that\u2019s a good example to say, every three years tends to be the length of our agreements and so you to tend to see that repeated, and that\u2019s what we mean by sort of the record or the largest expiry base and that is the pattern. In terms of LinkedIn having any impact? It did not. So that is the cleanest way to think about that number.","Chris Suh","Thanks Mark. We\u2019ll move to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital. Please proceed.","Ross MacMillan","Thanks very much and my congratulations as well. I\u2019m actually going to ask a question about the traditional server products business, which once again had a pretty strong growth rate up 5%. I think the last three quarters you have been trending at mid-single digits or even higher, and Amy I just love your thoughts as we progress through fiscal 2018, just so we think about this in the right way, you know how would you expect that sort of growth rate to trend and should we be sort of aware of the comps that come up in Q2 and beyond?","Satya Nadella","Maybe I can start and at least give you what or how we think about it technically and product \u2013wise, and then we can go into talking about the future in terms of the results itself. First of all, we don't think of our servers as distinct from our cloud. In other words, there is intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge is the architecture of pattern for which we are building, whether it is SQL server 2017 or with Windows server, the container service everything that we do assumes that distributed computing will actually remain distributed, and it turns out that it\u2019s helpful to think about it that way both for customers who are rationalizing their portfolios of apps as they lift shift modernize as to what they run in their data centers are in our data centers, but also forward-looking new workloads. ","If you look at some of the most exciting things that are happening in the cloud, is cloud applications that actively require an edge Azure IOT, or Azure Stack are becoming the runtimes of the edge where you do need not only the ability to do compute and storage, but to run the AI inference and the edge. So to me that\u2019s what we\u2019re building to. It\u2019s actually a big architectural shift from thinking purely as a migration to some public cloud to really thinking of this as a real future distributed computing infrastructure and applications, but I quite frankly feel very, very good about leading and so in that context our server license revenue will fluctuate based on what the macro is and these transitions and mix shifts, but from a forward-looking perspective, I want us to be very, very clear that we anticipate the edge to be actually one of the more exciting parts of what\u2019s happening with our infrastructure.","Amy Hood","And so that leads why I always tend to say, I don't focus as much on the mix per se. I know both of them will matter and both of them are important, and so that\u2019s why I tend to focus on that all up server KPI combination of the progress in the cloud, Azure, as well as the edge which is the on-prem. And so I think, we remain confident that double-digit target that we have for that KPI and is it really, I don't think sort of a comparability challenge per se, but that\u2019s why we try to keep it at that high level to not get too tied to one or the other, given we know the TAM expansion that\u2019s possible, we know we can grow within it.","And I apologize, I didn't answer Marks last component, so let me just go back and I had forgotten, which was, was there anything unique in the expiry base for Q1, the answer is, it is up a little year-over-year, but in certainly not through the same type of Q4 comparable. When we tend to have these, we tried to call them out like we did in Q3 leading into Q4. So, Q1 I would say is just up a little. So I wouldn't expect any material impact.","Chris Suh","Thank you, Ross. We will take the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.","Raimo Lenschow","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to drill in on the premium services in Azure, Satya you talked a little bit about SharePoint taking off and being a big part. Can you talk a little bit about the portfolio you have there, and I also wanted to contrast it a little bit with one of your main competitors who keeps coming up when new products just to kind of get to that premium service, and the advantage that you guys have given the IP that you build up over the years? Thank you.","Satya Nadella","Yes, I mean I think we have premium services whether it\u2019s an Office 365 or in the SaaS side with a Dynamic 365 and that\u2019s where the SharePoint comment came, but there is a lot more in Office 365 adoption cycle beyond exchange or email. On the Azure side, my comments in fact walked that entire tree so to speak, which is the infrastructure there wherein flat even in the infrastructure side there is no such thing as one generic infrastructure when I look at the diversity of the virtual machines, what\u2019s happening with AI infrastructure with GPU compute. So there\u2019s a lot of richness there. ","The layer about that for me is the data state, one of the exciting things is the growth in Azure DB, the growth in Cosmos DB, data warehouse product, the Datalake, so that is a place where we are seeing significant attach. On top of the data is where the AI services, where the bot framework, the cognitive services. So that\u2019s all the rich services where we are seeing significant customer action. The other side of it is the edge, so Azure IOT, our service both in the cloud and the edge and Azure Stack now truly are starting this quarter is going to be another way to extend out the rich services of Azure even beyond public cloud deployment. ","So that\u2019s what hopefully gives you a flavor for the IP that we have. And then one linchpin that we have between, in fact, our SaaS services, as well as Azure is Azure active trajectory. 90% of all the enterprises use Active directory and all of them rendezvous with Azure Active Directory irrespective of what applications they have in whichever cloud because that becomes a very key control plane for IT.","Raimo Lenschow","Perfect, thank you.","Chris Suh","Thanks Raimo. We will just have one more question Reyna, please.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.","Brad Reback","Great thanks very much. Amy, as the Azure business continues to gain scale and to Raimo\u2019s question the premium mix continues to be kind of bigger part of that, is there any reason to think that the gross margin gain shouldn't accelerate in 2018 versus where they were in 2017? Thanks.","Amy Hood","Thanks Brad. The way I tend to think about it is, with any service you want the gross margin itself to improve, and that includes in the Azure services components themselves. The difference between core compute in-store versus the premium layers can be significant and we\u2019ve had improvements across all of them. So, the real question on how and where should the Azure gross margin be is about sort of the ultimate mix of those.","Anyhow, we saw significant improvement this year. We expect a lot of improvement again next year on each of those service lines. And where the actual mix occurs among those lines, I think we will just have to wait and see, but that\u2019s why I tend to not focus at that layer it\u2019s like can you get every service better, can you make material improvement, and then of course can you get usage and consumption going that leads to premium service usage, and of course over time you\u2019d expect a higher mix of premium versus core.","Brad Reback","Great, thanks very much.","Chris Suh","Thanks Brad. So that wraps up the Q&A portion in today's earnings call. As Amy mentioned, Frank and I will be hosting a conference call in early August to discuss the changes under the new revenue standards, you can find additional details for that on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when available.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.","On our website, microsoft.com\/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide for the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on today's call. The non-GAAP measures exclude the net impact from revenue deferrals and the impact of integration and restructuring charges. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They're included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance, in addition to the impact of these items and events had on the financial results.","All growth comparisons we make on the call relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying business has performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. At the segment level, we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to recent change in our segment reporting groupings, we aren't able to provide segment level constant currency operating expense growth, and consequently cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant currency operating expense and operating income growth at the company-wide level.","Please note that we have recast certain prior period items to conform to the current period presentation with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flow. Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q and includes research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative, but excludes the impact of the last year's integration and restructuring charges.","We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included on our live transmission in the transcript and in any future use of the recording.

These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with, that I'll turn the call over to Satya.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon everyone. Today Amy and I will share the results of our second quarter and look ahead. Overall this quarter, we had solid performance and more importantly drove growth in areas that are key to our future. We delivered $25.7 billion in revenue with an operating income of $7.9 billion. We continue to advance towards our goals for fiscal year 2018. Our commercial cloud run rate surpassed $9.4 billion, up over 70% year over year and almost halfway to our goal of $20 billion. We nearly doubled our cloud customers over the last 12 months.","We also made progress towards our goal of more than 1 billion Windows 10 monthly active devices. We crossed the 200 million milestone, and Windows 10 is outpacing adoption of any of our previous operating systems. In fact, adoption is nearly 140% faster than Windows 7. I appreciate the incredible work and focus of both Microsoft team members and our partners to deliver these results.","Now let's get to the specifics for each of the three segments, starting with Productivity and Business Process. As we seek to help people get more out of every moment, we are delivering new innovation and seeing new opportunity with Office 365. Consumer response to Office is strong. Office attach rate is up. Office 2016 adoption is outperforming Office 2013 over the same period of time, and consumer subscriptions are up to more than 20 million.","We're also enthusiastic about how people use Office on other platforms. On iOS and Android, Skype has more than 900 million downloads and Office apps surpassed 340 million this quarter. There are also 30 million iOS and Android active devices running Outlook. Office 365 commercial revenue grew nearly 70% in constant currency while seats grew 59%. It is clear customers value the ongoing innovation we are delivering in Office 365 and this allows us to advance further into markets like voice and information protection.","In December, we released a major update to Skype for Business, which drives productivity up and costs down. Our customers can now use Skype for Business to get a dial tone without the need of their own PBX and conduct online meetings for up to 10,000 attendees.","Security is both a mandate and an opportunity for Microsoft across all our segments. As customers look to protect themselves, we are creating new demand for all of our security solutions. The number of people using our information protection capabilities built into Office 365 increased 25% quarter over quarter. At the same time, we released new capabilities like Advanced Threat Protection, Advanced eDiscovery and Customer Lockbox. These new innovations in voice and information protection accrue to our premium productivity and collaboration SKU E5 which we released last month.","Our Dynamics business is also contributing to our growth in the cloud. This quarter we released major updates to Dynamics NAV and Dynamics CRM, both of which deliver enhancements in mobility, insights and organizational productivity, as well as deeper integration with Azure and Office 365. Three out of four of our CRM customers are choosing to deploy in the cloud, which is driving continued triple digit paid seat growth for CRM Online in the enterprise.","Our momentum with Office 365 and Dynamics creates a compelling case for developers. This quarter, we exposed the data APIs which capture the relationships between people, conversations, projects, schedules, processes and content. We call these APIs the Microsoft Graph. The ability for developers to build on the Microsoft Graph presents a strategic opportunity for our customers and partners. Smartsheet has already taken advantage of these APIs. Oracle plans to use Microsoft Graph to enhance their line of business applications like Oracle Sales Cloud, and many innovative startups are extending it to create new generation of productivity applications.","Now let's move to the Intelligent Cloud segment. The enterprise cloud opportunity is massive, larger than any market we have ever participated in. Last quarter, I reflected on how we are now one of the two leaders in the space. At the same time, we are the only one in this market providing SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and hybrid cloud at scale. We are growing in each of these areas simultaneously. Our unique approach is resonating. Our cloud architecture reflects real world distributed cloud computing needs and services that enable businesses to convert data into intelligence and drive business transformation.","Azure revenue grew 140% this quarter in constant currency, with revenue coming from new and existing customers. We saw organizations like NTT DOCOMO, Honeywell, NASA's Jet Propulsion Labs, Dow Chemical and the UN Development Programme deploy innovative solutions on Azure. We see that Azure customers who also purchase Office 365 consume eight times more Azure than other customers. More than 70% of the Fortune 500 have at least two different Microsoft cloud offerings, up 13 points year over year. And now we're continuing to grow in new ways. Together with Red Hat, Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, we will increase our ability to address real world infrastructure needs. These partnerships give customers the flexibility to connect their existing on-premise infrastructure or Linux-based applications with our cloud.","We are leading innovation in new Agile and DevOps workloads as well, with Azure App Services, PowerApps and Visual Studio Team Services, where we surpassed 3.8 million developer subscriptions. We are adding thousands of new developers every day who are building cloud and mobile solutions that support industries like oil and gas, finance, e-commerce, consulting and healthcare. As we expand into new markets, our revenue from premium services like security, mobility management and analytics nearly tripled year over year. Enterprise Mobility solution customers have more than doubled year over year and we have nearly tripled our share among Fortune 500 in the last 12 months.","Security is now a major driver of the cloud adoption. As threats become more frequent and sophisticated, Azure's unique technology like machine learning empower customers to adapt to these new realities. This quarter we organized the Enterprise Cybersecurity Group to help customers prepare for and respond to attacks. We unveiled plans for new data centers in Germany and the UK that address customers' data access and sovereignty needs. And we continue to release new capabilities like Advanced Threat Analytics as part of our $1 billion product innovation and security spanning Azure, Office 365, Windows 10 and our Enterprise Mobility Suite.","At the heart of every business in the future will be systems of intelligence, powerful AI that helps people understand the past and predict the future. Cortana Analytics is the building block for these systems of intelligence. We released Cortana Analytics last July. It's a comprehensive suite of services that enable businesses to reason over massive quantities of data that emanate from connected people, places and things and converts them into intelligent insights and automation.","Coca-Cola, Russell Reynolds, and the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health System already use Cortana Analytics to dramatically change the way they market products to customers, uncover talent in the workforce and offer patients predictive and more personalized healthcare. Our goal is to make it possible for every company in every industry and every country to take advantage of this new artificial intelligence to transform.","In the More Personal Computing segment, I'm encouraged by our progress to unify our installed base on Windows 10 and to create new opportunities for Microsoft and our entire ecosystem. As of this month, we crossed 200 million active devices running Windows 10. Near term in what analysts predicts will be relative flat market over this next year, we are focused on three ways to drive growth for our partners and for Microsoft: first, deliver more value in innovation, particularly for enterprise customers who need advanced productivity, security and device management; second, grow new monetization through services across a unified Windows platform; third, continue to innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs.","Let me briefly expand on each. First in November, we released the first major update of Windows 10 with solutions designed to address critical business scenarios, security, manageability and ease of deployment. More than 76% of our enterprise customers are in active pilots, including organizations like Kimberly-Clark and Alaska Airlines, and 22 million enterprise and education devices are already running Windows 10. We're well positioned to grow our commercial device footprint in the second half.","Next, as we unify and grow the Windows 10 platform, we grow new monetization opportunities with the Windows Store, search and gaming. This holiday season, we doubled Windows Store paid transactions from PC and tablet customers. This increase is an outgrowth of Windows 10 monthly active devices all up, and the addition of new Windows 10 applications. This quarter, Netflix, Pandora, Uber, Wall Street Journal, NPR released new apps designed to take advantage of Windows 10 experiences.","For example, you can ask Cortana to recognize a song on Shazam, play a movie on Netflix or book a ride via Uber. With search, the clearest indicator of our progress is US search share, where Bing now exceeds 21%. Nearly 30% of our search revenue in December came from Windows 10 devices, partly as a result of user engagement with Cortana. We are seeing increased search engagement and monetization on Windows 10 over previous versions. This holiday, we saw record engagement on Xbox Live. Active users grew to an all-time high of 48 million across consoles and PCs. On December 28, we had more fans using Xbox Live than any other day in the Xbox history. Clearly, with Xbox One now upgraded to Windows 10, a vibrant community joined the Windows ecosystem.","Our games also performed strongly this quarter. We doubled the number of Xbox One gamers playing Microsoft published titles year over year, Minecraft concluded the holiday as the top paid app globally on Windows 10, iOS and Android, and we grew monthly active users by 18% year over year.","Lastly, we're innovating in new device categories and driving growth. With Surface, we created a new type of device, the 2 in 1, and partners are now bringing similar devices to market with success. At the same time, this was the best quarter for Surface ever with over $1.3 billion in sales, driven by the launch of Surface Pro 4 and the initial rollout of our brand new Surface Book. We see more opportunity ahead with Surface Book coming soon to China, Japan, the UK, France, Germany and other markets in Europe and Asia.","We believe in our ability to grow the Windows ecosystem. Near term, we are taking the right steps. We're also clear that long-term Windows growth and vibrancy rests on our ability to reinvent personal computers and personal computing. We accept the challenge as we see it as one of the greatest opportunities to prudently expand into new markets and generate shareholder value.","Before turning over to Amy, I want to briefly reflect on the past few months. I've had the opportunity to meet with customers from all over the globe and observe the effects of the macroeconomic trends impacting business today. Of course, any macroeconomic uncertainty will create pressures for our business. But increasingly I think it also creates opportunity for us. Every organization is looking for ways to gain efficiencies, insights and ultimately transform. This is at the heart of our mission. I believe Microsoft is uniquely positioned to empower them to find new growth areas, while finding new growth for ourselves.","With that, I'll hand over to Amy to go through this quarter's results in greater detail and share our outlook for the next quarter, and I look forward to rejoining you after to answer questions.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter revenue was $25.7 billion, down 2% and up 3% in constant currency. Gross margin declined slightly but was up 5% in constant currency. We grew operating income this quarter by 3% and 13% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $0.78, growing 11% or 23% in constant currency. We achieved strong results this quarter through targeted investments and innovation, and consistent execution.","From a geographic perspective, our performance in most markets was as expected. The key markets like Brazil, China, Japan and Russia continue to be challenging. Our commercial business once again delivered solid results, as we executed well in a large quarter for annuity renewals. Commercial bookings increased 12%, up 19% in constant currency and commercial unearned revenue was in line with expectations at $19.6 billion or 8% growth in constant currency. In addition, our contracted-not-billed balance reached an all-time high of $25.5 billion.","With our continued cloud growth, our commercial annuity mix reached 83%, up 5 points year over year. This quarter, more than 60% of customers with enterprise agreements attached commercial cloud services, up 15 percentage points year over year. Additionally, we continue to make progress in improving our cloud gross margins. In Q2, total commercial cloud gross margin was 46%, an increase of 9 points year over year driven primarily by improvements in both Office 365 and Azure.","Last quarter, I provided the expected foreign currency impact on total revenue as well as across each of the reporting segments. In Q2, the FX impact came in nearly as anticipated, though the US dollar trended stronger than expected in December. This resulted in less than 1 point of additional negative impact to total revenue as compared to expectations, rounding up to 5 points. Consistent with Q1, and as Chris explained, we're not able to provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses and therefore segment operating income. In general, FX had a favorable impact of 3% on operating expenses at the total company level.","Now let's turn to each segment's results. This quarter, our Productivity and Business Processes segment delivered in line with our expectations, with $6.7 billion in revenue, declining 2% but growing 5% in constant currency. In Office commercial, revenue declined 1%, but grew 5% in constant currency driven by ongoing strength from Office 365, where revenue increased nearly 70% in constant currency. 80,000 transacting partners sold Office 365 to small business customers, and our installed base continued to expand across Office, Exchange, SharePoint, and the Skype for Business workloads.","Office consumer revenue declined 14%, down 8% in constant currency, ahead of the consumer PC market. Subscribers increased to 20.6 million, attach rates grew and recurring subscription revenue continued to more than offset the impact of the customer transition to the cloud. And our Dynamics business grew 3% or 11% in constant currency, with triple digit installed base growth for Dynamic CRM Online for the fifth consecutive quarter.","We look forward to the upcoming launch of Dynamics AX, our ERP cloud solution built on and for Azure that increases the breadth of our offerings in the business process market. Segment gross margin declined 6%, up 1% in constant currency. The gross margin percentage declined, reflecting the increasing mix of cloud services within the segment. Segment operating expenses decreased 3% as we repositioned resources to align with our highest growth opportunities, and as a result operating income declined 8%.","The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered over $6.3 billion in revenue, slightly ahead of our expectations, and grew 5% and 11% in constant currency. Our enterprise customers continued to choose, adopt and use our hybrid cloud platform offerings which resulted in server product and services growth, revenue growth of 10% in constant currency. Additionally, Enterprise Services revenue increased 10% or 16% in constant currency, driven by our Premier Support services.","Segment gross margin grew 4% or 11% in constant currency. Gross margin percentages were flat as the rapid and continued growth of our cloud mix offset margin improvements in Azure and Enterprise Services. Given the addressable market opportunity and enterprise customer demand, we continued our investment in research and development, as well as sales and marketing resources. This quarter, operating income declined 1%.","Now to our last segment, More Personal Computing. Revenue exceeded our expectations at $12.7 billion, down 5%, and 2% in constant currency. First, our OEM results. Our total OEM business declined 5% this quarter, outperforming the overall PC market. OEM non-Pro revenue declined 3%, outperforming the consumer PC market as we expected, driven by a higher mix of premium and mid-range devices, which led to higher average revenue per license than the prior year. OEM Pro revenue declined 6%, slightly better than the commercial PC market. Pro license inventory is slightly above historical levels, which we expect to work through in Q3.","Windows volume licensing grew 3% in constant currency, with annuity growth, partially offset by transactional declines. IP licensing declined, impacted by both a decrease in total unit volume and a higher mix of low-royalty units. Our search business performed well again this quarter, with higher revenue per search, higher search volume and US market share growth, which resulted in continued profitability.","Devices revenue decreased 26% or 22% in constant currency, primarily due to phone where revenue declined 49% in constant currency, reflecting our change in strategy announced last July. Surface revenue increased 22% or 29% in constant currency, with the launch of Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, with continued channel expansion and growing commercial sales.","On a constant currency basis, device gross margin dollars declined 18% and gross margin percentage improved, driven by a shift in revenue to our higher margin Surface portfolio. As Satya referenced, we had a good holiday for Xbox. Gaming revenue increased 5% or 9% in constant currency driven by record Xbox Live transactions as well as first party game releases. As expected, hardware revenue decreased due to lower volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold.","Segment gross margin declined 1% or increased 5% in constant currency. Operating expenses decreased 14%, primarily due to reduced expense in our phone business, as well as a successful transition of display advertising sales to AOL. As a result, segment operating income grew 35%.","And now back to our overall company results. Customer adoption and usage of our cloud services continues to accelerate globally, and we are investing capital into our data centers and servers to respond to this demand. This quarter, we invested $2 billion, up sequentially from the $1.5 billion invested last quarter.","Other income was negative $171 million due to interest expense and net losses on derivatives, partially offset by dividend interest income and net recognized gains on investments. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19%, in line with our expectations, with the year over year decrease primarily due to an IRS audit adjustment in the prior year, and lower non-deductible operating losses in the current. This quarter we returned $6.5 billion to shareholders, an increase of 42%.","Let's move to the outlook. I want to preface my remarks with three overall comments, and then move to more specific comments by segment. First, FX. I previously stated that we expected the FX impact on total revenue to be about 3 points in H2. For Q3, given the recent strengthening of the US dollar, we now expect an overall impact of 4 points. By segment, we expect 5 points of impact on Productivity and Business Processes, 4 points in Intelligent Cloud, and 3 points in More Personal Computing. And we anticipate continued lessening of FX impacts by segment and on total revenue in Q4, assuming current rates stay stable.","Second, our commercial business. We expect our commercial business to remain healthy with a ongoing shift to annuity as new and existing customers adopt and use our commercial cloud services. Therefore even with continuing currency headwinds, we expect commercial unearned revenue to be within the range of $18.8 billion to $19 billion. Our commercial cloud run rate trajectory remains on pass, with continued focus on gross margin improvement across each of our key services, Office 365, Azure and Dynamics Online, though the total commercial cloud gross margin percentage will be impacted by the mix of revenue.","Third, we will continue to meet global customer demand for cloud services and will increase our investment in data centers and capital equipment in the second half of our fiscal year.","Now let me share some additional commentary on each segment. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion, which reflects 5 points of negative FX impact. This represents 6% year over year growth in constant currency, driven by Office 365 momentum and Dynamics Online.","For the Intelligent Cloud segment, we expect revenue between $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion, which reflects 4 points of negative FX impact. Continued customer preference for our hybrid solutions will drive sustained growth in server products and cloud services and robust demand for Enterprise Services. We expect this business to continue to grow double digits as it has throughout the first half of our fiscal year.","For More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $9.1 billion and $9.4 billion, which includes 3 points of negative FX impact. As this segment has both devices and software, I'll provide a bit more detail. First, Windows. As I mentioned earlier, we will return to normal levels of Pro inventory in Q3. And we expect non-Pro revenue to align more closely with the consumer PC market. In search, Bing will continue to gain share and will remain profitable. For phone, we expect similar year over year revenue declines, and the gross margin percentage for Q3 should look similar to Q2.","After a solid launch quarter, with Surface Book and Surface Pro 4, we anticipate continued momentum and growth with Surface Book expanding into additional countries. And in gaming, we expect normal post-holiday seasonality. We expect COGS to be $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion with variability driven by device sales. We expect operating expenses between $7.7 billion and $7.8 billion. And for the full year, we are lowering our guidance to $31.4 billion to $31.6 billion as we continue to improve efficiencies and invest in key growth opportunities.","We expect other income and expenses to be negative $300 million in Q3. This includes the net cost of hedging and interest expense offset by dividend interest income. We expect our Q3 and full year tax rate to be between 19% and 21%.","In closing, our Q2 results and our Q3 outlook demonstrate our execution discipline and our investment in strategic areas to sustain long-term growth. We remain focused as we both create new markets and take share in existing ones.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris for Q&A.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All right. Thanks guys and congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on commercial cloud and Azure specifically. I mean commercial cloud as you mentioned, the run rate was up $9.4 billion. I mean that's up $1.2 billion quarter to quarter, 70% year over year. That's a higher growth rate than even last quarter. Azure similar thing, accelerating growth versus even last quarter. Sort of a question for Satya and I'll follow up for Amy.","So Satya, when you look at the growth rates there in commercial cloud and particularly Azure, you talked about new customer wins, but also existing customers transitioning more workloads to Azure. Hoping you can give us maybe some more color there as far as what you're seeing and kind of about how you're thinking about the growth going forward there.","And then Amy, based on our calculations, it seems like Azure had a pretty meaningful improvement in just the gross margin year over year. I'm wondering if you could help us with the two curves in that business and where we are in Azure's call it gross margin life cycle, the fixed costs and the variable costs and how you're thinking about that. Thanks.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Phil, for the question. The way we think about our cloud is how I described it in my remarks, which is, it's the combination of the work we're actually doing in the SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and also our hybrid cloud layer, because we don't think for example of our servers as a distinct part. But it's in fact the edge of our cloud, and we're building for that with things like Azure Stack. So we think what we have done here by bringing these things together as one architecture for distributed computing and how people will consume applications and build applications in the future, we speak to more of the real world needs I think of an IT organization or a business organization that's trying to transform through digital technology.","I mean if you put yourself as a CIO of a organization, in a multinational organization and you want to operate in multiple geographies with different regimes for data sovereignty, and then you want to be able to take some workloads, move them all to the cloud, some you want to be able to tier with the cloud, that's the kind of flexibility we provide. And we also see network effects between if you're using Office 365, you want to extend the data in Office 365 by building applications that join it with some other data inside of our Data Lake service in Azure. Obviously Azure becomes the natural choice for such application development and we're increasingly seeing that. So that's really our strategy. Our strategy is not to compete in these constituent parts independently with different competitors, it is to bring one architecture and really drive the value for our customers because of that.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And Phil, let me quickly cover I think your gross margin question. You're right. We did actually make significant progress in both Azure as well as Office 365. And then the mix of those obviously impacts the overall commercial cloud gross margin. What's important, the dynamic's actually quite similar even though the services are quite different. There's really two fundamental components to gross margin improvement.","Number one is obviously scale efficiencies and where we are in that curve, which we are doing and continue to make consistent improvement in. The next obviously is the mix of premium services, and Satya talked about some of the increasing mix of premium services in Azure. That's been encouraging, especially in existing customers over time and through adoption curves. And Office 365, as you know, we continue to be excited by our premium mix in the commercial segment. And so those two combinations each quarter impact it as well as the overall.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Great. Thanks, Phil. We'll move to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Very nice quarter guys, and thank you for taking the question. Satya, you mentioned both new and existing customers increasingly using the Azure cloud. I was hoping you could give us some color into what that looks like, specifically when an existing customer starts using Azure in terms of how does their overall spending get impacted? And what happens to their spending for the more traditional server and tools? How does that get impacted as people use the Purple Cloud (34:50) utility more and more?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah, I mean the thing that we sort of notice is that with anyone who has moved to the cloud, there is a real opportunity for us to expand to multiple workloads over time, because it's a design win. It's like essentially an ISV win in the client server area, where you could get someone to build on your core infrastructure. They build their first application, and it turns out that once you've done that, you would want to look at our infrastructure for a second workload and third workload. So that's one side of what's happening with the expansion.","The other side of the expansion is what I also referenced, which is if you're an Office 365 customer, you have data in Office 365, you want to build applications that tap into that data, then you use Azure. So that's the other piece. The EMS growth is also very much related to that, which is if you deploy Exchange online, you have Azure AD and then the natural expansion from there is the full EMS suite with device management for all your mobile devices and also Advance Threat Protection and what have you. So we see both those trends from an application workload development synergies as well as infrastructure from identity management, device management work out.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Keith.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah, thanks.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent, thank you, guys.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Okay, thanks. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.","Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Amy, macro's on everyone's mind. I'm just curious if you guys could comment a little bit about what you're seeing. I know it may be too early to see some of the weakness that others have seen, but how are you looking at the demand environment? And how does that change your plans as you look sort of towards the back half of the year? Does any assumptions change in your mind?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Brent, for the question. The geos I specifically called out obviously were we're the most impacted and they're the bigger geos. But really, I think the focus that we have here is how we can best execute no matter what the macro environment turns out to be, focus on our own execution, focus on continue to drive cloud services, focus on continue to drive annuity mix. Those movements actually and as we help customers transform, it's really the best plan in the face of any uncertainty, which you're clearly asking me about. But I tend to probably focus more on what we can control versus the external environment and how we can best react to that.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Brent. Okay, we'll take the next question, then.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you very much. I was just wondering, Satya, you mentioned, and I know there's been a lot of questions on Azure, but you mentioned strong growth in compute and SQL usage on Azure being up, I think you said 5x. I was just wondering if you could give us your take on how you see the mix of Azure workloads. I mean is it right now more new workload growth and there's, it's very little existing workloads moving over? I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of how you see the wave cresting for new workloads versus existing workloads that can migrate over. And I'm also wondering if you see it helping you to take share. You mention it's kind of like a design win or an ISV win. I'm wondering if you could share with us how this might be impacting your share versus say Linux or versus other types of infrastructure platforms. Thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah, the thing, Heather, the move to the cloud has done for us is expanded the market opportunity that we have had more than ever before. In some sense, if you compare it to the TAM of STB versus what we now describe as intelligent cloud, we're operating in a much bigger market. And that's because first of all the move to the cloud combines a whole bunch of different categories as well as takes something that you mentioned, which is Linux. We now have the ability to take Linux workloads and run them first class and over 20% plus of Azure is Linux workloads, which was sort of a growth opportunity we tapped into with the cloud which we didn't have previously.","And even take something like EMS, which is a service you could say in the past we participated with Active Directory, but we, and some amount of system center. But now with the growth of actually mobile devices and SaaS applications, our opportunity with EMS is much bigger than anything that we had in the client server era. So clearly we are migrating some workloads and structurally, some of that helps us because we have that position in the client server space. But when we look at what we're doing in the cloud, it's mostly about attaching to one of the secular growth trajectories going forward, be it open source Linux development, mobile use and SaaS applications. So those are all things that we participate in which we didn't participate in the past.","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, Heather. We'll go ahead and take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Satya, Amy, congrats on the quarter. So I got a question for Satya, and then a quick follow-up for Amy. Satya, following up on the cloud discussion, recognizing that SaaS, PaaS, infrastructure as a service, hybrid are all related. But as Azure continues to grow fast and become a bigger part of the business, how should we think about the opportunities or the opportunity size for PaaS versus infrastructure as a service? PaaS is much smaller industry-wide today, but is the opportunity is big, bigger? How should we think about that? And then a follow-up for Amy.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","The opportunity I believe in both cases is high, because it just comes in different forms. IaaS growth comes because people already have existing code that they want to move over, and then they start extending by writing more PaaS because it's sort of more efficient for them to write new code and new apps in PaaS. So I think that depending on what. If you're bringing something over, your IaaS will be heavy first and then PaaS will grow. If you're starting new, you will have PaaS, which is going to be the first thing you do, but then you'll always find the need to go integrate with something that was already existing, existing data, existing code in a virtual machine.","So I myself, in fact one of the things that Amy and I do, is when we think about our CapEx, we think about all these layers together. In fact we amortize our CapEx across all of these and we pay attention to margin and premium mix. Because what we have come to understand is customers, depending on where they start, how they start, have different mix profiles. So it's the all-up, as long as we're growing our premium services attach and margins for those remain strong, we feel that the mix can be different and it's okay. And we really want to speak to the needs of the customers more than any product strategy goal we have.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Perfect. Thank you. Amy, a slightly different topic. Free cash flow grew 25% year on year, much faster than the other metrics. How should we think about this trend continuing?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","That was impacted, Mark, in the prior year by some integration and restructuring charges on the cash flow statement.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. So it's really a one-time event more than anything else.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Yes, just always make sure you check the integration and restructuring in the prior year.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Perfect. Thank you, I appreciate it. Congrats.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Mark.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","We'll go ahead and take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey thanks for taking my question and congrats from me as well. Quick question for Satya. Now that Windows 10 is on 200 million devices, what do you see on the developer network, because one of the big aims was you have a uniform platform for developers to go against the PC, tablet, et cetera. What do you see in terms of them kind of starting to embrace the platform and use the opportunity there? Thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah, thanks for the question and yeah, you're absolutely right. That was one of our biggest strategic objectives was to get active devices and with Store integrated into the installed base and in the user experience so that we could increase these successful developers. And we're seeing good early signs. In my opening commentary, I talked a little bit about both the increased visits to the Store and transactions as well as the fact that we are attracting new applications from developers like Netflix to Wall Street Journal to others. And as you can imagine, our share is today in desktops, in emerging in tablets, in 2-in-1 and of course now with Xbox as well, which is you know got great attraction to gaming developers. So those are the natural places where you'll see us gain more developers and gain more traction. We are big believers in a unified developer platform and a unified Store, and then as Windows 10 monthly active devices increases and the Store usage increases, we'll see more and more developers take advantage of it.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Raimo. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Just a numbers question for Amy. I noticed your long-term unearned revenue was up quite a bit. I mean that's kind of been a flattish trend and it was paired with commercial bookings being much stronger I think than I was modeling. I'm wondering if you could just help us understand what drove the unearned and how that contributed to those commercial bookings?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Sure. A couple things Walter, which I know you recall. We do have a bit of lumpiness in our expirations. As I said on the call, this was a big expiration quarter for us. And so on occasion what that does, even with the negative currency impact on C&B, is have a bit of lumpiness over time. Now that being said, I want to point to the core, which is that renewal rates were very good, and a big quarter. There was very strong performance on that front, very strong performance in moving customers to annuity as well as to the cloud. So aside from a bit of the lumpiness that you do note and we have from time to time, the execution in the quarter was very strong.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And then if I can just one other numbers question. It looks like in the Q you called out actually Windows Server declining as an offset to Intelligent Cloud growth. And I'm wondering, we haven't seen that comment in the Q before. Was there something sort of one-off driving that or any further detail on that?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","The way I'd think about that one, Walter, is in general, our premium or enterprise workloads across Windows, SQL, System Center, et cetera, grew double digits. And so some of that weakness frankly is in the non-annuity and very transactional business, which happened to impact Windows Server a bit more than other workloads. And that is where in macro pressure on occasion shows itself first, and then some of that non-annuity lumpiness. So that's the nature of that comment.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Walter.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Walter. Next question, please, Operator.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Amy, relative to your Q2 guide, the upside surprise really came in the personal computing business, and at least relative to our third quarter estimates, it's again the personal computing guidance that beat. I'm wondering if you could repeat the key factors that are contributing to the out-performance in that pretty important business? Thank you.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Sure, Karl. In Q2, let me talk about two key ones. Number one, it's really the device launches. We actually launched a very broad portfolio of devices into the quarter. With Surface Pro 4, Surface Book, Band 2 and the Lumia 950 and 950 XL. And so between all of those hardware products, as well as our gaming performance, another sort of hardware component in quarter, we did a little better than we had expected in our launches. Now when you launch mid quarter, there's always some timing aspect to that, but I feel very good about the execution of those and that is a meaningful component of that out-performance. The second one, which I talked about is OEM Pro. We did a little better in the quarter than I expected, but inventory levels are a little higher. I expect to work through that in Q2, I mean Q3. And that was a couple points of impact, for example on OEM Pro in quarter.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then, Amy, for the third quarter, your guide for that business is also pretty good. Is that due to some of these similar factors? Or are there one or two others that are driving the what appears to be pretty solid 3Q performance in that unit as well?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Well, it's similar drivers. In that segment, there's also some topics I tend to not get asked about in Q&A. Let me take the opportunity to talk about them. Which is one, our search performance continues to be very good. Frankly, our display business has been quite good. And if you go beyond that, I feel good about our gaming business sequentially. I feel good about the hardware, especially the Surface performance as we launch into more geos. And so if you think about all of those components, which actually were very similar to Q2 in terms of their strength, you see them again in Q3. And so I'm not sure there's anything quote-unquote new, Karl, I would say, other than that bit of mix between OEM Pro, a little bit pulled into Q2 versus Q3.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Terrific color. Thank you, Amy.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Karl.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you. We'll move to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter. I was curious to get your thoughts, Satya, on the Windows 10 upgrade cycle in the enterprise and also the consumer market, particularly after you anniversaried the free offer for Windows 10. And secondly and finally thoughts on Surface. It's off to a great start, at least the latest model. Could that play a more important role in the corporate computing landscape? Thank you. That's it for me.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Kash, for the question. As far as the upgrade momentum, the fact that we crossed 200 million active devices, we feel very, very good about that. And the pilots, the place which in the second half is going to be a huge focus for us is the enterprise deployment, and that's where I think there's real excitement because of some of the core capabilities of Windows 10 when it comes to security, manageability. That I think is going to create great value for enterprises, and that's showing up in all the pilots. In the accelerated, I've never seen a Windows release in the enterprise with this level of accelerated deployment planned. So we obviously need to do a great job in continuing to push that, and we're focused on it.","As far as Surface, Surface is playing an increasing role for us in both consumer as well as in the enterprise market. And also we just, we created a new category of 2-in-1s where even our OEMs are finding success, which was one of our strategic objectives of doing the Surface. And so overall, we do think that this tablet that can replace your laptop is ideally suited for productivity needs, which means it's great for your personal use as well as your use inside of the enterprise, and we continue to see good growth.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","I would just add one thing, is that we've actually announced a number of important partners to help us take the Surface portfolio into commercial customers. And I think we'll expect to see progress on that over the course of the year.","Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","If I could, your excitement is pretty palpable. What could be driving that 140% increase in adoption relative to Windows 7? We all thought XP to 7 was a major transition, but it looks like there's another big transition happening here.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","I mean I think there are two aspects of it. We have a good operating system release for the core desktop user, and second, I believe is that we also expand out into new usage patterns. If you look at even the thing that we're seeing is in terms of engagement, with the browser or things like Xbox Live with the Store, or new device categories like the 2-in-1, all I think make it much more possible for users to engage with Windows in more mobile formats and in more productivity scenarios. So I think it's the combination of all of that. But it starts with having a good product truth which Windows 10 does deliver on.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Great, thanks. We'll go to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much and congratulations from me as well. Satya, I had a question on commercial Office 365. I don't know if you gave us the number, but I think the last couple of quarters you talked about monthly active users. And I'm curious if you have an update on that number. And then I also was curious about thoughts around ARPU, because you introduced the E5 SKU in December. Where are we on the path of penetration, if you will, with the higher value SKUs and the ability to see price lift across the base over time. Thanks.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yes and Amy you can add. I mean I think, that's right, last time we talked about the 60 million monthly active users for Office 365 and that continues to grow. In fact there is always, and I think we also talked about how we get licenses sold and then, or subscriptions sold and then there's deployment. And there's always lumpiness as well as increased deployment that happens once the users migrate, and we'll continue to track that and we'll continue to disclose those numbers as they come along. But I feel very, very good in the growth of that. And I think the best proxy for you really beyond any numbers we talk about in terms of monthly active is our capital, because if you look at what we do, is we spend our capital only to really fuel the growth or to service the growth of usage across Office 365 and Azure, and you see that increasing.","And then in terms of the margin profile, I mean the entire story of having the E3 mix first to be high and now E5, that's the thing that Amy talked about, which is we now have good premium tier value in all of our products, in Office 365 that's most evident with E3 and now E5. Even in Azure, we have things like EMS, we have our data services, even our developer services. So I think all of, both of our cloud products, the major cloud products have these premium tiers that the mix shift to those or the addition of those is something that we're focused on and we see in our results","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","That's right. I would just add that we did see that premium mix go up in Office 365 on the commercial side as you were noting. And really E5's only been in market for the last month of the quarter. We're excited about the number of customers that are trying it and that all the value it offers. But I would expect that to be a longer term evolution as opposed to in Q2.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Can I just ask a quick follow up, Amy? That was great. Just on Windows just so we all calibrate correctly, you've had this benefit from the RPL comps from last year. Should we think about Windows really now beginning to trend in line with PC units, or can there still be some variability around that? Thanks.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Yes, in my guidance comments, I talked a little bit about that. On the Pro side as I mentioned, we'll have a couple point impact that would make a difference between that on the Pro side. And I would expect, I think we actually even talked about that last quarter, that the RPL delta which we've seen in Q1 and Q2 would go away in Q3 and Q4 and it would trend much more similarly to the overall consumer PC market.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Ross.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Operator? Thanks. Operator, we'll have time for one last question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please proceed.","Edward Maguire - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to ask if you've been able to quantify some of the uplift since you've been opening up Office to different platforms like iOS and Android and now with the recent alliance with Red Hat, opening up a lot of opportunity to Linux developers. Have you been able to quantify how much uplift you've gotten? And how do you see this impacting your broader market opportunity?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Let me sort of speak to it in generic terms because I don't think we have sort of quantified it as narrowly perhaps, just to address those specific moves we made. But overall, the way we have thought about it is, we want to make sure the Office subscription, both to consumers as well as to enterprise subscribers, is valuable across all their devices because it speaks to the vision that we have, which is the cloud is what enables the mobility of the human experience across all of the devices in your life. Because increasingly, there will be more devices and we want to make sure that we're adding value and if we add value in that context, you will be more inclined to retain or purchase the Office subscription. So that's been our goal and that's working well and it sort of shows up in our all-up growth.","And similarly with Azure, we're making sure that as people are tapping into the cloud and moving to the cloud, we can get all workloads to be as first class as on Azure. So that's why we've done the deals with Red Hat. We even did previously deals with Oracle. So Azure is a complete open platform where of course you can run all the Windows workloads, the .NET workloads. But we're increasingly seeing the open source workloads, the Linux workloads, the Oracle workloads, the SAPs and what have you. And more interestingly the mix of all of them because the enterprise is heterogeneous. It has been heterogeneous. We participated only in a portion of it, whereas with Azure, we can participate as the total open platform. And that's how we thought about it and that's what we're executing on.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Ed, and thanks everybody.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Yes, thanks.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you very much.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Great. So that wraps up the Q&A portion of today's call. We look forward to seeing many of you at the coming months at various investor conferences. For those unable to attend in person, these events will be webcast and you can follow the comments at microsoft.com\/investor.

It was a strong finish to a record fiscal year. We delivered more than $125 billion in revenue for the full year with double-digit top line and bottom line growth. Our Commercial Cloud business is the largest in the world surpassing $38 billion in revenue for the year with gross margin expanding to 63%.","I\u2019m proud of what we've accomplished over the last 12 months, and I'm energized by the tremendous opportunity ahead. Every day, we work alongside our customers to help them build their own digital capability, creating new businesses with them, innovating with them, and earning their trust. This commitment to our customers\u2019 success is resulting in deeper partnerships, larger multiyear cloud agreements, and growing momentum across every layer of our differentiated technology stack from application infrastructure to data and AI to business process to productivity and collaboration.","Now, I will briefly highlight our innovation and momentum. In a world where every company is a software company, developers will play an increasingly vital role in value creation across every organization, and GitHub is their home. GitHub is used by more than 36 million developers as well as the largest enterprises, including the majority of the Fortune 50. And we\u2019re investing to build the complete toolchain for developers, independent of language, framework, and cloud.","Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are the most popular code editing tools in the world. With Azure DevOps, you could build, test, and deploy code to any platform; and with Azure PlayFab, we have LiveOps, a complete backend platform to optimize engagement and interaction in real-time.","We are building Azure as the world's computer addressing customers\u2019 real world operational sovereignty and regulatory needs. We\u2019ve 54 data Center regions, more than any other cloud provider, and we were the first in Middle East and in Africa. Azure is the only cloud that extends to the edge spanning identity, management, security, and infrastructure","This year, we introduced new cloud to the edge services and devices from Azure Data Box Edge to Azure Stack HCI to Azure Connect, bringing the full power of Azure to where data is generated. Azure Sphere is the first-of-a-kind edge solution to secure the more than 9 billion MCU powered endpoints coming online each year. And now, IoT plug-and-play seamlessly connects IoT devices to the cloud without having to write a single line of embedded code.","Azure is the most open cloud, and in this quarter, we expanded our partnerships with Oracle, Red Hat, and VMware, to make the technologies and tools customers already have first class on Azure. Azure is the only cloud with limitless data and analytics capabilities across the customers' entire data estate. The variety, velocity, and the volume of data is increasing, and we\u2019re bringing hyper-scale capabilities to relational database services with Azure SQL database, new analytics support in cosmos DB enables customers to build and manage analytics workloads that run real-time over globally distributed data, and we offer the most comprehensive cloud analytics from Azure Data Factory to Azure SQL Data Warehouse to Power BI.","The quintessential characteristic of any application being built in 2019 and beyond will be AI. We are democratizing AI infrastructure tools and services with Azure Cognitive Services, the most comprehensive portfolio of AI tools, so developers can embed the ability to see, hear, respond, translate, reason, and more into their applications.","And this quarter, we introduced a new speech-to-text, search, vision, and decision capabilities. New updates to Azure ML streamline the building, training, and deployment of machine learning models bringing a no-code approach to machine learning. Our differentiated approach from developer tools and infrastructure to data and analytics to AI is driving growth. The world's leading companies trust Azure for their mission-critical workloads, including more than 95% of the Fortune 500. And just yesterday AT&T chose our cloud in one of the largest cloud commitments to date.","Now let's move up the stack to business process. We are redefining business processes with Dynamics 365 and Power Platform with modern, modular, extensible, and AI driven applications. Dynamics 365 uniquely enables any organization to create digital feedback loops and take data from one system and use it to optimize the outcomes of another, enabling any business to become an AI first business.","Our open data initiative with SAP and Adobe builds on this promise giving customers like Coke, HP, Unilever, and Walmart a single 360 view of their customers built on one data model and on one data lake eliminating data silos and driving real-time insights at scale.","This year, we introduced Dynamics 365 AI, a new class of AI applications built for an era where systems of record are converted into systems of engagement and intelligence.","The citizen developer movement is here, and we\u2019re empowering it. 500 new -- 500 million new apps will get created in the next five years and more than the total created in the last 40. Businesses will need to empower domain experts with tools to create applications as well as robotic process automation to streamline and customize workflow like service monitoring and time and expense tracking.","Our Power Platform spanning Power BI, Power Apps, & Flow is the only solution of its kind in the industry. It brings together low-code, no-code app development, robotic process automation, and self-service analytics into a single comprehensive platform. Chevron has gone from 80 users of Power Apps to 5,500 in a year and now has over 200 apps in production. This quarter, we introduced AI Builder, adding AI capabilities like object recognition to any Power App. And with Power BI, we are the leader in business intelligence in the cloud with more than 25 million models hosted on the service and 12 million queries processed each hour.","We are enabling our customers to digitize not only their business processes but to bridge the physical and digital worlds with our investments in mixed reality cloud, spanning HoloLens 2, Azure Spatial Anchors and Dynamics 365 applications. We are seeing traction in every industry from manufacturing to retail to gaming. Airbus alone is pursuing more than 300 use cases from training to design to remote assistance. All this innovation is fueling rapid growth, with more than 90% of the Fortune 500 using Dynamics 365 or Power Platform.","Now to LinkedIn. People are an organization\u2019s most valuable asset. Our strong Talent portfolio from Talent Solutions and Talent Insights, to employee engagement with Glint to LinkedIn Learning enables every organization to attract, retain and develop the best talent in an increasingly competitive jobs market. New capabilities help job seekers find and land more relevant and higher paying jobs through alerts, deeper insights and a new suite of interview prep tools, contributing to another quarter of record job postings.","Marketing Solutions is now our fastest growing business, with new brand and community building tools that make it easier for marketers to connect with LinkedIn\u2019s 645 million members. And we are enabling every business to drive a culture of relationship selling and take full advantage of their social networks, with the combination of Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn Sales Navigator. All this innovation contributed to another record year for LinkedIn, driven by all-time high engagement across the platform.","Now, turning to Microsoft 365. Microsoft 365 is the world's productivity cloud. It empowers everyone, including the 2 billion firstline workers around the world, with an integrated, secure, AI-infused experience on any device. It's the only comprehensive productivity and collaboration and communications solution that integrates with an organization\u2019s critical business process workflows.","Multinationals from L'Oreal and Walgreens Boots Alliance, to the largest chemical producer in the world, BASF, all chose Microsoft 365 this year. And over the last two quarters our premium offerings gained momentum, with S&P Global, CenturyLink and KPMG all selecting Microsoft 365 E5.","Microsoft Teams has had a breakout year. Teams now has more than 13 million daily active users and 19 million weekly active users. It brings together everything a team needs, chat, voice, meetings, collaboration with the power of Office apps, and the business process workflows, into a single, integrated user experience scaffolding, eliminating the need for discreet apps that only increase an organization\u2019s security and compliance exposure. And we\u2019re broadening our opportunity, bringing Teams to new and underpenetrated markets including healthcare, hospitality and retail, as well as firstline workers. We are empowering them with mobile tools in Teams, like shift scheduling and priority notifications.","And we are infusing AI across Microsoft 365 to enable new automation, prediction, translation and insights capabilities. Meetings are more inclusive in Teams, presentations are more accessible in PowerPoint, videos more searchable in Stream and emails more relevant in Outlook. And with Workplace Analytics and Microsoft Search, we take your relationships, schedules and activities and distill insights and knowledge, to help people work smarter, not longer.","We are investing in cybersecurity to protect customers in today\u2019s \u201czero trust\u201d environment. Microsoft is the only company that offers end-to-end security, spanning identity, device endpoints, information, cloud applications as well as infrastructure. It starts with Azure Active Directory and builds with three new services we introduced this year: Microsoft Threat Protection, Azure Sentinel, and Azure Confidential Computing.","We expanded our family of category creating Surface devices this year, including the new Surface Go and Surface Hub 2S. And Windows 10 is active on more than 800 million devices, with accelerating adoption in the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system.","Finally, gaming. We are investing to empower the world\u2019s two billion gamers to play the games they want, with anyone, anywhere on any device with our new game streaming service, Project xCloud, which will enter public trials this fall. Xbox Live Monthly Active Users increased to a record 65 million, with the highest number of mobile and PC users-to-date.","We are bringing one of the world\u2019s most popular video games to a new generation of mobile gamers with Minecraft Earth and mixed reality. And we nearly doubled our first party game studios this year to deliver differentiated content for our fast-growing subscription services like Xbox Game Pass, now available on both console and PC.","In closing, I\u2019m optimistic of what\u2019s ahead. We are accelerating our innovation to deliver differentiated value to customers across the cloud and the edge from GitHub to Azure to Dynamics 365 to Microsoft 365 as well as Xbox Game Pass. We are investing in the right secular trends to expand our opportunity and we are working to earn our customers\u2019 trust every day.","With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook. I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.","Amy Hood","Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. Our fourth quarter revenue was $33.7 billion, up 12% and 14% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 15% and 17% in constant currency. Operating income increased 20% and 24% in constant currency.","This quarter we transferred intangible properties from our foreign subsidiaries to the United States and Ireland, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $2.6 billion. When adjusting for this and the net benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from the fourth quarter of FY18, earnings per share was $1.37, increasing 21% and 24% in constant currency.","In our largest quarter of the year, our sales teams and partners delivered exceptional commercial results, which drove another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. From a geographic perspective, we saw broad-based strength across markets of all sizes.","Customer commitment to our cloud platform continues to grow. In FY19, we closed a record number of multi-million dollar commercial cloud agreements, with material growth in the number of $10 million plus Azure agreements. Commercial bookings growth was significantly ahead of expectations, increasing 22% and 25% in constant currency, driven by strong renewal execution and an increase in the number of larger, long-term Azure contracts.","As a result, our contracted not recognized revenue was $91 billion, up 25% year-over-year, reflecting our continued momentum and growing long-term customer commitment. We expect to recognize approximately 50% of this revenue in the next 12 months. Even with the higher mix of larger, long-term Azure contracts with low upfront billings, commercial unearned revenue was in line with expectations at $34.1 billion, up 13% and 16% in constant currency. And this quarter, our annuity mix was again 90%.","Commercial Cloud revenue was $11 billion, growing 39% and 42% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 6 points year-over-year to 65%, driven again by significant improvement in Azure gross margin. The Company gross margin percentage was 69%, up 2 points year-over-year and ahead of our expectations, driven by sales mix shift to commercial licensing and OEM.","In line with expectations, foreign exchange reduced revenue growth by 2 points and COGS and operating expenses growth by 1 point. Operating expenses grew slightly ahead of expectations, increasing 9% and 10% in constant currency driven by continued investment in cloud and AI engineering, LinkedIn, and GitHub.","Operating margins expanded again this quarter, as a result of strong revenue growth, improving gross margins, and disciplined decisions we\u2019ve made over the past 5 years to invest in strategic and high growth areas.","Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $11 billion, increasing 14% and 17% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by both our cloud and on-premises businesses.","Office commercial revenue grew 14% and 16% in constant currency, including roughly 4 points from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition that benefited both our cloud and on-premises businesses. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 31% and 34% in constant currency, driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as ARPU growth from our customers\u2019 continued shift to our E3 and E5 offerings.","Office 365 commercial seats grew 23% on a prior year comparable that included the strong performance of our Microsoft 365 academic offers. Office Consumer revenue grew 6% and 8% in constant currency, with 4 points of growth from transactional sales in Japan. Office 365 consumer subscriptions grew 34.8 million.","Our Dynamics business grew 12% and 15% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 45% and 48% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 25% and 28% in constant currency with continued strength across all businesses, highlighted by marketing solutions growth of 42%. LinkedIn sessions grew 22%, with record levels of engagement and job postings again this quarter.","Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 20% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased 1 point year-over-year as improvements in LinkedIn and Office 365 margins more than offset increased cloud mix.","Operating expenses increased 8% and 9% in constant currency driven by continued investment in LinkedIn and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 25% and 31% in constant currency.","Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $11.4 billion, increasing 19% and 21% in constant currency. Our on-premises server business drove our better than expected performance. Continued customer demand for our differentiated hybrid solutions drove strong server products and cloud services revenue growth, increasing 22% and 24% in constant currency on a significant revenue base.","Azure revenue increased 64% and 68% in constant currency with another quarter of strong growth in our consumption-based business and continued moderation in our per-user business. And our on-premises server business grew 5% and 7% in constant currency, with roughly 4 points from stronger than expected demand ahead of end of support for SQL and Windows server 2008, as well as continued strength across our hybrid offerings, premium versions, and GitHub. Enterprise Services revenue increased 4% and 6% in constant currency, driven by growth in Premier Support Services.","Segment gross margin dollars increased 19% and 21% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was flat year-over-year as another quarter of material improvement in Azure gross margin offset the growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue.","Operating expenses increased 23% and 24% in constant currency, driven by on-going investments in Cloud and AI engineering and GitHub, as well as revenue driven expenses given the strength of the quarter. Operating income increased 15% and 19% in constant currency.","Now to the More Personal Computing segment. Revenue was $11.3 billion, increasing 4% and 6% in constant currency, ahead of expectations as better than expected performance in Windows more than offset lower than expected Gaming and Search revenue.","In Windows, OEM non-Pro revenue declined 8%, below the consumer PC market with continued pressure in the entry level category. OEM Pro revenue grew 18%, ahead of the commercial PC market, driven by healthy Windows 10 demand, strong momentum in advance of the Windows 7 end of support, and roughly 4 points of benefit from increased inventory levels due to uncertainty around tariffs. Therefore, inventory levels ended the quarter above the normal range.","Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 13% and 16% in constant currency, with strong double-digit billings growth and a higher mix of in-quarter recognition from multi-year agreements. In Surface, revenue grew 14% and 17% in constant currency driven by strength in our commercial segment, particularly in the U.S., Japan, and Canada.","Search revenue ex TAC increased 9% and 10% in constant currency, below expectations driven by lower than expected volume. In Gaming, revenue declined 10% and 8% in constant currency, below expectations driven by lower console sales and monetization across third party titles.","Xbox software and services revenue declined 3% and 1% in constant currency with the tough comparable from a third-party title in the prior year offsetting continued momentum in Xbox Live and Game Pass subscriber growth.","Segment gross margin dollars increased 8% and 10% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased 2 points due to sales mix shift to our higher margin Windows businesses. Operating expenses declined 2% and 1% in constant currency. As a result, operating income grew 18% and 22% in constant currency.","Now back to total company results. As expected, capital expenditures including finance leases were up sequentially to $5.3 billion driven by ongoing investment to meet demand for our cloud services. Cash paid for PP&E was $4.1 billion.","Cash flow from operations increased 41% year-over-year driven by strong cloud billings and collections and roughly 8 points of benefit from tax payments made in the prior year. Free cash flow was $12 billion and increased 62% year-over-year, reflecting strong operating cash flows and the timing of cash payments for PP&E.","For the fiscal year, we generated over $52 billion in operating cash flow and $38 billion in free cash flow, driven by improving margins and operating leverage across our businesses, as well as operating improvements to better optimize cash flow.","Other income was $191 million, higher than anticipated due to recording of mark-to-market gains. As a reminder, under the recently adopted accounting standards for financial investments, we\u2019re required to recognize unrealized gains or losses on our equity portfolio. As a result, we expect increased quarterly volatility in other income and expense. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate came in slightly lower than anticipated at 16%.","And finally, this quarter, we returned $7.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 45%, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $30 billion for the full fiscal year.","Now let\u2019s move to our outlook, starting with Q1, where we expect another strong commercial quarter. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to decrease total company, Productivity and Business Processes, and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately 2 points and more Personal Computing revenue and total company COGS and operating expenses growth by approximately 1 point. ","In our commercial business, we expect continued customer demand to drive commercial unearned revenue up 11% to 12% year-over-year with volatility based on contract type. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will be up slightly on a sequential basis. And we expect capital expenditures to be roughly in line with Q4 as we continue to invest to meet growing demand for our cloud services.","Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $10.7 billion and $10.9 billion driven by double-digit growth in Office commercial, Dynamics, and LinkedIn.","In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $10.3 billion and $10.5 billion. In Azure, revenue growth will continue to reflect a balance of strong growth in our consumption-based business and moderating growth in our per-user business. Our on-premises server business will be driven by demand for our hybrid solutions and premium offerings, as well as the continued benefit from the end of support for SQL Server and Windows Server 2008.","In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $10.7 billion and $11 billion. In Windows, overall OEM revenue growth should be slightly ahead of the PC market driven by healthy commercial demand. Surface revenue will decline slightly year over year driven by product lifecycle transitions. Search ex TAC revenue growth should be roughly in line with Q4.","And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline year over year at a similar rate to Q4 as we move through the end of this console generation and a challenging Xbox software and services comparable from a third-party title in the prior year.","Now back to overall company guidance. We expect COGS of $10.55 billion to $10.75 billion and operating expenses of $10.1 billion to $10.2 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expenses should offset each other.","Next, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be slightly lower than our full-year expected rate of 17% due to the volume of equity vests that take place during our first quarter. And finally, as a reminder on Q1 cash flow, we will be making a $4.7 billion tax payment related to TCJA transition tax and the Q4 transfer of intangible property.","Now I would like to share some comments on FY20. First, FX. Assuming that current rates remain stable, we expect FX to reduce full-year revenue and COGS growth by 1 point. FX should have no impact on operating expense growth.","Next, revenue. At the company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue growth with another year of strong performance and continued momentum in our commercial business. As a reminder, our commercial licensing and OEM Pro businesses in the second half of the year will be impacted by a comparable that benefitted from the end of support of SQL server 2008, Windows server 2008, and Windows 7, as well as transactional strength in Japan.","We expect revenue in our gaming business to be down slightly year-over-year as double-digit growth in Xbox Software and Services will be offset by declining console sales. We do expect a stronger H2 than H1 in Gaming as we work through a third-party title comparison.","And as a reminder, an increasing number of large, long-term Azure contracts will drive more quarterly volatility in our commercial bookings and unearned revenue growth.","Next, commercial cloud gross margin. Revenue mix will continue to shift to our Azure consumption-based services. Even with this headwind, we expect commercial cloud gross margin percentage to be up slightly as we again drive meaningful improvement in Azure gross margin. Capital expenditures will increase to meet the growing demand for our cloud services.","Finally, on operating expenses, we will continue to invest given our strong execution, growing competitive position, and our significant ambition in high growth areas. Investment in areas like Cloud through AI and GitHub, Business Applications through Dynamics, Power Platform, and LinkedIn, Microsoft 365 through Teams, Security, and Surface as well as Gaming should result in operating expense growth of 11% to 12%.","Even with these strategic investments, the continued shift to our cloud business, and our very strong finish to FY19, we expect double-digit operating income growth as well as stable operating margins. We are looking forward to FY20.","With that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.","Michael Spencer","Thanks, Amy. We will now move over to Q&A. With respect for others on the call, we request the participants to please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Keith Weiss","Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and very nice end to a really strong FY19. I wanted to focus on the Office 365. If I\u2019m looking at this right, I think you guys saw acceleration in the Office 365 commercial business and in the kind of recipe to getting there seems to have changed a little bit of that as more sort of positive pricing versus just the seat growth. Is there a changing dynamic in kind of what\u2019s pushing growth there, because we had seen the F1 SKU and the frontline workers bringing down the price point a little bit. It looks like the pricing actually improved this quarter. How should we think about sort of the dynamics, what\u2019s going to be driving growth for Office 365 into FY20 and beyond?","Amy Hood","Thanks, Keith. Let me walk through a little bit of this, because there are some new behaviors that I think are important this quarter, but the fundaments that you talked about are relatively unchanged. We continue to see and saw again installed base growth across all of our customer segments from the enterprise to small business. That\u2019s happening not just because of frontline workers, but also continued expansion and continued movement in every segment where we see the opportunity to increase the installed base. We did see ARPU growth this quarter. It wasn\u2019t as much different from the -- from past quarters. We continue to see improvement from E3 and E5 transitions, saw both again. And I think we were quite encouraged by E5 performance, particularly in Q4 as we ended the quarter, which was great to see. What you saw a little bit and I referred to it was some more in-quarter recognition, but let me talk about why that\u2019s happening because it's got two important and positive trends that underlie it. The first thing is we're seeing longer commitments. When you see longer commitments under 606, you often have more recognition upfront. And so, we saw longer commitment and we\u2019ve got a little bit more recognition in the quarter, and so you saw then revenue grow a little faster. The other thing that we saw is increasing focus as we were having more conversations across organizations around Azure and rethinking their digital transformation plans with us, it opens up a very large conversation around the value Microsoft 365 can bring as people go through and think about those transitions. And so, the fact that we then -- we\u2019re often seeing extensions take place of prior commitments on Office 365 to again be longer and include the Azure contracts. When that happens, it's almost like you\u2019re adding new products and new value and a lot of that gets recognized faster in-quarter when you see that happen. And so, when you have a dynamic where you\u2019re seeing longer contracts plus you\u2019re able to sell more and new things, and I think different conversations around Microsoft 365, it was a good execution by the team and I think a recognition of the value that we continue to put into that what we believe is our hero -- hero experience.","Keith Weiss","Excellent. Sounds great.","Michael Spencer","Thanks, Keith. Operator, we will move to next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you very much and congratulations not only on the great end to the year, but confidence into next -- not next quarter and next year in terms of growth, investment, et cetera. We met recently at E3 with your gaming team and heard a lot about the steps that were being taken. Satya, can you give us more color, explanation -- excuse me, on how you see the gaming business fitting into the overall company's direction over next the few years, specifically how does gaming change? How does the synergy between gaming and the rest of the business change? How should we think about that overall mix and that whole [ph] morph that\u2019s going to occur? Thanks.","Satya Nadella","Sure. First, I\u2019d say we are in gaming because of what we believe are going to be the secular changes in the gaming addressable market for us. We\u2019ve always had a gaming position with console as well as the PC, but going forward, we think that any endpoint can in fact be a great endpoint for high-end games, which is where our structural position is. And we now have a business model with Game Pass as well as all the supporting mechanisms for Game Pass like game streaming, we\u2019ve a social network in Xbox Live that is the best in the business. So I feel we are well positioned to what is going to be a much larger market than what was traditionally gaming, in spite of all the success we\u2019ve had over the years in gaming. Now the second point is that it builds on the rest of the cloud investment. So, if you think about what we are doing with xCloud, it's a hero workload on top of Azure. So when we think about capital allocation, what\u2019s happening in the Cloud, what\u2019s happening in the Edge, how we build the network to optimize for streaming the same infrastructure, for example, is what Sony has decided to use as well, and be on Azure as well as use our AI capability. So, you will see significant synergies in terms of the architectural platform underneath gaming, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, LinkedIn all being the same.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you. I appreciate it and congrats.","Michael Spencer","Thanks, Mark. Operator, we will take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you so much. I had a couple questions for Amy. Just thinking through with the Azure mix becoming an ever bigger portion of IC revenue and when you factor in continued gross margin expansion that you continue to show in Azure, how should we think about the gross margin potential of IC overall? And I guess, I also wanted to ask about the build out of data centers related to the cloud build out, how do we think about your points of presence today from a coverage perspective, if you will, versus the regional -- the revenue pockets that you\u2019re targeting over the next few years? Thanks.","Amy Hood","Great. Heather, let me -- on gross margin, over a long-term period and intelligent cloud, given the expansive TAM and the growth opportunity we see, it will create gross margin pressure over long-term. Now over the next period, especially in H1, we continue to see -- expect to see very good hybrid percentage and execution, which help to offset some of that. So even as we continue to see Azure gross margin improvement at the IaaS and PaaS layer, just given the TAM and our opportunities, it will create long-term pressure on that gross margin number. But of course a lot of opportunity in terms of gross margin dollar growth and of course operating margin dollar growth as we move forward. When it comes to our build out, Heather, I tend to think two components. The majority of our capital expenditures is actually in server equipment, it's new capacity. It's not necessarily in the overall geo footprint build out. We will of course continue to do that where it makes sense and where opportunity presents itself. We do a very good job in terms of supply chain and being able to -- be able to get those up and running quite quickly. But the majority of the investment today is continuing to build capacity inside existing incredibly large data centers.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you very much, Amy.","Michael Spencer","Thanks, Heather. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Please proceed.","Jennifer Lowe","Great. Thank you. Satya, you mentioned the AT&T deal that was announced, I think earlier this week. IBM also had an announcement with AT&T. Oracle has been a long time partner with AT&T in the cloud as well. I don\u2019t want to dwell on AT&T in particular, but I do think it's interesting that a few different large scale cloud players are around the table there. So as you see more of these very large deals out there and Amy mentioned the increase in $10 million deals. How often are those multi-cloud deals and companies taking that sort of approach versus once that are committing to Microsoft and how do you navigate that landscape?","Satya Nadella","Yes, when I think overall, you all I think do a good job of tracking what is the public cloud competition and that\u2019s the competition we pay most attention to. And in this context I think we see a mix. There a few of us who are at scale in public cloud who are very competitive, and anybody who decides to be multi-cloud, public cloud, those are the winners. When someone thinks that only using one cloud, we're definitely one of the names. And in the case of AT&T we were the only public cloud in there. And so that\u2019s why we highlighted -- they highlighted us and we highlighted that in our quarterly announcement.","Amy Hood","And I will think general what we see, especially as contract gets larger, for us the opportunity under Tier 1 workloads for us to really see TAM growth. It's just expansive. And so, Jennifer, listen, I kind of think about this as we\u2019ve a incredibly strong footprint inside existing enterprises today, that footprint and you can see it in our results. Customers are relying on us for not only that footprint, but as they continue to expand to sit under the Tier 1 opportunity we haven't seen before. And so we, of course, see multi-cloud in a lot of our larger accounts, but this type of significant commitments is an opportunity, I think, you will continue to see us execute well on.","Jennifer Lowe","Great. Thank you.","Michael Spencer","Thanks, Jen. Operator, we will take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Karl Keirstead","Thank you. Amy, I\u2019ve got a question about the Windows business. A couple of the metrics, 18% Windows OEM Pro and 16% on the volume licensing side were extraordinary. I know you called out a couple of, call it, one-time issues around inventory levels and an uptick in in-quarter revs. But I wanted to ask you two questions. How much of a tail do you think we\u2019ve left on the Win7 to Win10 migration? Is it too cautious to say that there's really just two quarters of that tailwind left? And, secondly, on the volume licensing or commercial and cloud services segment, do you think that can, in fiscal '20 contribute to your overall double-digit growth? Thanks a lot.","Amy Hood","Thanks, Karl. And I will actually combine these, because really those are fundamental driver that sits underneath this and then we can get to the specifics of end of support. There's, I think a recognized momentum with Windows 10 if deployment inside of enterprises for its security and management value prop. We worked hard and I think Satya mentioned some of the new features as we continue to invest on security for all of our products. One of the places I think it often resonates the most is with Windows 10 and inside that value. The OEM Pro number as I talked about was impacted by a number of factors, but what we\u2019ve seen is over the past three or four quarters, a pretty consistent sort of high single-digit performance once you take out various impacts and chip supply and inventory levels on the tariffs. That performance certainly has some end of support impact to it as we've talked about before. I think, in general, what we've seen in prior releases is, it does extend a bit past the deadline, especially in our small and mid-sized business customers, and it's really important for us to continue to work hard to have the small and medium businesses find a path forward to make sure they can experience the most secure computing environment we have. And so, we will see some extension pass the line, we certainly have seen three or four quarters of that and we certainly expect H1 to remain strong. The more important part around the security management value prop is in fact I'm going to pivot back again a little bit, because it's the same thing we saw in Office. The Microsoft 365 value prop to customers, especially in the second half of the year and particularly in Q4, has three components. It has Office 365, it has EMS, and it has its Windows 10 commercial component. The Windows 10 commercial component will look far more like our success and our motion and overall being able to sell the Microsoft 360 value prop. It was a good quarter for that. We\u2019ve seen consistent double-digit billings in this segment and it speaks to that. I expect that to continue, although you will have volatility because what's interesting about that specific metric is, it has a little bit more 606 impact than we\u2019ve felt it's an on-prem product. And so there will be volatility in this number, but the consistent theme of being double-digit billings that really match our strength in Office 365, I think -- and I do expect to continue.","Karl Keirstead","Okay, terrific. Thanks, Amy.","Michael Spencer","Thanks, Karl. Operator, we will move to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Philip Winslow","Hey. Thanks, guys for taking my question and congrats on a great close to a great year. I just wanted to focus in on M 365, particularly Satya your comments on Microsoft Teams. Really kind of two components for this question. How do you think about sort of why customers are adopting Teams, especially the larger ones that you highlighted at Ignite Conference. Is it the fact, let's say, single app with those combined features you talked about or is it the broader, you call it, Office experience? And then, I guess a question for Amy then off of that. When you think about sort of the relevance of Teams on a going forward basis to keep this migration up, E1, E3, E5 and then plus those add-ons that are associated with Teams like Calling etcetera, how critical is Teams to this -- to the long-term, call it, like, price migration here at Office and M 365?","Satya Nadella","Yes. So, overall, I think there's no question this last fiscal year has been an absolute breakout year for Teams in terms of both the product innovation and most importantly at-scale deployment and usage that we\u2019re seeing. And I think, in fact unlike any other time other than Windows, we've not had this kind of platform effect. Office has obviously had very, very successful individual products that have been deployed broadly, but each of them was a singular tool. Perhaps SharePoint was the last time we had a platform effect of this kind. But Teams is -- transcends all that. It's the communications tool, it's the collaboration tool, it's the line of business tool for meetings as well as business process. And so, the amount of value creation for the customer by deployment is something that we ourselves are sort of really learning a lot each deployment, whether it's on the first line. The other point about Teams is just not limited to knowledge workers, which has been really the only place traditionally we play. Even our licenses to the non-knowledge workers were just mostly licenses of the tools we built for knowledge workers. Whereas now, we actually have specific value, which is in fact very valuable to those first line workers. And the thing that we have realized is, that businesses are in fact looking to spend more for those first line worker productivity. So we\u2019re in a very early innings of it, but we are pretty excited. The one other benefit, to sort of tease off with some of the comments Amy was making is that security compliance and governance is a huge issue for enterprise customers and commercial customers at scale. And Teams in some sense helps them a lot, because it builds on all the rest of the investment they\u2019ve made already in Office 365. And so we see that benefit even on that front.","Amy Hood","And I think it's an important component of our M 365 value, but it's really not outsized. I mean, we\u2019ve all these components value, that's really that\u2019s been the secret of what customers look and see. They see Teams that can not only change what Satya talked about, but also develop culture change in terms of employees being able to be involved and collaborate regardless of the org chart and that is what you're going to see. When we have 500 million new applications built in the next five years, you're going to see and I believe Teams to be one of the major interfaces through which that experience and business process reinvention will happen. Teams really expand multiple categories, so I wouldn't think of adjusted productivity or even just collab or meetings but as an interface. As you see business process reinvention occur, I do think of this as the surface through which many people will experience that. And so, I would ask to try to expand your thinking on this one, it's not just Office or needed to be an Office, it's really about having employees fundamentally experience Microsoft in a different way day-to-day.","Satya Nadella","Yes and I would point to the conference we just finished and some of the demos, and I think the customer demos, in particular, I would say, that will sort of probably give you the best feel for how people look at this in terms of the deployment characteristics.","Philip Winslow","Great. Thanks, guys.","Michael Spencer","Thanks, Phil. Operator, we will move to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.","Mark Murphy","Thank you very much. Amy, you\u2019re mentioning large and long-term Azure contracts. I'm wondering as we consider this robust 25% growth in your commercial bookings this quarter, roughly how many points are coming from that -- from any tailwind of the longer duration types of contracts? And then, Satya, I wanted to ask you regarding the recent partnership with AT&T. Some media report said it was worth over $2 billion. Wondering if there's some hyperbole there in the media, or is this an example of how Microsoft can play in every line of the company's OpEx budgets today?","Satya Nadella","I will just take the second one then you can go on. I mean I think it is a very significant deal. I\u2019m not going to comment on any specific dollar terms, it is the largest commercial deal that we\u2019ve signed of the size and we see -- we\u2019ve line of sight to many more such deals.","Amy Hood","When we think about bookings growth, I'm not sure -- for me -- break it down into two pieces, which is I think about bookings which were very good this quarter, has two fundamental motions. There's a motion around renewals and there's a motion around new. Both were very good this quarter and it wasn't while certainly long-term Azure contracts had a meaningful component of the new, they weren't alone and being the only component of the new. And renewals, as I mentioned earlier, we saw very good execution, not just on renewals in quarter, but really healthy behavior in terms of maybe expirations that we\u2019ve seen happen earlier in the year getting renewed, because of the new value prop and the commitment of the sales team to make sure that we landed a really thoughtful high customer value transaction. So, while these long-term large contracts will add volatility to that number, if you look at our -- see in our balance of $91 billion and see that that also grew 25% year-over-year, you will get a sense that it certainly wasn't alone in its impact for the year.","Mark Murphy","Thank you.","Michael Spencer","Thanks, Mark. Operator, we will move to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.","Raimo Lenschow","Hey, thanks and congrats from me as well. I wanted to zone in on Dynamics. There, you obviously like, you\u2019re playing in applications and we've seen other vendors kind of do SaaS applications. If you look at Dynamics Online, you now on my math kind of around $2 billion, but still growing at a clip that organically, not many others have achieved. It's now bigger than your on-premise business. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers there? And is there -- what are the ways to kind of keep in -- how did you achieve that over this scale and what are the drivers going forward? Thank you.","Satya Nadella","Yes, we\u2019re very, very excited about the progress again in the last fiscal year around Dynamics 365. Both the traditional business process applications themselves have become much more modular and a much more modern and we\u2019ve a very disruptive business model as well that goes with it. And so, therefore, we\u2019re becoming much more competitive with very large customers deploying whether it's sales or operations. The other exciting thing is we\u2019ve this entire new class of applications and I talked about this even into this week's conference, which is these AI-first modules, whether it's for sales, for marketing, for customer service or this Customer 360. And these are modules that there isn't an installed base of those anywhere, no competition even exist. So in other words, we can in fact have these modules get deployed in commercial customers even on top of existing business applications. And so we feel that we\u2019ve plenty of opportunity ahead. Again, this is a place where we\u2019re a very low share player. And so the fact that we will become a very competitive supplier of this technology at a time where the world needs more business process automation, we feel good about the opportunity ahead.","Raimo Lenschow","All right. Thank you.","Michael Spencer","Thanks, Raimo. Operator, we will take our last question now, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Brent Bracelin","Thank you for taking question here. I wanted to drill down in the Commercial Cloud gross margins. They were up 200 basis points sequentially, 600 basis points year-over-year to 65%. I guess, my question here is how sustainable are the cloud gross margins now that you're at this $40 billion plus scale, or were there some kind of one-time benefits we should think about in the quarter that helped you there? Thanks.","Satya Nadella","There were not any one-time benefits in this quarter that helped us. This is really about seeing improvement in some of our largest services and continue to see improvement year-over-year in the largest services. What we said for FY20 and certainly in Q1 as we expected to be up sequentially in Q1 and we will continue to get some headwind because of the strong Azure IaaS and PaaS growth we expect through the year, but we certainly think that Azure fundamental gross margin improvement will help offset that next year.","Brent Bracelin","Great. Thank you.","Michael Spencer","That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We appreciate you joining us, and look forward to speaking with all of you soon.

Today I will share the results for the first quarter and discussed how we are innovating into growing each of our segments. Overall we are off to a good start in FY '17. We delivered $22.3 billion in revenue this quarter, an increase of 5% in constant currency. I am proud of the continued progress.","Our platforms are leading profound digital transformation outcomes for both people and organizations. At our IT conference Ignite, I talked about how we are innovating in AI across the entire text back and how I will be infused into everything we do. To accelerate our innovation we've created a dedicated organization to focus on artificial intelligence. As I turned to progress we made by segment this quarter, I will highlight how these investments we're making in AI fuel innovation across all of our ambitions.","Let's start with productivity and business process. We're helping people be more productive by bringing intelligence to familiar office apps they use every day. We recently introduced cloud power intelligence within Word, Excel, PowerPoint and outlook that uses machine learning and advanced natural language processing to help automate related content and connections focus your inbox and more easily create compelling content.","We are also building intelligence into our apps to provide advanced security for customers. This quarter we announced Office 365 threat intelligence which analyzes billions of signals across office Azure Windows and external data sources to give customers broad visibility into attack trends and proactively recommend security policy adjustments. We're extending intelligence to compliance with our new data governance service which helps customers achieve organizational compliance and automate data retention.","These advancements are part of our ongoing commitment to strengthen security for Office 365 customers. We\u2019re seeing broad momentum with customers across enterprises, small business and consumers. Monthly active users of Office 365 commercial are now over 85 million, up more than 40% year-over-year. Office 365 commercial seats were also up 40% year-over-year and revenue up 54% in constant currency. Across industries, customers such as eBay, European airline, jet, global pharmaceutical company, Allergan, the Fortune 100 companies like the energy leader Exelon and Liberty Mutual Insurance are choosing Office 365 to help make their employees more productive and secure.","Customers love the power of office on any device. We now have more than 45 million outlook monthly active devices on iOS and android more than 70% increase year-over-year.","Last week we unveiled a new class of purpose built intelligent apps in Dynamics 365 designed to remove any impedance that exists between productivity, collaboration and business process. Using advanced analytics a machine learning, these new apps glean insights from previously siloed data to transform how people work across finance, sales, marketing and customer service. They monitor customer relationship help, reveal connections, forecast demand and predict risk and the deep integration with Office 365 makes it easy to take action communicate and collaborate in real time or schedule a follow up.","Our innovations the Dynamics 365 build on our existing momentum, dynamics online paid seats more than doubled year-over-year and customers increasingly prefer our cloud solutions with more than 70% of the new dynamics CRM and ERP enterprise customers choosing dynamics online. Companies like HP, Inc. are replacing their existing CRM systems with Dynamics 365 to take advantage of the built-in intelligence and our latest release and transforming engagement with customers and partners. Overall, we are well positioned to compete and grow our Sarah in this large and growing market.","Now let's talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Customers continue to choose the Microsoft cloud to help transform their businesses and organizations. Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $13 billion, and we remain on track to achieve our goal of $20 million in fiscal year 2018. Once enterprise customers choose one of our cloud services they continue to adopt more services.","More than 60% of the fortune 500 now have at least three of our cloud offerings, up 20 points year-over-year. And as with last quarter, we continue to grow our commercial annuity mix which is now at 88%. Customers choose Microsoft for three reasons. They wanted trusted global hyper scale cloud provider to meet the enterprise grade needs, they want hybrid support that is architected into both the hyper scale service and the cloud servers, they want higher level services to help them build their own digital capability inclusive of DevOps, productivity, new IOT and enterprise app development, advanced analytics and machine learning in AI capability.","These differentiated features are leading our cloud infrastructure growth. As revenue once again through to build it just wanted to 21% in constant currency with Azure compete usage more than doubling year-over-year. We continue to invest in and expand our data center footprint which now totals 38 regions including the announcement of our planned expansion into France and the recent opening of data centers in the United Kingdom and Germany.","Enterprises like Nissan alliance, hotels, as well as public sector customers such as the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense, the islands, health services executive are choosing brand tends to transform their organizations while meeting European data sovereignty security and compliance needs. Security and compliance remain paramount for enterprise customers. Azure is already the most trusted most compliant cloud with 49 certifications, more than any other cloud provider and our US government cloud has the highest number of certifications and dedicated data center regions in the industry to meet the stringent requirements of our public sector customers.","We are applying AIT security with the new Azure security Center which leverages advanced analytics and machine learning to detect threats and help enterprise customers respond with comprehensive cyber security and management.","Looking beyond infrastructure services, across industries customers like trucks North America, and are using Azure intelligence services to build powerful new offerings for their customers. More than half of the fortune 500 have our enterprise mobility services up more than 20 points year-over-year. This quarter we released a premium version of our enterprise mobility service that includes advanced security management for SaaS applications, automatic document classification and encryption, advanced identity protection, and we crossed three quarters of 1 billion unique user identities in Azure active directory.","This quarter we announced a number of key partnerships. Adobe and as a be recognized Azure's leadership in the cloud on bringing their industry leading marketing and human resource solutions to our platform, giving our mutual customers powerful new ways to transform their business. Customers and developers are also choosing Azure for its openness. Enabling digital transformation for everyone means supporting the widest range of platform frameworks and tools.","This quarter we announced that we are open source Windows power shall, our industry-leading infrastructure management tool and made it available on Linux. We continue to see strong interest in the previous post SQL Server with 19,000 customers registered including more than half of the fortune 500. It's opening conversations with customers spanning their entire data state both on premise and in the cloud. Azure fabric on Linux enables to high skill microservices and cloud applications. And we announced that our new power platform in Azure capable of extra scale compute will support Caf\u00e9, torch and our own frameworks for deep learning. ","Finally, we're building our server products to become the edge of our cloud to support true hybrid computing. The new Windows server 2015 gives IT professionals new layers of security and brings Azure inspired innovation for infrastructure and cloud applications. And we expanded our partnership with doctor to make the commercially supported Docker engine available to Windows 2016 customers at no additional cost.","Now let's talk about more computing were very also seeing intelligence transform Windows 10 and our ecosystem of devices. We now have more than 400 million monthly active devices on Windows 10 and nearly 200,000,000,000 hours of usage. And we are expanding our growth opportunities for Windows with enterprises and an area such as gaming.","Last quarter I outlined three aspects of our Windows strategy. First deliver more value and innovation, particularly for enterprise customers. Second, grow new monetization through services across the unified Windows platform. Third, innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs. Let me talk to the progress we're making in each. This quarter we release Windows 10 anniversary update with advanced security features including Windows defender, threat protection, our cloud enabled service that helps enterprise detect, investigate and respond to advance networking tax. And with threat intelligence sharing capabilities we enable IT to investigate and respond to security threats across Windows 10 and Office 365. Our advancements in security helped to drive by three times at present Windows enterprise deployments over the last six months.","The growth and customer option is also driving increased developers search and Cortana engagement. The number of developers building and updating universal Windows apps is up three times year-over-year, more than 1000 application of been developed using the Cortana API and Windows 10 Cortana search box now has 141 million monthly active users with almost 13,000,000,000 questions asked to date.","Gaming is a leading driver of engagement on Windows 10 and opens up new experience it and scenarios across Windows devices. For the past three consecutive months Xbox one has been the number one selling console in the United States, giving a strong momentum heading into the holiday season. Our highly engage Xbox live database continues to grow across Windows 10 IOS and android up 21% year-over-year, and we have more than 20 billion hours of gameplay on Windows 10 PCs and tablets, more than 500% increase year-over-year.","Our commitment to grow Xbox live community led us to acquire beam this quarter, and innovative and interactive live streaming service that gives viewers the ability to watch and play along with their favorite game in real time. Finally, let's talk about her progress in new device categories. Surface continues to drive category growth and more commercial customers are choosing to deploy service with the deals of 500 devices or more increasing 70% year-over-year and we are reaching more commercial customers of all sizes with the support of our channel partners.","The Windows holographic platform and Microsoft Hololens are opening up new differentiated opportunities on Windows. This quarter we made Microsoft Hololens development edition available to all developers and business customers in the US and Canada and last week we expanded our presence to six additional markets. Enterprise customers like Volvo, Japan Airlines and the PGA tour, all embracing Microsoft Hololens to transform the way they work and create new mixed reality experiences for customers.","It's still early, but it's great to see the innovation and creativity that developers are bringing to the platform and coming in 2017 we will enable our hardware partners to deliver entirely new mixed reality experiences with Windows holographic and on Windows 10. In closing, we are leading digital transformation across all industries and geographies. Creating enormous opportunity for Microsoft and our partners. As we infuse AI into all of our computing platforms and experiences, we will drive even greater transformational value for our customers. In the coming weeks, I'm looking forward to sharing news about our new innovation in Windows 10 and Office 365.","Now let me hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook and I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.","Amy Hood","Thank you, Satya and good afternoon everyone. This quarter revenue was $22.3 billion up 3% and 5% in constant currency. Gross margin was flat and up 2% in constant currency. Operating income was flat and grew 4% in constant currency and earnings per share was $0.76, increasing 9% or 13% in constant currency.","I'm pleased with the strong execution was on the first quarter from our sales teams and the partner ecosystem. Across both our commercial and consumer businesses. Across most markets our results were in line with microeconomic trends. With strength in key markets like the US, Western Europe and Japan. Momentum and cloud services contributed to a total commercial annuity mix of 88%, up two points from the prior year.","We again saw higher than expected transactional deal volume, primarily driven by office commercial products and our small and midsize business segment. This quarter the dollar volume of annuity expirations was significantly larger than the prior year, and was solid renewals from that base, we grew our commercial bookings by 18%.","The larger base also drove our contracted not billed balance to more than 25 The larger base also drove our contracted not billed balance to more than $25.5 billion. Strong execution resulted in better than expected commercial revenue of $22.3 million or an 8% increase in constant currency. Our commercial cloud revenue run rate exceeded $13 billion this quarter, growing 59%.","As I assure previously, we expect our commercial cloud gross margin percentage to materially improve throughout the year. This quarter our commercial cloud gross margin percentage was 49%, up seven points sequentially, although we do expect variability from quarter to quarter. Importantly, gross margin dollars grew by 61% across the total commercial cloud. ","Now the company gross margin. Our company gross margin was approximately 65%, down a little less than two points from the prior year, impacted by an increasing mix of commercial cloud revenue, slightly offset by improvements in more personal computing. The revenue performance in more personal computing largely drove COGS above our expectations. This quarter the FX impact on total and segment level revenue was in line with expectations. FX had a two point negative impact on productivity and business processes and Intelligent Cloud results, and a one point negative impact on more personal computing results.","Total operating expenses were flat and grew 1% in constant currency from investment supporting our commercial cloud. At the company level, operating income grew 4% in constant currency.","Let's turn to each segment where we can now discuss constant currency impacted the revenue and operating income levels. This quarter our productivity and business processes segment delivered results above our expectations with approximately $6.7 billion in revenue, an increase of 6% and 8% in constant currency. In office commercial revenue increased by 5% and 8% in constant currency as Office 365 growth continued to outpace the shift from our on premise business. We again grew our install base across all the workloads.","In our Office 365 commercial business are premium workload mix was above 60%. As mentioned earlier, our transactional results were higher than expected in the small and mid-size customer and segment and benefited from a stabilizing commercial PC market. Office consumer revenue grew 8% also a percent in constant currency benefited from a stronger than expected consumer PC market. Subscriber fee growth and recurring subscription revenue and our dynamics business grew 11% up 13% in constant currency as customer preference for cloud services and CRM online and dynamic the X the timber the two billings and seat growth.","Segment gross margin dollars were flat up 2% in constant currency. Segment gross margin percentage declined on an increase in cloud revenue mix. Operating expenses grew 2%, also 2% in constant currency primarily driven by investments in cloud engineering. Operating income declined slightly but was up 2% in constant currency. Intelligent Cloud segment delivered nearly $6.4 billion in revenue above our expectations and grew 10% or 10% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services grew 11% and 13% in constant currency. Demand for our hybrid cloud offerings led to another quarter of double digit annuity revenue growth within server products and cloud services, partially offset by a decline in our transactional on premise server business. Server premium products grew double digits in constant currency.","As expected, enterprise services revenue growth slowed this 12.45% and 2% in constant currency, largely due to a decrease in volume of support agreements associated with Windows server 2003 and support. Gross margin dollars grew 2% and 4% in constant currency and segment gross margin percentage declined primarily due to increase in cloud revenue mix, partially offset by significant improvement in Azure gross margin. Given the growth opportunity in cloud, we increased our operating expenses by 21%, also 21% in constant currency to fund cloud engineering, sales capacity and developer engagement. Consequently, operating income declined 14% and 11% in constant currency. ","Now to our final segment, more personal computing. Revenue was $9.3 billion, down 2% and 1% in constant currency and better than expected across multiple businesses. First, our OEM results. Our total OEM business was flat this quarter were in line with the PC market and better than we expected. OEM Pro revenue grew 1%, reflecting the stabilizing commercial PC market, particularly in the US. OEM non-Pro revenue declined by 1%, slightly ahead of the consumer PC market driven by a higher mix of premium devices. Channel inventory levels for OEM Pro and non-Pro remained at normal levels.","We're seeing strong growth in Windows 10 deployments. The annuity portion of our Windows commercial business grew again in constant currency as customers continue to commit to our differentiated security and management solutions. ","Overall, our total Windows commercial business revenue across small and mid-size businesses enterprises and academic institutions was flat and grew 2% year-over-year in constant currency. Patent licensing revenue increased this quarter, primarily due to favorable results in our annual contractual agreements. Our search business grew again this quarter driven by rate and volume improvements in being. The our growth rate is moderated we continue to gain share and scale while delivering profit. As expected, devices revenue declined this quarter. Revenue decreased 27% down 25% in constant currency due to a revenue declined 72% to 71% in constant currency.","Surface revenue increased 38% 39% in constant currency driven by year-over-year growth for surface Pro and bulk which launched in Q2 of the prior year. In gaming revenue decline 5% or 4% in constant currency, due to lower console hardware revenue. We continue to see strong engagement on our platform with monthly active Xbox live users up 21%. Our software and services revenue from console, PC in other gaming devices grew 6% or 8% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars.1% up 1% in constant currency as decreases due to Xbox consoles and phone were partially offset by our search and surface results. Segment gross margin percentage improved slightly given the revenue shift to higher margin products and services.","Operating expenses decreased 13% also 13% in constant currency primarily based on reduced phone spend and lower marketing spend resulting in segment operating income growth of 26% and 31% in constant currency. ","Now back to our company results. We invested $2.3 billion in capital expenditures, a decline from Q4 but consistent with our plan for investment to support customer and partner demand for our commercial and consumer cloud services. During the quarter we continued to rebalance our investment portfolio which resulted in other income and expense of $100 million from net recognized gains on investments in income from dividends and interest partially offset by interest expense. Our Non-GAAP effective tax rate was 70% this quarter. As I mentioned before, our income tax rate is impacted by three sectors. The proportion of service revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue, and the timing of equity and our first quarter equity best impact of the REIT more significantly been in other quarters.","We returned $6.6 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. We also raised our quarterly dividend by 8% to $.39. With that overview of the quarter, let's turn to the outlook. My commentary for the upcoming quarter does not include LinkedIn. We still expect the transaction to close in the second quarter.","Turning to FX, we expect one point of revenue impact of both the total company and individual segment levels. We expect our commercial business to remain healthy, but we will still see and experience variability our transactional business. We were also see strong annuity growth driven by solid renewal execution and increasing customer adoption and use of our cloud services. Therefore, we expect commercial revenue to be within the region $21.05 billion to $21.25 billion.","Next on CapEx, we will continue to invest to meet growing demand and see quarterly variability in spend. We expect the sequential dollar increase in the upcoming quarter. For the full year our total expected CapEx growth rate should be lower than FY '16 event efficiency improvements.","Now let me share some additional thoughts for each segment. In productivity and business processes we expect revenue of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion. We expect the ongoing transition to the cloud to drive install base growth with continuing declines in our transactional business.","For the Intelligent Cloud segment, we expect revenue of 6.5 5 billion For the Intelligent Cloud segment, we expect revenue of $6.55 billion to $6.75 million driven by strong annuity growth across our server products and cloud services. We anticipate the enterprise services revenue will decline due to lower volumes of Windows server 2003 service agreement.","We expect more personal computing revenue to be $11.2 billion to $11.6 billion. This segment is impacted by different trends in our other two segments so some additional detail.","First on Windows. We expect our OEM business and the underlying PC market to be closely aligned. As a reminder, our OEM Pro business we exited Q2 last year with a slightly higher level of inventory. We currently see normal inventory levels in the channel which will dampen year-over-year growth of it. In search we expect things revenue growth to be similar to Q1. Additionally, we expect that total search revenue growth will slow considerably as we pass the one year anniversary of our young to deal and the associated change in revenue recognition. Phone revenue will continue to decline and as we previously announced, we anticipate closing the sale of our feature phone business in Q2. We expect surface revenue to decline as we anniversary the product launch from a year ago.","And in gaming we expect strong share performance in key markets like the US and the UK this holiday, but overall revenue will decline given lower price points and lower overall console units as mix shift towards Xbox One and Xbox One S. We expect continued active engagement growth on our gaming platform given the holiday season.","We expect COGS to be $9.7 billion to $9.9 billion with variability driven by device sales. We expect operating expenses between $7.85 billion and $7.95 billion in Q2, and we remain on path for full year operating expense of $31.1 billion to $31.4 billion. We expect other income and expenses to be $150 million as we continue to balance games on equity investments and income from interest and dividends against the interest expense in the net cost of hedging. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be 20% plus or minus two points with variability due to three factors discussed earlier.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris for Q&A.","Chris Suh","Thanks Amy. We will now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.","Brent Thill","Satya on Azure the numbers were really impressive given how hard the comp was, I'm curious if you could just help out a little more color in terms of what you saw during the quarter and maybe how some of the ticket sizes or sizes these are signs changing from the past year ? Thank you.","Satya Nadella","Overall, again I go back to how we think about Azure. We really have a view of distributed computing which is more expansive doing just even our HyperScale cloud. We think about Azure and our servers as one distributed computing fabric that\u2019s building. We also don't think of Office 365 and Dynamics 365 as independent, we think of them altogether building out our commercial cloud because it takes one of the bigger growth areas we have in Azure, it's IoT but it's not just people connecting sensors and collecting data. They collect the data, they store the data, the analyze and do predictions on it but then after you do predictions you got to do something about the predictions. So in many cases they choose to use especially with the new Dynamics 365 field service module automating field service.","So it's those higher level scenarios that we are seeing in addition to the core infrastructure that supports hybrid that I think is accelerating and that's something that obviously we didn't make the decision last quarter to do that. This is a decision we made many, many years ago in some sense inception of Azure was built for a future which is much more distributed computing done in a very different way than the client server area. I think we're just finally getting into the early innings of what is true hybrid computing and it's good to sort of see those in last quarter's results as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. ","Keith Weiss","I want to drill in on Office 365 a little bit, 40% growth in commercial space is a really nice number but even nicer number on the revenue line I think 54% of constant currency growth in Office 365 commercial, that seems to imply you guys are seeing some nice ASP increase as the platform matures. Can you talk to us about where we are in that cycle of moving from a E1 to E3, is the E5 part of the equation yet? Are you guys actually moving there yet?","Amy Hood","When I talk about the premium services mix, in our Office Commercial 365 business being about 60%, that is what's driving whether that's the mix shift to E3 or ultimately to E5 you will continue to see and have headroom in that number but you are right, we are encouraged by the ARPU growth and the value proposition that has customers choosing the premium SKUs and continuing to choose those premium SKUs over time.","I don't really think about there being sort of a cap on that when you think about the mix percentage because part of it is as you know not just adding the first few in notes in E3 is continuing to add E5 and new scenarios over time that will continue to create. So hopefully that's helpful but you are right, it is ARPU driven the performance outside of the 40% growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. ","Heather Bellini","Satya I know that Brent asked you about Azure but I'm just wondering if you could share with us you mentioned that compute usage on Azure I think you said more than doubled or nearly doubled something to that effect. I'm just wondering if you could share with us kind of how you see coming pass [ph] coming along and where do you think we are in getting kind of the easier workloads to the cloud and are you now starting to see the inflection given we did see an inflection in growth on a year-over-year basis this quarter where you are starting to see production significant production workloads that are on premise actually starting to move over as well?","Satya Nadella","We definitely are seeing production workloads that are moving over from on premise, but I think the more interesting thing Heather for us is to see new workloads. When I look at what's happening with say some of the most innovative work we've done around distributed computing which is service fabric and how people are in fact going straight to building out using our past services some of the new HyperScale cloud services using microservices and not only are they doing that but we're also seeing great growth in our serverless infrastructure which is Azure functions.","So I am actually as excited about new cloud growth from new cloud workloads from the same customers so the much interesting thing that I am observing is that it could be the same model customer that was participating with us in the client server area. We are not just building or moving their IT but they are building new digital services for HyperScale and that's what it is probably unique in terms of what is changed year-over-year for us. It's not just the Silicon Valley startups anymore, it is the core enterprise that is also becoming a digital company and we are well positioned to serve them and that's good to see.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Karl Keirstead","Question for Amy. The operating cash flow generation $11.6 billion was extraordinary. I don't think you've had a 50% plus cash flow margin since early 2012. Is this a little bit of an anomaly may be driven by unearned revenues or is something changing in the business model that might change the rate of cash flow generation in coming quarters as well? Thank you.","Amy Hood","It is actually impacted by the same thing that impacted free cash flow this quarter, which is about a $1.3 billion on settled cash settlement impact. So you actually see that revert in Q2, although our free cash flow growth of 8% in the quarter was actually very good, and I do feel good about that, but I want to make sure you don't miss understand the root cause that makes the number a bit of an anomaly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Please proceed.","Mark Moerdler","So want to drill in a little more. The margin for commercial cloud improved 7% which given the size is a large improvement. Can you give us some more details on what exactly is driving that margin improvement. You said it's going to be improving over the year, but how sustainable is that drive to improvement?","Satya Nadella","Let me start market and then Amy you can add to it. Again Mark this goes back to a little bit of understanding I guess how we think about both X as well as OpEx in terms of our cloud. The architectural design we have for example when we do X we are buying the four everything that Microsoft does which is everything from Azure to Office 3652 Dynamics 365 as well as our consumer services like Xbox live. And you see the growth that we talked about across all of this. Then we have a very common platform both for first party workloads as well as our third party business.","And so then as we drive efficiency and our cloud infrastructure, when we for example use to be more out of our network, that's efficiency that we gain across the marginal cost and gross margin that spans everything that we do. Then also what we think about as the mix our goal is not just to sell commodity services, but to actually use commodity services in some cases as a bootstrap for higher level services because of things like data gravity. So there will be differences quarter to quarter. We may impact on board a few customers who first on board a lot of storage at commodity service levels, and then later on start some of the high level services.","So the margin improvement on a lot over a period of time is something that we are absolutely going to see, but from quarter to quarter there will be more volatility, but I would ask our investor base to think more about the architecture as well as the financial outlays of what we're building. We're not just building Azure we're building from 13 Office 365 Dynamics 365 as well as our consumer services withdrawal cloud oriented and it's a combination of that that's driving margin, but Amy I will let you add there.","Amy Hood","But I would say in terms of sustainability are quarter to quarter, Satya is right. There is going to be very ability the variability is really two things. One is the case of the mix shift to Azure as it grows at the pace we're seeing it does impact quarter to quarter. The overall commercial cloud revenue mix, but I would also say the directionality of the Azure gross margin for example which recent significantly improved we expect to continue. Certainly over the course of this year as we have discussed. So I think the directionality of sustainability is correct and I think the variability can certainly occur from any of the reasons Satya talked about.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.","Walter Pritchard","I think Amy am wondering on the segment operating margins guided those per se, but you have sort of flat performance in operating income in an declines in IC with growth in do you expect to see as you get towards the end of the year that the enterprise cloud segments move positive and MPC is not as much of a driver how should we think about the evolution of the product contributions of the over the year?","Amy Hood","Sure. I am actually going to cover in commercial segments as one because really when you think about the commercial cloud, it's really about capturing the opportunity of selling more complete solutions which include dynamics and office plus some components of Azure which is I think really the trend you'll see us talk about from here on out. So what I would say is, he will continue to see us focus on gross margin improvement and we talked about that.","You also continue to see us invest where we see massive market addressable expansion with sales capacity as well. So I think we have pivoted dollars to invest in that opportunity. He will continue to see us do that. But we also expect revenue growth in gross margin growth to come out of that investment. So I do believe that's a continued pace you will see us on, and we feel good about the ROI of the investments we have made especially in those commercial segments.","In MPC, I generally expect he will continue to see improvement through the year just based on the mix of products that we will have over the course of the year, that's not new. Use all the same mechanism last year through the year. As we pivot from our phone business to some of our higher margin product. And so, I suspect you will see a similar pattern on a similar desire by Satya to continue to invest toward growth especially on the commercial side.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Mark Murphy ","So Amy, you are reporting an impressive buildup of the long term deferred revenue itself 162% year-over-year. At the same time, some of your partners feel that you are gradually doing away with a three year that have existed for so long at that you are replacing them with the vehicle which is a little more flexible in terms of length of contract in there could be some shorter lengths. Could you help us in terms of how to think through the long term deferred revenue buildup as you do start to mix over to the MPSA?","Amy Hood","Let me break report that long term earned balance a bit. I do really focused and I think it's important if you're trying to understand the buildup of our commercial business to focus only on the unearned commercial balance. Our overall long term under imbalance has been impacted by the Windows 10 deferral over the past.","And so it can make a bit of a distraction towards seen the underlying trends. That being said, our commercial under balance is seeing good growth I'm proud of our performance this quarter. Both sequentially and year-over-year.","If you think about any change we're making or not, in our partner agreements our customer agreements. We still do generally rely the vast majority on three year agreements so whether or not the term were to change, given how we recognize revenue, I will you know if it's going to be material and I do not expect the change are talking about to be material in any way on the commercial unearned balance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.","Raimo Lenschow","Quick question more on an industry theme for Satya. We obviously saw a very interesting answer from AWS and [indiscernible] which kind of seems to suggest a hybrid cloud is the way forward [indiscernible] has to react. Can you talk a little bit about your customer feedback around the hybrid cloud offering from you and how your customer is thinking about that working with you together? Thank you.","Satya Nadella","I spoke to this a little earlier because from day one we have this vision of how we want to build for the future distributed computing would include our hyper scale cloud service which is Azure an impact Azure is built on Hyper-V and we always said that we were going to build our server as the edge of our hyper scale cloud and so that's what Windows Server 2016 represents, that\u2019s what SQL Server 2016 represents and so we have this unique capabilities like be able to stretch even a single table in a database in SQL 2016 all the way to the cloud for having infinite table capacity and then having your apps and queries work.","How we're doing containers for example in Windows Server 2016 we have great container support as well as support for things like our service fabric so that people can have absolute application portability and in fact people can even [indiscernible] applications.","We have many customers who tier their storage and compute across a hybrid backplane. So this is an architectural design point that we have built from the ground up from day one and it's good to see people validating it now and elsewhere and we will take that as a validation of something that we thought of a long time ago.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Please proceed. ","Unidentified Analyst","Can you just compare and contrast AWS versus Azure versus AWS for me standpoint of the technology footprint that you are offering both these companies? And Amy if you could just comment on the margin structure of your business trip of the business relative to AWS and if you have time talk about the Windows 10 cycle. Why hasn't got to be the best Windows 10 cycle for the enterprise compared to the previous cycle thank you so much.","Satya Nadella","I would say I talked about sort of the reasons the three big reasons why customers choose our cloud in our cloud infrastructure in particular. One, it is about the hybrid design point that is at the core of how we are billed, both Azure as well as our servers. It is because of the higher level services that we have. It is also because of the design point we have around not just Azure but as well as Dynamics 365 and Office 365 and the extensibility of our cloud services across all three of them, and that's really the fundamental reasons why customers choose us. The other thing I will mention is, we have more of a commitment I would say which is been there from a long time to build out a global footprint with more regions and anyone.","We are more certifications than anyone in terms of adhering to both regulated industry as well as digital sovereignty. We've done many things we're the only cloud provider for example that operates in China. We operate in Germany under German law.","And that matters to multinational companies but also are trying to operate across many geographies and jurisdictions. So those are our core attributes that are driving our growth and will continue to stay focused on them.","Amy Hood","In terms of the gross margin question, I feel very good talk about this quarter about our improvement year-over-year and remain confident that we are heading in the right direction and so, I think when you think about that plus the rest of our offerings, I think we're pretty confident.","I will take the opportunity and asked about Windows 10 in the enterprise market that we are encouraged by the pace of deployment, the number of proof of concepts, and actually some of the stability we've seen in the commercial PC market in terms of starting to see some so I think overall I think we will continue to watch, but our security and management value prop I think really is paying off.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. ","Ross MacMillan","Satya, I actually had a question for you on SQL server as you think about the port to Linux, what if you can provide an update on two things, one, it's just the timing of when we should see that in market and then two, are there other things you need to do to meet that requirement across the landscape.","So for example, you have to think about supporting Java runtimes inside of SQL server moving a little bit away from the traditional that development of armed.","Just curious as to how your Dick about getting your arms around a wider set of use cases on alternative operating systems. Thanks.","Satya Nadella","Overall, we are very, very excited about what we are seeing with SQL on Linux because the entire idea was to be able to have a full conversation around the data as stated with customers. And to now be able to talk about the full SQL estate one of the other conversations that we are having is not just about SQL but our analytics and advanced analytics with where we've done some very, very compelling work again across Linux and Windows and then of course the cloud.","So it's really the combination of SQL advanced analytics and the cloud with things like Azure datalink that are really the choices customers are trying to make as they think about their digital capability and the next generation of services and policy storage and processing capability they need.","Now, in terms of having support for these different runtimes, you're absolutely right, that's the reason why for example on Azure itself Java is first class. We have Linux is first class. We have real openness to all of the frameworks that you can call out to, and that something that we stay very attuned to come out which is we are not trying to fight some old battles.","This is all about being able to serve customers on their needs today and that's what is leading and driving a lot of our choices as well as how we think about our market opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen. Please proceed.","Gregg Moskowitz","Satya your make a much bigger bet on AI and rightfully so and you highlighted some very interesting use cases having said that, Microsoft has worked on AI project for quite some time. So can you help us understand what degree of positive change you think will come from the combined group 8 you have recently formed including when you think material AI benefits will become truly ingrained in the customer's workflows and then secondly how should we think about the incremental investment in AI going forward?","Satya Nadella","Overall, I am thrilled about both the AI group that we have formed, the AI research and the heritage we have with them even this week I think we publicly are talking about setting the state-of-the-art when it comes to something like speech recognition and something that we did even with image net an image recognition and object.","So these are capabilities that are not easy to build if you don't have a real commitment to research and then the ability to take that research and then ultimately turn into products.","So the way to measure from the investment side is to see AI when it is infused into everything we do. Take Hololens, the ability of Hololens to be able to see the world, reconstructed and in that world to be able to superimpose holograms, that is AI applied AI that is working today.","When you have Skype translate when two people are talking two different languages and are able to automatically translate without between languages, it's using a deep neural net pens bring together speech synthesis, speech recognition and machine translation with Skype data, that is fairly magical.","When you seeing capable of running flow to create intelligence, that is what we are using impact from our speech and vision work. That is AI as applied today. So I am not waiting for some future date to see ROI from AI, we're very much going forward even the office tools example I used. They're all using AI today.","The PowerPoint designer if you want the most practical use of it, even identify great PowerPoint slides now because of AI. And so, that's how I measure progress.","We are committed to long-term research, but we're also very focused on having the long term research translated into everyday use products, and that's what you will see from us going forward.","Operator","Our last question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed. ","Brad Reback","Amy quick question with the recent release of WinServer 16, is there any reason to think that we shouldn't see some uptick in the transactional business, especially with easing comps in the next couple of quarters? Thanks.","Amy Hood","With our annuity mix as high as it is, it can impact at a couple points either way, but I don't think about that as really immaterial impact. You should think about in the next couple of quarters. And our focus will always be making sure we have a clear roadmap for customers to make long-term commitments through annuity and so we are really trying to get away from some of that launch impact that you may normally expect to see.","Chris Suh","So that wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months at various investor conferences. For those unable to attend in person these event will be webcast and you can follow our comments at Microsoft investor relations website.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Today I'll share the results of the third quarter and discuss what's ahead.","I'm proud of the progress this quarter. We delivered $23.6 billion in revenue, up 7% in constant currency. Across all industries, organizations are looking to digitally transform with the state-of-the-art cloud services, AI, and new natural user interface technology. Increasingly, these organizations are turning to Microsoft as a partner they can trust for the innovation and building their own digital capability.","Now let's look at the progress we made this quarter by segment, starting with Productivity and Business Processes. We crossed a major milestone with more than 100 million monthly active users of Office 365 Commercial. Office 365 Commercial seats grew 35% year over year, and revenue is up 45% in constant currency. Across industries, customers recognize Office 365 is the productivity platform of choice, companies like H&R Block, Johnson & Johnson, and Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG, LVMH, as all chose Office 365.","And we continue to innovate and add new value. This quarter we made Microsoft Teams broadly available to Office 365 customers in 181 markets. Our new chat-based workspace is already empowering a new way to work for more than 50,000 customers, including Accenture, J. Walter Thompson, J.B. Hunt, and Expedia. Teams also creates a new platform opportunity for developers to reach 100 million Office 365 users with rich extensibility for bots, apps, and services.","Additionally, we are expanding the relevance of Office 365 to new segments. Retail, hospitality and manufacturing companies have a huge need to empower their front-line employees. Our expanded offering for this segment includes Microsoft StaffHub, Teams, OneDrive, Skype for Business, and more to give these critical employees a robust collaboration toolkit to maximize their impact.","Now let me talk about the second part of our ambition in this segment, reinventing Business Process. Accelerating our growth with LinkedIn by driving value for members and customers remains our top priority. This quarter we redesigned the LinkedIn desktop to create a more seamless intuitive experience across devices. We continue to invest in the LinkedIn Feed, bringing curated news and views to help members stay informed on what's most important to them. Our innovation across both the desktop and mobile is driving strong engagement momentum, with sessions up more than 20% again this quarter.","LinkedIn marked an important milestone this week, exceeding 500 million members, and our jobs platform hit new record levels with more than 10 million jobs posted. This strong momentum with jobs and engagement is continuing to fuel the growth across talent, marketing, sales, and learning solutions.","We took significant steps this week to redefine social selling with deeper integration of Sales Navigator with Dynamics 365, enabling sales professionals to dramatically increase their effectiveness by drawing on the relationships in their personal networks. Customers like Visa are choosing Dynamics 365 because of our deep integration across Office 365 and now Sales Navigator. I'm excited to put the Microsoft enterprise sales force and partner ecosystem behind this new opportunity.","Dynamics 365 solves a critical challenge for businesses, helping them break free of monolithic siloed suites of applications to unlock insights across the entire organization. You see this in our new Dynamics 365 talent applications, which combines HR business processes with LinkedIn Recruiter to help companies manage the employee lifecycle from recruiting to retention. Our innovation in Dynamics is driving strong revenue growth, with Dynamics 365 up 82% in constant currency this quarter.","Now let's talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Our Commercial Cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $15.2 billion. Customers are increasingly choosing the Microsoft Cloud. They value our differentiated approach as the most trusted global hyperscale cloud with hybrid support and higher-level services to help drive their digital transformation. Moreover, they appreciate the agility, operational consistency, and security across the entire digital estate, spanning enterprise mobility, Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure.","Take Maersk, the largest transport and logistics firm in the world with operations in 130 countries and a fleet of over 1,000 vessels. Maersk began their journey to the Microsoft Cloud with Office 365, Enterprise Mobility and Security in Windows 10. They chose Dynamics 365 for operations to streamline container production and maintenance. Now Maersk is using Azure to digitally transform its supply chain management and global trade. The intelligent services in Azure deliver up-to-the-minute insights on carrier performance and equipment usage with real-time data visualization and advanced analytics, enabling them to trim costs and create new revenue streams. For a company that ships 17 million containers annually, the ability to react quickly can mean the difference of tens of millions of dollars to the bottom line. This is a great example of our three clouds coming together to enable deep digital transformation.","Across industries, customers are choosing Azure. UBS announced they're using Azure for risk management, and GEICO chose Azure for hybrid capabilities. Publicis Groupe announced that they will use Azure and Cortana Intelligence Suite to deliver AI-powered marketing solutions at scale. Flipkart, India's this leading online marketplace, chose Azure as the platform to enable their rapid growth.","We continue to rapidly innovate and add new capability to drive further customer value. Microsoft IoT Central is the first SaaS offering that provides the end-to-end solution for organizations of all sizes to manage their entire IoT ecosystem across devices, cloud, analytics, networks, and software. This week at Hannover Messe, the world's largest industrial trade show, manufacturers showcased how they're using our solutions to transform all aspects of manufacturing, from water management to food and beverage packaging, to improving safety on the factory floor. When it comes to AI, this quarter we made our cognitive services for face recognition and computer vision broadly available to enable any developer to become an AI developer.","We're excited about how Azure Stack and SQL Server are helping define the edge computing paradigm. Azure Stack will enable customers to extend Azure capability to their private data center in a truly consistent hybrid computing environment. SQL Server 2017, coming this fall, is the first database with cloud tiering and artificial intelligence built in. It runs on Windows and Linux, supports docker container deployment and popular programming languages such as R and Python for machine learning and data science. We will share more about all these advances and more at our upcoming Build Developer Conference.","Now I'll turn to our progress in More Personal Computing. Almost two years ago we introduced a new approach with Windows 10, transforming the way customers experience Windows on all their devices. Now customers are always up to date running the most secure Windows ever. This quarter, the Windows business grew 5% in constant currency, and we delivered the next phase of innovation with the Creators Update.","Creators Update is about inspiring the creator in us all. We create technology so that others can create their own content and technology. We want to empower people to paint in 3D or paint with numbers in Excel. We empower people to create in Word or in Minecraft. These new forms of creation and expression are shaping Windows for the next generation.","Gaming is a key scenario to expand our opportunity across the PC and console. We are building on our already strong foundation with Xbox One and our Xbox Live community, up 13% to 52 million active users this quarter. With Creators Update, we integrated gameplay broadcasting into Windows 10 PCs as well as Xbox One. We're off to a very strong start with both streamers and viewers. In fact, the majority of the streaming in this industry today is on the PC and console, and we are uniquely positioned to provide the best, most complete gaming experience, from hardware to software to broadcast services. It's early days and we are excited to pursue this new growing opportunity. This quarter, we also revealed more about our forthcoming Project Scorpio, which will be the most powerful console ever and will enable true 4K gaming in the living room.","Our commercial customers continue to adopt Windows 10 as the secure trusted platform of choice. Customers like the Department of Education in the United Kingdom, British Telecommunications, the Adventist Health System, one of the largest healthcare providers in the United States, all chose Windows 10.","When I talk to businesses and government leaders, they value security and privacy of their data, the reliability of their systems, and choice and control over how and when they deploy. We remain committed to our core values of trust, transparency, privacy, and security for every customer.","Finally, devices; this quarter our Surface results fell short of expectations, impacted by end of product lifecycle and increased price competition. We continue to innovate and invest in creating new computers and computing experiences. Surface Pro, Book, Hub, Studio, HoloLens are all creating new markets for the Windows ecosystem and pushing differentiation with new natural user-interface capabilities, ink, vision, voice, touch, and mixed reality.","In the context of mixed reality, we just passed the one-year anniversary of Microsoft HoloLens. We now have more than 150 exclusive HoloLens apps in the store. Moreover, many of our commercial customers are using HoloLens to drive digital transformation and seeing real impact. HoloLens-based innovation was featured front and center at NRF, HIMSS, and most recently this week at Hannover.","Digital transformation across these industries is being shaped by new technologies, from IoT to mixed reality to AI and the cloud. thyssenkrupp Elevator is using HoloLens and Azure to digitize their entire sales and order process, shortening delivery times by four times, and they chose Dynamics 365 to enable transformation in their Steel division. Leading global medical technology company Stryker chose Office 365 to empower employees and is using HoloLens to improve operating room designs for surgeons, staff, and ultimately the patients. All this creates a strong foundation for the broader opportunity ahead with digital transformation.","I'm proud of the progress this quarter. I'm enthusiastic about what's to come. In the coming weeks, we will share more about how Microsoft is innovating uniquely to empower every customer, from students and teachers to business professionals to developers.","Now, let me hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining for your questions.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone.","Our third quarter revenue was $23.6 billion, up 6% and 7% in constant currency; gross margin grew 7% and 9% in constant currency; operating income grew 2% or 5% in constant currency; and earnings per share was $0.73, an increase of 16% and 19% in constant currency.","This was the first full quarter of company results of LinkedIn, which had a significant impact on revenue, gross margin, and operating income. At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 4 points of revenue and gross margin growth and 6 points of drag on operating income growth, which includes $371 million from amortization of acquired intangibles.","From a geographic perspective, our results were mostly in line with macroeconomic trends. Our performance in Japan was better than expected, driven by increased public sector spending and improved market conditions.","Our commercial annuity mix was 88%, even with another quarter of higher than expected transactional revenue results. Commercial bookings increased 12% or 11% in constant currency. Commercial unearned revenue followed historical seasonal trends, coming in at $20.4 billion and growing 9% and 10% in constant currency. And our contracted-not-billed balance increased to more than $27.5 billion.","Another strong quarter of cloud services performance drove our commercial cloud revenue run rate over $15.2 billion, growing 52%. Our commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased to 51%, up 6 points from last year, with improvement across Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics. And gross margin dollars grew 74%, keeping us on pace for material gross margin percentage and dollar improvement this fiscal year. As a reminder, our commercial cloud includes Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and other cloud properties, but does not include LinkedIn.","Our company gross margin was 66%, better than anticipated and up 1 point, as the sales mix of higher-margin product and services coupled with commercial cloud margin improvement more than offset the impact of $218 million of LinkedIn amortization.","Now to FX. This quarter, the U.S. dollar was weaker than expected. As such, we had 1 point less FX impact across our individual reporting segments, even though overall company impact was still approximately 1 point as guided. FX impacted the Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments by 1 point and had minimal impact in More Personal Computing.","Total operating expenses grew 12%, with LinkedIn contributing 13 points of growth, including $153 million of amortization of acquired intangibles expense.","Now, let's move to the segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes segment grew 22% and 23% in constant currency to $8 billion, with LinkedIn contributing 15 points of growth. Office commercial revenue increased 7% and 8% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 45%, driven by installed base growth across all workloads and continued ARPU expansion. Our transactional results came in higher than expected, mostly from performance in large markets like Japan and Western Europe.","Office consumer revenue increased 15% and 14% in constant currency, primarily from recurring subscription revenue as well as growth in our subscriber base.","Our Dynamics business grew 10% and 11% in constant currency, with Dynamics 365 customer momentum contributing to double-digit billings growth.","LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was $975 million.","Segment gross margin dollars grew 15% and 17% in constant currency, with 11 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $218 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Gross margin percentage declined due to a higher mix of cloud revenue and the impact of LinkedIn-related amortization.","Operating expenses increased 44% and 45% in constant currency, with 43 points from LinkedIn, including $153 million of amortization expense. Operating income declined 7% and 4% in constant currency, with 13 points of impact from LinkedIn.","The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered approximately $6.8 billion in revenue, growing 11% and 12% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 15%, up 16% in constant currency, demonstrating durable double-digit growth. Azure revenue increased 93%, up 94% in constant currency, and annuity revenue again grew double digits. Azure premium revenue grew triple digits for the 11th consecutive quarter, with more than 80% of Azure customers using our premium services.","Our Windows Server and SQL Server transactional business continued to perform well; with better than expected results mainly from Japan and continuing post-launch demand. As expected, Enterprise Services revenue declined 1% and was flat in constant currency due to a lower volume of Windows Server 2003 custom support agreements.","Segment gross margin dollars grew 6% and 7% in constant currency, and segment gross margin percentage declined due to an increasing cloud revenue mix and lower Enterprise Services margins, partially offset by material improvement in Azure margins. We grew operating expenses by 11%, with ongoing investment in sales capacity, cloud engineering, and developer engagement. Operating income was flat and up 3% in constant currency.","Now to More Personal Computing, revenue was $8.8 billion, declining 7%, as Phone and Surface results offset healthy growth in Windows, search, and gaming. Our OEM business grew 5% this quarter. OEM Pro revenue grew 10%, ahead of the commercial PC market, mainly due to a higher mix of premium SKUs. Additionally, the commercial PC market was slightly below our expectations, negatively impacted by channel production timing changes and upcoming Windows SKU pricing changes. Commercial end customer demand signals remain consistent and positive.","OEM non-Pro revenue declined 1%, ahead of the consumer PC market, with continued positive impact from the Windows Premium device category. Overall, inventory levels remain in the normal range.","Windows Commercial products and services grew 6%, with healthy enterprise demand as customers continued to deploy Windows 10 for its advanced security and management capabilities. Patent licensing declined this quarter, primarily from lower revenue per unit. Search revenue ex-TAC grew 8% and 9% in constant currency, driven by higher revenue per search and search volume.","Devices revenue declined 51%. We had no material Phone revenue this quarter. Our Surface business declined 26% and 25% in constant currency, as heightened price competition and product end-of-lifecycle dynamics resulted in lower than expected Surface Pro unit volumes.","Our gaming business grew 4% and 6% in constant currency, as Xbox Live revenue growth offset declines in hardware. Xbox Live monthly active users grew 13% across Xbox One, Windows 10, and mobile platforms, which contributed to software and services revenue growth of 7% and 8% in constant currency.","Segment gross margin dollars were flat, up 2% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased with the sales shift to higher-margin products and services. Operating expenses declined 11% and 10% in constant currency from lower Phone expense and Surface launch-related marketing spend in the prior year. Operating income grew 20% in 23% in constant currency.","Now back to overall company results, we invested approximately $2.1 billion in capital expenditures, including capital leases, less than we expected, as a portion of the expense will move into Q4. Other income and expense was $322 million, greater than originally planned, as we saw more opportunities in the equity market to realize gains during the quarter.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 23%.","We returned $4.6 billion to shareholders, continuing our balanced approach to capital allocation through share repurchase and dividends. After a period of accelerated buyback, we've resumed a buyback pace consistent with our historical trends.","Now let's turn to the outlook, first FX. Given current rates, we now expect less FX headwinds in our fourth quarter. We expect about 1 point of negative impact on total revenue. Within the segments, we anticipate about 2 points of negative impact in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing.","Second, our commercial business, the fourth quarter is an important one for our commercial business, and we expect continued annuity growth and healthy renewals as customers adopt and use our growing portfolio of Commercial Cloud services. We expect unearned revenue between $26.8 billion and $27 billion, in line with historical seasonality.","Additionally, we have a large expiry base in the fourth quarter, and our sales execution on renewals and upsell opportunities, while contemplated in our unearned revenue guidance, should also show up in a larger contracted-not-billed balance and commercial bookings growth.","Third, capital expenditure, we expect CapEx to grow sequentially and year over year. Quarterly spend variability will continue, and we remain on track for our full-year capital expenditure year-over-year growth curve to slow.","Let's move to the individual segments. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $8.2 billion to $8.4 billion, driven by the ongoing annuity shift to cloud and Commercial Office 365. In Office consumer, we expect growth rates to moderate from prior quarters, which were impacted by prior-year comparables. We expect consistent growth from Dynamics and approximately $1.05 billion of revenue from LinkedIn, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting. Similar to Q3, we anticipate that LinkedIn, excluding amortization, will have minimal impact on segment operating income, and we continue to expect it to be minimally dilutive to non-GAAP EPS this fiscal year.","In Intelligent Cloud, we expect $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion in revenue. Performance trends from Q3 should continue into Q4, with annuity strength and double-digit revenue growth across our server products and cloud services. Enterprise Services should decline with lower volumes of Windows Server 2003 custom support agreements.","In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.7 billion. In our OEM business, we anticipate that revenue growth will be more aligned with the overall PC market. OEM Pro growth will continue to be driven by Windows 10 Enterprise momentum and aligned to a commercial PC market that should return to typical seasonality. Our non-Pro revenue is expected to be above the consumer PC market, with continued benefit from a strong mix of premium devices.","In search, we expect Bing's revenue growth ex-TAC to be similar to Q3.","In gaming, we expect to see continued healthy user engagement on our Xbox platform, and we look forward to E3 in June, where we will share more on Project Scorpio and new titles for next fiscal year.","And in devices, we expect revenue to decline with negligible revenue from Phone. With Surface, we expect a more moderate rate of decline given the prior-year comparable and current market dynamics. We expect COGS of $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion. This includes approximately $420 million of LinkedIn COGS, of which $220 million is related to amortization. We expect operating expenses of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, with roughly $1 billion from LinkedIn, of which $150 million is related to amortization.","We now expect full-year operating expenses between $32.9 billion and $33 billion, with approximately $2.3 billion from LinkedIn. That includes about $360 million of amortization expense.","Other income and expense should be about $150 million. And for tax, we expect the full fiscal year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 21% plus or minus 1 point.","Finally, we encourage you to watch a few upcoming events, our Education event on May 2, our Dynamics 365 event on May 3, and the upcoming keynote from Bill to learn more about our ambitious plans leading into FY 2018. We will also host our financial analyst briefing on May 10. The webcast will be available our Investor Relations website.","Chris, let's move to Q&A.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to the Q&A portion of today's call. Operator, can you please repeat the instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent, thank you very much for taking the question and a very nice quarter. I wanted to dig into Azure a little bit. You gave us some really interesting statistics about gross margins going up, premium mix going up. One of the concerns I hear a lot from investors is what happens when we get these price cuts that go back and forth between you guys and AWS? It doesn't seem like the price cuts this quarter really affected you guys. So I was hoping you could shed some light on how \u2013 to what degree do those price cuts actually affect you.","And then on the flip side, where does all that growth come from? Where do you get that tripling of premium growth from what kind of workflows are coming on board to actually drive the underlying growth in that business?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Sure, thanks for the question, Keith. Let me start and then, Amy, if you want, you can add. Again, Keith, when we look at either the capital expense or the technical architecture, and the general approach we take is about all of our cloud. When you look at what we're trying to get done between Azure, we don't really see these themes across Azure or 365, Dynamics 365, and also the things that we're doing with Xbox Live, for example, all billed as one cloud infrastructure and a set of rich services in the cloud.","So for example, some of the cognitive capabilities that are there in Azure first come because of our first-party AI investments, whether it's been speech or vision or anything else. Even the infrastructure that is there in Azure came out of some of our first-party investments in Office 365 or again Bing in other areas. So we have an approach which takes all of our cloud pieces together.","And that same thing is reflected even in the customer journeys. I think the Maersk example I walked you through is probably a good one, where it may start with some commodity workload on Azure or it may start with Office 365, but then it will end up with HoloLens and someone using Dynamics 365 for increased automation. In the case of Maersk, they were using field service and operations inside of Dynamics 365.","So to me, those high-level services will over time attach in Azure, but also in Dynamics as well as in Office 365. So to me, that's why Azure is pretty strategic for us, not just for the attachment of high-level services in what is defined as Azure, but the all-up digital transformation opportunity. That's how Amy and I even think about our margin structure. We need to improve in each one of the elements, but all-up we need to improve because we think that increased opportunity is what's unique about our approach.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And I think what you're hearing in that answer from Satya, Keith, is really about whether the premium services exist as you heard at the Azure layer, or whether they show themselves in our Productivity and Business Processes segment.","The fact that you may see competition where there may be less differentiation, the real differentiation is where you've always been able to achieve margin and margin expansion, which is in the completeness of the solution or its delivery, the completeness of the business process change or not. And so I think while I do understand that people will ask a lot about that price competition at the lower level, I think what you're seeing is because we're able to continue to move people up the stack, including all the way up to the business process layer, I think you'll continue to see us be confident in our ability to move and create margin and growth.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Outstanding, thank you very much.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Keith. We'll go to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, thanks. I've got a follow-up, actually, on Azure, maybe to you, Satya, and it's the interplay between the cloud piece Azure and mostly the on-prem piece, what you guys call the server product. Most of your peers obviously, when they're pivoting to the cloud, are seeing weakness on the on-prem side. But what's unique about Microsoft is not only is Azure growth accelerating, but your server product growth at 7% is up meaningfully year over year as well, so we're not seeing that trade-off with Microsoft. I suspect part of the explanation is that a lot of the Azure growth is net new, but I'm just curious. When do you think customers will actually start migrating existing on-prem Microsoft workloads into Azure such that that server product line might start to decelerate? Do you think there's a prospect of that occurring in fiscal 2018? Thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah. The timeframes of these migrations and so on are a lot more complicated than they perhaps appear on the surface. So here's what we think of. For example, right when everyone's talking about the cloud, the most interesting part is the edge of the cloud. Whether it's IoT, whether it's the auto industry, whether it's what's happening in retail, essentially compute is going where the data gets generated, and increasingly data is getting generated at the volumes in which it's drawing compute to it, which is the edge.","So if you look even at our announcements over this quarter, a lot of what we have done with IoT is create an IoT edge. Of course, we have an amazing cloud with the SaaS services for IoT, but the edge compute, the ability to run a neural network at the edge, do inferences at the edge is exciting. Azure Stack is going to completely change what hybrid is and the expectations customers have with hybrid. I mean, GEICO example is a good one.","What's happening with SQL Server, SQL Server is no longer just about a database that's on-premise. It's a database that's on-premise that can be tiered with the cloud. A single table can be extended to the cloud. The queries will work across both the tiering. And so to me, the innovative work we're doing is what I would characterize as the future of true distributed computing, which is it will remain distributed. And that's what we are building towards. We'll talk a lot more and build on that about that architecture and what we're seeing with customers.","Then given that what you are saying is true, which is there will be some which will be lift and shift of workloads, but then there is lift, shift, and modernizing of workloads. And in that modernizing phase, it's not just being modernized to live only in what is called a cloud, but it will also be modernized to live in the edge of the cloud. And so that's the transformation at play. That's a multiyear and a generational transformation. Quarter to quarter, there will be all kinds of volatility. But what is clear to me and clear to Microsoft's engineers is that we have a very clear world view of what is it that we want to get done, and we stay focused on it.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And I think, Karl, to your question about how that shows up, it's why you hear us focus more on the all-up KPI between Azure and this transactional or on-premise number, because the line between them, both strategically and literally, is more important to be blurred and going in that direction. And so this quarter, you saw a little bit healthier than we had thought, I pointed out. It tends to be \u2013 in this instance, Japan was a little better. It can be product-launch related. It can be macro-impacted. But whether or not you see that in transactional, the Uber trend of being able to see it through the all-up KPI, the dynamic Satya has talked about, you're going to hear us talk more and more about, whether it's a quote-unquote, on-prem server launch or an Azure feature, about the integration of the two.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect, thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Karl. We'll go to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you. Again, I had a follow-up on Azure as well. I was just wondering, Satya, if you could share with us \u2013 and I know I've asked this in the past \u2013 but just any qualitative commentary you could give us about PaaS adoption. And I'm also wondering in particular, given the high percentage of workloads on Azure running Linux, what type of services are you typically seeing run on top of the OS? And how do you see your monetization of those workloads playing out over time?","And then, Amy, just the follow-up for you would just be \u2013 and I apologize, we had another earnings call tonight, so I might have missed it \u2013 but you usually give a comment about out-year OpEx on the call, and I was just wondering if you had any high-level thoughts there. Sorry, thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Sure, Heather, thanks for the question. Overall qualitatively, in terms of PaaS adoption of Azure, a lot of it comes with what's happening, for example, in the services we talk about, like IoT. We now have a much higher-level managed service. We even launched a new packaging of it with the IoT Central, which allows developers who are building IoT solutions, instead of assembling it themselves to be able to use this managed service to be that much more agile and productive. So that's usually the way we make the atomic parts available as well as these essentially SaaS services or PaaS services.","Same thing with data, the DocumentDB is a massive thing for us. It's the planet-scale database that supports JSON and much more, and we see that as a core part of the data tier for many, many applications. We even see, obviously, the end-user parts of the infrastructure when it comes to enterprise mobility. So all-up, we have multiple pieces.","The other areas, course, the entire toolchain of what's happening with Visual Studio to continuous integration, to continuous deployment, and that's a place where we have a very, very differentiated solution for developers and developer productivity, which in some sense you can think of as like the Office 365 for developers. But that's all part of Azure. So those are the places where there are PaaS services.","But as I said earlier in response to the question, we also welcome the use of, I'll say, the most atomic building blocks of Azure, whether it just be a Linux container, Azure functions, which is very cost-efficient for developers, because we know that over time, it may be not just PaaS services in Azure, it could be in fact a Dynamics 365 module. The canonical example for me is someone who collects data, does a prediction, ultimately then has to do something about that prediction, which means some automation like field service. So a lot of what is Dynamics field service is actually in our module growth we are seeing because of Azure IoT, and that relationship is not just about Azure PaaS.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And to your specific question, Heather, on FY 2018 and OpEx, I did not because we're going to see each other and have more time on May 10 at the analyst briefing, and that's where I'll take some more time to walk through FY 2018.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Heather. We'll go to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you, excellent, two questions. What were the drivers of the big growth in Dynamics 365? Is this large seasonality specifically in this quarter? Is it a big deal, or should we expect growth in the same vicinity for the near future?","And then as a second question, as discussed in, one of the previous questions about Server & Tools and the healthiness of that growth, I'm trying to understand the drivers. Is this the product refresh cycle? Is it Azure driving customer upgrades? Is it something else? Can you give a bit more color? That would be helpful. I appreciate it.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Sure, Mark, and let me start and then Amy, you can add. On the Dynamics 365, we're at the very, very beginning phase of the transition of Dynamics from primarily being on-premise to now being a very modern modular SaaS service. The Dynamics 365 momentum is picking up. I talked about the revenue growth rate, and that's definitely going to be what's going to be true in the quarters to come and the years to come.","But we do have a huge on-premise base. There is still a need for those on-premise products. That will continue, but our focus is on transitioning to the cloud. And you've seen us do this successfully with Office 365. You've seen us do that with Azure. And now we're ready to do that mainstream across what has been traditionally known as CRM and ERP without in fact us thinking and talking about those suites because we think that is a pretty old concept to have suites like that, which is we have now really made the entire Dynamics 365 much more modular, modern, and much more efficient for customers. So that's what's happening in Dynamics.","Same thing on Azure, which is \u2013 the driver is \u2013 a lot of it is net new. IoT, for example, was not a workload on the old server world, whereas it's one of the big workloads for us. Same thing with AI, not an old workload. So there's new growth in Azure. There is the lift, shift, and modernize motion as well, as well as a new need for the edge of the cloud. So all three of them are in play, while recognizing we had a large business called the Server Licensing business. So we have three new things that we're driving and a lot of large licensing pieces that are just transitioning into these three motions.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And in particular, in this quarter, how to think about I think some of the in-period outperformance versus what we see consistently, in the bucket of consistently, premium workload growth has been consistent for us. The double-digit annuity growth has been consistent for us, and that I think is a driver we continue to look for and be confident in its execution quarter to quarter.","In the more temporal bucket this quarter as well as last you saw a bit of it, some geo help in certain geos that may see and be more transactional in nature. Japan happens to be one of those geos. And then we are still seeing some post-launch impact, specifically on the Windows Server side and selling higher-end SKUs post-launch, which has to do with some of the value inherent. So that's how I break down the drivers, Mark.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Excellent, I appreciate it. Thank you and congrats.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Mark. We'll take the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks, two things, Amy. I think you mentioned in the script that Windows \u2013 there was some Windows volatility around some new SKU pricing. Could you go into some detail there?","And then secondarily \u2013 I know we may get this at Analyst Day, but around ASC 606, I knew you're going to adopt that early, and I think that will change to some degree your annuity revenue. I wondered if you could give us any color, even directionally, on what percentage of that annuity revenue is licensed that after ASC 606 will go up front.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Great. On ASC 606, we will talk about it in detail actually on May 10 in terms of the timing and what you can expect. You will also note in the 10-Q this quarter, we do give a look at the initial impact on an annual basis, using last year as an example.","The biggest difference on an annual basis with the adoption of ASC 606 will really just be the change from Windows OEM. Now what we will talk about in more detail is that the quarter-to-quarter results in any given year will be a little bit more volatile. But over any annual period, the biggest difference will really just be the change in some ways back to how we thought about OEM revenue. So that's what I would think of on ASC 606.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then a question on...","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Windows, I'm sorry. I answered them in the opposite order. And on the Windows pricing, which we talked about, we do and always have worked with Windows SKUs as we release new products and add new value. This quarter, we had a bit of a mix shift to a higher-end SKU. And starting in April, we've introduced other SKUs that have more value in them at lower processing specs. And so what you'll continue to see is that would normalize. Even though we saw some high-end SKUs this quarter do well, I would expect in Q4 to have the normal breadth of those SKUs and revert back to looking much more like the commercial PC market itself.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Walter. We'll go to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.","Brad Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, so two quick questions. First off, Amy, there's been a lot of talk about tax law changes on the corporate side. Would a repatriation holiday impact how you guys allocate capital back to shareholders?","And then just real quickly, on the OpEx side, I know you don't want to get too specific, but over the last few years you've been able to effectively reallocate upwards of $2 billion from the Phone business elsewhere. Is there still a fair amount of ability to reallocate internally? Thanks.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Great, let me take both of those. Let me separate your first question because I think you're really asking two that I probably don't relate as directly, and I should do that for you. We've been a longtime advocate of structural tax reform, and so we'll just wait and see how things play out. And as decisions get made and proposals clarified, we'll share more about what that means for us.","Next, in terms of how we thought about that impacting capital return, as you know, I think we've been and executed a significant capital return program over the past couple years, including accelerating the buyback program that I think I feel very good about at the corporate level in terms of the value it's created. And so I wouldn't say that I view those two things as waiting for one to do the other. We've in fact continued to do what we thought created the most value for shareholders, which is to invest in ourselves, acquire companies that help us expand our TAM and grow, return dividends, as well as repurchase shares. And we've continued to do that this quarter as well. I think you'll continue to see us take a balanced approach, but I don't think of those as being related.","The last question on OpEx, I think over the past couple of years, we've continued to make decisions that said every dollar we spend, are we putting it in the right place for the long term, whether that's reallocating or adding new. And what we expect is to grow new markets and perform really well in them with every dollar that we invest, whether, frankly, Brad, it's in OpEx or in COGS. At this point, both of those are very large buckets of investments, which Satya and I as well as the whole senior leadership team spend the majority of our time picking markets and making sure we execute in them.","So in terms of our ability to continue to do that, of course there are opportunities. We learn, frankly, I think every week where we can do better and where we can continue to invest to accelerate. That being said, I don't view any OpEx number as a constraint. More I view, is the return healthy? Is it growing the top line? Are we executing well on it? And if we are, it will make sense to spend more and if we aren't, it won't. And so I tend to take that approach as opposed to solving for any one number.","Brad Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thanks very much.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Brad. We'll take the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Amy, I want to follow up on your last point around investment and return on it. Around this time last year, you guys started spending a lot more or investing a lot more in OpEx on the Intelligent Cloud side in particular. This quarter, you saw Intelligent Cloud operating profit on a constant currency basis get back to growth again, which I think shows that those investments indeed made some sense.","Now that you have spent a lot, you've obviously added a lot in sales and marketing resources, R&D resources on that front. Could you just give us I guess qualitatively how you're thinking about that? It seemed like last year, you needed to catch up to a certain degree in terms of go-to-market capabilities. Do you feel better I guess where you are today versus your position, say, a year ago, just in terms of being able to capture the opportunity on the Intelligent Cloud side? Thanks.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","I'll start and then I'll transition to you, Amy. I don't view it that narrowly quarter to quarter or even year to year. These are generational opportunities that what's at play when it comes to the Intelligent Cloud or what's happening in augmented reality. Either one of those things, I think if we started viewing it quarter to quarter or year to year, we'll completely miss the trend. We definitely need to be smart about two things that Amy said before, which is pick markets that are secular growth markets and got big TAM. And most importantly, what's our role in it? Is this something that the world needs Microsoft to be doing, or is it well served by others? That's where we spend most of our cycles in.","The fact that we put some salespeople and then there's increased productivity is something that we obviously celebrate and we track very closely. But the places where we are more likely to go and put our OpEx in the coming quarters, in the coming years are going to be about revenue that's going to show up for multiple years out. And it won't be very transparent to you, and that's how it is. If we had not gotten started on some of the distributed computing infrastructure in a completely different place, we wouldn't have even had Azure. But I completely understand that all of you measure us to what we have done for you lately. And that's a fine way and we'll keep account of it, but that's not how it works.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","I think the important part in what Satya says is the distinction between really engineering investments that take multiple years of investment and world view on a TAM and holding ourselves accountable to sales and marketing investments. And are they earning the right return? Are we doing them in the right way? Are they in the might market? Are we investing in the right types of people, in the right capabilities?","What I look and say that this number shows is that we are doing and it is encouraging that the plan that we put in place, that the sales team has done a really terrific job of executing on. And all that does is build more confidence that both we've picked a good market and we're investing in the right type of people to make sure we land that opportunity at customers. And then the most important thing is that the customers' success is what will breed revenue for the next quarter, the next year. And especially in this market, a generational move here really means, especially for many of the workloads being moved, these pay off every year for the next 10.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Great, thank you, Kirk. We'll go to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, thank you very much. Satya, I'm curious, how is the pace of the conversations around Internet of Things, machine learning, and cognitive services? And also, what are you seeing as the killer app types of use cases that could resonate with customers in terms of the more mainstream applicability?","And also, Amy, just given the strength in commercial bookings and also commercial bookings guidance, macroeconomically do you see any signs of enterprise budgets opening up somewhat or different activity levels, more receptivity to transformative projects? I'm just trying to understand maybe how we can separate out your company-specific momentum against any conceivable incremental macro tailwind.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","That's great, so let me start. The best way to think about how people are using, whether it's Azure or Dynamics 365 or other capabilities we have, is in the context of that digital transformation and the outcome. So when you say killer apps, the killer apps are how are customers able to reimagine how they think about customer engagement, how they think about employee empowerment or the operational efficiency, or how they can change the products and the business models and the products.","And if you look at even the examples I used in this quarterly earnings call, Maersk and what they are trying to do across all of those is pretty transformative. There is machine learning in AI. There is IoT. There is new type of business process automation with operations. All of that is transforming Maersk. What thyssenkrupp has done in their Elevator business and other business units by using anything from HoloLens to a front-line worker to how they're fundamentally moving their business model from essentially the margin on the thing to the margin on the service, which has machine learning and AI built into it. Those are the killer transformation opportunities that we are seeing.","And in fact, it's not about in fact taking any old workload per se, but it's about reimagining what they want to do across these. And in that context, of course, they're lifting and shifting some of the older workloads, but they're modernizing the entire business process flow. And that's what's I think the killer opportunity, not any one technology, but the entire flow.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And I think your question about is it really budgets, I think you used the phrase opening up. What I think is really interesting is, I don't know, I read probably the same CIO surveys you all do. Frankly, the numbers in those in terms of IT spend or intent to spend, they aren't much different than we've seen. For me, what I think is missing in that question is really \u2013 it's not about any one customer saying wait, I'm going to spend 2% more or 3% more. These are companies actually deciding that the change is required, not from an infrastructure perspective, but to change how they're running their business itself.","And so things that used to look more to them like capital expense or COGS or not just an IT budget, this is literally changing every business process they run or changing the services they offer, and thinking about literally driving their revenue differently. And so I don't really associate it probably as much with a quote-unquote, budget that sits in IT very narrowly. This is really about every budget that sits not just in IT, but under every functional leader of a company being spent differently and being spent on our technology.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Mark. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much. Two, I think both for Amy. The first is that now that Azure gross margins have turned positive, would you say it would be reasonable to assume that the Creative Cloud gross margins should continue to increase sequentially going forward, or could other factors still create some volatility quarter to quarter?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Overall, we continue to expect each service is going to get better and better. That happens from two things, premium mix revenue doing well, as well as the efficiencies we expect to get in COGS resulting in gross margin improvement.","Now to your specific question on can you expect it every quarter sequentially, the answer is not really. The mix amongst the services will always result in a pacing change. And so while year over year you may not see as much, but you will see more sequential volatility as, frankly, you've seen over the past six quarters, even when we've seen improvements in each of the underlying and underlying services, which tends to be how I focus on it a bit more.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful, and maybe one other, if I could. Just on CapEx, I know there was a timing delta here between Q3 and Q4, but I just wanted to step back. If you think about your CapEx plans ex-LinkedIn as you came into the year and how you think you'll end up, are you going to be about on plan, or do you think you'll be above or below? Thanks.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks. In general, for the full fiscal year, we'll be right at or a little below where I thought we would have been, and so that's why the full-year perspective that growth will slow is still on track. And for simplicity, I generally would think about all the delta from Q3. I would encourage you just to move it into Q4 as you think about what to expect.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks so much.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Ross. We'll have time for one final question, please.","Operator","Our last question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Awesome, thanks, guys, for sneaking me in. Just a question on Office commercial. You guys reported another strong quarter here, about 8% constant currency growth. And, obviously, you're continuing that acceleration that you've had over the first three quarters of this year. Now, I guess the question to Satya and then Amy. Satya, you still have a positive mix shift going on here because we see the unit count growth, but also the revenue growth, so positive spread there. Maybe help me walk through where you think we are in this life cycle of Office 365 because you obviously have a lot of SKUs.","And then, Amy, in that context, to the last question on gross margins for commercial cloud. Obviously, we've made a lot of headway on Azure. How do think where we are similarly on the life cycle on the gross margin side of Office 365?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah, I can start. I think with Office 365, we are trying to expand the appeal of Office 365 on multiple dimensions. A lot of what we are still seeing in play is the rapid adoption or the increased adoption of Office 365 E3, which is what I think is driving a lot of the growth, the ASP growth. Now we have a good start with what is at the high end of the enterprise value, which is E5, some of the value we have. Whether it's voice or analytics and security, it resonates. And we're learning, we're improving, and we're pushing forward on that front.","At the same time, we're also introducing new SKUs for the front-line worker. This is one of the other first-time trends I'm seeing where CEOs are more interested in productivity of their front-line workers, and so that's another exciting space. It comes at a different ASP point, so it's not exactly the same as E5, but very important for us strategically to be able to increase the appeal of Office 365. We also are working to make Office 365 and seeing good traction in segments like small business.","The other aspect of Office 365 which is important for us is the international element because we really never had very high penetration of our higher-end service SKUs in the international markets. And we finally get to do that with the service offering. So those are all the areas. Where there's significant room left \u2013 and we're not just standing still in terms of adding value for new segments, so those are all in play.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And the way you've seen that, and I'll relate it to margins, is this continued and consistent installed base growth, and even still having the opportunities Satya laid out. And most of the ARPU improvement that we've seen has been, in fact still due to the E3 transition, not due to the E5 transition. So we still feel quite good about the opportunity, especially in some of the customers that have already moved to E3.","And then in terms of gross margin, margin actually here has been steadily improving. We've been in this business a bit longer and it's more mature. I do think here the opportunity is also ARPU-based actually here in terms of continuing to see margin improvement is continuing raise the dollars per user that we realize to continue to see that grow.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Awesome. Thanks, guys.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager, Investor Relations for Microsoft. Thank you, Chris. You may begin.","Chris Suh","Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. On our website, microsoft.com\/investor, we have posted our press release and a slide deck that provides a summary of our results this quarter.","Unless otherwise specified, all growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year. For selected metrics on the call and in other earnings materials, we have also provided growth rates in constant currency. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.","Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnote of our 10-Q and includes research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative but excludes integration and restructuring charges.","We will post the prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available.

You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until April 23, 2016.","During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are pretty predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today\u2019s earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Satya.","Satya Nadella","Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I\u2019ll focus my remarks on our three business areas: Cloud, Windows and Devices. Next week at Build, our developer conference, I\u2019ll share more about our ambitions and how our next-generation platforms will empower every person and organization.","This quarter, we delivered $21.7 billion in revenue, an increase of 6% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. We are seeing the impact of foreign exchange, geopolitical trends in certain geographies and product transitions. We\u2019re taking steps to respond quickly and adjust our plans as needed while we continue to move forward in our transformation.","Overall, I\u2019m pleased with our business performance. More importantly though, it\u2019s clear that we are well on our way to transforming our products and businesses across all of Microsoft. The early signs are evident in how our customers are using our products, which I\u2019ll share throughout my remarks today. Our momentum in the cloud is a highlight. Increasingly, customers are choosing Microsoft cloud services to transform their own businesses, going beyond just moving existing workloads to the cloud. These results showcase our ability to transform and perform simultaneously.","With that in mind, I\u2019ll walk you through the quarter, starting with our Cloud business. At the core of our results this quarter is incredible growth across a growing portfolio of cloud services. Our commercial Cloud business is a source of strength driven by Office 365, Azure and Dynamics CRM. Our commercial cloud annualized run rate now stands at $6.3 billion, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of triple-digit revenue growth.","Office 365 is clearly a key growth driver. Like any cloud service, we track how people are actually using it and we are proud that Office 365 is a vibrant, active service. Right now, there are nearly 50 million Office 365 monthly active users inside businesses. Exchange Online alone sees about 60 billion requests per day from all connected clients, about 70 billion transactions or user actions and there are 830 million meetings a month created in Office. And we\u2019re increasing our Office value proposition for businesses with new mobile device management capabilities built into Office 365 and through our continued commitment to customer data compliance and security.","We released new versions of Office Dells for mobile devices, and earlier this month, we rolled out Skype for Business to the Office 365 customers worldwide. Finally, in anticipation of the release of Windows 10, we have announced a preview of new touch-first Office universal app. Small and medium-sized customers are adopting Office 365 at a continued rapid pace, led by our more than 65,000 Office 365 partners. Thirty telecommunications companies are already offering 365 to small and medium-sized customers, including some of the largest in the world. In Q3, we announced a new partnership with T-Mobile to bring Office 365 to more customers and enhance the partnership with GoDaddy.","At Build next week, I\u2019ll talk to you even more about Office as a platform and how developers can connect into the Office framework to both harness the rich data and have their own application extensions available to ultimately a billion plus Office users. Azure is also seeing impressive usage momentum. Right now, more than five million organizations are represented in Azure Active Directory with more than 425 million identities. Storage is also a strong indicator of consumption, and now, we have 50 trillion objects stored in Azure, a 3x growth year-over-year in storage transactions, more than five trillion in March alone. And Azure websites are growing with nearly half a million sites hosted.","Beyond strong usage of our existing services, we are excited by the customer response to our expanding portfolio of new cloud offerings. In particular, Enterprise Mobility Suite is growing and we now have more than 13,000 enterprise customers using EMS. And as customer adoption and usage in the cloud increases, more developers are choosing Azure for the applications. Nearly three million developers are signed up for Visual Studio online, up 2x year-over-year. To foster developer innovation, we launched Azure App Service this quarter. It offers a powerful set of development tools for creating web and mobile app backends for any platform or device while enabling integration with other applications, including Office 365, Dynamics, Salesforce, Facebook, Twitter, SAP , Oracle, Siebel and many more.","We also delivered new Azure compute instances this quarter with more memory and storage than any other public cloud provider, attracting more mission-critical workloads to the cloud. And we improved our Big Data capabilities with support for the latest version of Hadoop and LINUX in HDInsight and improved disaster recovery with Azure Site Recovery and Backup . We\u2019re seeing significant customer interest and adoption in Azure Machine Learning and Azure Stream Analytics , in particular, for IOT scenarios.","In a world where every company has the opportunity to become a software company, a diverse set of companies like ThyssenKrupp , Toyota, Rockwell , Ford, Fujitsu and Millay are engaging with us in their transformation.","Further, our Dynamics business also has traction in the enterprise. It is now nearly a $2 billion business. Dynamics CRM online enterprise paid seats more than doubled year-over-year, and we more than doubled enterprise seats sold this quarter for ERP. We also announced a wave of innovation in Microsoft Dynamics CRM this quarter with new social, mobile and analytics capabilities for business process transformation, including seamless integration of Dynamics CRM with Office 365.","While our commercial Cloud business is expanding dramatically, we\u2019re also seeing strong growth in our consumer cloud services. Office 365 consumer added an average of one million new customers per month and we now have more than 12 million subscribers, an increase of 35% over the prior quarter. We\u2019re clearly taking Office everywhere. Core to our mobile first strategy is to ensure that our service endpoints are on every mobile device, and to that end, we have seen continued momentum with more than 100 million downloads of Office on iPhones, iPads and Android tablets. And with the release of Outlook on iOS and Android this quarter, updates through our OneDrive application and a preview of the forthcoming Office for Mac, we\u2019re making Office available to even more users on more devices.","Bing achieved a significant milestone this quarter when U.S. search share topped 20% and search advertising revenue grew 21%. Search is key to productivity in work and life and it\u2019s a huge opportunity for Microsoft as we continue to innovate with Bing across our applications and platforms. On top of that, I\u2019m pleased with our renewed partnership with Yahoo! and our combined ability to compete more effectively in the search marketplace. Our investments in innovation and user experience in Xbox Live are paying off. Xbox Live users grew 18% year-over-year, helping drive increased Xbox Live usage growth by 30%.","When I step back and look at Office 365, Bing search and Xbox Live collectively, I see real usage growth and monetization of our consumer services all up.","Now let\u2019s talk about Windows. To start, our Windows revenue from business customers is stabilizing post the XP refresh anniversary, coming back in line to historical levels. We\u2019re also transforming the consumer Windows business to adapt to the changing market dynamics, including lower price point devices. This quarter, while non-Pro revenue declined, activations were up. Importantly, we are now at a place where we can start to see early signs of how usage increases in services like search and gaming can drive new monetization opportunities over the lifetime of a Windows consumer device.","Windows is a tremendous asset for Microsoft, with more than 1.5 billion users. This means every day, hundreds of millions of people are using Windows and Windows applications. In fact, more than 60 million unique apps are used on a monthly basis from PCs running Windows 7 and later. We are focused on making Windows 10 the most loved version of Windows ever. Perhaps most importantly, last quarter, I talked about how Windows 10 will be a service across an array of devices and will usher in a new area era of more personal computing, an era where the mobility of the experience, not the device, is paramount. We look forward to sharing a lot more about Windows 10 at Build next week.","In our device portfolio, service adoption continues across enterprise and consumer customers, with 44% revenue growth year-over-year. And 64% of Surface Pro 3 users use OneNote, nine times that of any other touch laptop. This shows how great hardware innovation influences customer experience and usage. We\u2019re looking forward to Surface 3 availability next month, a device that has received positive reviews for being a superior versatile device at a lower price point.","We continue to demonstrate momentum in the Value Smartphone segment of the phone market, driving 18% growth in Lumia volume this quarter. However, we need to take further action to reduce our costs across devices as we execute on our Windows 10 first-party hardware plans.","I\u2019m excited that next week, I\u2019ll be able to talk much more extensively about our ambitions and the opportunity ahead to two important audiences \u2013 developers at Build and our investor community at the Financial Analyst Briefing in San Francisco.","Before I turn it over to Amy, I want to close by reflecting on Microsoft\u2019s transformation to a company that will thrive and help our customers thrive in a mobile-first, cloud-first world. This is a new world with new growth. It\u2019s a world that requires fundamental transformation in products, business models and delivery models across Microsoft. In 2008, we started our transformation by taking an iconic franchise, Office, to the cloud. We took the next big step towards forwards five years ago when we launched Azure and another step forward with the recent announcement of Windows 10 as a service. Microsoft\u2019s overall transformation isn\u2019t about one-for-one shift. It is about delivering new value to more customers and unlocking new growth opportunities. To do this, we will continue to push forward with big ambitions and persistence while delivering solid performance.","With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Amy to talk about this quarter\u2019s results in greater detail, and I look forward to rejoining you after to answer questions. Thank you.","Amy Hood","Thanks, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our execution in the third quarter. In our Commercial business, we continued to see healthy underlying fundamentals with strong renewals of volume license annuity contracts, a mix shift to cloud offerings and solid bookings. Importantly, you can see the progress we are making in the execution of our cloud strategy as the percentage of our revenue from annuity contracts in our Commercial business continues to rise.","As Satya highlighted, we also saw momentum in strategic businesses we\u2019ve been investing in, such as Bing, Xbox Live and Surface, which have a key role in our plans to further monetize Windows devices. Like most multinational companies, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar has had a significant impact on our reported results. Accordingly, when applicable, I will give growth rates in both GAAP and constant currency to help you better understand the underlying business demand.","Revenue was $21.7 billion, up 6% and 9% in constant currency. Gross margin grew 1% and 4% in constant currency. We improved gross margin percentage year-over-year in each of our segments again this quarter, reflecting our ongoing focus on operational excellence. Operating income declined 5%. Adjusting for both integration and restructuring expense of $190 million, as well as the negative $87 million impact from FX, operating income declined 1%. Earnings per share was $0.61, which includes a $0.02 negative impact from FX and $0.01 of integration and restructuring expense.","As a reminder, FX movements first impact our bookings growth and unearned revenue on the balance sheet. Each quarter, our contracted not-billed balance is adjusted to reflect current FX rates. When FX rates move rapidly, as they have in the last six months, bookings growth can be significantly impacted. This was the case again this quarter as bookings grew 2%. However, when measured on a constant currency basis, bookings grew 9%. Unearned revenue was up 4% year-over-year to $20.2 billion and 7% in constant currency. Total unearned revenue was slightly below expectations, driven primarily by a stronger-than-expected mix of sales that are recognized in the current period.","From a geographic perspective the U.S. outperformed our expectations. This relative strength in the U.S. resulted in roughly one point less of constant currency impact than we expected in our Commercial business. China, Russia and Japan were generally in line with our expectations.","I want to touch briefly on what we were seeing in Japan, given it\u2019s our second-largest market from a revenue perspective. Revenue was down $550 million, which is nearly four points of growth for the whole company. With high Office attach to PCs, revenue is particularly sensitive to the underlying PC market dynamics. Q3 was the toughest comparable due to both XP end of support and the VAT increase which went into effect last April 1. The impact is most evident in our DMC and Commercial Licensing segments. The macroeconomic climate remains challenging as well in Japan and we don\u2019t expect this to change in the short term.","With that backdrop I will now moved to a detailed discussion of our results, starting with Windows. Q3 last year was the peak of the XP refresh cycle, evidenced by Windows Pro revenue growth of 19%. This growth significantly outpaced the underlying PC market driven by higher attach of Pro, particularly with large enterprise customers in developed markets. This quarter Pro revenue declined by 19% and is essentially flat to our Q3 FY 2013 levels as both business PCs and Pro mix in that segment returned to pre-XP refresh levels.","For Windows non-Pro as we talked about last quarter, inventory in the channel was higher than normal. This quarter activations grew and we exited Q3 with channel inventories at more normal levels. This channel inventory reduction was the main driver of our Windows non-Pro revenue decline. We continued to see a mix shift opening price point PCs which impacted license mix and aggregate ASP. However, it was significantly less than the impact in Q2 when holiday sales favored lower price point PCs.","Office consumer revenue and D&C licensing was down 41% this quarter due primarily to the shift of purchasing toward Office 365 Consumer where we now have 12.4 million subscribers. This transition to Office 365 accounted for 27 points of that decline and the impact of Japan\u2019s PC market the remaining 14 points. Excluding Japan, we grew our combined consumer Office licenses by 10%.","Revenue in our Devices and Consumer Other segment grew 25% and 28% in constant currency, exceeding our expectations. Many of our growth efforts are represented in this segment and we made terrific progress this quarter across Office 365, Bing and Xbox Live transactions. Gross margin expanded again, benefiting from the increased scale in our services. Inclusive of the estimated impact of the Yahoo! agreement reached last week, we remain confident in our goal of Bing profitability in FY 2016.","Moving to hardware, revenue from Xbox consoles declined largely due to a mix shift of Xbox One consoles to lower ASP SKUs, as well as the impact of launch supply from a year ago. With Surface we saw 53% constant currency revenue growth driven by strong retail sales and attach of accessories. On phones we sold 8.6 million Lumia devices and have gained share in key markets such as the U.K. and Germany over the course of the year. Gross margin declined sequentially, driven by lower Q3 revenue and approximately $60 million of negative impact from foreign currency relative to Q2 FX rates.","We\u2019ve made significant progress in reducing the operating expense base in the Phone business, moving from an annualized rate of $4.5 billion at acquisition to a run rate under $2.5 billion. That said, the changing mix of our portfolio to the value segment and the significant negative headwind from FX will impact our ability to reach operational breakeven in FY 2016. In response we have in Q3 and will continue in Q4 to aggressively focus on our operating cost base by pursuing efficiencies in both COGS and operating expenses. We will focus those efforts across our entire first party device portfolio, even while we expand into new form factors such as Whole Lens and Surface hub.","Now moving to our commercial results, where revenue grew 5% or 7% in constant currency. Commercial bookings declined 1% on a reported basis but grew 10% in constant currency. The underlying health of the business remains very strong despite the negative impact from specific geos and prior-year XP comparables.","The transition of our customers to cloud and subscription annuity services is a critical element of our business transformation. To provide ongoing transparency into our progress we\u2019ve added a new KPI commercial annuity mix. This quarter 82% of our commercial revenue came from annuity revenue streams which is up 5 points from last year. While quarter-to-quarter the mix can vary with uneven growth rates we\u2019ve seen in transactional licensing before and after the XP refresh cycle. The overall trend clearly reflects the meaningful progress that we have made.","Office commercial products and services declined 2% but grew 1% in constant currency. Japan was a three-point drag. We successfully renewed a large volume of annuity contract expirations in Q3 at healthy levels in line with historical rate. And we continue to see a strong shift from traditional licensing to Office 365 across our business customers. In each of the last three quarters we have added more Office 365 seats than transactional licenses with SMB customers.","Server products and services continued to exhibit strong momentum with revenue growth of 12% and 16% in constant currency. Our portfolio is well-positioned to meet the needs of our customers for their private, public and hybrid cloud solutions. Adoption of our premium products remains strong and revenue grew 25% across our premium offerings for SQL, System Center and Windows Server.","Overall, revenue from our commercial cloud services more than doubled again this quarter. Enterprise penetration is accelerating with over half of all agreements signed during the quarter including cloud services. Within Office 365 premium workload now make up more than 50% of the install base and we are seeing strong attach of our enterprise mobility solutions to Office 365. As our usage grew rapidly this quarter and Dynamics CRM online benefited from strong customer growth.","Moving now to operating expenses which were favorable to our guidance driven by decisions that we made during the quarter to reduce spending and to continue to reallocate resources to accelerate growth in key areas. For instance, in markets where we are facing challenges, we reduced our sales and marketing expense to reflect the current environment and as I mentioned earlier in my comments on our phone business, we took further actions to lower our cost base. Across the company we continue to prioritize and reallocate our spend to activities with the highest impact.","The result was that operating expenses grew 4% for the company. Normalizing for the approximately $300 million year-over-year benefit from FX and the addition of $570 million related to phone, operating expenses grew just 1%.","Our effective tax rate was 24%, which is 5 points higher than last year. The increase is primarily driven by the inclusion of our phone results and our changing geographic mix.","We returned $7.5 billion to shareholders this quarter which is an increase of $3 billion from Q2. This change is consistent with our objective to increase capital return to shareholders with the focus on value.","With that overview the current quarter, let me now turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter. I\u2019ll start with a few overall comments for additional context. The guidance that we are providing is based on current FX rates and should actual rates differ they will be reflected in our financial results. As a reminder, in our annuity businesses the FX impact is first reflected in our unearned revenue as is it is based on rates when the contract is billed and then into the P&L at that same rate as the revenue is recognized generally over the next year.","In Q4 unearned revenue will reflect three quarters of billings with the stronger U.S. dollar which will negatively impact year-over-year comparables. Likewise, we\u2019ll be recognizing a higher percentage of revenue from periods with the stronger U.S. dollar in both the recently completed Q3 and also the prior-year comparisons. In total, we expect FX will impact revenue growth by approximately four points in Q4 with the majority of that impact in our Commercial segment. While XP-related comparables remain tough for Q4, we are starting to anniversary the XP benefits from last year.","And finally, from a geographic perspective, we expect the year-over-year declines in Japan to continue. With that additional context, I\u2019ll now move to more specific guidance, starting with Devices and Consumer.","In licensing, in Q4 last year, we recognized $382 million of revenue related to the end of the commercial agreement with Nokia, which will impact year-over-year growth trends. For this Q4, we expect revenue to be $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. This range reflects the anniversary of XP, the impact of the Japanese economy and an anticipated draw-down of inventories in the PC ecosystem ahead of the release of Windows 10 this summer. Within consumer Office, we expect similar trends to Q3, including the continued transition to Office 365 subscriptions.","In Computing and Gaming Hardware, with the addition of Surface 3, we expect revenue to be $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. In Phone Hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, with continued momentum in value smartphones and anticipated declines in non-Lumia phones. Gross margins will reflect similar dynamics to Q3. In Devices and Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion with continued growth in Bing, Office 365 and Xbox Live transactions. In Commercial Licensing, we expect revenue of $10.5 billion to $10.6 billion with a continuing shift to annuity. This range reflects roughly four points of negative impact from FX in addition to the factors I discussed earlier. In Commercial Other, we expect momentum to continue in our commercial cloud with revenue $3.0 billion to $3.1 billion. And in Corporate, we don\u2019t expect any revenue impact.","We expect COGS to be $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion with variability being driven by both hardware segments. We expect operating expenses to be $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion. This range implies that our full-year operating expenses will be roughly $2 billion below our initial guidance for the year while still investing in key growth opportunities across R&D and sales.","We have benefited from FX, but the biggest driver has been our ongoing cost discipline and prioritization efforts. In Q4, we expect to incur $100 million integration expenses and, separately, another $100 million in restructuring expenses. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. Given the current FX environment, we expect our net cost of hedging to increase and other income and expense to be negative $200 million. We expect our Q4 tax rate to be 22% to 24%.","In Q4, we expect CapEx to sequentially increase in support of our growing Cloud business. And we expect unearned revenue will grow sequentially, in line with historical seasonality, excluding the foreign currency impact.","In closing, as you heard from Satya, we are making progress in our strategic goals and we are seeing are focused investments land in differentiated products, customer usage and sales results. Customers are seeing and embracing our innovation, leading to increased usage of our cloud services and a transition towards subscription and multiyear purchasing. We continued to invest aggressively to capture opportunities where we see competitive advantage while also becoming more efficient to accelerate our pace of innovation.","We encourage you next week to watch the webcast of keynotes from our Build developer conference. We will share more of the innovation happening with Windows 10 and our cloud services. We\u2019ll also host our financial analyst briefing, where Satya, Kevin Turner and I will discuss how the company\u2019s transformation provides unique growth opportunities that drive increased lifetime customer value across our core businesses. We look forward to sharing that progress with you.","And with that, let me turn it back over to Chris for Q&A.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Amy. We\u2019ll now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.","Brent Thill","Good afternoon. You had great momentum in the cloud. I was curious if you could just talk about the positioning in both in on trend and cloud environments? And also weave in what you\u2019re seeing with Azure.","Satya Nadella","Sure, Brent. Thanks for the question. Overall when I think about the Microsoft cloud it\u2019s really the combination of Office 365 dynamics as well as Azure. We think about our capital allocation that way, we think about our utilization product architecture and customer value and how uniquely we can bring these three assets together to serve our customers well. And that\u2019s the momentum you see and I talked about the run rate, the usage metrics and there\u2019s really increasing intensity of usage amongst organizational customers in our commercial cloud. One of the other things also is a huge benefit for us is, because our cloud, our public cloud runs on our software assets, our software asset gets packaged up as our servers.","In fact, I think of our servers as the edge of our cloud. So the unique capability we now have in Windows Server, SQL Server is becoming that much more competitive. Because we\u2019re running our public cloud in it and that\u2019s what anyone deploying their own private cloud expects to have. And so you see there\u2019s two sides of benefits and two sides for us. One is in our cloud momentum, which itself is the combination of SAS applications, paths , and IADs which I believe is unique in the marketplace as well as with the software itself is packaged up into our private cloud offering be it Windows Server or SQL Server and they\u2019re becoming increasingly competitive in the enterprise and data center additions. And so that\u2019s what you\u2019ve seen in our commercial results, both on the licensing side as well as on the cloud side.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Brett. We\u2019ll move to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Philip Winslow","Hi. Thanks. Congratulations on a great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on Office 365 because some of those metrics really jumped out to us. It seems like overall revenue between commercial and E&D for Office 365 is up over 100%. If you look at the consumer user count is up pretty huge this quarter-to-quarter there. The question is sort of about Satya and Amy. Satya when you think about the positioning and sort of where we are in just the adoption lifecycle of Office 365 on the consumer side and then the SMB and enterprise. Where are we in terms of the inflection point there? And then Amy, how should we think about going forward in terms of the guidance that you gave how we should think about the financial implications of where we are in that transition from off-premise to the Office 365?","Satya Nadella","Let me start, and Amy you could take it from there. Overall I would say there\u2019s a secular movement that\u2019s happening in particular with Office 365, quite frankly, it\u2019s happening across the entire product portfolio of Microsoft which is more to what I would described as annuity relationship as well as subscription relationships. Because those of a long-term contracts relationships we want to have with our customers be it consumer, be it small business or large customers. In all the years I\u2019ve been at Microsoft it was always our dream to be able to sell more of the sophisticated capabilities of Office to individual consumers as well as small businesses.","But it was hard to do in the previous generation because of the server infrastructure and what I would say sophistication of IT required. Whereas now with the cloud for the first time we now can serve both individuals as well as small businesses with the same kind of sophistication that in the past was exclusively available for the large enterprises. That\u2019s what you see when we see our subscription growth in consumer, we see subscription growth in small business these are folks who never bought a server from us. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing is increasing, what I would call, annuity relationships and subscription relationships with all classes of customers.","And it\u2019s new penetration, so it\u2019s not even a one-for-one replacement, even for the enterprise customer there consumption is going up. They may have consumed one or two workloads but now they can have the opportunity to consume the entirety of the portfolio and not just that. If you look at the products in Office 365 that we have, take eDiscovery it\u2019s a complete new space for us where we are able to do things in security eDiscovery enterprise management that we didn\u2019t even do for the top end of the enterprise in the service side, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing.","Amy Hood","And, Phil, on the math that sits behind that, it\u2019s a good timing. Next week at the financial analyst briefing, I\u2019ll send the \u2013 and have a lot more time to explain the actual lifetime value of each of these customer segments, especially in Office 365. But I think in consumer, it\u2019s maybe the easiest one to talk about, is that we talked about license growth of 10%, when you correct for Japan. Our ability to quickly, I think, move our customer base through stronger execution, both direct through retail and having our channel execute well and partner with us on this transition. I do think we\u2019ve made a lot of progress. And maybe more importantly, we continue to innovate in the product and deliver value to the end user, which is really what matters. And so I think we\u2019ll be able to show the progress we\u2019ve made over every quarter, and give you some goals going forward. So I look forward to having the chance to spend more time on that in detail.","And SMB looks very similar in some ways. They purchased similarly, was bought with a PC, was bought one time, it was infrequent, with an inability, as Satya said, to add workloads. So I think those are some of the bigger transitions you\u2019ve seen for us in terms of being able to increase the value. So hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to give you more details on that next week.","Philip Winslow","I\u2019ve been waiting for those details for years. I appreciate that. All right. Thanks, guys.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Phil. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Keith Weiss","Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and a very nice quarter. I think one of the highlights of the past year has definitely been the expense control, and I guess you could call it, like a normalized OpEx growth of just 1% in the quarter, continues to be very impressive. How should investors, and how should we think about the sustainability of that expense control. Or how long can you keep sort of investing for these growth initiatives, like cloud, yet keep your overall OpEx growth rate so low on a go forward basis?","Satya Nadella","Let me start, and then I\u2019ll have Amy add. Overall, the core of how I want us to approach expenses is to make sure that we are not limited in our ability to invest in categories where we have unique things to, contribute. So we\u2019re going to do that though, with great discipline, and that\u2019s what I think you\u2019ve seen us do over the course of the last year, and we\u2019ll continue to exhibit that. But at the same time, we will not shrink away from our ability to go put investment, be it in sales, marketing or product R&D, when we clearly have unique things in secular categories of growth. And that\u2019s something that we have the capability of doing, and we want to be able to do that in a disciplined way.","Amy Hood","And I would just add, I generally think about two key items that we\u2019ve been able to think about, across the leadership team. First is, I think we have exhibited an increasing ability, over the course of the year, to reallocate during the year, both at the organization level and at the team level, to make sure our dollars are going to the highest ROI things. And secondly, I think it\u2019s a general belief held at the highest levels of the company, that operating efficiency increases our ability to be responsive, both to the needs of our customers, as well as innovate faster inside this place. And I think when you take those two things, along with what Satya said, being able to balance disciplined focus and execution for us, I think we feel very good about the progress we\u2019ve made.","Keith Weiss","Yes. Thank you.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Keith. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please proceed.","Rick Sherlund","Thank you. Satya, you mentioned, a year ago, that we\u2019re going to see a next generation of personal productivity software. I wonder if you could update us on what that means. And when we might see that as just an extension of Office 365? Or how do we monetize those products? And when will we hear more about them? And Amy, we didn\u2019t see any tech guarantees in the quarter for the upcoming Windows 10 launch, and we also haven\u2019t heard anything more about changes in accounting for Windows 10, given that there\u2019s going to be a big undelivered element there. Is that something we should expect to hear more about next week?","Satya Nadella","Sure. Let me start. Thanks, Rick. What I think about even just my own day-to-day usage of Office, even in the last year, it\u2019s gone through a drastic amount of change. Of course, I use Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, on a daily basis. But if I think about all the tools that I\u2019m using, which is all part of Office 365, today, on a daily basis and multiple times a day I start my day as I talked about in many conferences with Dell which is a tool I love which is in fact something that\u2019s uniquely possible because of the shift to Office 365 where we can take organizational data and breakthrough all the boundaries or, again, in silos inside an organization and have people discover information. It\u2019s the richest way for me to visualize what\u2019s happening at Microsoft in real time. That news feed for me is kind of the lifeblood of Microsoft. I use Power BI . One of the things that we talked a lot about is usage.","In fact, one of the cultural changes inside the company is everyone from the frontline engineer to the frontline salesperson is responsible for usage. And given that, we want to have these leading indicators showing up in our dashboard not are static reports and Power BI is this rich canvas for us to be able to, one, visualize data as well as ask natural language questions. I look at my own usage of one note in Surface. That\u2019s gone through a fee change both because of the hardware innovation, innovation in Windows, innovation in Office. I look at something like Sway which I\u2019m pretty excited about because basically we\u2019re taking the concept of what is an interactive document and the website and bringing it all together into these Sway documents if you well and if you\u2019re excited about what that could mean in customer service marketing or for school reports.","So that\u2019s \u2013 we are well into it so that is not going to be waiting for some future date to release anything that\u2019s new, but we\u2019re well on our way with all of these tools and they\u2019re available today and we\u2019ll of course be iterating continuously.","Amy Hood","And, Rick, on your other two questions specific to the tech guarantee that you would think about the time of year, due to the specific nature of the offer we have on Windows 10, there won\u2019t be a tech guarantee as you think about it for this upgrade cycle and there\u2019s disclosure in fact, in our revenue recognition section in the 10-Q that talks about that specifically. When we talk about the accounting for Windows 10, I will touch on that next week but as we get closer to the launch we\u2019ll go into more specifics.","And I\u2019m so excited about the space. I don\u2019t want to miss this one other big scenario which is Cortana , that\u2019s perhaps the thing that\u2019s going to change personal productivity even most and especially with Windows 10 and how Cortana comes to Windows, both to the browser as well as to the start, I think it completely change what personal productivity software mean from a day-to-day experience as well.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Rick. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Please proceed.","Mark Moerdler","Satya, Amy, congrats on the quarter. Thank you for taking my question. So if Windows OEM Pro has now stabilized excluding the bump that we saw from XP Refresh and volume licensing at least in constant currency is stable growing, should we figure that we\u2019ve now started to turn the quarter on commercial Windows revenue? In addition, where do you think we are on the consumer side on the non-OEM front? Is that something that continue to shrink for a bit?","Amy Hood","Let me take that one. Satya, you can add at the end of you want. No. I think, Mark, you\u2019re reading it correctly. We actually had our annuity volume licensing business as you know, has been showing growth and stability for a while as we talked about Pro is back to the pre-XP levels and while could see some fluctuation, I think this has been a very stable business for us for a long period of time when you take out that XP bump from last year. Talking about consumer, I think frankly Satya and I both reflected a bit on it in our comments. We do expect to see some additional inventory draw down in front of a launch. That\u2019s not unusual prior to a launch cycle and that will clearly impact our revenue in the quarter.","But I think as I look to 2016, I\u2019m excited about the designs we\u2019ve seen, I\u2019m excited about the products that are possible with Windows 10, and I think we feel good and are looking forward to sharing some of that excitement next week.","Satya Nadella","Yeah, the one thing I\u2019d also add is there is actually a much more fundamental transformation happening even with how we think about Windows and its delivery and we\u2019ll talk more about this even at our financial analyst briefing next week because I increasingly think about the lifetime value we can deliver to the user of a Windows device be it in consumer or even in the enterprise. And if you think about when we say Windows-as-a-service it\u2019s actually a pretty profound construct which involves us being able to not only think about what ships with OEMs, but how do we on a continuous basis, if it\u2019s a consumer we have things now in the store, we have subscriptions, we have gaming and then when it comes to the enterprise there\u2019s management, security, servicing which is all unique value. So there is going to be an increasing emphasis in the concept of lifetime value that we can deliver to customers.","Mark Moerdler","Perfect. I really do appreciate it.","Satya Nadella","Thanks, Mark.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you.","Chris Suh","Thank you, Mark. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please proceed.","John DiFucci","Thanks. Listen, it sounds like Cloud and Azure represents an opportunity to transition existing customers to a Cloud model, but also to expand your customer base or penetrate \u2013 or penetration into your current customer base with \u2013 I mean incremental business is what I\u2019m talking about. I would think that most of Office 365, because most people were already on Office, represents transition from life to license model, but so far, and I know it\u2019s still early, but so far what about the rest? Can you give us an idea of how much of this is new business and how much of this is transition business?","Satya Nadella","Let me start and then you can add. I mean I think you have to sort of look at all the use cases. In fact as I said, a lot of the Azure use case, I think you referenced this, have been non-zero-sum because our people started building their mobile back end, web back end using Big Data not workloads we have. I look at sort of everyday usage growth, even if they\u2019re creating a web workload it\u2019s for a very different type of web back end and a mobile back end. And the same thing with advanced analytics. I even look at the growth of virtual machine instances on Azure. We not only see Windows Server obviously but we see 20%-plus of Linux growth. So that\u2019s again non-zero-sum .","So there\u2019s significant traction we have in terms of moving beyond just one-for-one shift of a workload that traditionally ran on our server to our Azure Cloud. In fact if anything the majority of what we are seeing is new. Even in Office 365 it\u2019s not just one-for-one shift. Of course if you are \u2013 were using as a large enterprise Exchange and you moved to Office 365 you moved to using Exchange Online; same thing is true for SharePoint. But again take all the other things I described, power BI , Dell and the list goes on, take eDiscovery; even for the largest of enterprise these were things that had low penetration or low deployment. And so we are seeing increasing usage of that.","Same thing with our Dynamics business. EMS , it\u2019s completely a new category. We never had that kind of a management footprint. We now have the ability to have one control plane for IT for all the devices, identity management, device management, data protection. That\u2019s a new workload. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. We definitely are seeing one-for-one migration, but the opportunity in everyone one of our offerings from Office 365 to Dynamics to Azure has a non-zero-sum component to it.","John DiFucci","Thanks, Satya. Just want to be clear because you said something, I mean other than Office 365 did you say the majority of the Cloud business is new business? Or \u2013 and again, I know it can\u2019t be \u2013 I mean maybe you know exactly what it is but I\u2019m sure some of it is somewhat cloudy or \u2013 no pun intended, or vague, but do you think most of it at this point is new business? Is that what I heard you say?","Satya Nadella","Yeah, and also it sort of comes in interesting ways because one of the things IT, as you know, it\u2019s not about sort of replacing what you have, it\u2019s always augmenting what you have. A very classic scenario would be I\u2019ll take a SQL database application, bring it to the Cloud and then build a new mobile back end using the same data. So reuse of code, reuse of data, so you would use some amount if iOS infrastructure and then past consumption. So that\u2019s one of the very typical enterprise solutions you will see. In fact, our own IT Systems, take what we have done with our HR and our financial systems and some of those things as they move to the Cloud, we bring some existing and then add to it.","Amy Hood","And, John, to your specific question, you\u2019re right. A lot of the Azure is, the good way to think about that is new; and especially our Dynamics business, CRM online and some of the work we\u2019ve done across AX is certainly all new. And the lower down in the segment of Office you get, the more new it is, is the way to think about it.","John DiFucci","Great. Thank you very much.","Chris Suh","Thanks. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.","Walter Pritchard","Hi. Just a follow up to the question John had on Azure. Amazon released their profitability for the first time on AWS and it was I think higher than most people were expecting. I\u2019m wondering how we should think about your mix of business in Azure? You\u2019re running Linux, you\u2019re running a lot of services based on open source software, you\u2019re also running some of your own IP there. How should we think about where your margins are today and should we think of Amazon\u2019s AWS margins as a good benchmark for where you could be at like sort of scale they\u2019re at today?","Satya Nadella","First of all, I don\u2019t think that of the comparison between Azure and AWS is the true north for me. I think about the Microsoft Cloud because even the way we do capital, the way we measure utilization is all with the complete unit, which is of course all of Office 365 runs on Azure, Azure AD powers all of our Cloud, so it\u2019s really its entirety that we think of as our unique value. So that means we have SaaS which is a huge component between O 365 and Dynamics, PaaS which is a huge component of Azure itself. We see many customers who would use even our PaaS services and even AWS. So we \u2013 for example, you can in fact do a single sign-on using EMS and Azure AD in Azure and use \u2013 so your resources on AWS.","And then of course we have our iOS business. So that\u2019s how we think about it. And then it\u2019s reflected even in our margins. So when we look at our Cloud margins, they will have our revenue quality, which is very different; that\u2019s a combination of past iOS and SaaS. And that\u2019s how we want to make sure we make progress, because that\u2019s where both product value which is unique to us and also the quality of revenue that\u2019s unique to us.","But the one other thing that I \u2013 see my world view is not that all compute storage networks just goes to one place. That\u2019s why I think of our servers as the edge of our Cloud, and as I said there\u2019s a huge software asset in there which is becoming increasingly competitive. Of course we don\u2019t count that in our run rates or when we talk about our $6 billion plus run rate, that\u2019s just pure public Cloud number and that\u2019s fantastic to see and we want to measure it that way. But quite frankly if you sort of looked at what\u2019s broadly happening in the Cloud transition, we are participating in both the private hybrid Cloud as well as the public Cloud.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Walter.","Walter Pritchard","Amy on OpEx, you have \u2013 I guess not necessarily you but the company generally at this time has given some color into the next fiscal year\u2019s OpEx. Is that something we should expect at the Build event with your Analyst Meeting next week? Or any \u2013 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not going to give it to us today but \u2013 or right here, but just wanted to figure out expectations around when we should hear about that?","Amy Hood","We\u2019ll continue to talk generally about it. I don\u2019t expect to give specific guidance on FY 2016 next week.","Walter Pritchard","Okay.","Amy Hood","Okay, Walter.","Walter Pritchard","Thank you very much.","Chris Suh","Thanks. We\u2019ll go to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Heather Bellini","Great. I had two questions. One was related to the success of the sub 250 machines that you guys in the market have been seeing and just what geos have seen the best uptake for those so far? And then just, if there is a little bit more color you can share about the drivers of the commercial licensing business and I\u2019ve recognized all the affiliate that you guys just gave guidance for Q4. But as kind of as we look out over the next year or two, what are the big puts and takes in particular maybe on the server and tool side that we need to think about?","Satya Nadella","I\u2019ll start. I think as far as the low-cost devices, it\u2019s pretty broad. I think we think of the U.S. itself being in fact a big driver of some of the growth on the consumer side. We\u2019re also obviously \u2013 stimulated this so that we can be much more effective even in the educational markets worldwide. And Amy can add to that if we had any more detail on it.","When it comes to our Commercial Licensing and our servers, it\u2019s the same trend, Heather, which is the big shift that\u2019s happening is our enterprise and datacenter products, being Windows Server, Systems Centers , SQL Server, are more competitive. It\u2019s the same thing that I would say at least in the last couple of years clearly have played out. There is clearly \u2013 and in fact, as our products have become competitive there\u2019s been this mix shift. People have bought from us previously just standard editions are able to now look at our enterprise editions and that\u2019s what\u2019s playing out.","And there\u2019s definitely some pricing action we were able to take, but mostly because we were able to deliver this incremental value. And even with all the pricing action we took, we, from a total cost of ownership or just raw pricing perspective are very competitive versus what\u2019s available in the market. So that\u2019s what we see. And so the cycle some of the pricing actions obviously were anniversary out, but the overall thing that I\u2019m focused on is how can we continue to run our software asset ourselves in public cloud and translate that into our servers. And really paint this vision and make it a reality of hybrid computing and drive the secular growth of that.","Amy Hood","Thanks, Heather.","Chris Suh","We\u2019ll have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Mark Murphy","Yeah, Satya, I\u2019m wondering what inning do you think we are in terms of building out the next generation data centers but you\u2019ll need to support the commercial cloud. For example, do you think you\u2019ve built out data center capacity to support the commercial cloud business all the way to a $10 billion dollars run rate or $20 billion run rates? So if there\u2019s any way you can help us to try to gauge how much overhead you have in the capacity. And perhaps what type of data center footprint you envision a few years down the road.","Satya Nadella","In fact, one of the big changes that has happened I would say in the last couple of years, and I\u2019ll have Amy even detail out. It\u2019s the way we\u2019re going about everything from the very long lead things like actual data center locations and Build out to the procurement of individual machines, and essentially the work in progress inventory of that. We have driven significant process improvement to essentially make it as efficient as one can make it and that\u2019s a continuous process for us.","So when I think about even the capital allocation per quarter we very carefully look at what is our current utilization forecast, and what our demand forecast is. And we now have the ability to be much more dynamic. Surely there are some things which are long lead like data center location. But you don\u2019t need to build out data centers much before they\u2019re really being utilized. And so we have a very good process and that\u2019s a place were quite frankly a lot of the proprietary advantage of someone who is an at scale public cloud provider, not just with one application. And this is where the huge distinction is. After all we did run large-scale consumer services ourselves between Xbox LIVE and Bing. But this business of supporting a highly geo distributed enterprise cloud business is very different than just running in one at scale public cloud service. And we learned a lot with what is our workload diversity as well as our geo-diversity. And our supply chain management is optimized for it.","Amy Hood","Yeah, I would just add Mark. This is a place as Satya said we have made a lot of progress in being data-driven. This is down to a monthly review by workload, by property, by geo. And this is a place where I feel that we are in it terrific position frankly to respond to data sovereignty demands, changes politically and our ability to execute that to provide what our customers demand in terms of security and manageability and location. It\u2019s something that we also care a lot about.","Mark Murphy","Thank you.","Chris Suh","Thanks. Mark.","Chris Suh","So that wraps up the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call. We encourage you to tune into Build, our Annual Developer Conference which will be webcast live at to be www.buildwindows.com as well as our Financial Analyst Briefing on Wednesday, April 29, which will be webcast live on our Investor Relations website.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Satya.","Satya Nadella","Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining.","It was another strong quarter with double-digit top-line and bottom-line growth, the result of picking the right secular trends, accelerating innovation and most importantly, relentlessly focusing on our customers\u2019 success.","Our trusted, extensible cloud platform spanning application infrastructure, data & AI, productivity and collaboration, as well as business applications enables every organization to create their own intelligent systems and experiences to compete and grow.","Now I\u2019ll briefly highlight key areas of innovation and growth across our business.","Microsoft 365 empowers everyone from the largest multinationals to small businesses; from knowledge workers to first line workers with an integrated secure, compliant experience on any device. It is the only comprehensive productivity collaboration and communications solution that integrates with an organization\u2019s business process workflows.","Microsoft Teams brings together everything a team needs, messaging, video conferencing, meetings and collaboration into a single integrated user experience scaffolding, eliminating the need for discreet apps that only increase an organization\u2019s security and compliance exposure. 91 of the Fortune 100 use Teams, and more than 150 organizations have over 10,000 active users.","And we are expanding Teams to new industries like healthcare, with priority notifications for patient care and the ability to securely access patient records.","Cybersecurity is a central challenge, and Microsoft is the clear leader in cloud security with our unparalleled operational security posture, and our growing portfolio of security and compliance solutions, spanning identity, device endpoints, email, information, cloud applications as well as infrastructure.","In financial services, National Bank of Canada, BNP Paribas, Refinitiv a joint venture between Thomson Reuters and Blackrock, all chose Microsoft 365 for our advanced security and compliance.","We expanded Microsoft Threat Protection to include the Mac and manage vulnerabilities in third-party applications, providing the best defense for customers\u2019 heterogeneous environments. And we introduced two first-of-their-kind services: Azure Sentinel analyzes security signals at massive scale across an entire organization, using AI to detect, investigate and respond rapidly to threats. Microsoft Threat Experts is a new cyberthreat hunting service that provides access to our security experts on demand.","All this innovation is driving growth. Office 365 Commercial now has 180 million users. Our EMS installed base reached 100 million. And the Outlook apps on iOS and Android surpassed more than 100 million users for the first time this quarter.","We expanded our Surface family of devices with the Surface Hub 2S, which brings together Teams, Windows, and our category creating Surface hardware to power teamwork for organizations like Volvo, Domino\u2019s Pizza, Northwestern University and NASA Jet Propulsion Labs.","Finally, Windows 10 is now active on more than 800 million devices and continues to gain traction in the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system.","Moving to business applications.","Today, traditional systems of record and engagement are often siloed, limiting the value of an organization\u2019s most important asset, its data. Dynamics 365 solves this challenge connecting all their systems and creating digital feedback loops, enabling any organization to become a true AI-first company.","The Open Data Initiative we announced last year with Adobe and SAP delivers on this promise, and is already enabling customers like Unilever to unify their business data across all their lines-of-business applications to unlock new AI-driven insights.","Personalization is increasingly key to every organization\u2019s marketing strategy enabling them to effectively engage customers, tailor their experiences and increase return on investment. Tivoli is one of the world\u2019s oldest amusement parks is using AI in Dynamics 365 to help personalize marketing campaigns and transform how their first-line workers engage with guests, reducing churn and increasing customer loyalty.","And we are not stopping there. We are leading in two emerging categories: robotic process automation and mixed reality. Our Power Platform brings together robotic process automation with self-service analytics and no code-low code app development.","Recent updates enable citizen developers to build higher-quality PowerApps faster and easier and along with new capabilities in Power BI empower customers like SNCF, France\u2019s national railway, to create a more data-centric culture.","Our new HoloLens 2 is the most advanced, intelligent edge device available and in combination with Dynamics 365 and new Azure mixed reality services enables organizations like PACCAR and Chevron to digitize physical spaces and interactions to empower their first-line employees with the right information at the right time in the context of their business process work.","All this innovation is driving growth. Revenue from our Power Platform grew triple-digits year-over-year, and for the first time, more than 50 percent of our Dynamics revenue was driven by the cloud.","Moving to LinkedIn.","LinkedIn again exceeded expectations across all lines of business driven by record levels of engagement in the feed, content shared across the platform, the messages sent this quarter.","Marketing Solutions was up 46% year-over-year, and customers are relying on our new Pages experience and audience targeting capabilities to connect with LinkedIn\u2019s nearly 630 million members.","We saw record job postings again this quarter and are making it easier for job seekers to find more relevant and higher paying jobs and get personalized salary insights.","We have the most comprehensive solution for every organization to manage and engage their most important resource, their talent. New tools in Glint empower managers to quickly analyze and action feedback to have the greatest impact on team performance. And with our combination of LinkedIn Talent Solutions, Talent Insights, LinkedIn Learning, and Glint, we are helping employers access data driven insights to attract, retain and develop the best talent in an increasingly competitive jobs marketplace.","Now let\u2019s talk about Azure.","From the outset, we took a differentiated approach to the cloud to meet the real world needs of customers. Our architectural advantage is a clear reason for our success. Azure is the only true hybrid hyperscale cloud that extends to the edge. Operational sovereignty is increasingly critical to customers, and Azure uniquely provides consistency across development environments, operating models and technology stacks, whether connected or disconnected to the public cloud. And we\u2019re accelerating our innovation. ","Azure Stack extends our hybrid differentiation, enabling customers like Airbus Defense and Space to build and run cloud applications at the edge. And now with our new Azure Stack HCI, customers can build and run virtualized applications on-premise in a consistent way.","Azure Data Box Edge is a powerful new AI-enabled edge appliance that sits within a customer\u2019s environment in their data center or on a factory floor so that they can use AI to reason over data at the edge.","More than 95% of the Fortune 500 run their workloads on our cloud, including TD Bank. And AT&T chose Azure to shape the future of 5G with computing at the edge.","We are building Azure as the world\u2019s computer, with more global datacenter regions and now two in South Africa and more compliance certifications than any other cloud provider. And just last week we announced two new Azure government regions to meet the stringent requirements for maintaining the security and the integrity of classified US government workloads.","Every organization needs an IoT strategy to manage the 20 billion connected devices coming online by 2020. Our comprehensive Azure IoT platform enables customers to build, manage and secure their connected devices, and our recently announced acquisition of Express Logic furthers our goal, bringing our cloud to more than 6 billion MCU-powered endpoints.","BMW Group is partnering with us to speed the adoption of industrial IoT, both in automotive and more broadly in manufacturing, and Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance and Volkswagen both chose Azure to fuel their new connected car experiences.","Data and analytics is the foundation for building an organization\u2019s AI capability, and we are investing to make Azure the best cloud for data estates from data warehousing to real-time stream analytics. Daimler chose Azure as its new platform for big data and advanced analytics, and third-party analysts affirm our price performance lead in this fast-growing space.","And we are investing to make Azure the best place to build AI. This quarter we introduced new Azure Cognitive Services for fraud detection and image identification. Telefonica is using Azure AI services to create new intelligent experiences for their customers around the world and transform customer engagement.","The developers will play an increasingly vital role in value creation and we are committed to giving them the tools they need to be productive on any platform. GitHub surpassed 36 million registered users, and free private repositories expanded the opportunities for all developers, with private repo creation more than doubling this quarter. The new Visual Studio 2019 optimizes developer productivity and team collaboration.","And I\u2019m excited to share more about how we are empowering developers at our Build conference in two weeks.","Now to gaming.","We are investing in content, community and cloud to capture our massive opportunity in gaming, delivering record user engagement again this quarter.","Microsoft Game Stack brings together our tools and services to empower game developers from independent creators to the biggest game studios to build, operate and scale cloud-first games across mobile, PC and console. Our Xbox Live community now 63 million strong is key to our approach and we are enabling developers to reach these highly engaged gamers on iOS and Android for the first time.","Our fast-growing gaming subscription service, Game Pass, is expanding our reach, bolstered by our growing pipeline of first-party content. And Project xCloud, our new game streaming service will be in public trials later this year.","In closing, I\u2019m energized by our progress and incredibly optimistic about our opportunity ahead.","Across all of our businesses, we are delivering differentiated value for customers and creating new categories of growth that position us well for the future.","With that, I\u2019ll now hand it over to Amy who will cover the financial results in detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining for your questions.","Amy Hood ","Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone.","This quarter, revenue was $30.6 billion, up 14% and 16% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 16% and 18% in constant currency. Operating income increased 25% and 27% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $1.14, increasing 20% and 22% in constant currency.","Our sales teams and partners delivered strong results across each of our segments, once again resulting in double-digit top and bottom-line growth. From a geographic perspective, most markets performed in line with our expectations, however, results in Japan were much stronger than we anticipated.","In our Commercial business, cloud services strength drove our annuity mix to 90%, up 1 point year-over-year. Commercial unearned revenue was better than expected at $25.1 billion, up 19% and 20% in constant currency. Commercial bookings growth was strong, increasing 30% and 34% in constant currency.

We'll now move over to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. ","Heather Bellini","Amy, if I go back and look through your KPIs, it looks like the year-over-year growth in commercial bookings has never been this high on a constant currency basis, at least I was able to go back through fiscal '13. You mentioned an increase in the number of larger long-term Azure contracts which obviously is a driver of this. But is there any more color you could share? Is this coming from a handful of customers? I mean if that are just driving all of their like outsourcing everything to you guys and shutting down their data centers? Or do you see this as kind of a broad based trend, even in some of the industries that have been slow to move to the cloud where this is really starting to snowball? ","And then the follow up would be just Azure gross margins where you guys have done a remarkable job just continuing to increase efficiency there. How much room is left to go and how do you think about the percentage of COGS in Azure that are variable versus fixed and has the ratio been changing? ","Amy Hood","Great, Heather. Let me try to take both of those questions. On your commercial bookings growth question, I find it easier to think about commercial bookings before I answer the larger question about one-time in two ways. The first is the expiration base absolutely does matter and that's how we talked about it, and we had a actually very good quarter here in terms of renewals and what I think of as revenue we capture. We\u2019re able to grow the revenue in existing contracts, and so that absolutely contributed and has contributed over the past couple of years to what I do believe has been reasonably consistent, commercial bookings strength versus the expiration base. ","The second component is what I would put in a bucket of new business. Whether that new business comes as what you saw this quarter are two ways. There was some on-prem strength this quarter, it does show-up in bookings, it doesn\u2019t show up in unearned and it does show up in the P&L, we had a good quarter there. And we did have some large Azure contracts which tend to be longer dated and tend to have low billings upfront. That means it shows up in bookings and again not in the unearned balance in the same way, and so you will see as we go forward and you are already starting to see it more volatility in this number, not just based on the way we\u2019ve traditionally talked about it which is the movement of the expiration base but also in some of these larger and longer term commitments by what we now think of not just as customers but these are really now partnership relationships that we have where to your point we're co-collaborating to help customers be successful as they build their digital future. And so you will see a little bit of volatility in this number as those contracts and the type of contracts start to land. ","On your second question of Azure GM we have continued to see strong improvement in the core gross margin as Azure team has done a nice job on a number of fronts, continue to make progress on both software innovation but also importantly hardware innovation and working with our supply-chain to continue to have and see benefits on that side, and also is increasing use of premium services also contributed to Azure gross margin improvement. ","So while we remain focused on efficiency and the utilization of the hardware and software is also important to continue to see premium upsell, premium workload usage, so the customers are getting the most out of their deployments and usage of the Azure platform. ","In general it hasn\u2019t changed a ton in terms of that final component about fixed versus I think variable base, it's still been in the I think low [40%] [ph] as a range for us in terms of what depreciation versus what's more variable.","Operator","Our first next comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. ","Keith Weiss","A very impressive quarter. I'm going to speak a similar question to Heather\u2019s but [indiscernible] try to get a higher level answer. In terms of -- during this quarter, it just sounds to me like I heard Amy talk more about exceeding expectations than we have in prior quarters and exceeding plan more than we have in prior quarters. This matches up from what we are hearing in CIO surveys and talking to customers, it sounds like there is an inflection point going on in adoption of cloud and digitalization effort. So the question to you is, are you seeing that, are you starting to see an inflection point in terms of these adoption trends and the investment that you guys have made behind this really starting to take hold? And then perhaps a follow up for Amy. So operating margins really exceeded our expectations this quarter and I think consistent with expectations, can you talk a little bit about kind of what drove that and kind of why we wouldn\u2019t see as much as that on a go forward basis in terms of operating margin expansion?","Satya Nadella","Yes, thanks Keith for the question. So let me start. I think overall, what we're seeing is continued momentum, if you think about even our overall approach has been to have a view of an architecture that is grounded in our customers\u2019 needs. So we always believe that in distributed computing, you need a cloud and an edge. You need hybrid and guess what, today in 2019, hybrid has become much more main stream. But we were talking about this even five years ago.","They also sort of said things that will matter in this transition to the cloud will be consistency and productivity. So for example, whether it's developer productivity or IT productivity, it\u2019s not any one dimension, you need to bring IT and developers together to drive agility in an organization and their digital capability building. This is again, a place where we've had traditional strength. And that's showing up in the marketplace. ","And also if you look at our cloud stack, we have application and infrastructure, data and AI, productivity and collaboration, as well as business applications. That's pretty unique again. So that's, I think, what is showing up at scale as competitive differentiation and that's what you see in our numbers. But the most importantly, I think you see it in the customer momentum and what I believe is what is customer success. Digital technology today is not about tech companies doing innovation. It is about the rest of the world doing innovation with technology and Microsoft is uniquely in position to enable that. ","Amy Hood","And on your operating margin question Keith, there's a couple of things I would say that. In this quarter in particular, the places where we had a lot of outperformance were especially high margin areas, and I would point out three. The first is obviously the OEM and chip supply. The improvement in that in Q3 is obviously very high margin and also the bottom. ","Japan as a geography for us is a high transactional market. And so when Japan is strong, it tends to be a very high margin landing down to the bottom line. And the other one is the on-premises server number which is very good in terms of hybrid demand this quarter also with high margin. So when that happens, you do see because it's a lot of -- almost 100% in quarter recognition, a lot of help at the operating margin line. ","Now, the more sustainable conversation I think we continue to have on operating margin is our ability to pick the right secular markets in the right secular trends, you see significant revenue growth. We continue to focus on improving the gross margin of each individual product area, which creates leverage over time. And finally, focused investment and operating expense and that obviously creates leverage. And I think you do see that in general through the year as we continue to keep that formula.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Please proceed with the question. ","Mark Moerdler","Congratulations on a really strong quarter everyone. Amy, Satya -- Amy, can you delve into the impact of Azure hybrid benefits on Azure revenues, serving tools, renewals, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really well understood. Is it having more meaningful impact on Azure's reported revenue growth because of the fact that some of this is apparent in serving tools? And Satya can you give us some added color on why this specific offering is resonating so well with customers, which is what we're hearing? ","Satya Nadella","Yes, maybe I can start on the second part and then leads to the first question. I would say Mark the main thing that this offering enables is the flexibility with which customers can adopt hybrid computing. And as I've always said that there is -- hybrid computing is important for workloads that are more in the characteristic -- can be characterized as lift, shift and modernize, so that's one motion. And then there is a new load hybrid as well which is people are building in fact they're doing AI training job in the cloud but want to deploy the model close to the edge. And in both of the cases, hybrid benefits actually help with -- our business model is basically differentiated in supporting the architectural need and the flexibility needs. The one additional thing I\u2019d mention, which is increasingly becoming clearer to us is operational sovereignty will become important, the world and its distributed computing needs is not going to become some margin as set of requirements but it's going to be very heterogeneous, very in many cases regulated and so what we provide in terms of both the technology and the business model I think shows up with the maximum flexibility. ","Amy Hood","And then let me talk a little bit about the question from server products and services and how to think about the hybrid use benefits. In general today Mark almost all of that benefit shows up in what I would say as the on-premise KPI, and so over time though how you should think about that it will eventually show up in Azure consumed revenue growth, this is a benefit that\u2019s fundamentally about high value and flexibility and meeting customers where they are so that they can make a determination of when to make that choice. And so it tends to be like it's focusing people back on the all up KPI because it's a best representation of where customer commitment and usage of our architected from the beginning hybrid cloud. But to your specific questions it shows up today in the on-prem number is where you can see most of the strength of that value and over time as it gets used and consumed it will show lot more in the Azure ACR number.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. ","Q - Karl Keirstead ","Amy, I'd like to ask you about the big revenue beat in the Intelligent Cloud segment that drove much of the upside and in particular the server product KPI that was just addressed up 9%. I'm just wondering if you could frame how material the contribution of the Version 2008 upgrades were? And assuming that that lift can continue throughout calendar 2019, could it be enough to keep that the on-prem KPI you described it flat or even up slightly in the coming two quarters despite the tougher comps? ","Amy Hood","Thanks, Karl. When I think about the on-prem number I really divide it into things that have durable value and things I think of as more one-time. When I think about the durable trends that I expect to see it's been the hybrid value prop that we really just talked about on Mark\u2019s last question. And then the premium mix. Those two we have seen and continue to see. I do think we saw some benefit of end of support, but I would not say it was the primary benefit this quarter. The primary benefit was the two things I just talked about. End of support obviously we've got SQL in July and then Windows in January. And so I do think we saw some impact, particularly in SQL and I do expect to see some of that in Q4. But the Q4 comparable for on-prem is very big. And so even with some of that benefit of the durable trends, plus I think a more temporal one of end of support, I do expect to see a deceleration in that number in Q4. ","Operator","Our next question comes from like of Jennifer Lowe from UBS. Please proceed with your question. ","Jennifer Lowe","Great, thank you. I wanted to turn to the Office 365 Commercial business a bit. And that's been consistent very strong performer for you on and was again this quarter. But maybe just two related questions there. First, if I heard you, right, Satya I think you said there was 180 million users now on Office 365 Commercial which seems like you're hitting a lot of the customers that you thought might be there a couple of years ago. So I was just curious to get your view on how far along you are in that adoption cycle. And if there's still a lot more opportunity in terms of see expansion in the upcoming year? And then related, Amy you mentioned E3 and E5 are both pretty big contributors on the ASP front in the quarter. Are we kind of seeing shifting where E5 is sort of increasing in relevance in E3\u2019s played out a bit or is it sort of equally balancing, just curious to get sort of the mixing there as well? Thank you.","Satya Nadella","Sure. In terms of overall reach of Office 365, we continue to see significant opportunity going forward on multiple dimensions. So for example, we never participated as much in I'd call it non-developed markets, medium and small businesses with all of the sophisticated workloads. So, now that with a SaaS approach, you can reach a much broader base of business customers all over the world, is one opportunity. ","The second opportunity is, if you look at Teams, as an example, we are now reaching a lot of first-line workers. So this is whether it's in healthcare, whether it's in manufacturing, whether it's in retail, just not knowledge workers, but where you now have messaging solutions, as well as business process workflows integrated. So it's that combination of things going from knowledge workers to first-line going and the ability to reach all sizes of businesses is what's going to continue to help us I think have overall seat growth or socket growth. And then of course, there is the other dimension, which is the levels of Office 365 all the way to E5 with significant value. ","And the one thing I\u2019d mention is the having compliance security that spans all of these tools, is also proving out to be a very big architectural advantage in a customer value proposition because I think, our customers look to use more SaaS applications, they don't want an exponential increase in their security exposure or more compliance burden. And so therefore, Office 365\u2019s approach resonates even there. ","Amy Hood","And Jen maybe a little to your question, which is fundamentally about seat growth and ARPU as the drivers of that all up Office 365 Commercial growth number. This quarter and a little bit last I actually think some of the ARPU increase has been masked by some of the trends in seat growth. What I mean that is that 27% seat growth is starting to include some lower ARPU seats that Satya just mentioned whether that's in academic, in edu, in front-line workers and that's really important for us to keep having that seat growth even if it\u2019s not at the same ARPU level those are not seats that we ever could reach before at any level and that's absolutely new opportunity for us. But it does tend to mask a little some of the ARPU improvement that we've seen, it's still E3 and E5, there\u2019s opportunity on both, although we are starting to see the impact of E5 in net ARPU number. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. ","Mark Murphy","Satya, we've seen many indications of Azure winning a greater share of enterprise workloads recently. Do you think that you have found the right formula now for Azure to win the majority of workloads in the enterprise IT world? And then Amy just given the trajectory and the long-term commitments that you mentioned there, do you see it pass for Azure to surpass Office 365 Commercial and thus become the largest revenue stream for Microsoft I would say in the next couple of few years?","Satya Nadella","Sure, I'll start Mark and having grown up essentially in our infrastructure business at Microsoft, I would say that compared to even the previous eras where we did well in the client server era, in face of tough competition and in this era again in the face of a different set of competitors, we are doing well and we are doing well much better than we did in the previous era because we are seeing these tier 1 workloads which we never saw in the past. If you think about it in the client server era we never participated in the core of the digital infrastructure or financial services or in healthcare or in retail or in manufacturing and absolutely when we think about the digital transformational and design wins, deployment, consumption, it's kind of like what we would have done with some ISVs of the past, how we worked perhaps with SAP in the 90s when we were coming out with SQL server and they were coming out with R3 is what we are now doing with many, many, many businesses as they build out their digital businesses. So that' sort of perhaps characterizes for you what's new in terms of Microsoft\u2019s own growth in this space. ","Amy Hood","And the way that would show up Mark is a little bit I think where you were leading with the question you asked which is when we think about the Microsoft commercial cloud at $9.6 billion and growing over 40% how do you see that evolving and really the question is we have quite a bit of per seat or per user type businesses but what Satya just talked about is really about the Azure concept or participating both in an expand scenario total addressable market which I think people have talked about for a long time but what was different about what Satya just said is our ability to frankly to have higher share in the next era than we had in the last era. And so if you look at then our ability to grow in the Azure would be larger or over any period of time then ARPU seat or per user businesses it certainly could be but I don\u2019t want that to really diminish the fact that there is a lot of room for us and our per seat businesses particularly across LinkedIn, the Power platform work we're doing. Satya mentioned security, identity, compliance, there is a lot of room for us to continue to add value and growth in that area as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from like of Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Ross MacMillan","Thanks so much and my congratulations as well. We continue to see this really nice progression in the commercial cloud gross margin and you called out the Azure gross margin improvements. And within that there's some moving pieces. I think you\u2019ve got better utilization and efficiency of core Azure. You've got premium services, and then you've got this counter prevailing force of the different growth in consumption versus user base. ","Two questions on this, one for Satya. On the premium services, I'm just curious as to, which one or two or three are you seeing maybe break out become the largest or grow the fastest, which are most meaningful at this point? ","And then secondly for Amy, as we think about this trend, are you convinced that we'll continue to see not just for fiscal Q4, but into fiscal \u201820 and beyond consistent progression and growth in the overall commercial cloud gross margin? Thanks.","Satya Nadella","Sure. I mean, on the first question Ross as far as our premium services, just even on the application infrastructure side, for example, in compute, there is increasing need for things like IoT services. Essentially, there is a new business application like set of services that are getting developed to help people manage their complex IoT application development. IoT Central is a good example of that when you have many, many connected devices, you need a control plane for many of those devices, so that you contain the complexity of your app deployment, security management. That's one example. The other one is of course data. And the sophistication of the data aid is growing exponentially, both in terms of the needs of the databases required, the processing that is required close to data. So that's another place where something like Cosmos DB which is very unique in capability in the marketplace is definitely another service that's got real traction. Even data warehousing, the scale at which this is another market which we never participated in, in the past, whereas now we are one of the most competitive products when it comes to benchmarking around data warehousing. So those are all things that I would say are premium services that just talking about new applications being built on Azure, not counting all of the SaaS applications about that. ","Amy Hood","And to your overall commercial progress margin question. You're right, the fundamental driver is when I look forward into next year, I expect each service just like it did this year to really see gross margin improvement, whether that service is LinkedIn or Dynamics or Office 365, Azure per user or Azure IaaS in PaaS, but what you'll see is a revenue mix shift, right, that will offset that to Azure IaaS and PaaS. And so what that generally will do, will be a headwind to continued gross amount of the improvement even though you'll see individual improvement across all the GM services, and you'll continue to see Azure increase as a percentage of the total revenue. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with the question. ","Brad Zelnick","I want to follow-up on Karl's question but more generally on database products with the end of support coming for SQL Server [2008] in July, Satya, can you tell us how that sparking conversations with customers about database offerings on Azure and moving workloads to the cloud. And Amy help can you perhaps help us contextualize the opportunity to move traditional database workloads onto Azure and what the expansion economics look like?","Satya Nadella","Yes, a couple things Brad. One is, overall the need to get on the latest and greatest database technology just because of what is the increasing need for compute and data at the edge is what's driving a lot of the conversations on SQL Server. Interesting enough, we have a lot of requirements around edge devices even, so that you can have databases with compute so that you can really have what is needed at the edge, that\u2019s sort of one conversation. The other one is in terms of the cloud migration there is a variety of different used cases, we see people are using SQL DB, which is essentially PaaS service but it's a complete compatibility of SQL Server, they want to managed services around SQL Server which we have. And so both of those are all happening in parallel. A good example of this is in fact even the rewrite of complete revamp I would say of Dynamics. Dynamics 365 and its architecture at least in my eyes is a thing of beauty because it's completely been rewritten for the new database technology, whether it is on the data base side or on the data warehouse side, again uses a whole bunch of micro services and functions so that you can do AI close to data. That type of architectural approach is what we see is possible now for every SaaS application vendor out there as well. Because you think about the number of SaaS -- the number of business applications that were built on SQL Server I feel that that's an architecture that can support both what they want to do on the edge, but as well as on the cloud. ","Amy Hood","And on the contextualizing opportunity, the reason I said it's not the primary driver is because of that vast, vast majority of our server business is annuity based. And so when it's annuity based there is really no opportunity to see it as upside in Q4 from an end of support frame. For the smaller portion of our business it\u2019s still non-annuity per transactional, it does provide as I talked about earlier some opportunity but it\u2019s not that large just because the nature of the commitment our customers now is far more of the annuity type. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. ","Raimo Lenschow ","Can you talk on the Windows OEM side? You mentioned that the chipset situation is kind of easing a little bit. Are we kind of fully done there in terms of what do you see there from the Intel side and does that create some pent-up demand for the coming quarters as people are thinking about moving over to Windows 10 with the end of life coming up?","Amy Hood","Thanks, Raimo. I think we actually in Q3 as I said met sort of the unfulfilled Q2 demand and Q3, so I don't think of it as a pent up situation heading into Q4 and our guide certainly does not indicate that, that is what we believe will happen. And what I would say is I think there we feel good about the supply in the Commercial segment and the Premium Consumer segment, which is where the vast majority of our revenue is in OEM. And so I think in those segments, we feel fine for Q4.","Michael Spencer","That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call.

[Operator instructions.]  I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, general manager of investor relations. Chris, you may begin.","Chris Suh","Thank you operator, and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. With me today are Peter Klein, chief financial officer; Frank Brod, chief accounting officer; and John Seethoff, deputy general counsel.","On our website, microsoft.com\/investor, is our financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow our prepared remarks and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. As a reminder, we will post today's prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available.","Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft investor relations website until April 18, 2014.","During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements that are predictions, protection or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.","Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","Before I hand the call over to Peter, I would like to remind you all that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year. Also, unless specified otherwise, all impacted numbers for the current quarter have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of the revenue deferral and recognition related to Windows, Office, and Xbox videogame and the expense related to the non-tax-deductible European Commission fine.  Details of the adjustments can be found in our financial summary slide deck and press release.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Peter.","Peter Klein ","Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon everyone.  Before I get into my comments about the quarter, let me say a few words about the CFO transition we announced today.  As we all do throughout our careers, at various times we assess our personal and professional goals and priorities.  Sometimes we change jobs, sometimes we change companies, and sometimes we step back to focus on family and other personal goals.","As we approach the end of our fiscal year, for me personally, it\u2019s a good time to refocus my priorities to spend time with family in a way I haven\u2019t previously had the chance.  I feel great that the company is on a path to an exciting future in devices and services, and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of, and confident in, the finance organization.","I look forward to working with my successor on the transition, including getting out and meeting with many of you.  I have truly enjoyed working with all of you.  And now on to the quarter.","I\u2019m pleased to report we drove revenue and earnings per share growth of 8%, even as we navigate an evolving device market.  Our results reflect our diversified portfolio as well as the investments we have made in key strategic areas.  During the quarter, we launched the new Office, our enterprise cloud services continued to gain traction, and we continued to take market share in the data platform.","Before I dive into more details on our progress in these areas, I want to address what\u2019s top of mind for many of you, which is our Windows business.","There is no doubt that the device market is evolving.  Consumers and businesses are increasingly shifting their focus to touch and mobility, and as a result, they want touch-enabled computing devices that are ultrathin, lightweight, and have long battery life.  While Windows revenue has been impacted by the transition from the traditional PC to a new era of computing devices, the overall addressable markets are growing, and we are excited by the opportunities ahead of us.","We built Windows 8 with touch and mobility at the center of the experience, which positions us well in this new era.  However, the transition is complicated, given the size of our hardware and software ecosystem.  We still have an immense amount of work to do, yet we feel good about the foundation we have laid and are optimistic about the long term success of Windows.","I want to take some time now to be clear about where we are in this journey, and what we are doing to help drive this change.  With Windows 8, we are setting a new, accelerated pace for updates and innovations, as we focus on making the Windows experience richer and better.","Since launch we have delivered several important updates to improve our mail, storage, search, music, and video services.  During the quarter, we also added to the Surface family of devices with Surface Pro, which combines the performance capabilities of a PC with a modern tablet design.","Looking ahead, we will release the next version of Windows, codenamed Windows Blue, which further advances the vision of Windows 8 as well as responds to customer feedback.  The assortment of touch-enabled devices that are built for Windows 8 by our OEM partners is also improving.","Over the last couple of months, we\u2019ve started seeing devices that take full advantage of Windows 8, and we expect to see more devices across more attractive price points over the coming months.  As part of this, we are also working closely with OEMs on a new suite of small touch devices powered by Windows.  These devices will have competitive price points, partly enabled by our latest OEM offerings designed specifically for these smaller devices, and will be available in the coming months.","In the upcoming back to school selling season, we expect to see devices that incorporate advances from throughout the supply chain, including chipsets.  As well, Intel\u2019s fourth generation core processor will help enable new devices that combine performance benefits with power savings. Later in the year, we expect to see devices based on Intel\u2019s upcoming Bay Trail Atom processor, which promises to deliver tablets and hybrid PCs with extended battery life at competitive prices.","Today in the Windows Store, there are six times as many apps since launch, and we expect more to be added as we gain traction with Windows 8 adoption.  In June, we will host Build, our developer conference, where we will provide more tools and information for developers to build great Windows 8 apps.","In retail, we are working to improve the consumer purchasing experience.  Our initiatives include focused efforts to further educate and incentivize retail sales professionals and to have better in-store product differentiation.","In summary, Windows is transforming to the new era of computing.  As I said on our last earnings call, growth in Windows depends on our ability to give customers the exciting hardware they want at the price points they demand, and a wider range of apps and services to meet their diverse need.  We are hard at work with our partners to meet these goals, and we\u2019re confident we are moving in the right direction.","Now, switching gears to productivity, this quarter we launched the latest version of Office, which brings mobility, social, and cloud features to the world\u2019s most popular productivity app.  Importantly, the new Office represents a fundamental shift in our model.  Now both businesses and consumers can access Office through subscription.","With this shift, we expect to grow our customer base, increase customer satisfaction via continuous updates, and reduce piracy.  As our enterprise customers modernize their productivity infrastructures, we are confident that they will continue to deploy Office 365.  We also expect our transactional customers to increasingly transition to the cloud with Office 365.","It\u2019s been a while now that we\u2019ve been talking about our investments in the cloud, and I\u2019m pleased to share that we are starting to realize the benefits of those investments in a meaningful way.","Office 365 lights up with this latest release, as evidenced by our growing customer adoption.  This quarter was our strongest ever, with net seat additions up 5 times over the prior year.  One in four of our enterprise customers now has Office 365, and the business is on a $1 billion annual revenue run rate.","Our server and tools business continues its momentum with yet another solid quarter of revenue growth.  Within the data platform, we continue to take share, with our strength in mission critical and business intelligence workloads.  Enterprise has recognized the power of SQL Server to unlock business insights, and as a result, we continue to significantly outpace the market and are seeing new deployments and very healthy renewals.","In enterprise cloud, just in the last week, we launched our Windows Azure Active Directory and infrastructure as a service offering on Windows Azure.  This innovation across platform and infrastructure services uniquely positions Microsoft as the only cloud provider who can offer customers a comprehensive hybrid cloud solution that integrates existing IT infrastructure with all the benefits of the public cloud.","Xbox continues to be at the center of our living room strategy, having evolved from gaming to an entertainment platform.  Whether they are playing games, being social, or watching movies, consumers continue to be drawn to Xbox Live.  Xbox Live now has over 46 million members, up 18% from the prior year.  Clearly there\u2019s a lot of momentum, and with E3 only a couple of months away, we look forward to sharing more shortly.","In summary, our diversified portfolio drove solid revenue and earnings per share growth.  We are hard at work here at Microsoft and with our partners to drive Windows 8 adoption forward.  At the same time, we have strong momentum in our enterprise businesses, including our cloud services.  Combined with our unique consumer assets like Xbox Live and Skype, we are well-positioned to deliver on our devices and services strategy.","And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Chris to discuss our quarterly results in more detail.  I\u2019ll then come back to discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter and beyond.","Chris Suh","Thank you, Peter.  First, I\u2019m going to review our overall results, and then I\u2019ll move on to the details by business segment.  Our diversified portfolio helped us deliver solid financial growth this quarter.  Revenue was up 8% to $18.8 billion, and operating income increased 5% to $6.7 billion.  Earnings per share grew 8% to $0.65.","Foreign exchange had a $180 million, or 1 percentage point, negative impact to revenue this quarter and a $99 million, or 2 percentage point negative impact to net income.  From a geographic perspective, we saw similar growth rates across both developed and emerging markets.","Multiyear licensing revenue continued to be strong, growing 16%.  Additionally, unearned revenue grew 13% to $17.1 billion.  And our contracted not billed balance was over $21 billion.","In the Windows division, revenue was flat this quarter.  Within that, OEM revenue performance was in line with the underlying x86 PC market, which continues to be challenged as the PC market evolves beyond the traditional PC to touch and mobile devices.  This quarter, inventory levels were drawn down as the channel awaits new Windows 8 devices.","Non-OEM revenue grew 40% this quarter, driven by sales of Surface and continued double digit growth in volume licensing.  Businesses continue to value the Windows platform, and volume licensing of Windows is on track to deliver almost $4 billion in revenue this year, and nearly three-quarters of enterprise agreements that we signed this year include Windows.","Additionally, this quarter we saw continued progress in the transition of Windows XP to Windows 7, and now two-thirds of enterprise desktops are running Windows 7.","Next, I\u2019ll move on to our server and tools business, where we continue to have good momentum.  Revenue grew 11%, highlighted by multiyear licensing revenue, which grew 20%.  The strength in multiyear licensing reflects the commitment and confidence that our customers have in our products and roadmap.","In the data center, the premium version of Windows Server, which targets tier one application workloads, saw significant revenue growth again this quarter.  Companies such as Domino\u2019s Pizza and Xerox continue to look to Hyper-V and Systems Center to deliver their critical business applications.  Revenue for Systems Center grew 22% and Hyper-V, our virtualization product, has gained four points of market share over the past year.","Our momentum in public cloud continues with more innovation, greater customer adoption, and a comprehensive suite of offerings.  Enterprise customers like NBC Sports and 3M continue to choose Windows Azure for their cloud platform needs.  Recently, we launched Windows Azure Active Directory, which is an identity and access management solution designed to support cloud-based line of business applications.","Today, over 2.9 million businesses, government bodies, and schools are already enjoying the benefits of Windows Azure Active Directory, using it to manage access to Office 365, Dynamic CRM Online, Windows Intune, and Windows Azure.","In our data platform business, SQL Server revenue grew 16%, and again outpaced the broader market.  Usage of SQL Server for tier one applications continues to grow, based on functionality, reliability, and value.  In addition to our efforts in big data, we are developing in-memory BI technologies built right into SQL Server that achieve breakthrough improvements in transaction processing.","Now, I\u2019ll move on to the Microsoft business division, where revenue grew 5%.  Within that, business revenue grew 10%, driven by 16% growth in multiyear licensing.  In January, we launched the new Office for consumers.  The new Office introduces touch, social, and mobile scenarios as well as tight integration with SkyDrive, enabling access to documents from any device.","The new Office is also available as a subscription, which benefits customers as they are always using the most modern version of Office.  As Peter stated, we expect the shift to grow our customer base, and we saw strong early adoption of the subscription service.","I would like to remind you that with subscription, the revenue is earned ratably over the length of the subscription, rather than at the initial purchase.  All up, consumer revenue was roughly in line with the consumer PC market, influenced by the shift to subscription and strong [attach] gain.","In terms of our productivity server offerings, we continue to see strength with Exchange, SharePoint, and Lync, each growing double digits.  Specifically, Lynch revenue grew over 30% again this quarter, with excitement around the platform continuing to grow.  90 of the Fortune 100 companies are now using Lync, and there are more than 5 million seats of Enterprise Voice deployed.","At our Lync 2013 conference in February, we announced that Lync and Skype connectivity for presence, instant messaging, and voice will be available for all Lync users by the end of June.  Connecting these audiences was a key milestone as we deliver on the promise of truly unified communications.","Next I\u2019ll move on to the online services division, where revenue grew 18%.  Online advertising revenue was up 22%, driven by another quarter of significant search rate improvement.  Operating performance improved 45% this quarter, driven by revenue growth and continued expense management.","In the entertainment and devices division, revenue grew 33%.  Xbox sold 1.3 million consoles and maintained its share position in the soft console market.  Xbox Live continued its strong momentum, and we continuously look for ways to further extend the value of Xbox Live for both our members and content partners.","As evidence of the expanding benefits, we saw transactional revenue grow roughly twice as fast as member growth this quarter.  Momentum with Windows Phone continues to build.  The device is now available in a broad range of price points.  We\u2019re receiving great reviews and carrier support continues to grow.","We now have over 10% share in several countries, but realize there is still a lot of work ahead to break through in some key markets.  The growing awareness of Windows Phone has sustained innovation from our hardware partners, and we feel well-positioned to continue our momentum.","Now I\u2019ll cover the remainder of the income statement.  Cost of goods sold increased 21%, principally driven by Surface, growth in cloud infrastructure, and royalties on Xbox Live content and videogames.  Operating expenses grew 4%, primarily related to product launch marketing.  This quarter, our effective tax rate was approximately 19%, and finally, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Peter for our outlook.","Peter Klein ","Thanks, Chris.  For the remainder of the call, I will discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter, and share some thoughts on fiscal year 2014.  Let me start with the fourth quarter.","In the Windows division, similar to this quarter, revenue will continue to reflect sales of Surface and strong volume licensing, while OEM revenue will be impacted by the declining traditional PC market as we work to increase our share in tablets.","Within server and tools, product revenue, including transactional and multiyear licensing, is about 80% of the division total revenue.  Enterprise services is the remaining 20%.  We expect both product and enterprise services revenue to grow low double-digits.","In the Microsoft business division, multiyear licensing revenue, which is approximately 60% of the division\u2019s total, should grow low double digits.  Excluding the recognition of revenue from the Office upgrade offer, transactional revenue, which is the remaining 40% of the division total, should be in line with the x86 PC market.","As a reminder, when updating your Q4 models, we expect to recognize approximately $780 million of revenue related to the Office upgrade offer.  In the online services division, we expect revenue to grow low double-digits, reflecting growth in search revenue, partially offset by lower display revenue.","Moving on to the entertainment and devices division, we expect revenue to grow mid teens.  For the fourth quarter, we expect COGS to grow mid teens, including Surface.  Other income and expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging.  In the current low interest rate environment, we expect these items to generally offset.","We are reducing our full fiscal year guidance for operating expenses to $30.2 billion to $30.5 billion.  This range excludes the impact of the European Commission fine of $733 million.","At the full fiscal year, we expect our effective tax rate, excluding the expense related to the European Commission fine, to be 17-20%, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be about $3.5 billion.  Excluding the impact of the Office upgrade offer, unearned revenue should roughly follow historical seasonal patterns.","Now turning to fiscal 2014, we expect fiscal 2014 operating expenses to be $31.6 billion to $32.2 billion, which represents growth of 4-6% from the midpoint of our updated fiscal 2013 guidance.  We will continue to prioritize our spending while investing in the significant opportunity that is ahead of us.","As we look towards the future, we have a solid foundation of products and services in market, and our leadership team is collectively focused on advancing every one of our businesses.  You can expect to hear more about the specific actions we are taking over the next few months.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris and we\u2019ll take some questions.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Peter.  We want to get questions from as many of you as possible, so please just keep to one question.  Operator, please go ahead and repeat your instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.]  And our first question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.  Your line is open, sir.","Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks for the cloud data.  We\u2019ve been looking for a lot of this, so it\u2019s very helpful.  Let me ask two related parts to that.  Can you give us a sense on the growth metrics in terms of Office 365, which is what you\u2019re starting to give here, in terms of revenue, users, customers, something that we can think about there?  And the second half of it, can you give us a sense in terms of the percentage of Office 365 customers that are net new to Exchange?  I know you\u2019ve given little bits of data on SMB and new SMB customers, but any sense there would be appreciated.","Peter Klein ","On Office 365, the metric that we gave was net seat additions were up 5 times over the prior year, so that gives you some growth metric in addition to the revenue number.","To your point on Exchange or more broadly, I would say about other workloads, we\u2019re seeing exactly that dynamic.  So not only are we addressing and reaching new customer segments like SMB, but many of them have never had a productivity server workload before.  Not just Exchange, but others as well.  And even those that had Exchange are now using other workloads, and so we\u2019re seeing most of our customers having more than one workload.","So across every dimension in terms of new revenue streams from the service, new customer segments, and new workloads, there\u2019s a lot of new, and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the growth and the opportunity that we\u2019ve been looking for.","Operator","And our next question is from Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.  Your line is open, sir.","Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse ","You provided a little bit of color on Surface.  Obviously we\u2019re seeing expanding portfolio there.  I just want to get a sense of how this evolving, especially on the distribution side, and how the product is doing versus your expectations.  And then when you start to think about going forward, how would you also expect the product portfolio to evolve, as well as distribution?","Peter Klein ","As I said, we are expanding both the product set and distribution, and that is broadly, all devices, inclusive of Surface.  We are expanding distribution of Surface.  We are now in 22 countries, 70 retailers.  And we\u2019ll continue to look to expand that.  Not only just expanding, but improving the experience.  And that\u2019s true not just for Surface, but for broadly Windows 8 devices.  And so we\u2019ll be investing against that for both Surface and a broader array of Windows 8 devices at multiple price points, including lower price points going forward.","Operator","Walter Pritchard with Citigroup, your line is open.","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","I wonder if you could weigh in.  There\u2019s been a bit of a debate this quarter around what the underlying PC market did.  And I think you see numbers ranging out there from mid single digit declines to a mid teens decline.  I\u2019m just wondering if you could weigh in on that.  In the past you\u2019ve given some sort of range.","And then related to that is if you look at the second half, I\u2019m wondering how we should set our expectations around this mid to high end Haswell release from Intel in terms of impact it may have on the PC market versus the later year, more holiday time, lower end Atom release, and how those two chip releases may have an impact on what you\u2019re expecting from the device market and overall impact on Windows?","Peter Klein ","On the PC market, I would look to some of the third parties, IDC and Gartner.  They\u2019re sort of in the 12-13-14 down range this quarter.  And in terms of the chipsets, we\u2019ve always felt that with Windows 8, it was a process of the ecosystem really innovating across the board, and really starting to see that on the chips.  And we\u2019re very encouraged by both Haswell and some of the Atom processors to really improve the overall user experience that Windows 8 delivers.  And over the coming selling season, I think that\u2019s very encouraging and we\u2019re optimistic about that.","Operator","Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs, your line is open.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","We\u2019ve heard Intel talk about Haswell, and they mentioned it on the call, I think it was last night.  You obviously mentioned it.  And I guess I\u2019m just wondering what can you guys do to specifically help grow your tablet share given you are reliant, ex the Surface products, on OEM partners to really hit a broad segment of the market.  And I\u2019m thinking in general, given the OEM partners don\u2019t have much wiggle room on the margin side, what can you do to help stimulate your market share, in particular in the mobility and in the tablet side?","Peter Klein ","I think broadly, in improving our position in tablets, and generally in devices, there\u2019s five or six dimensions ranging from what we\u2019re doing with OEMs on the devices and the range of devices, and how they can have a range of price points.  What the chips can do, because I think that\u2019s a part of it.  Both first party and third-party apps, and we\u2019ve seen improvements across the board there.  The user interface, and how we\u2019re innovating across the user experience.  And then distribution","So if you start sort of from the bottom up, all the way to when you buy the product, we\u2019re working across all those dimensions.  And on the device side, we are working closely with the OEMs to help them take Windows 8 and show it off in all its glory, across different form factors.  I talked about new smaller form factors and how Windows 8 can innovate to improve that experience.","So I think the biggest thing we\u2019re doing is helping them develop new and improved user experiences across the board, across size, across price point, and deliver a really compelling Windows 8 experience.  And it\u2019s not just the devices, like I said, it\u2019s chips, it\u2019s the apps, it\u2019s the buying experience, it\u2019s the user interface.  So we\u2019re really focused on all five or six of those dimensions going forward.","Operator","Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","You mentioned on the call that going to subscription revenues does have a near term impact on your revenues.  I was wondering if you could help us understand whether we\u2019re seeing that impact today, and perhaps to what degree, with the strong uptake of some of the cloud services, particularly like Office 365.","Peter Klein ","We are seeing that, particularly in our transactional business, in MBD, as people move from what may have been a transactional to a perpetual license, where the revenue is recognized up front, to a subscription service, where it\u2019s recognized ratably.  So you\u2019re basically deferring the rest of the term of the subscription.  So in the short term, you\u2019ll be deferring revenues that were not in a subscription, and would have been recognized immediately.","And as the subscription business is growing, you\u2019ll see that impact growing, but over time, what you\u2019ll get is what looks like an annuity revenue stream, that\u2019s more predictable and has higher customer satisfaction and probably higher retention rates going forward.  But in the short term, that will impact mostly in the transactional side of the MBD business.","Operator","Brent Thill with UBS, your line is open.","Brent Thill - UBS ","Peter, just on the gross margin, it\u2019s been under pressure for the last several years, but this quarter it did bounce back.  Can you just give us a sense of how you think gross margins will trend, and do you expect a slow improvement from here or expect more of the same in terms of where they\u2019ve been in the last couple of quarters?","Peter Klein ","Gross margins, as you know, are always going to be a function of mix.  And so depending on where you are in the quarter, the biggest driver of what your gross margin is going to be is mix.  So if you have a big hardware quarter that has low gross margins, that will impact it.","The biggest things that are going to impact the mix are going to be hardware, cloud services, and enterprise services, or people services.  It is a fact that we are starting to get scale in our cloud services, and so the growth that we\u2019re seeing in Office 365 is really coming at an improved margin as we scale that out.","So within each, we made progress, and then overall, in any given quarter, for the company it\u2019s going to be a function of mix.  So obviously in a holiday quarter, where you sell a bunch of hardware, that will have an impact on gross margin.","But I think one of the main takeaways for me is in particularly some of our cloud services, we\u2019re really starting to get scale. Bing continues to improve, their margins.  And Office 365 is really starting to get to scale.  So those things are really encouraging.","Operator","Ed Maguire with CLSA, your line is open.","Ed Maguire - CLSA","You just launched your Azure infrastructure as a service.  Just went generally available this week.  And I\u2019d love to get some color on how much that\u2019s figuring in the growth in long term contracts, and what your expectations might be for more traditional infrastructure as a service uptake over the next several quarters.","Peter Klein ","Great question.  It\u2019s clearly a key enabler of our cloud OS story, and how we\u2019re driving what we\u2019re doing with enterprise in the data center.  We have infrastructure as a service, we have now the most complete end-to-end offering through platform, and software, identity, and access.","But having the infrastructure is a key enabler, and I think a real accelerator for the Windows Azure strategy, and really more broadly the cloud OS strategy.  We now have a complete end-to-end story through the data center, from private, to hosted, to public, from infrastructure to platform, so I think it\u2019s, again, a key enabler of that [all up] strategy, and an accelerator.","Operator","John DiFucci with JPMC, your line is open.","John DiFucci - JPMC","My question is for Chris.  Just wanted to clarify something you said about inventories.  I think you were talking about PC inventory.  But with the Windows business, can you give us your assessment of what Windows inventory is at OEMs, especially given the disappointing PC shipment data this quarter?","Chris Suh ","I did mention the fact that we believe inventories were drawn down.  We do think they\u2019re at normal levels at this point, though.","Operator","Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company, your line is open.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Company","In recent periods, we\u2019ve seen your MBD growth significantly outpace PC unit growth, although we now have a dynamic where your Office subscription is really resonating with customers.  So the question is, just looking at it on a directional basis, is MBD revenue outperformance relative to PC units something that you think is sustainable going forward?","Peter Klein ","The answer is that it will depend, and certainly an offset between attach gains we\u2019re making against the market, offset against some deferrals as revenue moves to a subscription.  And so it will kind of depend each quarter.  Long term, it\u2019s a great trend, because we\u2019re building up a banked book of business on the subscription side, which will become less and less connected to the PC market.","Operator","Raimo Lenschow with Barclays, your line is open.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays","If you look at IBM coming out earlier on today having a relatively tough quarter given the economy, can you just comment on a little bit of what you\u2019re seeing out there, especially server and tools division obviously doing relatively well, but other guys are really struggling.  So help us understand how you see the economy.","Peter Klein ","I think about the economy, and then I think about the value proposition of our products.  Clearly there are tough spots in the economy.  I think enterprises and CIOs are looking for what they\u2019ve always been looking for, which is how do they get the best value for their dollar to move their businesses forward.","And I think we have a very good story in terms of the value that enterprises and small and medium businesses get from the capabilities that they can get from us, particularly in the data center, with SQL.  And as you compare SQL Server to competing products, the performance that you get relative to the price is really a compelling value proposition, and that\u2019s what\u2019s been enabling us to take share.  The same on virtualization as well.","And so I think for us, it\u2019s a combination of having the most complete roadmap for getting to the cloud, as well as the best collection of products that have price performance characteristics that are attractive to CIOs that are allowing us to have growth in our enterprise business, particularly in server and tools.","Operator","Our last question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel.  Your line is open.","Brad Reback - Stifel Nicolaus","Peter, as you look at the PC data over the course of the quarter, can you give us any sense of how that trended?  And following up on that, as you think about the business upgrade cycle, which should be over by this time next year, do we risk a real fall off again in the PC business, because the upgrade cycle has aided what\u2019s been a difficult PC market the last couple of quarters?","Peter Klein ","On your first question, there wasn\u2019t anything abnormal in terms of the trends during the quarter.  On your second question, the upgrade cycle, particularly for businesses, will be interesting over the next year.  I think over the longer term, what\u2019s more interesting is the long term evolution we\u2019re seeing in the device market, which I think is actually going to be more of a driver than any temporal upgrade cycle.  Innovation is happening faster, people are getting new experiences and new form factors.","I think that\u2019s what Windows 8 was designed to take advantage of, and so I think about the opportunity more about the new capabilities and the new services, and the experience that people can get on their devices and different kinds of devices, than it is about an upgrade cycle that\u2019s driven by something else.","Chris Suh ","So that will wrap up the Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure and now I will introduce and turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations for Microsoft. Thank you, Chris. You may begin.","Chris Suh","Our website microsoft.com\/investor is our financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow our prepared remarks and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.","Our website also includes information related to our new financial report segments, which were announced on September 19, 2013, and discuss with investors on our conference call on September 26.","As a reminder, we will post today's prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript at the Microsoft Investor Relations website until October 24, 2014.","During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are prediction, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","Before I hand the call over to Amy, I would like to remind you that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year. Also, please keep in mind that with our new segment reporting structure, adjustments for items such as upgrade offers, tech guarantees and presales are consolidated into corporate other to provide a comparison of operating results.","Unless specified otherwise, all impacted numbers for the current quarter have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of last year's revenue deferral related to the Windows upgrade offer, Windows 8 presale, the Office offer and a $113 million revenue deferral in the current quarter, primarily related to Windows 8.1 presale. You can find details of adjustments and reconciliations of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in our financial summary slide deck.","With that I will turn it over to Amy.","Amy Hood","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. By now you had a chance to look our press release, earning slide deck, key performance indicators and our 10-Q. Our results have been reported using the new reporting framework I first discussed in our financial analyst meeting in September.","Since this is a new way to think about our business, I am sure you will have a lot of questions, so after our prepared remarks, we will allow a little more time than usual for Q&A.","With that, let me dive right in.","This quarter, we delivered record first quarter revenue. We did it while working through a significant affirmation of our organization and while making significant move to implement our new strategy. Our company is focused and delivering. Our enterprise business remained strong despite a macro environment that some had characterized as tough. We are driving our business forward with industry-leading solutions in the areas like collaboration, unified communications and cloud services, and high customer satisfaction is driving high enterprise agreement renewal rate.","At the same time, we are making meaningful progress in our consumer business. We saw growing engagement and adoption across our major consumer services, including office 365 Home Premium, Skype, Bing and SkyDrive. With the new Windows, we are building high value experiences for our consumers that allow people to use our devices and services all day long whether at work or at home.","From a geographic perspective, we saw broad based revenue growth. Overall both, developed and emerging markets showed strengths. The U.S. and parts of Western Europe were particularly strong, while China was weak.","Now, let me share some quick thoughts on the PC market which turned out better than we had expected. We are seeing signs of stabilization in the business segment with two consecutive quarters of growth and a relatively stable outlook for the next couple of quarters. While the consumer segment is more volatile with increasing competition for share of wallet and also performed better than expected, particularly in developed markets.","With that backdrop, let's move onto Windows. We are seeing favorable reviews and customer enthusiasm for Windows 8.1, which became available last week. Windows 8.1 delivers on Microsoft promise of a quick innovation cadence launching less than one year after Windows 8. Based on extensive customer feedback, we added more customization capabilities, made the UI simpler and easier to use, added new and smart ways to search, improved power management and allowed multi-tasking, even on a tablet. Combined with the progress our OEM partners are making, we are collectively increasing the selection of compelling windows devices available to meet the dynamic needs of all segments of the market.","This holiday, we will see competitive opening price points on tablets and laptops, such as the Dell Inspiron 15 for less than $300. We will also see exciting mobile devices from six inch phones to 10 inch tablets, many with Microsoft Office. In the six inch category, we are incredibly excited by the Nokia Lumia 1520 tablet announced this past Tuesday. For eight inch tablets, Toshiba, Dell, Lenovo will have devices available for less than $300. And for 10 inch tablets, we of course like the Nokia Lumia 2520 with LTE.","In addition to third-party devices, we are also excited about our first-party lineup. With Surface, we are making progress with better end market executions. As a result, we more than doubled the number of units we sold over the prior quarter. In terms of mix, Surface RT did better than expected. With Surface Pro, we saw some customers delay purchase in anticipation of Surface Pro 2 which delivers significantly improved battery and processor performance.","Moving on to the enterprise, where demand for our solutions continues to be strong. Earlier this month, we announced our fall wave of enterprise products and services, which touches nearly every aspect of IT. We are seeing solid growth. We are outperforming our competitors and we are taking share in areas like virtualization and the data platform.","Our hybrid infrastructure and management offerings continue to be tough choices for CIOs with Windows Server Premium and System Center growing double digits again in this quarter. The latest versions of Windows Server, System Center and Windows Intune deliver enhancements in networking, storage and device management for Windows and alternative platforms. These enhancements will help customers realize the promise of hybrid cloud computing across their data centers, hosted clouds and Windows Azure.","In the data platform, SQL Server continues to outpace the market. The next version, SQL Server 2014, will offer new in-memory and cloud capabilities that will increase performance and unlock new hybrid scenarios. Later this month, we will make Windows Azure HDInsight, our Hadoop-based the Big Data solution generally available. We continue to bring additional value to the Windows Azure platform. This quarter, delivered a number of updates that enable faster connectivity, improve security and integrate access and identity across on-premise and cloud application. With all of the innovation we are delivering to our enterprise customers, we continue to be uniquely positioned to capture more and more of the addressable market.","Before handing it off to Chris, I would like to say a couple of additional things. As part of our new reporting framework, we have disclosed segment gross margin. The segment breakout is important in understanding our performance because each of our businesses are impacted by the different dynamics and have different margin profiles. In devices and consumer, the sequential change in gross margin dollars reflects the progress we are making towards our strategy of delivering a compelling family of devices and services.","While we feel good about the increased traction we saw with Surface this quarter, we know there is more to do. We are intensely focused on improving our capabilities in key areas like demand-planning and supply chain management and on achieving scale as quickly as possible. In commercial, we are already seeing the benefits of the investments we have made to transform our business model from perpetual software licensing to services.","In our commercial cloud business, which includes Office 365, Azure and other Microsoft services, we saw year-over-year gross margin expansion. With regards to our pending acquisition of substantially all of Nokia's devices and services business, we still expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of calendar 2014. We will provide an update to the EPS impact, if any, post-closing.","So in summary, we are executing better, getting our customers what they want and making meaningful progress through the early stages of our transformation. And we have accomplished all of this while also working through the One Microsoft realignment and several significant announcements. We are committed to executing and delivering and so far that's what we have done.","With that backdrop for the quarter, I will hand it over to Chris to give more details about our performance before I come back and share thoughts on the outlook.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Amy. First, I will review our overall results and then I will move on to the details by business segment.","Total revenue was up 7% to $18.6 billion and came in at about $700 million better than our expectations. Without the impact of foreign exchange, revenue would have been $200 million or one percentage point better.","Annuity revenue was particularly strong and grew 11%, driven by commercial performance. Cost of goods sold increased 23%, which was in line with our expectation of over 20% growth. This increase was primarily due to service cost and also higher depreciation related to the CapEx investments we made this quarter for cloud services strategy. As a result, gross margin grew 3% to $13.5 billion, reflecting the changing mix of our revenue.","All up, operating expenses grew 8%, which was generally in line with our expectations with the exception of G&A, which declined due to lower legal expenses. We continue to be thoughtful and diligent in how and where we focus our resources, in advertising, the [keynote], embraced One Microsoft and the benefits are already accruing with improved messaging and results.","In R&D, we are continuing to focus our resources while accelerating our cadence. Operating income and earnings per share, both declined 3% to $6.4 billion and $0.63, respectively.","Unearned revenue grew a healthy 14% to $20.1 billion and our contracted not billed balance grew to over $21 billion, driven by commercial strength. Our inventory balance sequentially increased by $675 million, mostly due to build the Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Ahead of holiday selling season, Xbox represents over half of our inventory balance.","Inventory for Surface products declined sequentially even as we built levels ahead of this week Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 launches. This quarter, we announced a 22% increase in our quarterly dividend to 28% and also announced $40 billion share repurchase program. We returned $3.8 billion of cash to shareholders, our high quarterly amount since the second quarter of fiscal 2011.","I am now going to talk about the performance in each of our reporting segments. Our devices and consumer licensing segment is comprised principally of Windows OEM, consumer office and Windows Phone, including related patent licensing. Our Windows OEM business performed better than expected, declining 7% versus our expectation of a mid-teens decline.","As Amy noted, we believe we are seeing stabilization in business PCs, which grew again this quarter and drove Pro revenue growth of 6%. We also saw better than expected performance in the consumer part of our business.","Non-Pro revenue declined 22%, but with several points better than expected. Excluding the impact of China, which continues to have a different dynamics than other emerging markets, non-Pro revenue declined 17%.","Together with our OEM and retail partners, we brought an incredible breadth of Windows devices to market. We have also made meaningful improvements to our advertising campaigns which now clearly highlight the value proposition of our devices.","As we head into holiday, we are excited by the opportunities to bring the new Windows experience to even more users around the globe. Consumer Office licensing revenue declined this quarter. The financial impact of the shift to Office 365 Home Premium was generally in line with our expectations.","Office 365 subscribers benefit from the natural integration of services such as SkyDrive and Skype and have the flexibility to access the service from numerous end points. Whether via traditional licensing or subscription, customers continue to see the value in Office and overall attach of Office increased this quarter.","The Windows Phone ecosystem is seeing sustained growth. While we have work to do, our share is growing in many geographies, the device portfolio is expanding and the number of apps available in the marketplace is increasing.","about Ubuntu our devices and consumer hardware segment, where revenue grew $401 million, driven almost entirely by Surface. With improved sales and marketing effort, combined with pricing and promotional activities, we saw Surface units and revenue growth sequentially from Q4, with the mix of sale shifting towards 32 gigabyte RT device. Demand increased for this device both, in retail and in education. From a gross margin perspective, in addition to product costs, which grew as a result of increased Surface sale, we also incurred non-product expenses as we readied inventory line for the new Surface lineup in the holiday sales cycle.","Moving to devices and consumer other. As a reminder, this segment includes our online marketplaces, advertising, Xbox Studio, Office 365 Home Premium and other consumer products and services. This quarter revenue growth in this segment was driven by both an increase in advertising revenue and also volumes in our online marketplaces. Search advertising revenue grew 47% driven by continued revenue per search improvements and query volume growth. Bing has now grown its share of search queries in the U.S. to 18%. Gross margin declined slightly due to higher royalty costs and also infrastructure cost growth as we expanded geographic footprint of our services.","Turning now to our commercial business. With all up commercial revenue across both on-premise and cloud services grew 10% this quarter. Notably even as we invest for growth, we saw gross margin expansion in our commercial cloud business. Across our commercial portfolio, we saw healthy renewal, a continued shift to premium products and strong adoption of our cloud services. Our enterprise cloud strategy is resonating with customers and server product revenue grew 12%. SQL Server revenue grew double-digit with SQL Server Premium revenue growing over 30%. Our commercial","Office products also remained strong and grew 11%. Within this, SharePoint, Exchange and Lync collectively grew double-digits with Lync growing nearly 30%. Helping to drive this demand for our Server and Office product is deployment of hybrid cloud solution. This quarter, revenue for our commercial cloud services grew over 100% as services such as Office 365, our innovative Azure services for comprehensive cloud solution. Importantly, we are seeing strong customer adoption with Office 365 seats and Azure customers both growing triple-digits. Dynamics CRM Online is also expanding its base, with two-thirds of new Dynamics CRM customers opting for the cloud.","With that overview of our Commercial business, let me share the financial performance in each of our Commercial reported segments. Revenue in the Commercial Licensing segment grew 7% and in our Commercial Other segment, revenue grew 28% to $1.6 billion. As a reminder, Corporate and Other is where we consolidate adjustments for tech guarantees, pre-sales and the like. In the comparable quarter of last year, we had aggregate deferrals of $1.4 billion for Windows and Office and this quarter we deferred $113 million, primarily related to Windows 8.1 pre-sale.","Having now talked through our results for this past quarter, let me turn it over to Amy to discuss our forward looking guidance.","Amy Hood","Thanks, Chris. As we look towards the second quarter, we are assuming the macro environment remains generally the same. With this, we expect many of the dynamics we saw in the first quarter to continue with strong performance in our commercial business and ongoing improvement in our consumer business. Importantly, we are set up for a terrific holiday season. We will have a wide variety of Windows-based devices in market.","Earlier this week, we launched Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2, and in November, we will launch our next generation console, Xbox One. Building on the performance and unique experiences that gamers love, it will also deliver an innovative entertainment experience by bringing movies, music, sports and live TV together in one place.","With that, let's get into the outlook. Starting with Devices and Consumer. In Licensing, we expect revenue to be $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion. This range reflects similar dynamics to what we saw in the first quarter. As I noted earlier, we expect the business PC market to be stable, however, the consumer PC market is subject to more volatility.","In Hardware, we expect revenue to grow 35% to 45% to $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion, reflecting the expanded Surface line up and the much anticipated Xbox One launch. The 10 percentage point range reflects variability in device unit volumes. In the consumer hardware business, such variability is not uncommon, especially during launches and the holiday season.","In Devices and Consumer Other, we expect revenue to be $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Search revenue should continue to grow reflecting improved revenue per search and query volume. As a reminder, in Q2 of the prior year, we launched Halo 4, which contributed $380 million of revenue to this segment.","Now, moving onto Commercial. We expect revenue to grow 9% to 11%, in line with the first quarter. As we think about this part of the business, we are confident in our ability to continue to add value to our products while providing low total cost of ownership for our customers.","In Commercial Licensing, we expect revenue to be $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion, with similar dynamics to what we saw in the first quarter. This includes healthy renewals and strong annuity revenue growth from volume licensing with Software Assurance.","In Commercial Other, we expect revenue to be $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, reflecting ongoing momentum in our commercial cloud business and enterprise services. As CIOs increasingly look to capitalize on the opportunities of cloud computing, we are confident they will continue to look to Microsoft for their IT solutions.","Moving on to cost of revenue, which we expect to be $7.9 billion to $8.3 billion next quarter. This range primarily relates to the unit variability assumed in hardware revenue. In Surface, we are still in the early stages of the lifecycle. As you know, there are many things that go into bringing hardware to market, including both variable and fixed costs. We are intensely focused on building volumes and achieving scale to cover these costs and get to profitability.","As you think about the economic model for Xbox, you should keep in mind that console margins are just one aspect of the overall platform's financial performance. Attach with games, accessories and Xbox LIVE services, also contribute to the economic model. We expect the launch of Xbox One to be the biggest in Xbox history and we feel great about our ability to continue our leadership position in the living room.","Moving onto operating expenses. We expect OpEx to grow 6% to 8%, to $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion. We also reaffirm our full-year guidance of $31.3 billion to $31.9 billion. We continue to invest in innovative experiences for our customers while remaining focused on expenses.","We still expect full year capital expenditures to be about $6.5 billion, even though we only spent $1.2 billion in the first quarter. Given the nature of the investments, there is variability from quarter-to-quarter due to our success based approach as well as the timing of delivery and completion.","We expect our tax rate for the full year to be between 18% and 20%, depending on our geographical mix of earnings. When adjusting for tech guarantees and product deferrals, we expect unearned revenue to be roughly in line with historical trends.","In summary, I am really pleased with our results this quarter. It was a great start to the fiscal year as we executed and delivered across all of our businesses. We are on track with implementing the transformation of the company around the One Microsoft strategy, and at the same time are not missing a beat in executing faster.","As we look forward to the second quarter, our enterprise business will remain strong and we are also set up for a fantastic holiday season with Surface, Xbox One and a host of devices from our partners, which will allow us to reach new customers and drive increased engagement.","With that, I will turn it to Chris and we will take your questions.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Amy. With that, we are going to move on to the Q&A. Operator, please go head and repeat your instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Brent Thill - UBS","Good afternoon. Amy, Chris, thanks for the additional details. I know everyone appreciates the forward looking details. My question is on the commercial revenue, obviously an impressive number in a seasonally soft Q1.","Your guidance assumes also a continued good trajectory. Maybe if you can walkthrough why you think you are outgrowing your peers and what has led to this double-digit number?","Amy Hood","Thanks, Brent, for that question. When I think about the commercial business and focus on our unearned revenue growth of 14%, plus our bookings growth, which was quite strong as well, 6%.","I think about the roadmap. The strength of the commitments the customers are making, is really forward-looking. It's a three-year commitment to the Microsoft platform both, to our cloud and on-prem solutions, the breadth and strength of that roadmap and our offerings, and in many ways that's what gives us the confidence that we are outperforming our peers. Also I it speaks a lot to the innovation in the roadmap we have shown, whether it's for Azure, Office 365 or our broader Server, what's the word, portfolio. I do feel quite good about both our competitive position and our ability to execute. I think we did a great job in the field this quarter, remaining focused on delivering what we needed to deliver to our customers and we were quite pleased.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Brent. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse","Hi, guys. Thanks, guys, and congrats on a great quarter. I just want to focus in on Xbox and Xbox platform. Amy, I wonder if you could give us maybe some color on how it performed this quarter, but in particular as you look into the December quarter here, obviously, you gave that gross margin guidance. But I was wondering if you could talk high level about how you are approaching the Xbox One launch play versus Xbox 360, from a perspective of how you are pricing it relative to COGS and just how the build of Xbox One looks versus 360?","Amy Hood","Thanks, Phil. I think it's a great question that gives me the opportunity to talk about the breadth of the portfolio that we will have to offer at holiday. And then talk a little bit about the gross margin profile and philosophy we have about those products. We are excited that we will have a great value offer at holiday with Xbox 360 and we will also have a great choice with our innovative Xbox One platform to really give us a good breadth rolling into holiday of selections across price points. We did, with Xbox One, make a decision to really enable a first-class experience out of the box. There's Kinect, there is a headset and there is the console. And depending on where you are around the globe, there may be a game included as part of bundled per geographic interest.","As I have said, the best way always, to think about the life value of the Xbox plan is over its lifecycle. I am excited about the increased opportunity that Xbox One allows us to attach more and different services beyond what we have historically thought of it as simply a gaming platform and when I think about the opportunity going forward, it is important in Q2 to realize that will impact our growth margin in the short-term but winning the platform at holiday and our positioning to do that allows us to grow profitability in a far different way over the lifecycle. So hopefully, that helps.","Chris Suh","Great, Phil. Thank you. Let's move on to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with JPMorgan Chase. Thank you. Please proceed with your question.","John DiFucci - JPMorgan Chase","Thanks. Amy, billings were about what we modeled for the quarter but deferred revenue was about $700 million less than we expected anyway, which was equal to the upside in revenue. So I am just curious, did you end up recognizing a greater portion of revenue upfront this quarter than you normally would? Because like I have realized, given how you recognize revenue, I guess the question could be said, was the transactional portion of the revenue in the Commercial segment greater than it is typically this quarter?","Chris Suh","Hi, John. This is Chris. I am going to jump in a little bit and let me Amy add on. I think the way to think about, the way we think about it is, we did see growth across annuity and non-annuity in the business. But also the changing dynamic is the mix of the dollars that are going into unearned revenue. As we build more contracts in some of our subscription offerings, that also changes the nature of the term. If you think about one-year subscription offerings and things like this, that has a little bit of effect on unearned revenue balance as well.","Amy Hood","Let me add a little bit. I would have said, John, both of those things you said are true and both are good, which is I do think our unearned balance growing 14% year-over-year was better than we actually had expected, from our perspective. And we also saw very good non-annuity performance within the quarter, particularly in Office and in SQL which, I think, are very good signs, we believe, for both to see the strength broad based. As you know the annuity portion tends to be related to large customers making long-term commitments, some of the non annuity is exciting, but it tends to be smaller customers who have decided to go ahead and upgrade to the most recent version of Office, which is also encouraging.","Chris Suh","We will move to the next question please, operator.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Wong - Citigroup","Hi, guys. This is Ken Wong for Walter. I guess, we wanted to focus a bit on Windows, and the OEM business was down just 7% this quarter versus down 15% last quarter and what seemed like you guys had a lot of pressures on ASPs and what not. What drove sort of the quick turnaround from quarter-to-quarter? Maybe if you could just dig in a little bit there.","Amy Hood","Let me try to break it up a little bit, Ken, to make sure I understand and get a chance to talk about the overall performance. Business was better than we expected, so actually ASPs were probably higher than many people had modeled and than we had expected, due to mix Growing 6% in the Pro segment was both, better than we expected and probably better than many people had considered.","In the Consumer segment, the minus 22, taking out China to minus 17, I think is generally overall you take those two numbers probably in line with most of the device level estimates for PCs we have seen across the industry and from some of our peers reporting into system.","I do think, we were impacted by some inventory levels. It did come down a bit actually this quarter as well, so I think overall we do think that things were probably more stable in the business segment and encouraging and then consumer and developed markets particularly were better than we had seen.","Chris Suh","Thank you, Ken. Yes. Next question please. Thank you.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. You saw a real market uptick in the advertising revenue, with the search advertising revenue. Any particular accounts you could point us to and sort of what really canalized that part of the business and how sustainable that's going to be on a go forward basis?","Amy Hood","Sure. Thanks, Keith. A couple of things. It was or going to - as you noted both by RPS improvements and volume improvements which is encouraging. I also think underlying matters some real technical improvements we made within the search engine, algos are better and the investments we are making are really allowing us to monetize at a higher level.","We also saw some strength in a few other geos, which helped increase the performance there, so I do believe that that trend we expect to continue into 2Q.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","Excellent. Thank you, guys.","Chris Suh","Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Great. Thank you, Amy and Chris. I just was wondering, you talked about the entry of a lot of new SKUs that are coming out for the holiday season. As we start thinking about building our OEM models, how do we think about for ASPs for this eight-inch and below category that you referenced there is a lot of product coming out with?","Amy Hood","Good question, Heather. Let me talk about first the importance of the breadth of the offers that we are putting into market. With Windows 8.1, one focus we had was to expand both, the opportunity for screen sizes and to reach new price points and to cover really from the smallest to the largest with touch and non-touch.","I think our ability to work with partners and some of the sales execution we have seen in the fields has led to have a broad opportunity at retail for holiday for devices. It is important. I do hope in some ways, this is a question that's a bit awkward. You always want to say ASP. It's good to have ASPs go up.","Transparently going forward as we make more progress, especially in the smaller screen sizes, we should expect units to go up and be very excited about that in terms of share, but ASPs would trend down. I don't think that will have a material - our guidance does not assume a material impact to ASPs in Q2, but over the long-term I actually do understand the question and would expect ASPs to be on that trend line assuming we are successful in those lower end device sizes.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much.","Amy Hood","Thanks, Heather.","Chris Suh","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you. And Amy, thank you, of course, for giving so much more data in guidance. We appreciate it. A couple of quick attached questions. You had said that the consumer Office last quarter was going to be down roughly 5% lower than the PCs due to the move to subscription. You said the attach was higher this quarter. Should we think that the dip was roughly in line with that?","Chris Suh","Yes. Hi, Mark. This is Chris. Let me try to clarify the numbers, just so we are all on the same page. So we did say consumer Office did decline this quarter. Last quarter, you were right, we said about 5 points of impact. So the impact indeed was about what we expected but with the increase in attach, they tended to offset each other in the end. So the numbers came in pretty much as expected. So I think that's the right way to think about it.","Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, perfect. That makes sense.","Amy Hood","Of course, I can't let Chris, I am going to add a little bit to the answer. Sorry. Mark, I do think it's important for us to continue to reiterate the importance of the success of the Office 365 Home Premium SKU from a strategic standpoint. We have done a very good job and I would say, as a mix percentage of the SKU, it continues to do even a little better than we had hoped in terms of execution at the endpoint and driving value. While that does have an impact on the initial ASP of the SKU, the long-term lifetime value of that product, in my belief, given the always up-to-date, first to see innovation, use across multi-endpoints, inclusion of Skype, inclusion of SkyDrive, really does allow for a higher lifetime value and ultimately a happy customer. So I really am encouraged by our progress and our execution there.","Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein","Beautiful. One other quick question. Any sense for what Commercial Licensing would have been if not for the move to cloud and subscription? Does it make a material change yet at this point?","Chris Suh","No. The best way to think about that, Mark, is if you look at, it's not an exact offset, but when I talked about the Commercial business all up, I gave the construct around products like Commercial Office, Commercial Server as all up across both prem, on-prem and Commercial. So we talked about Office growing 11% across both Commercial Licensing and Commercial Other in aggregate. If you look at the specific segment, you will see that Office in the Commercial Licensing segment actually grew 6%. So you can see that we are having outsized growth in the Commercial Other segment which is Office 365. So that, maybe, helps at least dimensionalize the size of the growth in relative term.","Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein","Perfect. I really appreciate it. Thank you, both.","Amy Hood","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities.","Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities","Thanks. Just to follow-up on Mark's question. I believe there was a slide at SAM that showed about $150 million of negative impact in the quarter from the move to the cloud which, in and of itself, it's about 1% of revenue. So it's kind of not a very big deal. And I think most of that was from Office versus Server and Tools. So if you say it's about as expected, I guess I am just looking for some clarification here. Is the really only impact we are seeing in the Office segment versus Server and Tools or is there much impact in that part of the business from the move to subscription.","Amy Hood","Rick, let me clarify. The $150 million, you are right. It was actually just related to the consumer Office segment and had no broader connotation beyond that. So that $150 million in a quarter on consumer Office actually does have a meaningful impact to the gross of that especially versus PCs. So that being said, obviously, if we talked about the momentum in our broad Office 365 revenue, it is a bigger impact across not just Office, because I think that's actually not the way of thinking about Office 365 impact. There it's really around Exchange, Lync, SharePoint and the board Server impact there is actually more meaningful than its impact on maybe Office clients on the commercial side.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Rick. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Macmillan with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Ross Macmillan - Jefferies","Thanks a lot. I have two questions. Just first on the Device and Consumer Licensing business. Your forecast for Q2 suggest some moderating decline and I was curious as to whether on the corporate OEM side, if you will, that's just a reflection of the ongoing stabilization trend or do you also expect to see improvement on the consumer OEM side? Related to that, how do you think about the impact of the end of life of XP on the corporate OEM side? Do you think that the improvement is completely unrelated to that end of life forthcoming or do you think there could be some impact related to that? Thanks.","Amy Hood","Great. Let me divide that question. I think and you said two parts. Our Q2 guidance for devices and consumer licensing, really says that the trends we saw in Q1 on both sides continue in Q2, so I think that's an important distinction as you noted and asked for clarification on, so I hope that's helpful on that component. When it comes to end of life of XP, I tend to think about that more on the VL side as well and the strength there which will be in the commercial reporting segments.","We continue to make progress on the XP install base and now a little over 75% of the PCs are running 7, so I do think as we continue to get to end of life of XP, you will see the impact more on the VL side of the business than you would in the device and consumer licensing segment.","Ross Macmillan - Jefferies","Thank you very much. It's helpful. Maybe one quick follow-up? Just on the Office business overall in the Commercial segment. If you think about units, whether licensed or 365, when you just think of the aggregate pool of units, you sort of alluded to it before, but did that perform in line with your expectation or was it actually slightly better on a unit basis? Thank you.","Amy Hood","It was slightly better for Office, the best way of taking about that from a unit perspective.","Ross Macmillan - Jefferies","Thank you very much. Congratulations.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Ross. We will take next question please.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","Ed Maguire - CLSA","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could address the conditions in China in a little bit more detail, not just on the consumer but also in the commercial as well as what your expectations might be given the lifting of the ban on game consoles for Xbox there, and also if you could just address what you are seeing in terms of your commercial cloud adoption outside of the U.S. Thank you.","Chris Suh","I will take the first part of the question, so yes as I said on the call, the macro conditions in China, which is I think consistent with what some of the other companies that reported as well have been challenging. Our total revenue across all of our business, including PC related businesses were down year-over-year and I think that's overall impacting our results in China all up.","I think the second part of your question was related to? Sorry, can you repeat your second question.","Ed Maguire - CLSA","Sure. Well, I was wondering about Xbox expectations there, but also the trends of commercial cloud adoption in areas outside of the U.S.","Amy Hood","We haven't really talked specifically about our expectations for China on the Xbox, but let me take the second half of that question. Our performance in both, Office 365 and Azure has actually been quite good both, in the U.S. to your question and outside the U.S.","Part of the reason that you have seen us investing on the capital expense side is to continue to build out the opportunity set, because we are seeing good demand outside the U.S. As you think our ability to be competitive there is just as high as it is here, so we have already seen that growth.","Ed Maguire - CLSA","Thank you.","Chris Suh","Great. Thanks, Ed. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo","Good afternoon. I wanted to drill a little bit into how you are thinking about holiday on the consumer hardware side and specifically just expectations around Surface, and then also any insight or color you think in terms of what your expectations are with RT versus Pro? Thank you.","Amy Hood","Thanks, Jason. I think, overall, for holiday, given our guidance, we clearly do expect a healthy holiday performance across the portfolio. I say that because we do have offerings that provide great value from having Surface V1 RT still in market, Surface 2, Surface 2 Pro plus Xbox 360 plus Xbox One really does provide both a value portfolio and those who want the latest and greatest experience have something covered.","The guidance does include good performance across all of those product lines. We did see, I think as Chris and I both talked about, a lot of progress in sales execution on Surface, in particular this quarter. And that does give us more confidence about our ability to execute again well in Q2. In particular, as you know, our RT did do quite well this quarter. And I look forward to seeing that continue with the Surface 2 device as well in holiday.","Chris Suh","Thank you, Jason. We will move to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thank you very much for all the details as well. Maybe my math skills have gotten horribly weak, but I just took the mid-point, Amy, of your revenue guidance for the different line items and also the mid-point of your cost of revenue inputs and the midpoint of your OpEx and I comp with what looks to be about a 10% reduction to where, I think, most sell-side models or maybe I am hoping that I did something wrong here, but if that's the case, I get about 29% op margin relative to the 33% or so that you did last year. So can you just walk us through what are items that you are assuming in your cost structure which effectively makes the op income flat, although you are getting good revenue growth rate. I just wonder if there were any one time items or if it's just emblematic of a shift in your business model devices and consumer, especially with Nokia going forward? Wonder if we should not be thinking about op margins but really op income growth rate? Thank you.","Amy Hood","Thanks, Kash. I think the one thing I would urge you to do, as you think about the guidance we gave, is looking specifically at the D&C Hardware guidance as well as making sure you are mapping the COGS very specifically to whatever assumption you are making in D&C Hardware, given the business model of Xbox that can and will have an impact in Q2 to the overall gross margin structure. So as you think through that, I think that's probably one of the assumptions that it may sound like using the midpoint could lead you a bit off, off of where I would have expected.","Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you very much.","Amy Hood","Thanks, Kash.","Chris Suh","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays","Thank you. I just wanted to follow-on from Jason's question earlier on. Can you talk a little bit about where you see the improved success and the sales execution success on the Surface? Is it kind of Commercial? Is it Consumer? And what's driving the improvement there? And how much is the improved revenue run rate, also driven by the fact that the channel needed to be ready for the holiday season? Thank you.","Chris Suh","Hi, Raimo. Thanks for the question. As we talked about, especially for this last quarter, Surface, we saw two things I will mention which is popularity of the Surface 32 gigabyte RT device. That one was more successful this last quarter. And we actually saw demand increase in both commercial and in the education customer segment as well. So we did see some improvement across both of those segment.","Amy Hood","Yes, I would say that another way is that, it was in retail and in education was where our RT performance.","Chris Suh","Yes, sorry. I meant actually -","Amy Hood","So I just want to make sure that was clear. It really was better execution at retail and in edu and I still look forward to building a commercial channel which we are just starting to do as we continue to add resellers to our model.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays","Perfect. Thank you.","Amy Hood","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks so much because I had two quick ones. One was, the SQL Server success continues to be very impressive particularly relative to the field. So I am wondering where you are seeing the most success there? Is that market share gains? Is that pricing getting into some new markets? If you could provide any color there that would be helpful? Then when is your expectation for the next update on OEM?","Amy Hood","Great. Let me take the second one first because it's the easiest. We still do expect transaction to close in the first calendar quarter of 2014, and post closing if there are any EPS impact changes to what we said before we will give them post-closing, so now back to your original question on SQL. That's a terrific one to get to talk about. Our growth there is as you said both, share growth and revenue growth.","It happens, I think, generally both, in BI which we have seen a lot of traction with. I don't know if you have had a chance to see some of our Power View announcements recently. Our ability to sort of span from the end user to the hardest Big Data problems really has resonated both, in the market and with industry analysts who has taken a strong position that we are the real market leader there.","The other thing I would say is, a very healthy performance of our premium SKUs. Our premium SKUs have continued to provide market growth and I think are competing quite well with the competition.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities","Great. Thanks, guys.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Brendon. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Company","Thank you very much and good afternoon, guys. Just two questions. First, Amy, if I recall correctly, I believe last quarter you had mentioned an expectation for double-digit annuity growth in fiscal '14. Is that still how you are thinking about the annuity part of the business?","Secondly, the year-over-year cloud revenue growth you reported was certainly impressive, but I was wondering if you could shed some light perhaps on how much of Azure billings or revenue are incremental versus [ballistic]?","Amy Hood","Too good question, I do expect our annuity growth and the guidance we gave it still does assume double-digit annuity growth going forward, and I think our performance this quarter gives me confidence that the guidance in Q2 is the right one given our strengths and our competitive position.","Secondly, on cloud revenue, your question gives me an opportunity to talk about the importance of our hybrid cloud. Within especially our server business, our ability to power the cloud whether you want to run it, you want a service provider to run it or you want to use ours, is really an incredibly powerful story and I think in some ways whether or not cannibalizing becomes somewhat difficult.","What we generally found right now is that it has been often additive, if you look at our server growth all up which we try to provide to help give some parameters around that, to give us some confidence that we are both, growing the base and providing additive opportunity. I think that's the number I would probably look to, to see the impact there.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Company","Great. Thanks very much.","Amy Hood","Thank you.","Chris Suh","Operator, I think, we are down to our last question.","Operator","Certainly. Our last question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Kirk Materne - Evercore","Thanks for fitting me in. I guess, two quick ones for you, Amy, on the commercial cloud offerings. I guess, first, around Office 365, you mentioned you have seen pretty good uptake even outside the U.S. I was interested in just your ability to monetize Office 365 in some of the emerging markets that have been challenging over time for Office.","Then secondly, as a follow-up to Gregg's question on server, within Azure, how much of the uptick in Azure is coming from sort of existing Microsoft logos versus bringing on net new logos onto the platform? Thanks.","Amy Hood","Great. Thanks, Kirk. Two things, I do think it's interesting. Maybe the best example of how to think about us moving beyond our traditional markets is the fact that we were the first to commence a data center in China, a market that we have historically had challenges monetizing at a high level. We went there, we are going there with Office 365 and Azure, we look forward to being able to make progress, we are investing both, headcount and capital dollars, because we do believe this provides interesting opportunity for us to begin monetizing end markets that have been harder for us to grow, maybe with our more traditional business model.","Secondly with Azure, I think we have seen both, but the thing I would say is what has been really helpful is that as we make it easier to attach Azure services to our normal rhythm in the field for enterprise agreements and through licensing. It provides a really helpful way and a really easy selling motion to provide customers flexibility. We added in the normal rhythm of the sales motion. We allow people to try, use and buy. And that has served us well in terms of being able to expose Azure to more and more customers in a normal selling cycle. So I think that's probably one of the better ways. It's the same actual selling rhythm we have used with Office 365 so successfully.","And with that, I wanted to say thank you. I know that this quarter, we changed reporting segments and that requires a lot of work. So thank you for all the work put in to understand our transition that we are trying to make as a company. So I am going to turn it back to Chris to say his final words.","Chris Suh","So that wraps up today's earnings call.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","Okay. And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Peter.","Peter Klein","Thanks Bill, and thanks everyone for joining us. Our first quarter revenue was flat year-over-year at $17.4 billion reflecting solid growth in multiyear licensing, but a slowdown in transactional revenue. Our transactional revenue which includes our OEM business was impacted by a challenging PC market, normal purchasing slowdowns in advance of upcoming product launches and tough economic conditions, particularly in Europe. This impact was offset by growth in multiyear licensing revenue which benefited from healthy renewals of enterprise agreements as customers continue to make long-term commitments to the Microsoft platform.","Our productivity and infrastructure offerings remain a top priority for CIOs. In productivity, our collaboration and communications solutions continue to perform well, with double-digit revenue growth this quarter. In the datacenter, our virtualization capabilities and hybrid cloud scenarios are enabling enterprises to move to the modern datacenter on their terms. And on the data platform, we are well positioned to take share, as customers increasingly turn to SQL Server 2012 for their mission critical workloads and business intelligence needs.","As part of our ongoing focus to increase the overall value we bring to our customers, we are enhancing our unique hybrid IT capabilities, with targeted acquisitions like StorSimple and PhoneFactor. Acquisitions of industry leading solutions like these accelerate our ability to help CIOs better manage their environment.","As I mentioned earlier, the PC market was challenged this quarter. In addition to a tough economic environment and competitive pressures, OEMs drew down their Windows 7 inventory as they began the transition to Windows 8. Our partners are building an incredible breadth of hardware. To-date, we have certified over 1,000 unique Windows 8 systems, including beautiful new tablets, convertibles, laptops and all-in-ones and there will be more to come.","As I look at where we are, we have kicked off the largest launch wave in our history and in a 12-month period, we will have refreshed nearly all of our major products. With these launches, you are seeing the investments we\u2019ve made over a number of years converge. And more importantly, you\u2019re seeing us execute on our commitment to deliver devices and services that people love and businesses need.","Whether we build our own devices as we have chosen to do with Xbox and Service or work with our partners to develop stunning new Windows devices. We will continue to offer consumers and businesses wide ranging choices, so that every user can get exactly what they want at the price that is right for them. ","With Windows 8 and our cloud services, we will delight users with an integrated experience across their devices. Right out of the box, Windows customers will be connected to unique communications, productivity and entertainment services from both Microsoft and our partners.","Services like SkyDrive, which allows users to store and manage their data online or the recently announced Xbox Music, which brings entertainment to the forefront. Users can access their content seamlessly from any device, at any time.","With the new Office which will be made available in the coming months, we will enable productivity scenarios to take the full advantage of the hardware coming to market. Including new mobile phone factors with touch and pen capabilities. And with Skype, Yammer and other services we put social directly into productivity and collaboration.","Within the enterprise, CIOs are using technology to drive their business strategy forward; whether it\u2019s making employees more productive, unlocking key business insights or managing and growing number of devices, we are uniquely positioned to address their needs. Our products are scalable and flexible and provide the lowest total cost of ownership. As we enter this new era at Microsoft, there is incredible opportunity for our partners, developers and customers and we are well positioned for sustained profit growth in the future.","With those thoughts, I hand it back to Bill for more details on our results. And then I will come back to provide some thoughts on our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2013.","Bill Koefoed","Thanks Peter. First I am going to review our overall results and then I will move on to the details by business segments. Revenue for the quarter was flat at $17.4 billion. Operating income was $6.7 billion, down 7%. Earnings per share was $0.65, a decline of 4%. Cash flow from operations was roughly flat at $8.5 billion. Foreign exchange had a $257 million or 2 percentage point negative impact to revenue this quarter, but the impact to net income was immaterial.","From a geographic perspective, this quarter we saw tough conditions in Europe where revenue declined mid-single digits. In emerging markets, PCs were roughly flat, a significant deceleration from the growth rates we had been seeing previously. Our Enterprise business in emerging markets continued double-digit revenue growth.","When looking at our revenue mix, consumer and business transactional revenue declined which is typical ahead of launches. Multiyear licensing revenue remained strong with 15% growth representing roughly 45% of our total revenue for the quarter. When adjusted for the $1.9 billion cumulative impact of the Windows and Office revenue deferrals, unearned revenue was $17.7 billion, up 13%. Our contracted-not-billed balance was roughly $20 billion.","Now let\u2019s move onto the PC market. We saw the overall PC market decline this quarter in advance to the launch of Windows 8 and in part due to competitive pressures and the challenging macroeconomic climate, I noted earlier. Business outperformed consumer and emerging markets outpaced developed markets although at a reduced rate.","Moving to the results for the Windows division, revenue declined 9% and lagged the PC market due to OEM inventory drawdown prior to the Windows 8 launch and the ASP dynamics of emerging markets relative to develop markets.","We have discontinued the bridge to the PC market as Windows 8 will be a platform across a broad set a form factors. As we go forward we will provide updated information and metrics about our business performance in the new context.","The shape of Windows revenue this quarter was non-linear as revenue slowed down dramatically in the first two months driven by the weak PC market dynamics. Revenue accelerated in September as OEMs started to build out for Windows 8 launch demand.","Windows 8 OEM presales revenue was roughly $800 million approximately 40% higher than Windows 7 presales revenue in the comparable launch quarter. This quarter volume licensing revenue grew double-digits and our Windows 7 enterprise deployments continue to grow though at a slower rate than last quarter.","On Tuesday, we announced pricing, market availability and open to pre-orders for Surface. Next week on October 26th, we will launch Windows 8 and Surface. With a modern user interface ability to support multiple form factors and a rich platform to build apps, Windows 8 opens up significant opportunities for partners, developers and customers.","Now I will move on to the Microsoft Business divisions where revenue grew 1%. Business revenue grew 3% and within that multiyear licensing revenue grew 8%. Reflecting the PC market dynamics, consumer revenue declined 8%. Last week we released the manufacturing of the new office and announced that it will be generally available in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013. ","The new office has a fresh look and touch-friendly interface that lights up on Windows 8 devices. Since the customer preview in July millions of people have downloaded the preview or signed up for this service and we feel great about the feedback and positive response from users. The new office is also in the cloud and features social enterprise capabilities with SharePoint, [EMET] and Skype. It is our most comprehensive office release ever. ","Our productivity server offerings continue to perform well; Exchange, SharePoint and Lync collectively grew double-digit again this quarter. Lync revenue grew at an impressive rate of over 40% as enterprises chose our unified communications platform for their communication and collaboration needs. ","Dynamics revenue grew mid single-digit and within that Dynamics CRM revenue grew over 30%. This quarter we announced key milestones to our ERP portfolio, with updates to Dynamic GP and NAV. Both these releases delivered great value to customers and partners through faster and more efficient implementations and compelling application functionality. ","Now let's move to Server and Tools which posted another solid quarter with over 20% bookings growth and 8% revenue growth. Enterprises services grew 13% and multiyear licensing revenue grew 19%, driven by new customers who are investing in our product wave. Transactional revenue declined this quarter, driven in part by a slower server hardware market and customers switching to multiyear licensing.","In the datacenter, we're seeing strong adoption of our platform across Cloud, on premise and hybrid scenarios. System Center revenue grew more than 20% and we launched the Windows Server 2012 in September, with increased management and virtualization capabilities. Customers like Acer, AQUAPAX, and Volkswagen Financial Services are already using its robust set of technology and features including network virtualization, flight migration and continuous availability.","We continue to gain virtualization share as customers like [POVA] and the City of Barcelona switch from VMware to Hyper-V at System Center to build private clouds with increased efficiencies and higher savings. In the public cloud, we continued the pace innovation and announced the release preview of Windows Azure Mobile Services which connects Windows 8 apps to the cloud, backend hosted in Windows Azure.","As Peter mentioned, over the past few weeks, we announced the acquisition of StorSimple and PhoneFactor, which will enhance our position in data storage and device management. In our data platform business, SQL Server revenues continue to grow double-digit. SQL Server premium revenue grew more than 20%, as customers continue to deploy it for their mission-critical workloads and business intelligence needs.","By combining the power of SQL Server, SharePoint and Office, CIOs can create scalable, self-service BI platforms. Users can leverage these platforms to analyze and interact with data in bold new ways, make real time decisions and gain insights from big data. We\u2019re seeing how SQL Server 2012 has raised the bar and positioned us to grow faster than the competition.","Next, I will move on to the Online Services division where revenue grew 9%. Online advertising revenue was up 15%, driven primarily by rate improvement in search offset in part by a decline in display revenue. Operating performance improved by [$150 million] or 29%. Increasingly, users are finding better search results at Bing. In (inaudible) test, nearly two and three users chose Bing\u2019s web search results over Google\u2019s results and over 10 million users had visited the Bing It On Challenge, where they can compare Bing and Google head-on.","In the Entertainment & Devices division, revenue declined 1%. While the console market was tough, Xbox maintained a strong share and had 49% at the US market for the quarter. This holiday season we have a great lineup of gains headlined by Forza Horizon and Halo 4, and complimented by a rich catalogue of connect games.","We continue to see strengthening Xbox LIVE, where our membership grew over 15%. This week we announced Xbox Music, which leverages the cloud to integrate the music experience across the tablet, PC, phone and TV, and has a worldwide catalogue of over 30 million songs. Xbox Music is the most comprehensive service available. It provides users unlimited streaming music on Windows devices, let\u2019s them play music based on similar artists and styles and allows them to purchase songs and albums. ","There is no other music service out there today that matches the capabilities of Xbox Music. We are excited about the upcoming launch of Windows Phone8. We have a strong device line up and breadth of operators across key markets. We will share more about Windows Phone8 at our event on October 29.","Moving on to Skype. This quarter 120 billion minutes of calls were made on the Skype network, an increase of 58%. We continue to make progress with the integration of Skype into our portfolio of products, and have announced the upcoming federation between Lync and Skype which will allows users to access their contacts through a common interface. Skype is also central to communications in the new Office and Skype calling is included in the upcoming Office 365 subscription service.","I will now cover the remainder of the income statements and share some expectations going forward. Cost of goods sold increased 10%, primarily due to Nokia platform payments, inclusion of Skype costs, growth in cloud infrastructure and enterprise services. As we look forward, excluding Surface, we expect cogs to grow high single-digits for the full fiscal year.","Operating expenses grew 2% to $6.5 billion. For the full fiscal year, we are reaffirming our guidance for operating expenses as $30.3 billion to $30.9 billion. Other income in this quarter was $226 million driven by the gain from the MSNBC sale. Other income includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. In the current low interest rate environment, we expect these items to generally offset for the remainder of the year.","This quarter our tax rate was approximately 19%. For the full fiscal year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21%. Adjusting for the impact of the Windows upgrade and Office offers, we expect other revenue will roughly follow historical sequential growth pattern for the second quarter.","We expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year to be roughly $3.5 billion. This quarter we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders and buyback and dividend and raised the dividend 15% to $0.92 per share annually. Now I will turn it back to Peter for our revenue outlook.","Peter Klein","Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I will discuss our revenue expectations for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2013. Starting with Server & Tools, product revenue including transaction and multiyear licensing is about 80% of the division\u2019s total revenue, and enterprise services is the remaining 20%.","As we noted the last quarter, our customers are moving from transactional purchasing to premium products and multiyear licensing agreements. We expect product revenue to grow high single-digits for the second quarter and low double-digits for the full fiscal year. And we expect enterprise services revenue to grow low double-digits for the second quarter and mid-teen for the full fiscal year.","In Microsoft business division multiyear licensing revenue which is approximately 60% of the divisions total should grow low double-digits for both the second quarter and full fiscal year. Excluding the Office deferral, transaction revenue which is the remaining revenue in the division, should grow low single-digits in the second quarter and mid single-digits for the full fiscal year. ","As a reminder, when updating your Q2 models, you should defer between $850 million and $950 million of revenue related to presales into the channel and the Office offer. Amounts deferred for presales will be recognized upon general availability, while amounts deferred to the Office offer will be recognized upon delivery, redemption or the exploration of the program in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. ","Moving on to Entertainment and Devices division, while we have been maintaining our share and leadership position, the console market continues to be challenged. As a result, we expect revenue to decline low teens into second quarter, but to grow low single-digits with the full fiscal year. ","In the Online Services division, we look to build upon our improvements in share and search monetization. For the second quarter and full fiscal year, we expect revenue growth to be consistent with the dynamics seen in the first quarter. In the Windows division, as a reminder, second quarter growth will reflect the recognition of $800 million of revenue from first quarter presale, partially offset by roughly $100 million of additional deferred revenue related to the Windows upgrade offer. ","Remember that the upgrade offer expires at the end of February at which time we will recognize all remaining deferred revenue. Looking forward, we eagerly anticipate the launch of Windows 8. We are bringing a new range of capabilities and scenarios to Windows and with support system-on-chip architecture we are moving beyond the traditional PC to the widest range of Windows hardware we have ever seen. New hardware will debut next week and will broaden over the coming months.","With Windows 8, we are giving developers a modern platform on which they can build rich immersive apps unlike any of the Windows ecosystem have seen. The Windows Store offers developers attractive financial terms and broad reach. With its grand opening next week the Windows Store will have a strong line-up of apps. Just as with the hardware, the line-up of apps will become more robust overtime.","In addition to delivering Windows 8 next week, we will also launch Surface designed to be the ultimate stage for Windows; Surface allows users to seamlessly transition between consumption and creation and as an example of the substantial innovation that is enabled by Windows 8. We are hard at work manufacturing the devices and will ramp production overtime. October 26th only marks the beginning of the journey we will take together with our partners and developers. Our collective success will be evident overtime as we change the way people experience the power of technology.","With that, I will turn the call over to Bill and we\u2019ll take some questions.","Bill Koefoed","Thanks Peter. And with that, Peter and I will take some questions. We want to get questions from as many of you as possible, so please stick to just one question and avoid long or multi-part questions. Gabrielle, can you please go ahead and repeat your instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, of course. (Operator Instructions) Our first question does come from Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Your line is now open.","Rick Sherlund - Nomura","On the Windows and Windows Live division there was no real guidance for the year; you just said you would recognize all remaining deferred revenue. Can you just help us understand what the variables are that we should be thinking about other than what the PC market grows out; and by PC market, I think we need to find out as you know, all Windows 8 compatible devices including tablets. So are there mix shift issues, the price you realized on a tablet versus traditional notebook; what are kind of variables we should be thinking about in terms of how to model Windows and Windows Live revenues for the year?","Peter Klein","Yeah. That\u2019s exactly right. One of the exciting things about Windows 8 is how it really redefines, so how people think about devices and the experiences they get across those devices and up until now, that\u2019s sort of narrowly been defined as PCs or tablets and customers have been forced to choose and may trade-off, frankly of what they get. With Windows 8, you can kind of get whatever you want at whatever price point you want. So whether you want convertible with touch and pen and integration with your line of business apps, or do you want a tablet for great information and communications and entertainment, whether you want a touch ultrabook, all those things come into play and all those things are available with Windows 8. And I think overtime, we're going to see how that plays out and that\u2019s the opportunity for us and it's really a factor of thinking about how all those are going to play against each other.","Bill Koefoed","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Just to Rick\u2019s question a little bit more specifically and I was on another call before this, maybe you said it. But, can you give us a sense of your expectations for Surface in the quarter, or if you can\u2019t do that, can you give us a sense for what pre-orders were thus far, just to give us a sense of how that\u2019s ramping out of the gate and what your expectations are there for that?","Peter Klein","","Yeah, thanks Heather, right now we\u2019re focused on our launch both of Surface and Windows 8 next week and so that\u2019s really what we\u2019re excited about and the opportunity to show people all the great devices, all the great capabilities and so we\u2019re not talking about that now. As we mentioned on the call, we\u2019re working hard on production, we\u2019re ramping production, we\u2019re excited about what we\u2019ve heard so far, the feedbacks are great, the reviews have been really good. And I think that demonstrates what we\u2019ve been talking about, the capabilities and experiences that Windows 8 delivers across various form factors. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley","I am going to shift to the Server and Tools business; the billings were a little bit better than we thought, but the recognized revenue in the forward guide was a little bit lighter than we have been looking for. And I just want to drill in to some of the expectations for the forward guidance. Are you assuming the transactional environment remains weak? Do you still think you can outpace the transactional piece in terms of your business and what should we be thinking about in terms of the convergence of billings and recognize revenue? Thank you.","Peter Klein","Yeah, thanks Adam; what we are continuing to see is that a migration from transactional revenue to multiyear licensing agreements, which is great, because it\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s driving the business, which is the vision we have for the roadmap, the resonance that has with our customers and so they\u2019re making long-term commitments to the platform. And so, it\u2019s one of the reasons we gave you the bookings number and the multiyear licensing revenue number of 20% and 19%, because that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing and so as that\u2019s growing faster than the transactional you\u2019ll see the bookings and the backlog grow and the recognize will follow overtime.","So that\u2019s really the thing to watch for in Server and Tools and we continue to be very bullish on that opportunity across the board whether that\u2019s to Window server, system center what we are doing in the private cloud and public cloud and certainly with SQL Server. So that trend that we are seeing in the migration to the multiyear licensing agreements is driving that business both now and for the long-term.","Bill Koefoed","","And just to build on that, this is one of the strongest bookings quarters we\u2019ve had in the last several years, so again for a $19 billion business to have over 20% bookings growth we feel obviously in addition to all the products that have come so far this year I think we feel pretty excited about the opportunity in that business. So thanks for asking that question. Gabrielle, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein","So question, given the slowdown in the PCs, how should we think about the change or what\u2019s going on in the Windows adoption processes; are we seeing continuation at the current rate or is this some proportional slowdown in the roll out of Windows 7?","Peter Klein","","We continue to see -- you are talking about enterprise adoption?","Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein","Right.","Peter Klein","We continue to see that grow this quarter although at a slower rate than we had in past quarters, so that opportunity remains very large. We are over 50% deployed and remember the end-of-life for XP is about a year and half away, so that remains a great opportunity for us that we see continuing on.","Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein","But it is slowing a bit?","Peter Klein","","It did this quarter.","Bill Koefoed","","It did yeah just this quarter and it\u2019s a summer quarter, so I don\u2019t know that I would read too much into just one period. Gabrielle, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open.","Walter Pritchard - Citi","Just to follow on with some launch questions, so there are sort of two changes here to the business that we will see going forward, one is the hardware piece in Windows and the other is, what looks like a pretty big ramp-up on the retail side with some store presence; understanding that the latter is probably in your guidance. Can you just remind us on the store side, where are you allocating the expenses and is that presence potentially grows overtime; how you expect that to the impact your financials? And then on Surface, should it be anything we think about other than sort of a price time to unit and making margin assumption, are there any other new ones around, the way you account for Surface in your financials?","Peter Klein","First question was about the retail stores and were they showing up\u2026","Walter Pritchard - Citi","Yeah, where the expenses are?","Peter Klein","Got it. The expenses are [incorp] and they show up a little bit in COGS and a little bit in operating expenses.","Bill Koefoed","And sorry, what was the second part of your question?","Walter Pritchard - Citi","To on Surface, I mean is there anything else, we should be thinking about in terms of how to model the impact of Surface; we know the price, we can make a unit assumption, we can make a margin assumption. Is there any deferrals, any OpEx impact and warranty you know\u2026..?","Peter Klein","Yeah, you\u2019re thinking about it right.","Bill Koefoed","Gabrielle, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch","As you enter the world of the new form factors; since you\u2019re coming little bit behind relative to Apple, what is the right way to think about your differentiation relative to the consumer market, opportunity for tablets and the enterprise market opportunity for tablets? Thank you.","Peter Klein","Well, I think one of our differentiations is we give everybody what they want for the purpose they want it. When I talk to CIOs for example and the enterprises, one of the things they really excited about is that Windows 8 devices give them a chance for their employees that uses that technology to have the devices they want and bring to work, they get the kind of manageability, security, integration to go on in business apps they want. So I think there is a big differentiation in the enterprise across all the form factors especially tablets that that are increasingly coming in for a place.","On the consumer side, I think there not only a range of price points and different kinds of form factors, but also unique and differentiated set of services and experiences that come with the device including Office, including SkyDrive, including Xbox Music. So I think across the board we see similar differentiation both in the enterprise and on the consumer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS","Peter if Surface is successful, shouldn\u2019t the cogs be well above the high single-digit growth for the fiscal year. I was just curious why you excluded, are you just waiting to see how the traction is before you give us more guidance or what is the explanation for that?","Peter Klein","Yeah, that's exactly right (inaudible).","Operator","Our next question comes from John DiFucci with JPM.","John DiFucci - JPM","I have a question on the deferred revenue specifically for the Windows business. Even if you exclude the adjustments, deferred revenue for this business increased in the quarter. And you normally or actually you always see a seasonal decline. I guess can you talk a little bit about that. What are we seeing there, is this tied to multi-year deals in this business now or is there something you do, or some of these adjustments maybe we are not accounting for correctly.","Peter Klein","It actually is that its multiyear licensing deals is continuing to grow double-digits so that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the deferred there. That's one sort of example of how enterprises are continuing to see value and adopting Windows.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colin Gillis with BGC Financials.","Colin Gillis - BGC Financials","Looking at the Server and Tools line again, when the results first printed we were asked quite a bit if that was showing any weakness in the enterprise [spend] environment. It sounds like a lot of that was just driven by the rotation to multiple year contracts. But can you talk about the market place right now, and if the market place is weakening, do you find out to be an advantage given the cost preferences in that line?","Peter Klein","It definitely is the migration from transaction licensing. Irrespective of a weak market, strong market, we\u2019ve got a great value, and it does play very well in tough macroeconomic times, because one of our great value proposition is the savings and efficiencies people get from using integrated technology across their stack at a really good price performance characteristic. ","So I would say, we feel great about our value proposition in any environment, does play very well in a tough macro environment. But what we're seeing now in the financials this is how we highlight bookings growth and multi-year licensing growth. It\u2019s related more towards the migration from the transactional business.","Operator","Okay, our next question comes from Philip Winslow of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Philip Winslow - Credit Suisse","Alright, thanks guys. Just have a question on just the margins of Surface, kind of the high level doing in an exact margin percentage. But how did you get sort of price Surface relative to (inaudible). I mean, obviously you guys talked about this one including implied your revenue amount for Windows license. Did you also take in to account sort of a weighted average or [tax] rate of Office for the buyers and then you add on a gross margin for the hardware. Just kind of how you built up to that, and then just kind of a high level, what was the pricing thoughts behind service. Was it the drivers, just adoption of the platform, was it actually may be some business, and does it change at all, near-term versus longer term? Thanks.","Peter Klein","As a [ready] pricing decision, it\u2019s really about the value proposition effort through your customers and the degree of capabilities and value you are delivering to them at a variety of price points for what they want. And that\u2019s really fundamentally what drives all of our pricing decisions. Do we have a really compelling value to offer our customers with the capabilities that we\u2019re delivering, and that\u2019s what we do across all our business and that\u2019s what drives our economic performance.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ed Maguire with CLSA. Your line is now open.","Ed Maguire - CLSA","Looking at how you\u2019re beginning to combine products and services with Office 365 for home and then, the bundling of services with Windows RT. Looking forward, is this going to change the way that you allocate, what might have been transactional revenues in the past to accommodate those transactional and services revenues?","Peter Klein","Yeah, generally that is correct. As we move to more delivery at services that will show up as services revenue as oppose to transactional revenue, that\u2019s correct. But I do think, it\u2019s a long-term trend and you saw that in the commentary that we made around our server and tools business. But we are having people that are making longer term commitments to Microsoft, and that shows up in our annuity business and server, it shows up in things like Office 365 where people are having a subscription service, it shows up in things like Xbox LIVE which you\u2019ve seen happening over the last couple of years. So, Ed, I think you\u2019ve got it right that we\u2019re seeing a lot more people that are committing to a longer term relationship with Microsoft which is clearly what we\u2019re striving toward.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is now open.","Brad Reback - Stifel Nicolaus","Peter, historically the transactional aspect of MBD has followed the PC market roughly. Is there any reason to think that that\u2019s not the case here for the final three quarters?","Peter Klein","Yeah, in general there are two things that impact the transactional business at MBD, one is PC market and the other is product cycle. So one of the things we also see period right before a launch of a new product from a transactional side and businesses is a slowdown, and also it does track the PC market. So those are the two things to keep an eye on. ","Operator","Alright. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays","Historically when we had to launch a Windows product there was a big uptake especially on the consumer side. Now this time around it\u2019s obviously different from the factors that are playing in and consumers need to get used to it. How do you think about the momentum we should see in terms of the first quarter or the second quarter etcetera? Thank you.","Peter Klein","Well without giving specific [items] we are certainly very excited about the capabilities that come with Windows 8 and the excitement that comes from that, and we are excited to talk about that at the launch next week. I think I am encouraged by what we saw from the Windows 8 selling that we\u2019ve seen so far the 40% growth over the comparable period last time. So we will just keep an eye on that and watch as we get further into the launch.","Operator","Alright our final question comes from Greg Moskowitz with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Greg Moskowitz - Cowen","This is somewhat of a follow up t Raimo\u2019s question. Over the past several months many of those reviewing Windows 8 for PCs while praising the significant innovation behind the OS have also continued to focus on the dual interfaces and the adjustment that users will have to make. Is that something that causes you concern just when it comes to initial adoption levels of Windows 8. Just wondering how you think about that?","Peter Klein","Not a lot, I hear the feedback and as a user we sort of have gotten used to it very quickly. At Microsoft when we do an innovation historically across our products often times there is new things that comes and I understand initially people do look at those things. And what we see overtime is that those innovations have delivered way more value, way more productivity and way more better usability. And so I am very confidence that is even more true with the great technology and capabilities and experiences that we have at Windows 8.","Bill Koefoed","And I think you have seen that the use of people who have used it over a longer period of time. And again for those who will be helpfully using it early. You will see that shopping your experience as well. Okay, so that\u2019s going to wrap up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you at the numerous events and conferences in which we will be participating in this quarter. For those of you unable to attend and personally, these events will generally be webcast and you will be able to follow along at microsoft.com\/investor.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. It was another strong quarter, the result of picking the right secular trends, delivering differentiated innovation and focused execution that results in increased engagement and usage. The intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge era is already upon us. It represents a tremendous opportunity. We took significant steps this quarter to put this at the forefront of everything we do, realigning our entire engineering organization to accelerate innovation and better serve the needs of customers and partners.","With that as a backdrop, I want to highlight key areas of innovation and growth across our customer solutions. Creating a modern workplace where people can do their best work requires the right culture and the right technology. Microsoft 365 helps every organization empower their employees with AI-backed tools that unlock creativity, increase teamwork and fuel innovation, all the while ensuring compliance and protecting data from new cyber threats.","Microsoft is a clear leader in cloud security. Advanced AI reasons over hundreds of billions of signals each month to identify anomalies, automate detection and help customers respond to cyber threats. Just last week, we announced new value for customers, Microsoft Secure Score, Attack Simulator and Windows Defender ATP automatic detection and remediation capabilities, as well as a new open API for the Intelligent Security Graph.","We've also built compliance capability directly into our cloud services. Thousands of organizations are using the recently launched Compliance Manager with new information protection scanner and built-in classification capability to help prepare for GDPR. Our comprehensive approach and proactive protection are one reason Coca-Cola chose Microsoft cloud for their digital transformation.","One year in, Teams has rapidly become the hub for teamwork. More than 200,000 organizations in 181 markets use Teams from Maersk to General Motors. Teams is now enabled for a broad spectrum of calling and meeting room devices. We're also building AI-powered services into Teams. We've integrated Microsoft Stream, our enterprise video service, into Teams for transcription and time coding of recorded meetings.","We've added new facial recognition capabilities, which will attribute remarks to specific meeting attendees. And we are adding new Cortana capability to make calls, join a meeting or initiate three-way calling just using your voice.","All this innovation is driving customer usage. Windows 10 continues to gain traction in the enterprise, with Windows 10 commercial monthly active devices up 79% year-over-year. Office 365 commercial now has more than 135 million monthly active users, and Office 365 consumer subscribers increased to 30.6 million.","Now I'll turn to LinkedIn and business applications. From the start, we recognized the opportunity for LinkedIn and Microsoft to combine forces to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce and enable professionals to be more productive and successful. A little over one year in, we feel great about the value we are delivering for members, customers and shareholders","Our integration model has enabled LinkedIn to accelerate growth, while retaining its member-first ethos. Results are ahead of expectations across all lines of business with revenue growth of 37% year-over-year. We saw record levels of engagement again this quarter with sessions growth of more than 30% year-over-year, driven by innovation across the platform. This increased engagement is driving strong demand for sponsored content and marketing solutions and record levels of job postings and job visitors again this quarter in Talent Solutions.","Shifting to business applications. Dynamics 365 is gaining traction as our third commercial cloud growth engine, up 65% this quarter. We unleashed a wave of AI innovation in Dynamics with hundreds of new capabilities to transform sales and automate marketing, with Office 365 embedded inside Dynamics for productivity.","Relationship analytics for sales and marketing leverage the Microsoft Graph and data from social networks to improve customer relationships, and predictive lead scoring helps sellers identify and focus on high-quality leads.","We're investing in our business applications platform capabilities across Power BI, PowerApps, Flow and a common data model. Now customers can extend Dynamics 365 and Office 365 and quickly build applications using data from across the organization as well as third-party data with minimal custom code.","The new power platform enables customers like Inter Cars, a leading European auto parts company, to go from paper to digitized workflows within days versus months. With the rapid growth of Power BI, we are now the leader in business analytics in the cloud.","Now I'll turn to infrastructure and AI platforms. Our architectural advantage of a consistent stack from the cloud to the edge is resonating with customers, with Azure revenue growth of 93% this quarter. Recent CIO surveys affirm our leadership position in hybrid, developer productivity, trusted security and compliance and new workloads such as IoT and AI at the edge.","We have made the right investment decisions and they're having an impact, increasing our overall share in an expanding market. Our recent data center expansion, including the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland, brings our total number of regions to 50, more than any other cloud provider, and the additional availability zones provide the most comprehensive resiliency in the industry.","We also continue to see strong customer demand for Azure Stack across industries, and its unlocking new workload scenarios across hybrid and edge. Industrial IoT is transforming the rules of manufacturing, fueling cloud and edge innovation, accelerating the evolution of digital factories and enhancing supply chain performance. Azure IoT and Azure Stack enable customers and partners to build industrial IoT solutions that run at the edge, so operators on the factory floor can manage devices and analyze data in real-time. And HoloLens is quickly becoming an indispensable tool as we take digital twin technology to the next level.","We're also innovating in silicon to help customers realize the promise of a connected world of devices and things. Our just announced Azure Sphere is a first of its kind highly secure edge solution that combines chip design and IoT operating system and a cloud service to secure more than 9 billion microcontroller-powered devices entering the market each year.","And we're already seeing rapid customer adoption of IoT scenarios. Toyota Material Handling in Europe is using Azure as well as HoloLens to create a factory of the future. Using AI, drones learn complex processes to automate the flow of a factory, increasing supply chain and warehouse efficiency. And Microsoft and ABB are partnering to push the boundaries of smart manufacturing for industrial automation.","We're investing to make Azure the best cloud for enterprise data estates. In less than a year, Azure Cosmos DB, the first globally distributed multimodal and multi-model database, exceeded $100 million in annualized revenue. Azure database for MySQL and PostgreSQL makes it even easier to bring open source powered applications to Azure, expanding our opportunity in this space. We are seeing a rapid adoption of Azure Databricks for data preparation, advanced analytics and machine learning scenarios.","We continue to innovate to democratize AI. More than 1 million developers have already used Cognitive Services to quickly and easily create AI applications, and we have more services than any other cloud provider. Our Azure Bot Service has nearly 300,000 developers, up more than 150% year-over-year. Microsoft Translator brings AI-powered translation to developers where their data is, whether it's in the cloud or on the edge.","And just last month, we reached human parity in language translation, a new milestone in addition to our previous human parity achievements in object recognition, speech recognition and machine reading comprehension.","We're also gaining traction in machine learning tools adoption with tens of thousands of customers using Azure ML. Finally, we are innovating with new GPU and FPGA-based offerings to lead in AI infrastructure for both training and inference. I'm excited to share more about our cloud and AI innovation at our developer conference next month at Build.","Now, to gaming. We continue to pursue our expansive opportunity in gaming from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed. We had one of the best quarters in gaming with strong revenue performance and record levels of engagement. Software and services revenue grew 24% as we continued to attract, retain and deepen user relationships across Xbox Live, Game Pass and Mixer.","Xbox Live monthly active users grew to 59 million, up 13%. Our new first-party game, Sea of Thieves, drove gameplay across Windows 10 and Xbox One in addition to nearly 10 million hours of viewing on services like Mixer in its very first week.","Our results speak to the strength of our platform and services for both first-party and third-party experiences. And we'll continue to invest in our platform, enhancing our cloud services with AI capabilities for developers to quickly build and monetize games across PC, console and mobile.","In closing, intelligent cloud and intelligent edge represents a tremendous opportunity for our customers. It comes with a responsibility to ensure trust in technology. We are working to instill this trust in three key areas. The first is privacy. We recognize that privacy is a fundamental human right, and we have consistently acted accordingly.","Our success is grounded in our customers' success. We have been working towards the May 25th GDPR implementation date since 2016 with hundreds of engineers across the company working on end-to-end privacy architecture, and we'll ensure that all our products and services are GDPR compliant.","For customers, we will provide robust tools backed by our contractual commitments to help them comply with GDPR. In fact, for most customers it will be more effective and less costly to host their data in Microsoft's GDPR-compliant cloud than to develop and maintain GDPR compliance tools themselves.","Second, cybersecurity. In response to escalating cyber attacks around the world, we are leading a bold initiative to defend and protect our customers. We recently led a coalition of 34 global technology and security companies in signing the Cybersecurity Tech Accord. The accord is an important first step by the industry to help create a safer and more secure online environment for everyone.","Finally, we recently established the AI and Ethics in Engineering and Research Committee at Microsoft to ensure we always advance AI in an ethical and responsible way to benefit our customers and the broader society. This includes new investments in technology to detect and address bias in AI systems. Microsoft stands for trust, and this will continue to be a differentiating focus for us moving forward.","With that, I'll hand it over to Amy to cover our financial results in more detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining for your questions.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter revenue was $26.8 billion, up 16% and 13% in constant currency, with better than expected performance across all segments. Gross margin increased 16% and 13% in constant currency. Operating income increased 23% and 20% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $0.95, increasing 36% and 31% in constant currency.","From a geographic perspective, we saw broad-based strength across markets of all sizes, benefiting from the positive global corporate IT spend environment. Growth in cloud services increased our commercial annuity mix, up 2 points year-over-year to 89%. Along with healthy renewals, our sales teams and partners drove a higher volume of new business, leading to commercial bookings growth of 26% and 18% in constant currency. Commercial unearned came in slightly above our expectations due to FX, growing 20% and 17% in constant currency.","Commercial cloud revenue was $6 billion, increasing 58% and 55% in constant currency, highlighted by healthy growth in the U.S., Western Europe and the UK. We again improved commercial cloud gross margin, now at 57%, up 6 points, with improvement in each cloud service, most notably Azure.","We outperformed our expectation on company gross margin, finishing the quarter at 65%. We are up slightly year-over-year with improvement in our Productivity and Business Processes segment from Office 365 commercial and LinkedIn, offset by a decline in our intelligent cloud segment, driven by a greater mix of Azure revenue.","FX positively impacted revenue growth by 1 point more than expected, 3 points at the company and Productivity and Business Processes level and 2 points on both intelligent cloud and More Personal Computing. FX added 2 points of growth to COGS and operating expenses, 1 point more than expected.","Operating expenses grew 10% and 8% in constant currency as we continued to invest in commercial sales capacity, cloud engineering, and LinkedIn. Even with this accelerated pace of spend, we increased operating margin 2 points year-over-year, a direct result of our focused investments to drive top line growth.","Now, to the segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was approximately $9 billion, increasing 17% and 14% in constant currency, with better than expected results from Office 365 commercial and LinkedIn.","Office commercial revenue grew double digits again this quarter, up 14% and 12% in constant currency, including a couple points from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 42% and 40% in constant currency, with continued installed base growth and ARPU expansion driven by customer migration to our premium workloads in E3 and E5. Office 365 commercial seats grew 28%, in line with the expected trend, given the increasing size of the installed base.","Office consumer revenue increased 12% and 9% in constant currency, driven by recurring subscription revenue and a growing overall installed base. Our Dynamics business accelerated this quarter, growing 17% and 14% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 65%, 62% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue grew 37% and 33% in constant currency, with more than $1.3 billion in revenue.","We continued to see outperformance across all segments, with record levels of engagement. Segment gross margin dollars increased 18% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased with margin improvements in Office 365 commercial and LinkedIn offsetting the increased mix of cloud revenue. Operating expenses grew 14% and 12% in constant currency as we continued to strategically invest in LinkedIn commercial sales capacity and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 23% and 19% in constant currency.","The intelligent cloud segment delivered $7.9 billion of revenue, increasing 17% and 15% in constant currency, exceeding expectations due to our on-premises server business.","Server products and cloud services revenue grew 20% and 17% in constant currency to $6.3 billion, driven by continued strong Azure revenue growth of 93%, 89% in constant currency on a significant revenue base.","Our on-premises server business grew 3% and 1% in constant currency, driven by customer demand for hybrid solutions as well as increasing virtualization needs, resulting in the uptake of premium versions.","Enterprise Services revenue increased 8% and 5% in constant currency, with growth in premium support services and Microsoft Consulting Services more than offsetting the continued decline in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003.","Segment gross margin dollars grew 16% and 14% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage declined with the growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue mostly offset by another quarter of material improvement in Azure gross margin.","Operating expenses increased 9% and 7% in constant currency, driven by our continued investment in sales capacity and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 24%, up 21% in constant currency.","Now to the results of More Personal Computing. Revenue from the segment was $9.9 billion, up 13% and 11% in constant currency, with significantly better than expected results in gaming, Windows commercial and Surface.","Windows OEM revenue increased 4% this quarter. OEM Pro revenue grew 11%, in line with a strong commercial PC market. We continued to see healthy enterprise demand for Windows 10, benefiting our OEM partners.","OEM non-Pro revenue declined this quarter by 8%, below the consumer PC market, driven by a higher mix of lower-priced licenses and continued pressure in the entry-level price category. Inventory levels were within the normal range.","Windows commercial products and cloud services increased 21% and 17% in constant currency from strong double digit billings as well as a higher mix of in-quarter recognition from multiyear agreements.","The fundamentals of this business remained healthy, with installed base growth and adoption of our security solutions. As a reminder, under Accounting Standard 606, the Windows commercial growth rate will have significant variability quarter-to-quarter due to its relatively high mix of on-premises licensing revenue.","Search revenue ex TAC grew 16% and 14% in constant currency with higher revenue per search and search volume driven by Bing performance in the U.S. and international markets.","Surface revenue grew 32% and 27% in constant currency with better than expected performance from Surface Book as we continued to transition to the latest products in our portfolio and against a prior year comparable impacted by product end-of-lifecycle dynamics.","Gaming revenue increased 18% and 16% in constant currency due to Xbox software and services revenue growth of 24% and 21% in constant currency. Momentum in digital distribution as well as record levels of engagement driven by a third-party title contributed to better than expected software and services revenue.","We grew Xbox Live monthly active users by 13% to 59 million with user expansion across Xbox One, Windows 10 and mobile platforms.","Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 11% in constant currency, in line with revenue growth. Segment gross margin percentage was relatively flat year-on-year. Operating expenses increased 5% and 3% in constant currency from investments in engineering across gaming, search and AI. Operating income grew 24% and 20% in constant currency.","Now back to the total company results. In line with our expectations, we increased capital expenditures on a sequential basis with $3.5 billion invested to support current and future growth of our cloud offerings. Cash paid for plant, property and equipment was $2.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was up 14%, driven by collections from strong billings growth.","Free cash flow of $9.2 billion grew at a slower rate, 3%, due to an increasing cash used for property, plant and equipment. Other income and expenses was approximately $350 million from net recognized gains on investments and income from dividends and interest, partially offset by interest expense. Our effective tax rate came in at 14% due to a benefit from an R&D tax credit.","We returned $6.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, increasing total shareholder return by 37%. We nearly doubled our year-over-year amount buyback, accelerating our pace from the prior quarter and now have roughly $30 billion remaining of our current $40 billion share repurchase authorization.","Now let's turn to next quarter's outlook. First on FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 3 points, COGS by 1 point and operating expenses by 1 point.","Second, we again expect strong performance from our commercial business, with solid execution in our largest quarter of the year. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be up 38% to 39% sequentially.","Third on CapEx. We expect sequential growth in capital expenditures on an accrual dollar basis, as we continue to see strong demand signals globally.","Finally, we expect commercial cloud gross margin to be roughly flat to Q3, representing another quarter of material year-over-year improvement even with increasing Azure revenue mix.","Now to the segments. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $9.55 billion and $9.75 billion. We expect Office commercial growth rates to normalize as we do not expect the same level of in-quarter recognition on multiyear contracts as we saw in Q3. Dynamics should see another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, driven by Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn growth should remain high.","In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $8.95 billion and $9.15 billion, with another quarter of server products and cloud services revenue growth in the high teens as our hybrid cloud leadership continues to be a differentiator for customers. We expect the total Azure revenue growth to reflect the balance of our continued strength in infrastructure, data and application services and a moderating growth in our per user base services like EMS.","In More Personal Computing, we expect $10.3 billion to $10.6 billion. Across both OEM Pro and non-Pro, we anticipate trends in Q3 to continue into Q4. In our devices business, we expect Surface revenue growth in the high teens, as we continue to transition to the latest products in our portfolio. Search ex TAC should see another mid-teens revenue growth quarter as it has the entire year.","In gaming, we expect a higher revenue growth rate than Q3, as we continue to benefit from third-party game title performance and user engagement on our platform. We expect COGS between $9.6 billion and $9.8 billion, including 1 point of growth from FX. We expect operating expenses of $9.8 billion to $9.9 billion, with 1 point of growth from FX. This would place us slightly above the high end of our prior range for the full year operating expense growth due to the impact from FX and incremental revenue-driven expenses that support our continued strong top line growth.","In Q4, we expect other income and expense to be approximately $350 million as we continue to take gains on our equities portfolio and earn dividend and interest income as we have in prior quarters. We expect our effective tax rate in Q4 to be approximately 16%, with some volatility in the final quarter of our fiscal year.","Finally, I want to offer a few early thoughts on FY 2019. Assuming the macro environment remains consistent, many of the key drivers of our business should remain intact. Revenue growth will continue to be driven by the transition to cloud services. And within our commercial business, strong execution and our differentiated hybrid position should drive continued high teens growth in our server product and cloud services revenue KPI.","Office 365, Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn should also continue to drive double-digit revenue growth in our Productivity and Business Processes segment. The gross margin percentage of every commercial cloud service will continue to improve, with more improvement in Azure IaaS and PaaS consumption-based services and less improvement in our per user SaaS services.","While we expect continued improvement in the overall commercial cloud gross margin, the revenue mix shift to Azure will moderate the rate of improvement relative to FY 2018. We will continue to grow our investment and capital expenditures to meet the growing demand for our cloud services.","With the business results we've delivered and the tremendous opportunities we see ahead, we will continue to see growth in operating expenses in key areas we've discussed, including LinkedIn. We expect other income and expenses to be slightly negative in FY 2019 as we don't expect to have any significant equity gains.","And lastly, we continue to expect the full year FY 2019 effective tax rate to be slightly below the new U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%, with variability across the quarters due to the mix of cloud versus license revenue and the timing of equity vests.","And with that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we be will conducting the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you, Satya and Amy. You guys are seeing a really nice acceleration in intelligent cloud gross profit growth. And with 15 straight quarters now of triple-digit premium services growth in Azure, I know you mentioned some comments directionally about the gross margin ramp. But how do we think about the pace of the ramp in gross margin expansion from here for this, for Azure in particular, as you approach what we estimate to be roughly an $8 billion business in annualized revenue? And I guess the other thing that would be helpful is when you think of the COGS of commercial cloud, can you give us a rough ballpark of what percentage of COGS comes from CapEx depreciation? Thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","So maybe I'll start and then I'll have you, Amy, go into sort of the numbers. One of the things, Heather, that's happening is there is growth in Azure across each of the layers. And I think I've said this before. Sometimes, when you have new workloads and new customers onboard, they start with in some sense the IaaS and the data more at Blob storage, but then scale to higher layer services like our Cosmos DB or even some of our compute higher-level services like in AI.","So that I think will continue, because we're still in the early innings of the cloud transition. We're investing aggressively, whether it's on the field side or on the CapEx side to attract more customers and more workloads per customer. So they will have that same profile, which is lower-margin services first, higher-margin services over time. That's just inside of Azure. And of course, you combine that with the rest. One of the things that I think should be fairly clear is the high correlation between our services in Office 365 as well as Dynamics 365 around data in particular with Azure. So that's why we think of this as one cloud play but that should give you a feel for how the customers are looking at it.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And I think to your specific questions, there were a couple in there, Heather. If you think about the portion of our commercial cloud gross margins that come from depreciation, it's best to think of it as roughly half. And actually it's been going up as we began to get scale through these services over time actually. Some of the fixed costs, frankly, even in COGS, tend to come down as a percentage over time. So that should help you roughly to think about how much depreciation is at that number.","Now, if you think about some of the dynamics that we've been going through in the intelligent cloud segment, in particular the way I tend to think about that, as you've seen, we're now 20% growth this quarter in that server and product services KPI, 17% on a constant currency basis, and are sort of confident that you should continue to see that, as I said, into Q4 and then into FY 2019 as well.","I tend to think about that as we'll have significant revenue growth in that segment. We'll have significant gross margin dollar growth in that segment, and you'll actually continue to see operating margin dollar growth that's significant in that segment even as we reinvest into it, given the top line signal.","If you think about gross margins in particular, what you'll see is Azure continuing to be a growing percentage of the total revenue growth. So even with significant improvement again in, what Satya was talking about, some of the lower level IaaS and PaaS services within Azure, on the gross margin side you'll see some gross margin percentage pressure in that segment through 2019, but with significant dollar growth.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Heather. We'll take next question now, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mark Moerdler with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much, and congrats on the quarter. CapEx increased significantly this quarter, $2.9 billion you said in cash on property and equipment. We know that you build out \u2013 you significantly invest in the data center footprint ahead of demand, but you don't build out the equipment itself that far in advance. Is there a large corporate or government requirement or is it the acceleration in the new data centers that ended up causing that lift? Or is there something else driving it? And as a follow-up, how should we think about that for the next couple quarters? Thanks.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Mark. I actually didn't think of it as a significant change in trajectory from what we expected. A year ago, Q3 was actually a little low. So on the year-over-year basis, I think it pops a little bit, Mark, when on really a sequential basis I actually don't think, to me, it looks out of sorts, especially with the type of demand we're seeing, not just for Azure, but across all of the cloud components. Those growth rates really at 58% on that total cloud number, it's pretty good demand signal on a global basis. So I hear you on a year-over-year basis, but Q3 was a little funny a year ago on that front.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","And we continue to really monitor the actual equipment in that supply chain and what have you. And if anything, there's a lot of automation and demand sensing capability we have there.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah. And I would say, Mark, while I appreciate your point that it takes \u2013 and we do build data centers in advance, the majority of the cost obviously in a data center is in the equipment inside. And so, while this really is \u2013 the majority of this spend is servers.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Mark. Operator, can we please move to next question?","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question and really nice quarter across the board. There's really not much to pick on in this quarter. One of the highlights from my perspective was definitely LinkedIn and what seems to be an acceleration in the revenue growth in LinkedIn. So a two-parter here. One, where are we in terms of that acquisition? Is this still just LinkedIn operating better as an independent company or are we starting to see some of the synergies, specifically revenue synergies, come to bear from maybe broader distribution channel that they get from Microsoft or product integration? So have synergies started to kick in, number one?","And number two, given where we are in terms of the M&A process on LinkedIn, what's the appetite for further like large M&A for Microsoft on a going-forward basis?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Keith, for the question. Let me start and then, Amy, you can add to this. First of all, it is very important for us to ensure that we did everything to enable LinkedIn to keep their product and cultural ethos of putting members first and innovating on their behalf. I mean, that was sort of our priority one, two and three. And that's what you see in their sessions growth, engagement growth, their quality member growth. And obviously that all translates into the revenue growth as well across all of the marketing solutions, talent solutions, and sales solutions.","We also, during that one year, done integrations. You see it. I see it every day in my Outlook Mobile. I see it in Sales Navigator and Dynamics. And so, you will see us \u2013 with Windows 10, so you'll see us continue to do these integrations that add value again to both the Microsoft 365 and Dynamics users, as well as LinkedIn members.","And clearly that's increasing engagement as well and that obviously then translates into revenue growth of those business solutions we mentioned. So, yes, revenue synergies are showing up, but mostly because product synergies are showing up, and that's because of the product ethos of LinkedIn around member-first is what we have maintained throughout this integration.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And I would also add, Keith, the LinkedIn team has really done a tremendous job. So let me also say, after a year of working with them closely, my appreciation and, frankly, a lot of inspiration that I think you've seen in our own product development has been their focus on users and how important it is and how focused they are on it.","In some of the products, I would urge people to look at the Outlook Mobile experience and how really meaningful the experience is for the user and the member. And I think sometimes it's harder for us to measure exactly what a revenue synergy means. But I think I look at this and say, at a 37% growth rate, plus some of the integrations we've seen and the growth in uses and users of things like Outlook Mobile, I believe that we're probably a little bit on the front end of the revenue synergies you'll see in product over time.","When it comes to our appetite for M&A, actually it has remained unchanged, which is when things meet our criteria and when we feel like it's in core areas for us, where markets are expanding, where the companies have a unique asset, I think that our ability to both execute on those and see them both execute on their own and execute inside Microsoft, I actually feel quite good that we don't worry about our ability to do them, but I wouldn't say that's new this quarter.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah. And I think just to add on that, which is whether it's Minecraft or LinkedIn or many other acquisitions we've done as part of Azure, I think the key thing that we are very, very focused on is how do we make this culturally accretive, management times accretive as well as revenue. And that's where we are building good muscle and we'll continue on that.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you very much guys.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Keith. We'll take the next question now please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. And just to start, Satya and team congrats on getting Microsoft to over 10% organic growth. That's a big achievement for a company at your scale, and it looks like you're expecting the same for the June quarter, so congrats. So I guess, my question is in the spirit of this, to Amy, on the overall growth margin trade-off as you look into fiscal 2019.","Amy, when I go back to the Analyst Day you had almost a year ago, I left thinking that your messaging was really that you were going to press on revenue growth and not on big margin leverage. So I'm just wondering as we look into fiscal 2019, is it correct to assume that that's a similar framework with the focus on top line growth and not to expect much in the way of overall improvement in gross margins? Thank you.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Karl. Yes, I think that's a fair interpretation of my commentary both last year and this, which really speaks to consistency. I do believe that the market that which we are operating, the set of assets we've picked, the team we've built, the investments we made in our sales force, even some extent the acquisitions we've done, these are all showing up as top line revenue growth for us. You see it this quarter. You see it frankly in the guide. And I think your interpretation that our focus on being a growth company, even at our scale, is certainly the right interpretation.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Karl. Let's please move to the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, Thank you. I'm wondering, maybe a combination of Amy and Satya, talk about the forward kind of view of Azure growth and how we should think about the drivers of that as we go into 2019. New customers existing consumption, premium services and I think we're growing at eye-popping rates right now. We saw that with Office 365 in the early days. How should we expect this business to sort of level out over time as I think it inevitably will as we look to next year?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah and I'll start qualitatively. And it's true that we are at this point at scale on Azure and with very, very high growth rates. But as I said, I think the key things that we think about is differentiation of Azure at each level because that's what is super important for us as we compete in this marketplace and more importantly double down on areas of differentiation we have.","So the first thing is on the infrastructure side itself with the combination of the edge and the cloud I believe between Azure Stack and Azure as well as inclusive of our servers, we have the best crowd platform for what is going to be hybrid computing and we'll continue to push on that, so you'll see growth. It's just got a different margin profile.","The layer above that is the place which we are very excited about. We've seen lots of consecutive quarters of growth in our higher-level services but we're now seeing some good scale. I, for the first time, talked about Cosmos DB. This was actually a database we just launched last year. I mean, I've been around databases for a long time. I've never seen a product that's gotten to this kind of scale this quickly.","And so we're very bullish about what can happen in the higher-level services and we'll continue to build on that piece. But as I said, one of the key things is, architecturally, the way we build Azure, the way we build Office 365, the way we build our gaming cloud and the way we build even Dynamics are all pretty much one architecture.","And you see that even in the way customers use it. So overall to your specific question on Azure, the growth will moderate as the numbers become big, and they've already become very big. But that said, we see plenty of opportunity for total gross margin growth in terms of dollars just because of the number of markets that we participate, in which we by the way, never participated in the old server world.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And, Walter, I think the way you see that show up is really in my conversation on FY 2019, to Satya's point, really we talked about that server product and KPI being high teens through FY 2019. We're really confident in double-digit growth in that PBP segment with the components of Office 365, Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn. So if you think about that as the primary components of our commercial cloud overall, we're certainly saying that it's a big business growing very fast at $6 billion not counting LinkedIn. At 58% growth, it certainly speaks to having a big base and a big growth number.","On Azure, you're right. It will moderate through next year. But because of the scale at which it's operating, that's why you still see that server KPI remain at that high level even as the base grows. And so you will see also some different dynamics within that Azure revenue number. Satya mentioned the layers of Azure. If you think about the IaaS and PaaS numbers, I would expect to be on the higher end of growth rates. And some of the services that are more per-user like, like EMS within the Azure frame, you would expect that growth to moderate somewhat more quickly just because it's a per-seat business.","You will actually over time see us be able to continue to add ARPU and growth in those segments. Think of it almost like an Office business. Internally, we call that component part of our Microsoft 365 Value. That's how we sell it externally even. And so hopefully, that helps give a little context to the number as well as our overall ability to continue to grow the sort of hybrid cloud opportunity high teens.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks Walter. We'll take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey guys, thank you guys for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. Satya, you touched on the synergies that you're seeing between new applications businesses and LinkedIn helping the two out. Wonder if you could talk just sort of high level and strategically about applications and enterprise applications in Azure, and how you kind of see the synergy potentially coming out between those, especially when you think about Azure AI and all the services, or kind of the question is, how important or how critical are applications like the growth that we're seeing in Dynamics, et cetera?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yes, I mean, one of the things that I talked about in my remarks this time was this power platform. One of the areas of in fact real breakout growth in differentiation as being in Power BI, PowerApps and Flow. For the first time in fact, in our own Microsoft history, we have an extensibility model that is the same for Office 365 and Dynamics 365. This has been a dream of mine for, I don't know, for 15 years probably. And we are finally here and we are executing super well.","But the interesting thing is it's not just even for our own SaaS applications. It is the extensibility model for every SaaS application out there, including a common data model. So I think that that's where the synergies lie, because AI starts with having a data estate that can really bring data from all of your applications, silos in some sense, together so that you can start doing, building that analytical power that you can then visualize and put in the hands of people using Power BI or run an AI model that does some prediction that you can deploy in your system, whether it's forecasting, sales lead scoring, what have you.","So that workflow, we have every layer of it. We have the best deployment tools and development tools in Azure. We have this common data model. On top of this, we have the best BI visualization technology. So that's what you're seeing increasingly as the synergy. But most importantly, architectural benefit for customers because by having incoherence around these layers is where you may feel like you're making some great best-of-breed sort of choices in individual layers, but you'll bear that expense in your overall agility as well as your overall management of your data. And that's where I think we will be very differentiated.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great, thanks guys.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks. Let's move to the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Okay, we'll move on to the next question which is coming from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Brad Robert Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thanks very much. Maybe Amy, quick question. The Windows OEM Pro business has been extraordinarily strong the last few quarters. Could you maybe give us a sense of how penetrated you guys are in the Windows 10 corporate upgrade cycle and the sustainability of that growth? Thanks.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks Brad. Let me, first, I wouldn't say penetration is the word for this. Let me talk about this in two or even a couple of components, because when you think about Windows 10, what we've seen over the past couple of years is, you're right, a very strong enterprise deployment cycle and real pull for that product inside enterprises, because of the security value prop of the product itself.","When you see that deployment for security reasons, an externality of that is people often choose to upgrade machines in that process. We've seen good demand inside commercial entities for and when they make those upgrades to buy Windows PCs and often Surface devices, in that choice, I think it's benefited our OEM partners and us. The portfolio of devices that are available are incredibly compelling. I think our partners have done a terrific job on that as well.","The overall economy is certainly also quite good, and the installed base had actually gotten older. And so I think what you're starting to see is a process whereby there's a great product, there's a good macro environment. And you've got customers who really want to move to a modern infrastructure. A modern infrastructure has to both be secure at its very core, and that can result, as you're seeing through that confluence of events, in a very strong PC market with very strong Pro performance. And certainly, the guide for Q4 continues to imply all those factors.","Brad Robert Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Brad. We'll take next question now, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Satya or Amy, can you help us understand the large revenue outperformance and guide for continued strong growth in gaming? And Amy, could you please give us a sense of the margin profile of the areas of gaming that exceeded expectations? And if you could also comment on the strength of the MPC margin in the context of the gaming margin as well, that would be helpful. Thank you very much.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah, I can start and then, yeah.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Why don't you start.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Because even on gaming, very much like how we talk about some of our commercial segments, we've gotten a strategy which sort of really helps us articulate both the growth opportunity as well as our investments across all of the various layers.","So first is, the console itself is the highest engagement console out in the marketplace. So anytime a new game, whether it's first-party or third-party releases, the fact that Xbox is where the best engagement is driven benefits us. So as a platform owner, that's a great growth area for us. But we don't stop there because now we have, whether it's Xbox Live, whether it's Game Pass or Mixer, these are all additional opportunities to really serve the gamer as they play more games or watch games on different platforms. So that's the other big opportunity.","But the last one, which I think is new and is something which is already paying its dividends on the Azure growth side, is we've taken all the knowledge of what it means to build any one of these first-party titles of ours and building it as a PaaS service in Azure for game developers, and the PlayFab acquisition speaks directly to that. So those are all the various levers we have in gaming. And you'll see it in the MPC segment and you'll see it, as I said, increasingly over time even on Azure.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And I think, Michael, if you don't mind, I'm going to expand your question a little bit, because I don't think the increase in the MPC guide is simply gaming. So let me talk a bit about the components and which ones, I think, are a bit more sustainable and which ones may have a temporal nature to them.","The performance in Q3 and the guidance for Q4 shows actually strong performance in a number of places that we expect to continue. OEM Pro is a terrific example, for the reasons I just gave in Brad's question. Windows commercial, which is really the business inside the enterprise of selling much of the security value on a far more annuity-like basis, we've seen strong double-digit billings growth there and we expect that to continue into Q4 as well.","The next piece that I would say is a part of that sort of uplift in Q4 is our Surface device. The reception to Surface Book 2 as well as Surface Pro with LTE has been quite good. And you see us reflect that again in Q4 even as the comparable gets a little bit more difficult than it was in Q3 for us when you saw a very large growth rate. We're still expecting high teens there.","Then you get to that gaming component, and specifically what Satya was talking about, the Xbox software and services component is where I would expect to see the impact of the continuation of Q3. Part of that, I want to be very clear, is consistent even going back a few quarters. That has been a double-digit grower. It will be a double-digit grower. There'll be some volatility in the number like anything else. And third-party hit games will move it higher as they did this quarter, and we're expecting in Q4. But there's also a really strong base to that business that is the result of what Satya's talking about in terms of having a vibrant platform with fans that believe in it and come to it with all the value that's been added.","Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","So did that help? Okay, great. Thanks.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Michael. We'll move to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks so much. Hopefully, the line is clear this time. So Satya and Amy, I wanted to ask about server products which was striking growth this quarter, given the comp. And, Amy, you talked about expected strength into fiscal Q4 and all of that, I guess, is testament to the strength of the kind of hybrid leadership you have. But the two questions though were really, is that strength in server products broad-based across Windows Server, SQL Server, System Center, et cetera? Or is there any sort of bias in the mix, if you will, in terms of what's driving that strength?","And then, Satya, you mentioned Cosmos DB and that was a striking number to me as well. And I was just curious, do you think now you have the multi-model database in market that can help you take market share within the data management database space? Thanks.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I'll take the second one. I think that, yes, I mean, Cosmos DB's pretty unique capability in combination with everything else we do in both the data layer, the AI layer and the infrastructure layer, I think we have a tremendous opportunity, because, as I said, this AI era is mostly first a data era. And that's where I think the opportunity lies.","But to your previous question, even there, there are multiple trends here, and Amy referenced it in her remarks, which is for example, virtualization still continues to be a growth driver of server products. The other growth driver of server products is cybersecurity and the security value in our servers. So that's one.","The fact that we now have SQL and, for example, when you think about SQL itself, it's a hybrid product. You can tier SQL databases with the cloud. SQL is an AI product because we have the one database that actually allows you to write Python and R in situ, store procedures right in your database.","So, for example, when we talk about data and AI close to data, because computation will always go wherever data is. And a lot of data shows up in relational databases and we have a growth driver there as well. And then there is the hybrid choices, where if somebody's building a smart factory, they're now looking and saying, what is the server I deploy in the factory to manage the millions of sensors that are there across the factory. And that's where Azure Stack shows up. So multiple drivers of what is essentially the server and cloud number in combination.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And to your point on the component, the on-prem component, even with comparable doing well, let me break Satya's comment into sort of two drivers that have been actually more sustaining. And it's across both Windows in particular, but also SQL, which are obviously the largest products within our server portfolio.","The first exactly with hybrid demand. We have something called Azure Hybrid Benefits. What it does is really provide confidence to our committed customers buying on-prem servers that their transition to a hybrid, to cloud over a period of their agreement, is really about their choices, their timelines and their confidence. And so, with that right, it lets them easily transition between Windows or SQL to those same benefits in Azure with a small uplift in price. I think that has actually been a core component.","The second one was the virtualization drive or data center modernization, another one, do move the premium mix up a bit. So that's, if you wanted to break it down into two more sustaining things, those are the types of things we're seeing in that number.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Great. Thanks. And this will be our last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Last question will be the longest one; really, really long. Thank you guys for getting me in. A question for you, Satya. As you meet with CEOs of large companies, this is a recurring theme that we've been hearing from other software company CEOs, the theme of digitization. Can you help us to understand, especially given that Microsoft's growth rate is accelerating whereas the GDP growth rate is the GDP growth rate.","So obviously, tech spending or IT spending as a percentage of GDP or average company revenue is going higher. So can you help us, given your perspective, which is pretty unique, help us understand what is the baseline of IT that we've been operating in, when it comes to digital business transformation, what are the phase 1, phase 2, phase 3 initiatives like and where are companies likely to spend more? And what kinds of products and services that are new and upcoming or maybe you sell them today that comprise that incremental swing factor over the baseline of what IT is today versus wherever we're likely to go with the digitization of business processes? Thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah, I mean, I think when we talk to customers and CDOs, CEOs, what have you, we talk about four digital transformational outcomes. In fact, everything that we do across our solution areas are all ingredients to helping our customers achieve digital transformation objectives on, for example, how do they engage their customers. When I talked about Cosmos DB growth, Cosmos DB happens to be one of the best database products to be able to capture the signals that you want around your customers from a variety of different sources. That's gone one example of it.","The second piece is of course around empowering your employees. I mean, one of the things that now has increasingly become a number one priority for every CEO is to make sure that the right tools, the right products are in front of their own employees so that they can do their very best work and collaborate. So teams grow. There's a great example of how companies are modernizing their workforce with things like Microsoft 365.","The third one is operational efficiency. When you see the Dynamics 365 growth or Azure IoT growth, taking every IoT project, it ends up as a field service project, so that's a classic way somebody says, let me sense something, predict something and then actually fix using field service. So that's a transformational outcome where we're very well positioned.","And lastly, people are changing their business models. You take somebody like a Nalco Water. You could say they're a water company, but now they're pure water service company. In other words, they put sensors that allow them to actually deliver a very differentiated business model to their customers. And so that's the transformational outcomes we see. And we feel, at Microsoft, we're well positioned both with the technology but also with our frontline sales capability, service capability and partner capacity to best address the digital transformation needs.","Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Wonderful. It seems like CRM, HCM, ERP, IoT, these are the predominant themes that are going to be driving your growth. Thank you very much. Very useful, insightful.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Kash. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. You can find additional details at the Microsoft Investor Relations website.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, everyone.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Again, we thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect your lines at this time."],"15033":["Microsoft Corp.

Please proceed.","Mike Spencer","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today.","On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Deputy General Counsel.","On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today\u2019s call and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.","All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to growth rate only.","We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Satya.","Satya Nadella","Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining.","We are off to a strong start in fiscal 2020, delivering $33 billion in revenue this quarter. Our Commercial Cloud business continues to grow at scale as we work alongside the world\u2019s leading companies to help them build their own digital capability. Microsoft provides a differentiated technology stack spanning application infrastructure, data and AI, developer tools and services, security and compliance, business process productivity and collaboration. First, each of these areas represents secular, long-term growth opportunities; second, we\u2019re delivering best-in-class innovation and openness in each layer; and third, we offer unparalleled integration and architectural coherence across the entire stack to meet the real world needs of our customers.","Now, I\u2019ll briefly highlight how we\u2019re accelerating our progress in innovation, starting with Azure. Organizations today need a distributed computing fabric to meet their real world operational sovereignty and regulatory needs. This quarter, we opened new data center regions in Germany and Switzerland. And in India, we\u2019re bringing the power of Microsoft Cloud to millions of small businesses through our partnership with Jio, one of the largest mobile carriers in the country. Every Fortune 500 customer today is on a cloud migration journey, and we are making it faster and easier. Just this week, we announced an extensive go-to-market partnership with SAP, making Azure the preferred destination for every SAP customer. And our partnerships with VMware and Oracle also bring these ecosystems to our cloud.","We\u2019re extending beyond the cloud to the edge, enabling customers to get real-time insights where data is generated while ensuring security and privacy. And we\u2019re seeing traction in every industry from Azure Sphere, securely connecting Starbucks coffee machines to Azure Stack, enabling scenarios from smart factories and modern compliant banking to mobile health care in remote areas.","We are reimagining customers\u2019 data estates with the cloud era with new limitless capabilities. Azure SQL database brings hyper-scale capabilities to relational databases, and Azure Cosmos DB, the low-latency high-availability database for globally distributed applications of any data type.","The quintessential characteristic of every application going forward will be AI. And we have the most comprehensive portfolio of AI tools, infrastructure and services. Azure AI now has more than 20,000 customers, and more than 85% of the Fortune 100 companies are using Azure AI in the last 12 months.","In health care, Novartis chose Azure AI to transform how medicines are discovered, developed and commercialized. Nuance will rely on our cloud to power the patient exam room of the future where clinical documentation writes itself. And Humana is using Azure AI to build personalized health care solutions for its more than 10 million members.","We\u2019re also pushing the bounds of how computers and AI can generalize learning beyond narrow domains, collaborating with OpenAI on a supercomputing platform to train and run AI models. I\u2019m excited about our partnership and our collective pursuit to democratize AI, and its benefits for everyone.","Now to developer tools. The rise of digital IP creation in every organization means developers will increasingly drive and influence every business process and function, and GitHub is where they go to learn, share and collaborate. GitHub has grown to more than 40 million developers, up more than 30% since our acquisition a year ago and more than 2 million organizations use GitHub, including the majority of the Fortune 50. At Ford Motor Company alone, 8,000 employees use GitHub to innovate and collaborate with the vast ecosystem of third-party software developers. Our acquisition of semantic code analysis engine, Semmle, this quarter, strengthens our security capabilities, enabling developers to more easily find vulnerabilities in large open source code bases.","Now, let\u2019s turn to our workflow cloud Power Platform. Automating workflows across every function will be key to productivity gains for every organization. We are building Power Platform as the extensibility framework for both, Microsoft 365 inclusive of Microsoft Teams as well as Dynamics 365. It brings together low-code, no-code app development, robotic process automation and self service analytics, enabling everyone in an organization to build an intelligent app or workflow where none exists. Power Platform already has more than 2.5 million monthly active citizen developers. PowerApps helps domain experts, those closest to the business problem to design, build and publish custom apps fast. And 84% of the Fortune 500 have already created power applications.","Now, let\u2019s talk about security. Rising cyber threats and increasing regulation mean security and compliance on a strategic priority for every organization. We have a comprehensive offering across identity, security and compliance spanning people device -- people, devices, apps, developer tools, data and infrastructure to protect customers in today\u2019s zero trust environment. It starts with Azure Active Directory Premium used by more than 100,000 organizations for identity, access management and SaaS application security across heterogeneous environment.","It builds with information protection and cloud security with Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, and now with risk-based vulnerability management. And it extends to Azure Sentinel, now broadly available. Sentinel is a cloud first service that analyzes security signal at massive scale across the entire organization using AI to detect, investigate, and automatically remediate threats. We\u2019ll share more about our expanding opportunity in security at our Ignite Conference in the next few weeks.","Now, on to business applications. Dynamics 365 is the only AI powered business cloud that gives customers a 360-degree view of their business, from marketing and sales to finance and operations to unified data and unlock insights. It enables every level of organization to move from reactive silo transaction processes to proactive, repeatable and predictable business outcomes. This quarter, we introduced Dynamics 365 Commerce, a new omni-channel solution to unify back office, in-store and digital experiences, and deliver personalized content wherever shoppers are.","Dynamics 365 AI insights app ingests data from any first party or third party source, freeing data from systems of record to power modern systems of engagement and intelligence. New, Dynamics 365 Product Insights provides organizations like Ecolab, real time view of how customers are using their products to maximize customer lifetime value. And Dynamics 365 connected store helps retailers like Marks & Spencer analyze observational data to optimize in-store shopping experience.","We\u2019re enabling our customers to bridge the physical and digital business processes with our mixed reality cloud spanning HoloLens 2, Azure mixed reality services, and Dynamics 365 applications. Pharmaceutical company, Patheon, for example, is using Dynamics 365 Guides along with HoloLens 2 to reimagine training for its employees.","Now to LinkedIn. We saw record levels of engagement again this quarter across the platform. Marketing Solutions remains our fastest growing segment, up 44% year-over-year, as marketers leverage our community-based tools to connect with LinkedIn, nearly 660 million members. We continue to innovate across our talent portfolio, including Talent Solutions, Talent Insights, Glint, LinkedIn Learning to help every organization attract, retain and develop best talent. LinkedIn Skills Assessment is a new way for members to showcase their proficiency and become more discoverable to recruiters.","Now, turning to Microsoft 365 and Surface. Earlier this month, we unveiled our broadest Surface lineup to date, including two new dual screen devices coming next year. We are reimagining every layer with how we infuse AI from silicon up to device form factors and the role of operating systems to help people be more productive and creative in a multi-sense, multi-device world. We will continue to invest across form and function to new create categories that benefit our entire OEM ecosystem. And our expanded partnership with Samsung builds on a promise to help people be more productive on any device anywhere, bringing one drive outlook in your phone, and more to new Samsung devices.","Microsoft 365 is the world\u2019s productivity cloud and the only comprehensive solution that empowers everyone from the C suite to first line workers with an integrated secure work -- secure experience on any device. We\u2019re infusing AI across Microsoft 365 to help make work more intuitive and natural. New Presenter Coach and PowerPoint makes anyone a better public speaker, new capabilities in Word enabled professionals to transcribe or record audio files while staying in the flow. Video is more searchable, shareable, and first class within Microsoft 365 with Stream. And new inking capabilities let users create and reply to comments from anywhere, using pen or voice.","Microsoft Teams continues to gain traction, bringing together everything a team needs, chat, voice, meetings, collaboration with the power of office and business process workflow into a single integrated user experience, all with the highest security and compliance. Teams keeps all of your work, conversations and meetings in context, eliminating the need to bounce back and forth between different apps with features like integrated calendaring, one touch to join meetings from your phone, and we are broadening our opportunity with 2 billion firstline workers worldwide, adding priority notifications, role-specific targeted messages, and the ability to clock in and clock out of a shift. Our differentiated offering is driving usage making teams the category leader. More than 350 organizations now have more than 10,000 users of Teams.","More broadly, all this innovation is fueling growth. Office 365 commercial monthly active users surpassed 200 million this quarter. The leading organizations like Cerner, Chevron and the LEGO Group are choosing our premium Microsoft 365 E5 offerings for their advanced security and productivity experiences.","Finally, gaming. In gaming, we\u2019re investing in content, community and cloud services to expand our opportunity with 2 billion gamers worldwide. We saw record Xbox Live monthly active users with strength both on and off console in mobile and PC, and continued growth for Game Pass subscriptions. Gears 5 saw more than 3 million players in its first weekend alone. 10 years in Minecraft is stronger than ever with record revenue and usage, and we are bringing the franchise to new audiences with Minecraft Earth. Finally, just last week, we started trials of Project xCloud, so gamers can play games wherever and whenever they want on any device.","In closing, we are accelerating our innovation across the entire technology stack to deliver new value for customers. We\u2019re investing aggressively in large markets with significant growth potential, and it\u2019s still early days.","With that I\u2019ll hand over to Amy who will call our financial results in detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining for your questions.","Amy Hood","Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone.","This quarter, revenue was $33.1 billion, up 14%, and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 18%, and 20% in constant currency. Operating income increased 27%, and 32% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $1.38, increasing 21%, and 25% in constant currency. Consistent execution and strong demand for our hybrid and cloud offerings drove a solid start to the fiscal year with another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. From a geographic perspective, we saw broad-based strength across all markets.","In our Commercial business, we again saw increased customer commitment across our cloud platform. In Azure, we had material growth in the number of $10 million plus contracts. Additionally, Microsoft 365 drove new customer adoption as well as expansion in our existing customer base, given the strong value Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility and Security provide at a secure intelligence solution. As a result, Commercial bookings growth was ahead of expectations, increasing 30%, and 35% in constant currency, with a higher volume of new business and strong renewal execution. Commercial annuity mix increased to 91% and Commercial unearned revenue was ahead of expectations at $31.1 billion, up 14% and 16% in constant currency. Our Commercial remaining performance obligation was $86 billion, up 26% and 27% in constant currency, driven by these long-term customer commitments.","As a reminder, going forward, we will disclose the Commercial remaining performance obligations as a KPI, which better reflects commitments our customers are making across all contract types. Commercial Cloud revenue was $11.6 billion, growing 36% and 39% in constant currency. Commercial Cloud gross margin percentage increased 4 points year-over-year year to 66%, as significant improvement in Azure gross margin offset a sales mix shift to Azure. Company gross margin percentage was 69%, up 3 points for year-over-year and ahead of our expectations, driven by sales mix to higher margin businesses.","The U.S. dollar was a bit weaker than anticipated, which resulted in slightly less impact to our results. FX reduced revenue growth by less than 2 points, and cogs and operating expenses growth by approximately 1 point. Operating expenses grew 8% to 9% in constant currency, slightly lower than expectations mainly driven by the timing of marketing and project spend. And operating margins expanded this quarter, driven by the combination of higher gross margins and operating leverage through effective resource allocation.","Now, to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $11.1 billion, increasing 13% and 15% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by On-Premises Office Commercial business. Office Commercial revenue grew 13% and 15% in constant currency, and benefited approximately 2 points from the transactional strength in Japan.","Office 365 Commercial revenue growth of 25% and 28% in constant currency was again driven by installed base growth across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU. Office 365 Commercial Seats increased 21% with a growing mix from our Microsoft 365 suite.","Office Consumer revenue grew 5% and 6% in constant currency with roughly 7 points of benefit from transactional strength in Japan, more than offsetting the strong prior year comparable related to the launch of Office 2019. Office 365 consumer subscribers grew to 35.6 million.","Dynamics revenue grew 14% and 16% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 41% and 44% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 25% and 26% in constant currency with continued strength across all businesses. LinkedIn sessions increased 22% as engagement again reached record levels. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 2 points year-over-year as improvements in LinkedIn and Office 365 margins more than offsets an increase in cloud revenue mix.","Operating expenses increased 8% and 9% in constant currency, driven by continued investment in LinkedIn and Cloud Engineering. Operating income increased 23% and 27% in constant currency.","Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $10.8 billion, increasing 27% and 29% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by our on-premises server business. On a significant base, server products and cloud services revenue increased 30% and 33% in constant currency, driven by continued demand from our hybrid value.","Azure revenue increased 59% and 63% in constant currency, with strong growth in our consumption-based business across all customer segments, partially offset by further moderation in our per-user business. Our Enterprise Mobility installed base grew 36% to over 120 million seats, benefiting from the Microsoft 365 suite momentum. And our on-premises server business grew 12% and 14% in constant currency, driven by continued strength across our hybrid and premium offerings, GitHub and roughly 4 points of benefit from the end of support for SQL and Windows Server 2008.","Enterprise Services revenue increased 7% and 8% in constant currency, driven by growth in Premier Support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 27% and 30% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was up slightly as another quarter of material improvement in Azure gross margin was partially offset by a growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue.","Operating expenses increased 22%, driven by ongoing engineering and sales investments and cloud and AI, including GitHub. Operating income grew 33% and 38% in constant currency.","Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $11.1 billion, increasing 4% and 5% in constant currency, ahead of expectations as better than expected performance in our OEM Pro and Windows Commercial businesses, more than offset lower than expected monetization across third-party titles within gaming. In Windows, OEM non-Pro revenue declined 7%, below the consumer PC market, with continued pressure in the entry level category. OEM Pro revenue grew 19%, ahead of the commercial PC market, driven by strong Windows 10 demand and momentum in advance of the Windows 7 end of support. Inventory levels ended the quarter in the normal range.","Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 26% and 29% in constant currency, driven by healthy demand for Microsoft 365, which carries higher in-quarter revenue recognition.","Surface revenue declined 4% and 2% in constant currency, driven by the timing of product lifecycle transitions ahead of the recently announced product launches. Search revenue ex TAC increased 11% and 13% in constant currency, driven by Bing rate growth.","In gaming, revenue declined 7% and 6% in constant currency, driven by lower console sales. Xbox content and services revenue was relatively unchanged and increased 1% in constant currency with growth from Minecraft, Gears of War 5 and Game Pass subscriptions offset by a strong third-party title in the prior year.","Segment gross margin dollars increased 12% and 13% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased 4 points due to higher margin sales mix. Operating expenses declined 7% and 6% in constant currency as redeployment of engineering resources to higher growth opportunities was partially offset by investments in gaming. As a result, operating income grew 28% and 31% in constant currency.","Now, back to total Company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $4.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year, driven by ongoing investment to meet growing demand for our cloud services and slightly below expectations due to normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build out. Cash paid for PP&E was $3.4 billion.","Cash flow from operations was $13.8 billion and increased 1% year-over-year, as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by tax payments related to the Q4 transfer of intangible property. Free cash flow was $10.4 billion and increased 4%. Excluding the impact of these tax payments, cash flow from operations and free cash flow grew 27% and 39%, respectively.","As expected, in other income and expense, interest income was offset by interest expense, foreign currency remeasurement and recognized losses on investments. Our effective tax rate was 16%, in line with expectations. And finally, we returned $7.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 28% year-over-year.","Now, let\u2019s move to our outlook. Assuming current rate remains stable, we expect FX to decrease Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately 2 points, total Company Productivity and Business Processes and More Personal Computing revenue growth by approximately 1 point, and have no impact on total Company COGS and operating expenses growth.","We expect another strong quarter in our commercial business. Demand for our hybrid offerings and cloud services remained strong and capital expenditures will continue to reflect that. Given the normal variability and infrastructure spend timing, we expect Q2 CapEx spend to be down slightly on a sequential basis, but still growing from the prior year. And Commercial Cloud gross margin percentage will continue to improve on a year-over-year basis, even with the continued mix of revenue toward Azure consumption-based services.","Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $11.3 billion and $11.5 billion, driven by double-digit growth across Office Commercial, Dynamics, and LinkedIn. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $11.25 billion and $11.45 billion. In Azure, we expect continued strong growth in our consumption-based business and moderating growth in our per-user business, given the size of the installed base.","Our on-premises server business will be driven by demand for our hybrid and premium solutions, as well as the continued benefit from increased demand ahead of the end of support for Windows Server 2008. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $12.6 million and $13 million. In Windows, overall OEM revenue growth should again be ahead of the PC market as we balance healthy Windows 10 demand and the benefit from the upcoming end of support for Windows 7 with the supply chain\u2019s ability to meet this demand in Q2.","Based on our customer demand signal and prior end of support cycles, we expect some continued momentum past January, end of support deadline. In Windows Commercial, products and cloud services, we expect another strong quarter, benefiting from continued Microsoft 365 momentum.","In Surface, the launch of the latest Surface Pro and Surface laptop devices should drive low double digit revenue growth on a strong prior year comparable. In Search ex TAC, we expect revenue growth similar to Q1. And in gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-20% range driven by lower console sales as we near the end of this generation, as well as the most challenging quarterly comparable and third-party titles from last year.","Now, back to overall Company guidance. We expect COGS of $12.45 billion to $12.65 billion, and operating expenses of $10.8 billion to $10.9 billion. Other income and expense should be approximately $50 million as interest income is partially offset by interest and finance lease expense. And finally, we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be slightly above the full-year rate of 17%.","Now, let me share some additional comments on the full year. At the Company level, we continue to expect double digit revenue and operating income growth, driven by continued momentum in our commercial business. Given our strong first quarter results and the expected sales mix for the remainder of the year, we now expect operating margins to be up slightly year-over-year, even as we continue to invest with significant ambition in high growth areas.","With that, Mike, let\u2019s go to Q&A","Mike Spencer","Thanks, Amy. We\u2019ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect to others on the call, we request the participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Keith Weiss","Excellent. Thank you for taking the question, and very nice quarter. I was hoping to dig in a little bit into the Intelligent Cloud business and what you guys are seeing there from a hybrid perspective. And so, maybe one question for Satya and one for Amy. For Satya, can you talk to us a little bit about sort of how these hybrid engagements are kind of rolling out with the larger customers, how they are contracting from it? And any sense you can give us in terms of in what way do they engage, both kind of the on-premise assets as well as the cloud assets? Because I think the part of the equation is really positively surprising a lot of investors and how well Server & Tools is doing.","And then, maybe for Amy, you could help us understand sort of when we look at Server & Tools up 14% in constant currency, which is well ahead of our expectations, how should we think about the durability of that in terms of what comes from sort of the pull forward of demand ahead of some -- like SQL Server and Windows Server expirations? And what is going to be more durable over time on the back of those pull forwards?","Satya Nadella","Sure, Keith. Thanks for the question. Overall, our approach has always been about this distributed computing fabric or thinking about hybrid as not as some transitory phase, but as a long-term vision for how computing will meet the real world needs. Because if you think about the long-term, compute will migrate to wherever data is getting generated, and increasingly there will be data generated in the real world, where just when you think about the cloud, you have to think about the edge of the cloud as a very first class construct. So, in that context, what we see is a couple of things that you see even in the results today. One is the hybrid benefits. That is increasingly what is getting customers excited about the Azure choice and the fact that they can renew, knowing that they have the flexibility of both the cloud and the edge. That\u2019s definitely driving growth.","Second is we\u2019re also gaining share. When you think about what\u2019s happening even with the edge, some of the -- our data center addition products are very competitive in the marketplace. And so, you see both of those effects. But architecturally, we feel well-placed. In fact at our Ignite Conference, you will see us even take the next leap forward even in terms of how we think about the architecture inclusive of the application models, programming models on what distributed computing looks like going forward. So, we feel well-positioned there.","Amy Hood","And Keith, to your question on sort of durability, we tried to call out the four points that we felt transactionally was due to the end of support, and that\u2019s 4 of the 12 in USD. And so -- but for us, if you step back for a second, the durable trends that Satya just talked about, which is making sure we license in a way that respects this long-term reality of where data and compute will be needed is what we call the hybrid value proposition, and the rights to that of course are inherent in how we report this number. And so, for us, what you\u2019ll see is premium strength, which we saw this quarter in both SQL and Windows because of some of the value proposition of hybrid and of course broad strength as well, when people feel that flexibility to not be constrained by licensing in terms of how they view their estate.","Keith Weiss.","Excellent. That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks, guys.","Mike Spencer","Thanks, Keith. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you so much. This is a question for Amy. I was just wondering, you\u2019ve been saying for a while now that you\u2019re seeing material improvements in Azure gross margins, and that\u2019s obviously hugely benefited Commercial Cloud gross margin. I\u2019m just wondering if you could share with us how much of the improvement is related to the need to maybe expand data centers at a lower clip than you have been, and maybe it\u2019s less depreciation and amortization that\u2019s coming that you\u2019re starting to recognize. How much of it is due to just better capacity utilization? And I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how much longer you\u2019re going to be able to say that for, I guess, and just have you guys been ratcheting up your target gross margins for Azure over the years to where you think they could be, as you look ahead? Thank you.","Amy Hood","Thanks, Heather. Let me start by saying, in general, at the Commercial Cloud gross margin, what you\u2019re seeing is revenue growth that for the past, almost two years has vastly been faster than our capital expenditure growth. So, if you start at the top of the frame, what we\u2019re seeing is overall gross margin improvement across portfolio and improving -- and that comes from a couple of things, which is where you\u2019re getting to on Azure. It comes from structural improvement on sort of cost per unit but it also comes from mix shift of revenue to premium services from being able to sell more SaaS-like services and consumption services or even premium data services that really do have both, more margin but also are quite consistent in terms of their growth, and you see then that represented as improving targets for us. But, I would say in general, Heather, what the team has done has actually delivered on what I think we felt was a five-year roadmap of improving gross margins on a material basis.","Now, as you continue to see the mix shift to the consumption-based Azure services, the overall cloud gross margin will improve at the same rate, and we\u2019ve said that and you\u2019ll continue to see that on a go-forward basis as well. But, we do continue to expect Azure, especially on the consumption side gross margins to improve and they still have room to improve, especially as we start to see some of these premium services both being made available and being utilized at higher rates.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you.","Mike Spencer","Thanks, Heather. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Karl Keirstead","Thank you. Amy, question for you. When I look at your next quarter guidance by revenue segment, it seems to equate to an overall revenue growth rate, assuming the midpoint of about 9% to 10%. So, when I combine that with the 14% growth you just put up in Q1, it implies that in the second half overall Microsoft revenue growth should remain roughly in the 10% ZIP code to enable you to get to double-digit growth for the full year, despite the fact that you\u2019re moving past some fairly key end of support milestones. I think, some of us were expecting a little bit more of a first half, second half delta. So, I just wanted to ask you what are the maybe one or two or three drivers that enable you to sustain that growth rate in the second half, and if it\u2019s fair to assume that your guidance doesn\u2019t really reflect any deterioration in the overall spending environment? Thanks a lot.","Amy Hood","Yes. I think, in general, Karl, a couple of things I would point to, or many of the things I talked about in the comments that we prepared. Overall, Q1 was a very strong start commercially from a bookings perspective with some very strong trends across the board. Whether it is in both the absolute size and number of the Azure commitments that we\u2019re seeing, the consistency we\u2019re seeing in the consumption growth rates of Azure, the commitments we\u2019re seeing to Microsoft 365, some of the signs we\u2019re seeing across our Dynamics, the Power Platform, the workflow cloud that Satya referred to and LinkedIn, it\u2019s a good bookings quarter, a good execution quarter on overall contracting value. Renewals were good, recapture rates were good, and new business was good.","So, with that confidence, some of those same trends that we had talked about, of course show up through the year. And we\u2019ve tried to be consistent in that, while end of support will make for points here and there each quarter, the more sustainable trends are the fact that our Commercial Cloud overall offers significant value and differentiation to customers, and they are making longer term commitments, and we continue to grow ARPU.","So, when I think about sort of some of the seasonality that you\u2019re talking about, Q2, I thought we were -- I wanted to be clear that that\u2019s really a gaming challenge in Q2. And you see that reflected in the margins in Q2 being significantly better than they were last Q2. And if you think about H2, I do expect Surface will have some easier comparables in H2 and a new portfolio to grow from. So, I think that\u2019s another change you\u2019ll see in trajectory in H2 as well.","Karl Keirstead","Terrific. Thank you, Amy.","Mike Spencer","Thanks, Karl. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you, and congrats on the quarter. AI is obviously a large focus; it was a large driver of Intelligent Cloud OpEx spending growth this quarter. Satya, can you give us some more color on where you see Microsoft on the AI journey? And, Amy, is this investing way ahead of revenue, or is AI already driving big revenue for Azure, how should we think about it? I appreciate it. Thanks.","Satya Nadella","Thanks, Mark. It\u2019s a great question, because we look at what\u2019s happening with AI having 2 dimensions to it. One is, I would say just our own use of AI as first-party SaaS applications. There are some phenomenal breakthroughs when you see new transcription features or new computer vision features that come with HoloLens. All of these are being driven by new AI capabilities that are all by the way powered by the same cloud infrastructure. We all build everything at Microsoft with first party equals third party with Azure as the core platform. And so what you see us is in fact using our own SaaS applications and consumer innovation even to drive the high end AI capability, but then bringing the best-in-class tooling for enterprise customers. So, for example, like we have innovated even in, what does DevOps look like for the machine learning age? That\u2019s a unique capability that\u2019s there in Azure ML. And those are the types of innovations that are even driving the projects that our enterprise customers have on Azure. So, you will see us leverage our overall spend, whether it\u2019s CapEx or OpEx across all of what Microsoft does and then surface them in I think what is perhaps the best way to get traction in the enterprise market, which is great tooling, compliance, security. And that\u2019s a place where we\u2019re making good progress.","Amy Hood","And so, for me Mark, it\u2019s a little bit hard for me to say, gosh, we invest in AI here and you\u2019ll see it specifically here. What I think, you heard through Satya\u2019s commentary is actually AI woven through every layer and component of the entire tech stack, and how important that is, whether you\u2019re participating at the Dynamics 365 layer with Insights or whether you\u2019re using components, like some of our customers are maybe for a natural interaction work. And so, for me, it is almost fundamental to see that cost and investment, because you\u2019ll see it in margin and usage, and frankly product differentiation that we can provide versus our competitors.","Mark Moerdler","Excellent. I really appreciate it. Thank you.","Mike Spencer","Thanks, Mark. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Brent Thill","Thanks. Amy, there\u2019s been a lot of macro concern among tech investors, given some of the peers in your group have seen some weakness. It doesn\u2019t seem that you have seen anything. But, I\u2019m curious if you could just comment on what you\u2019re seeing from a demand perspective.","Amy Hood","Thanks, Brent. What I would say is for us, it has been so important to remain focused on where growth and opportunity exist, and to invest in those areas that are large, expansive and durable TAM. And I think, when you think about where we spend our time both building products, investing in marketing, investing in sales capability and technical capability, it has been in many, if not all, of those places. So, when I look and say, where is our execution or how do I think about our ability to execute in a macro environment, for me, it is about investing in the right places, executing in a great way, remaining focused on the transition, our customers need us to help them through to create their own opportunity and their own growth. And I think, we\u2019ve done a nice job of being invested in the right places. Satya mentioned a few of them on the call, but there are really many. If you think about security, compliance, communication, workflow, business process reinvention, the list can go on and on where I feel like we have set up a multiyear journey to be well-positioned. And I tend to think of every quarter, every year as an opportunity to continue to differentiate, invest in innovation, and execute well to take share. And so, that\u2019s I think how I\u2019ve approached that.","Satya Nadella","And I think, that\u2019s probably the unifying theme quite frankly of all the questions so far, which is what\u2019s next. What\u2019s next for us is in the apps and infra go from perhaps first innings to second innings; for data and AI to start the first innings. When it comes to security, compliance, we never participated in this. Guess what, we get to participate in a fairly competitive way now. We\u2019ve built, something that didn\u2019t even exist a few years ago, which is the workflow cloud. That\u2019s a huge opportunity for us. Biz apps, we are a very competitive and growing footprint. Even when you think about something like Microsoft 365, we never participated, in spite of our past success with all the first-line work, and now we get to participate in it. So, I see long-term secular growth opportunities and we are going to stay focused on making sure our innovation is competitive in all those layers we talked about.","Brent Thill","Thank you.","Mike Spencer","Thanks, Brent. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Phil Winslow","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on another really impressive quarter. Satya, I want to focus on the strategic announcements you talked about earlier in the call, the Oracle, VMware and obviously the most recent one with SAP. Wondering if you would just walk us through the sort of the strategic thoughts behind these. And then, also, especially with VMware and Oracle, since those are out there obviously longer, what\u2019s the feedback from customers been? And then, I guess, to Amy, how do you think about sort of these big strategic differences [ph] this year actually showing up in the numbers?","Satya Nadella","Sure. Phil, thanks. So, overall, I think, this is again one of those things where in the past we participated in the infrastructure business, but we had a fairly narrow footprint, which is we had our own infrastructure that supported primarily our databases and our operating systems. Whereas with the migration to the cloud, customers are looking for us to be a provider of all their infrastructure needs, which is heterogeneous. And that\u2019s what has really led us at the infrastructure layer to have partnerships with VMware and Oracle. We, as you know, have first-class support for Windows and Linux, Java and .NET, Postgres and SQL, VMware, Red Hat as well as obviously Windows hypervisor. So, I feel that we now have that ability to be able to take the entire infrastructure estate, the entire data estate and really add value with these partnerships. And SAP represents the same because SAP has got both infrastructure, we now are the preferred cloud. So, I think, it\u2019s a fairly no-brainer for any customer who is an SAP customer who wants to accelerate their migration to the cloud and innovation from SAP and us that they should move to Azure. And that\u2019s what this announcement was all about. And so, we\u2019re really looking forward to essentially executing on that strategy and that customer need that we see very clearly.","Amy Hood","And Phil, to your question on where would we see this. You\u2019d actually see it in a couple of places, not just in Azure, which may in fact be the most logical extension. But, at the heart of this is making it easier, faster and more reliable for us to help customers move their estate to the cloud and to migrate that with confidence. And so, when we do that, it\u2019s about becoming a committed partner. And you actually see that in broader Microsoft Cloud results whether that\u2019s helping even through these partnerships to be able and get closer to Tier 1 workloads, business process changes. And so, I actually think these are quite important for us to continue to make sure the first goal is customer centric, which is why we continue to move in this direction.","Mike Spencer","Thanks, Phil. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Please proceed.","Jennifer Lowe","Great. Thank you. I think, this is probably an Amy question. As I sort of parse through the Dynamics within Office 365 and through the discussion around sustainability of double-digit growth within the Commercial segment, we\u2019ve seen seat count decelerate, also the uplift on pricing maybe isn\u2019t as much as quarter as we saw in the past, which leads me to believe that there you are seeing a lot of success in the frontline worker piece and maybe that\u2019s a bigger driver of the seat count from here. But, can you just -- and at the same time you\u2019re seeing strong uptake of the premium SKUs as well. But, as we think about seat count going forward, how much opportunity is there still left on the migration front of commercial licenses versus leaning a bit more on things like frontline worker to sustain that growth? And is there a point where potentially the seat growth and things like frontline could start to eat further into your ability to continue to lift ARPU on the base you already have?","Amy Hood","Thanks, Jen. Let me break this question apart, because you are actually asking important dynamics that I don\u2019t always think of as trade-off. And so, I want to make that more clear in my answer. First, to your question on seat growth. We have room, even beyond just first-line workers, whether that is our ability in small and mid-sized businesses, on a global basis with mobile first workers, this is a very broad opportunity for us to reach people, trying to accomplish tasks and do their work on devices of any size. And so, there is significant room for us to continue to make progress on that front.","Now, could that end up with some ARPU pressure long term? It certainly could. But, the important for me -- I don\u2019t think of that as being necessarily a negative. We used to really make no money through the seats that we just talked about. And so, every dollar or multiple dollars or many dollars earned on those new seats is all new revenue, new opportunity and new socket for us. Let me separate that from the next dynamic, which is why sort of an average number may not be the best indication, which is our ability to continue to move people to higher value SKUs, whether that\u2019s through the addition of really compelling things in security or compliance or communications or collaboration or knowledge or learning, where we can add value. Whether we call that E5 or E3, we have room in that transition as well and new opportunity in a way that I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve seen that. I feel very optimistic about M 365 -- I\u2019m sorry, Microsoft 365 and our ability to continue to add value. So, hopefully that helps, Jen.","Jennifer Lowe","Yes. That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Mike Spencer","Thanks, Jen. Operator, we\u2019ll take our last question now, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.","Raimo Lenschow","Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. Quick question on Azure. If I look at the SAP announcements, but you had some other industry announcements out there smell like Humana, et cetera. Like, how do I have to think about the progress you guys are making there in terms of getting more into the different industries and to kind of create deeper relationships around Azure evolving and just doing kind of simple infrastructure outsourcing? Thank you.","Satya Nadella","Yes. It\u2019s a very deliberate strategy that we have. In meeting our customers\u2019 needs, we need to have the partners they already work with and want to work with also on our platform. So, it starts sometimes with the customers, whether it\u2019s Humana or Walgreens or Walmart and others. It also starts with partners like Nuance, which is another one that we announced recently. And so, the idea is for us to be really ensuring that by every industry we have the right marquee customers as well as the partners and have strong go to markets. One of the things that everyone I think in the marketplace understands is Microsoft for especially from a partner perspective is a great route to market. We have a platform directly with our sales force, as well as our channel, that is very attractive to third-party developers to get on Azure, and they realize those benefits. And in fact, our customers rely on that as also as a benefit because it helps them get the best value from their partners as well.","Mike Spencer","Thanks, Raimo. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today\u2019s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.","Amy Hood","Thank you.","Satya Nadella","Thank you, all.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Bill Koefoed, General Manager, Investor Relations. Bill, you may begin.","Bill Koefoed","Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. As usual, with me today are Peter Klein, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel.","On our website is our financial summary slide deck, which is intended to follow our prepared remarks and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. This information is available at microsoft.com\/investor.","As a reminder, we will post today's prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and any future use of the recording.

These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","Okay, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.","Peter S. Klein","Thanks, Bill, and thanks everyone for joining us. I'm pleased with our performance this quarter. Despite a challenging PC market, we delivered solid financial results. We saw a strong demand for our business products and services and had a record holiday season, driven by the unique entertainment experience we have built with Xbox 360.","This quarter, the strength of our product portfolio enabled us to grow revenue 5% to $20.9 billion. Combined with our ongoing operating expense discipline, even as we prepare for a big launch year, we delivered record earnings per share of $0.78. ","Similar to prior periods, we saw a broad-based growth across geographies, with particular strength in emerging markets. Within our segments, the Microsoft Business Division had another good quarter as businesses and consumers around the world look to Microsoft to meet their productivity needs. Six quarters post-launch, Office 2010 continues to exceed our expectation, with increased consumer and business PC Attach worldwide. ","We saw double-digit revenue growth across our key business application workloads, including Exchange, SharePoint, Lync and Dynamics CRM and ERP. As businesses large and small look to the cloud to lower costs and enable new ways of supporting a distributed workforce, they are turning to Microsoft. With Office 365, we give customers powerful productivity and collaboration tools at great value. Today, more than 100,000 businesses have made the commitment to our Online Services. Whether on-premise or in the cloud, Microsoft remains the top choice for productivity. ","The Server & Tools Business delivered another strong quarter, as we continue to execute on our strategy of cloud optimizing every business. CIOs are increasingly turning to our business infrastructure offerings, including Windows Server, Hyper-V and System Center as they look to Microsoft for the security, flexibility and manageability they need to build world-class private clouds. This quarter marked the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for Windows Server Premium revenue and the 11th quarter of double-digit revenue growth for System Center. ","On the data platform, we remain the worldwide unit share leader with SQL Server. Consistent with our strategy, we are growing our revenue share with marquee customer wins on mission-critical workloads and business intelligence capabilities.","This year, we will bring to market the next generation of our server offerings, including Windows Server 8, SQL Server 2012 and System Center 2012, which deepen and broaden our platform for the private cloud. Combined with the power of Windows Azure for the public cloud, our offerings give enterprises the identity, virtualization, application development and management tools they need to efficiently progress into the new era of hybrid IT.","The PC market was challenged this quarter, with particular softness in the consumer segment. However, Windows 7 momentum in the enterprise continued and today, over 1\/3 of enterprise desktops worldwide are on Windows 7. And with the future release of Windows 8, we believe the ecosystem will benefit from the new range of capabilities and scenarios that it enables.","In Search, we saw improvements in RPS this quarter as we partnered closely with Yahoo! to address the monetization challenges of the combined ad platform. We are pleased with the progress and are working hard to continue that trajectory.","In the years since Windows Phone launch, we have worked diligently alongside our partners, including Nokia, to bring a differentiated experience to the mobile platform. Earlier this month at the Consumer Electronics Show, we showcased the latest innovation in Windows Phone to very positive reviews. With these new devices, we are increasing the choices for consumers around the world to find a Windows Phone that is exactly right for them.","As I mentioned, Xbox 360 had a record holiday season as we continue to differentiate home entertainment. Whether it's using Bing Voice Search on Xbox to quickly find the movies and shows you want to watch or enabling more interactive TV as we demonstrated at CES with Sesame Street and Elmo, Xbox and Kinect are bringing together our technologies to redefine the living room experience. Beyond gaming and entertainment, with the Kinect for Windows program which launches February 1, our technology will further innovation and creativity across industries.","During the quarter, we started the integration of Skype's world-class communication products and global network platform into our portfolio of products and services. While it is still early, we are excited by the momentum we have seen thus far and by the opportunities to redefine social and real-time communications for consumers and businesses around the world.","As I have consistently mentioned, operating expense management is a priority for Microsoft. Reflecting our ongoing discipline and prioritization of investments, operating expenses grew just 4% this quarter.","In summary, we delivered solid financial results despite a challenging PC market. The strength of our product portfolio drove solid top line growth, we delivered record earnings per share and we are well positioned for future growth. ","With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on our results.","Bill Koefoed","Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results, and then I'll move on to the details by business segment. Revenue for the quarter was a record $20.9 billion, up 5% or $900 million year-over-year. Operating income was $8 billion, cash flow from operations was $5.9 billion and earnings per share was $0.78. Foreign exchange did not materially impact our net income this quarter.","Enterprise demand remains strong as our customers continue to add both product and seats to their Enterprise Agreement, and our renewal rates remain solid. At the end of the quarter, unearned revenue was $15.3 billion, and our contracted not billed balance was approximately $19 billion.","Turning to the PC market, as I mentioned last week, it was a challenging quarter for the industry. Factors such as the flooding in Thailand, macroeconomic uncertainty and competing form factors resulted in an overall market that we estimate declined 2% to 4%.","In the PC market, it appears that the impact of the hard drive supply chain constraints were not limited to a specific region or OEM type. While absolute volumes were impacted, we did see the following trends continue: PC sales to emerging markets outpaced developed markets; the business PC refresh cycle continued with business PC growth of 2%; the decline of netbooks negatively impacted consumer PCs which were down 6%. Netbooks, which a year ago represented about 8% of the PC market, now represents only 2%. Excluding netbooks, consumer PCs grew 2%. ","Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live Division, where revenue was down 6%. As usual, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. The primary differences between the PC market and Windows revenue were the continuing growth of emerging markets faster than developed markets and inventory drawdown from the prior quarter. ","We have now sold 525 million Windows 7 licenses since launch. And as Peter mentioned, we are seeing sustained momentum on enterprise deployments. In December, we announced that Windows 8 beta would be available in late February, and we also previewed the Windows Store, which will be the hub where users can discover and download applications. For developers, the Windows Store represents a significant opportunity given its broad reach, flexibility and favorable economic terms.","Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division, where revenue grew 3%. Recall in Q2 last year that we recognized $224 million of revenue for the Office 2010 Technology Guarantee Program. And if you exclude that, revenue grew 7% for the quarter. ","Consumer revenue declined 17% year-over-year and declined 2% when factoring in the impact of the Technology Guarantee Program that I just mentioned. The outperformance relative to the overall PC market was driven by Attach games, which continued despite being 18 months since the launch of Office 2010.","Business revenue grew 9%. And within Business, multiyear licensing revenue grew 12% and transactional revenue grew 3%, driven by strong Attach worldwide.","We continue to see strong growth in our productivity solution offerings. Lync, SharePoint and Exchange each grew double digits. We've previously shared with you the opportunity that we see for unified communications, and we are beginning to realize that potential. Lync revenue grew over 30% as customers such as Volkswagen and LA Fitness chose Microsoft to be their voice and video solution.","This quarter, Office 365 became this first major cloud provider to comply with leading EU and U.S. standards for data protection. Meeting these high standards enables businesses to more fully realize the potential of the cloud. We also had our first major service enhancement to Office 365, which extends the company's next-generation cloud productivity service to reach businesses in 22 additional markets. ","During the quarter, companies such as JetBlue, Campbell Soup, Patagonia and Wunderman chose Office 365 to enable their employees and customers to work together in the cloud. We are also pleased with the momentum and cloud services for education, where we now have more than 22 million users, a 100% increase over the prior year.","Our Dynamics business continued its momentum, where revenue grew double digits both in CRM and ERP. Dynamics CRM revenue grew over 30%. Dynamics CRM had important competitive wins this quarter against Salesforce.com and Oracle, such as Safety-Kleen Systems and the American Heart Association. The common theme among switchers was that Dynamics CRM has a familiar user interface, which improves productivity while delivering lower operating costs than the competition. ","Now let's move on to Server & Tools where revenue grew 11%, driven by multiyear license revenue that was up mid-teens in Enterprise Services. We saw broad-based strength across our products. In our data platform business, SQL Server grew low double-digits, outpacing industry growth due to the strength of our premium edition. This quarter, we saw competitive database wins against Oracle such as U.K.-based retailer, The Co-operative Group, which switched to SQL Server because of its advantages in business intelligence, security, flexibility and cost. We also saw a strong market anticipation for SQL Server 2012 with over 100,000 downloads in the 2 months since the release candidate was made available.","In the private cloud, Windows Server premium revenue grew high teens, and System Center grew over 20%. On Tuesday, we announced System Center 2012 which brings many of our Azure cloud capabilities to an integrated private cloud management solution for the first time. We also announced great competitive wins against VMware with accounts such as T. Rowe Price, Unilever and Lufthansa Systems. ","System Center 2012 integrates each separate component products into one unified solution, streamlining installation and reducing the time it takes to deploy from days down to hours. Additionally, we've provided a clear path to Windows Azure for customers who are looking for a public or hybrid cloud solution.","In the public cloud, our December release of Azure enhanced ease-of-use and simplified deployment, as well as delivered new open source capabilities with Hadoop support. We are seeing strong growth in the number of large customers signing up to use Azure. One such example is Sony Pixar's Crackle online content service, which has moved to Azure due to the cost savings, agility and performance it provides. ","Now I'll move on to the Online Services Division, where revenue grew 10% and operating performance improved for the second consecutive quarter. Online advertising revenue was up 13%, driven primarily by Search. The increase in Search revenue was driven by both rate and volume improvement. Bing's U.S. organic market share ended the quarter at 15.1%, up 40 basis points this quarter and over 300 basis points year-over-year.","Now let me move to the Entertainment & Devices Division, where revenue grew 15%. According to a third-party research, Xbox was the #1 console in the U.S. during calendar year 2011 and had 46% of U.S. console sales in December. During the quarter, we sold 8.2 million consoles, which was up over 25% despite a soft gaming console market. Kinect continues to impress customers with 18 million Kinects having been sold since launch just over 1 year ago. Xbox LIVE members grew 33%, with 40 million users now enjoying Xbox LIVE.","In December, Xbox released the new Metro style dashboard and added dozens of new entertainment applications and content partners to the platform. While it is early, engagement has been quite impressive as the number of people using entertainment apps from November to December increased by almost 50%.","We continue to make progress with Windows Phone. During the quarter, Nokia began to bring some of their great new devices to market, which adds to the growing list of compelling phones available from our OEM partners. At CES, the talk of the show was the new LTE Windows Phones from Nokia and HTC that will be available on AT&T in the coming months, joining the Lumia 710, which is now available on T-Mobile. ","In October, Skype officially joined Microsoft. This quarter, over 200 million people used Skype to communicate with family, friends and businesses. For calendar year 2011, over 300 billion minutes of calls were made over the Skype network, an increase of 50%. The teams are working closely on the integration across Microsoft, and we will share more as we get further along the road map.","Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 17%, driven by the following: first, we saw an increase in costs resulting from the strong Xbox console sales and increased Xbox royalties; second, Enterprise Services continue to grow rapidly; and third, Online Services and traffic acquisition costs increased. ","Operating expenses were $7.3 billion, an increase of 4%, driven primarily due to compensation, legal expenses and Puerto Rican excise taxes. This quarter, we've returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends.","So in summary, we saw a strong demand from our business customers, and our Xbox platform delivered a record holiday season. We were able to navigate a challenging PC market to deliver solid top line and earnings per share growth. ","With that, I will hand it back to Peter who's going to discuss our business outlook.","Peter S. Klein","Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the third quarter and full fiscal year.","Beginning with the Windows and Windows Live Division. We expect revenue to continue to be impacted by market dynamics similar to the past several quarters. PC growth in emerging markets will outpace developed markets, and business PC growth will outpace consumer PC growth. We also expect the hard disk drive shortage to continue to challenge the PC market to at least the next quarter.","Turning to the Microsoft Business Division. For the third quarter and full fiscal year, transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, should lag the overall PC market, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to emerging markets. And multiyear licensing revenue, approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow low double-digits. ","Moving to Server & Tools. Approximately 30% of the division's revenues comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multiyear licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. For the third quarter and full fiscal year, we expect transactional revenue to generally track with the hardware market, multiyear licensing revenue should grow low double-digits, and Enterprise Services revenue should grow high teens.","Turning to the Online Services Division. We are focused on improving the financial performance of our Search business and are looking for ways to increase RPS and streamline costs. For the third quarter and full fiscal year, we expect revenue to show year-over-year improvements in RPS. ","Moving on to the Entertainment & Devices Division. We continue to be very pleased with our share of the worldwide console market. However, the console market is softer than we previously expected, and as a result, we now expect revenue to grow high single-digits for the third quarter and mid-teens for the full fiscal year.","Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company. COGS growth will continue to be impacted by the changing mix of revenue as we have seen the past few quarters. We expect COGS to grow about 8% to 10% for the third quarter and mid-teens for the full fiscal year. ","As a result of our focus on operating expense management, we are lowering our fiscal year guidance. We now expect operating expenses to be $28.5 billion to $28.9 billion for the full fiscal year, including the impact of Skype. This represents year-over-year growth of 5% to 6%. We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the third quarter and full fiscal year, and we still expect capital expenditures to be about $2.5 billion for the full fiscal year.","For the third quarter, unearned revenue should roughly follow historical seasonal patterns. We continue to expect unearned revenue at the end of the fiscal year to grow low double-digits compared to the prior fiscal year.","As we look forward, we have the strongest product pipeline we have ever had. We're pleased with the early enthusiasm around our upcoming wave of products that enable CIOs to cloud optimize their business. And we are excited by the opportunity to unify the consumer experience across our phones, PCs, tablets and TVs with our new Metro style design.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Bill and we'll take some questions.","Bill Koefoed","Thanks, Peter. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please go ahead and repeat your instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Holt.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question is about the material improvement in OSD margins quarter-on-quarter. It looks like you held firm on expenses year-on-year. Does that reflect the new philosophy around that business in terms of driving profitability? And can you update us on where you think you are on the RPS improvement?","Peter S. Klein","Yes. As we've been saying, the key to profitability in that business is to grow our top line because it scales really well. The marginal impact of that is very high because it's a high fixed cost business. We have been, as we've been growing share and improving our RPS especially this quarter, holding the line on operating expenses and really streamlining. The most important thing long term, as we\u2019ve said, is to continue to grow that share and grow the revenue per search, so we're pleased with that trajectory and want to keep on that. And we are watching the cost very carefully so that, that revenue marginally goes to the bottom line. And that's what you saw happen this quarter, and that's the trajectory we hope to stay on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","We're just wondering on the EDD side. It looks like you called out the Nokia payments as part of COGS as a driver. And I'm wondering, you've been pointing us to mix of revenue types as mainly the driver there of COGS. Could you help us out with how meaningful those payments were? And how should we expect those to continue to track as we move into future quarters?","Peter S. Klein","Yes, it's part of it. There were several things impacting the gross margins in the E&D business. Obviously, one is just the volume of consoles and the mix of consoles, high end versus low end, the mix of software whether it's first party or third party that has a different margin characteristic. And so that's the biggest piece in E&D. Then the Nokia piece is also another piece that plays into that. But the biggest piece is the mix of business in the E&D business and then Nokia is also another driver of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rick Sherlund of Nomura.","Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","On the hard drive shortage issue, I spoke with Gartner on Monday, and they were looking for PCs of down 1%. You guys have said down 2% to 4%, and they helped reconcile that, suggesting that there were some issues in terms of the pipeline of products. And if the inventories were reduced in the pipeline, that might reconcile why the 2 of you are viewing the industry somewhat differently. I'm just curious if you think that's going to continue into the next quarter. I know we're going to see an impact in this next quarter. I'm just curious whether you and Gartner might be more in line with each other going forward? Or if there's more inventory reduction in that pipeline that might be an ongoing impact above and beyond perhaps what we're seeing from the numbers that Gartner and IDC are giving us?","Peter S. Klein","Yes, that's impossible to say, Rick. I'd say obviously, for this quarter, we obviously are very confident and comfortable with the estimate as we said during the remarks. We expect the impact to continue on at least to the next quarter. And I think the best thing to do is at the end of that, we'll probably all have a better view and we kind of assess where we are and what it looks like going forward. I'd say just generally on the inventory as well, obviously, as I've said in my remarks, there was an inventory drawdown to end the quarter. I think there was an overall -- I think both IDC and Gartner have also talked about the fact that the overall supply chain for PCs is obviously leaner than it was 3 months ago. So we'll have to see how fast kind of people ramp back up, how fast the PC ecosystem rebounds, and that will obviously impact, as Peter mentioned, inventory at the end of the quarter as well. So good question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering, Peter, if you could talk a little bit about which businesses are the furthest along regarding their COGS transition as you move more and more of your revenues to the cloud, if you could kind of rank order them for us?","Peter S. Klein","Yes, I'd say Office 365 is really far along. We've had a lot of good momentum and obviously, one of the things that drive -- you up the sort of margin scale -- is getting the economy to scale with volume, and we talked about some of the numbers, the 100,000 businesses the great sort of demand we've had for sort of the Office business all up including Office 365. So I'd say that's probably farthest along, followed closely by Windows Azure as we sort of add new enterprise customers, new ISVs, new developers to that. But certainly, Office 365 is accelerating at the ramp.","Bill Koefoed","And the other thing that I would add is obviously OSD is, we'll call it, kind of our largest cloud property. And as Peter mentioned earlier, I think in one of the questions, it obviously has achieved scale. And as a result, kind of every incremental kind of search ends up becoming 100% margin. So we are -- we're at different stages, I think, within some of the different business products. But certainly around running a cloud infrastructure, we feel like we've got quite good handle on that from -- primarily from our Search business.","Operator","Our next question comes from John DiFucci of JPMC.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question essentially follows to Rick. It has to do with the Windows OEM revenue bridge. Just curious on some of these items, how they fit today. For instance, and I believe, Bill and Peter, you take account for that inventory changes in the Windows Attach and inventory line. And last quarter, it added about 5% to the quarter. This quarter, it was a 2% hit. And Bill, you noted the inventory drawdown had an effect there. Can you give us a sense on where you think channel inventories are today relative to what you might call normal levels? And then also just quickly on that last line in that bridge, the OEM revenue adjustment, when is this stop -- going to stop being negative? It's been slightly negative for quite some time now. And shouldn't it have stopped like 3 years after the Vista launch because it -- wasn't it related to XP and having Internet Explorer as part of that as a meaningful part of that versus for Vista?","Peter S. Klein","Yes, we'll take the second one first. Next year, that should go away. So to answer your question, yes, that's what you would expect and that's what will happen. On your first question on inventory, at any given quarter, inventory is going to be -- sort of go up and down depending on what's going on in the channel. As you noted, sometimes, it's a tailwind, sometimes it's a headwind like it was this quarter. It's hard to say precisely what sort of -- where it stands and what it's going to be like next quarter. We'll sort of look at it when we get there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler from San Bernstein.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Question for you. How much of the year-over-year decrease in the consumer revenue on the Offices product is due to licensing, licenses specifically included in OEM sales of PCs as compared to stand-alone Office sales to the consumer market?","Peter S. Klein","It's mostly associated with OEM. I mean, the driver that we use for that part of the MBD business is specifically tied with the PC unit growth of consumers. And so as I mentioned in my remarks, we actually outperformed that but that's the best driver that -- it's not complete but that's the best driver of trying to be able to predict or interpret that result.","Operator","Our next question comes from Philip Winslow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just got a question on just the Windows division. When you think about the impact of Windows 8 coming out theoretically, obviously, the second half of this year, how do you think that's going to impact build plans amongst the OEMs but also inventory levels when we get to the summer?","Peter S. Klein","Probably pretty premature to talk about that. I think we need to get closer to it. So the thing I would say is just from an ecosystem perspective, there's an incredible amount of excitement and innovation going on across vendors like the chip vendors and all the OEMs. You actually see that starting today with the Ultrabooks that you're seeing with Windows 7. And so the fact of the matter is there's a ton of innovation happening today for Windows 7. There's a ton of excitement for enterprises for both Windows 7 and looking forward to Windows 8, and what that gives them in terms of an end user experience and IT manageability. So I don't think about it so much as looking forward. There's a ton of innovation going on today. You see it in Ultrabooks. You see it in what both the ARM and x86 chip vendors are doing, and so that sort of continues sort of on a regular pace.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If you look at the last few quarters, I know we've been through tough comps, sluggish slower revenue growth rate and also the mix issues that have caused the margins, the gross margins to go down. As you come out of this tough cycle and start to get into this, the next sort of launches, should we think about the gross margins as starting to go in the other direction just based on the -- what looks to be better mix between your Windows -- just typical software businesses as you get into launch year? Part of me it says maybe the margins are bottoming here. Of course, I completely respect the fact that you've got sort of another mix issues that are more longer term as you have Entertainment & Devices business, the cost there, et cetera. But shouldn't margins start to go back up as you head into launch year?","Peter S. Klein","Yes. Certainly, margins are a function of mix. And to the extent there\u2019s a higher mix and higher margin products, that will have a positive impact on margins. And it's not unrealistic to think that in a launch year, you can see a higher growth in higher-margin products. So it will depend on what the mix is, but I think it's a very plausible scenario.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle of Pacific Crest Securities.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could give us any color on what you saw geographically in terms of growth trends in particular or any -- in particular in Europe or Asia, it was weak or strong?","Peter S. Klein","Yes. We saw a particular strength in emerging markets, particularly what we call the BRIC markets, Brazil, Russia, India and China. That was really a driver of growth for us. And that's exciting for us because we've had got strong and growing positions there, and that's where kind of disproportionate economic growth is happening sort of worldwide. But as Bill mentioned and as I mentioned, we saw a broad-based strength in demand across geographies but with particular strength in emerging markets.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ed Maguire of CLSA.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","You called out 100,000 businesses that are engaged in Online Services. Could you comment on the impact that this transition is having on recognized revenues versus unearned and contracted not billed?","Peter S. Klein","Yes, it's interesting. Subscription businesses aren't that much different from our existing multiyear licensing business in the sense that it sort of bills upfront and then recognized over time, just like our multiyear licensing agreements. And so it really doesn't have a significant impact on the sort of flavor or character of our revenue recognition or unearned revenue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Oppenheimer.","Brad Reback - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Great. Peter, the business PC growth rate was down about 300 basis points sequentially. Was that all economic or hard disk drive?","Peter S. Klein","Yes. I'd say -- the one thing I'd say is the overall business environment sort of remains very strong for us. And so sort of all of our sort of macro indicators for business spending on IT remain good, unearned revenue, our renewals for enterprise licensing agreements and sort of enterprise deployments of Windows 7. In terms of PCs, as we said, there's still growth and we're still in the refresh cycle. I do suspect that some of that, well, is due to supply chain and maybe a small amount due to macro but it's small.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Peter, you mentioned Ultrabooks earlier, and on the heels of CES, we're going to be seeing a lot more of them hit the market. Can you talk about what this means for Microsoft? And more importantly, when might Ultrabooks be ready for the mass market from a cost perspective?","Peter S. Klein","What it means -- for me, what it represents is sort of the excitement and the opportunity long term in building compelling devices for consumers and businesses around the world. There's so much innovation still to get done. There's so many new form factors, so many new use cases. And I think it's great to see what the ecosystem does when it works together, as I mentioned before. In terms of the sort of price points in mass market, we'll just sort of wait and see how that evolves before commenting on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Klasell of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Tim Klasell - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a question on the EDD. You have mentioned about a softening in the console sales. Do you think that, that's due to mix shifting towards lower-priced units, or is that business just getting more seasonal? If we model that going forward, should we make that a more seasonal holiday type of an event than we currently do?","Peter S. Klein","In terms of the over -- first of all, yes, we feel -- for our console business, we feel really good about our sort of relative position in the market and our ability to take share and have a really strong competitive position. In terms of the seasonality, I don't think there's anything that indicates it's sort of more or less seasonal than we've seen in the past. Like many consumer businesses like this, it will always be relatively stronger at the holiday season. And in terms of some of the mixes, some of it's a function of product cycle. If you think about that Kinect centers and how we sold those into our installed base, and now we're selling more bundles, those kinds of things. Its seasonality hasn't marginally -- hasn't materially shifted.","Bill Koefoed","Obviously, when big-title games come out, that tends to also drive kind of a big cycle so that\u2019s also something to pay attention to around this business.","Operator","Okay, our next question comes from Robert Breza of RBC Capital Markets.","Robert P. Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Bill, maybe could you just comment a little bit back on, I think it was a Cr\u00e9dit Suisse analysts talking about the Windows 8 release the end of February. Given the complexity you're adding into Windows 8 with mobile, et cetera, making that kind of a cross-platform experience, do you expect that to kind of delay the traditional milestones? Or how should we think about Windows 8 going forward?","Bill Koefoed","Yes, I wouldn't think about kind of traditional milestones. I would say one of the things that Tammy [ph] talked about at CES last week was just how important it is for us to work on and with developers to create a really vibrant developer ecosystem. And so one of the things we also talked about with the beta release was the Windows Store, really making sure we're going to have quite a few apps that are going to be up on the Windows Store at beta. Obviously, one of the things she and Steve both talked about last week is that any Windows 7 PC could run Windows 8. But obviously, there\u2019ll be kind of some new and interesting form factors that are going to come out here as we get further on down the road. So I don't know that I would think about it except, as we said earlier, we're on track. We feel really good about where we are on the product, and this next super important milestone is the beta release and having a really great developer ecosystem that kind of surround that. So great question.","Okay, so that will wrap up the Q&A portion of today's call. We look forward to seeing many of you at the numerous conferences in which we're going to be participating at this quarter. For those of you unable to attend those events in person, you will be able to follow our comments at microsoft.com\/investor.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Spencer, General Manager, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and Carolyn Frantz, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.","On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.","All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses perform, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.","We'll post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. We're off to a very strong start in fiscal 2019, delivering record revenue and profit. Every organization today needs tech intensity to compete and grow in an increasingly digital world.","There are two aspects to this. Think of it as a simple equation. First, every organization needs to be a fast adopter of best-in-class technology, second, they'll need to build their own proprietary digital capability. Our cloud platforms and tools enable our customers to build tech intensity, while ensuring we're addressing their tough questions around trust, both trust in technology and trust that they have a partner whose business model is aligned to their success.","No customer wants to be dependent on a provider that sells them technology on one end and competes with them on the other. Getting this equation right is key to their success going forward. Microsoft is uniquely positioned to help.","Now I'll briefly highlight how we are innovating across our solution areas. A little over a year ago, we introduced Microsoft 365 to help organizations of all sizes empower their employees in the modern workplace. Today it's a multi-billion dollar business that gives our customers a path to the cloud and broadens our reach with new and under-penetrated markets. Customers from large multinationals like Eli Lilly to Rio Tinto first-line field workers to small businesses that are all choosing Microsoft 365.","Cybersecurity is a central challenge. Microsoft Security differentiation is based on two things: first, our unparalleled operational security posture, second, our comprehensive product suite spanning identity, information, application and device protection.","We analyze more than 6.5 trillion signals each day, process 450 billion authentications monthly and scan 400 billion e-mails for malware and phishing each month. This massive signals generate insights that fuel security innovations for customers. New capabilities in Microsoft 365 detect, investigate and remediate sophisticated cybersecurity threats across every endpoint, saving IT professionals thousands of hours.","Microsoft Security Score gives organizations a dynamic report card on their security posture. In identity management, Microsoft is already a leader with Azure Active Directory and we are innovating with new capabilities to eliminate passwords for the hundreds of thousands of Azure AD connected apps that businesses use every day.","The future of productivity and collaboration will be defined by AI innovation and new AI-driven features across Microsoft 365 from automated slide design to proactive Cortana reminders to enhanced search experiences and real-time meeting transcription to org analytics are all augmenting human capability, making it easier for people to focus on what matters most.","Another differentiator is Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Teams is the only enterprise-grade solution that brings together messaging, video conferencing, meetings, and web-based collab into a single integrated user experience scaffolding. It eliminates the need for discrete single-point solutions that only increase an organization's security and compliance exposure.","Customers recognize this value. Teams is now the hub for teamwork for 329,000 organizations, including 87 of the Fortune 100 And we are adding automated translation support for meetings, shift scheduling for first-line workers, and new industry-specific offerings including healthcare and small business.","Windows 10 continues to gain traction in the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system and more than half of our commercial device installed base is now on Windows 10. Surface continues to set the bar for the industry with five new category-leading Surface devices including the new Surface Go. Microsoft 365 and Surface are inspiring our OEM ecosystems to innovate and we have the strongest line of devices going into the holiday season.","Moving to business applications, AI-powered digital feedback loops that connect products, operations, customers, and employees to create predictive power, automate workflows, and ultimately improve outcomes are key to all organizations. Dynamics 365 uniquely addresses this need. We expect Dynamics to deliver more than $2.5 billion in revenue this year with half of that total coming from Dynamics 365.","And this quarter, we introduced Dynamics 365 AI, a new class of AI applications built for an era where the systems of record and engagement are converted into intelligence. Dynamics 365 Mixed Reality digitizes the physical spaces and interactions. Companies like Chevron and ZF Group are already using it to transform training and design for their first-line workers, and H&M, the world's second-largest clothing retailer is relying on Dynamics 365 to digitize its critical business processes.","These customers and others recognize the advantage of our modular extensible approach over the traditional SaaS model of monolithic suites of siloed apps. And our investments in our analytics and application platform spanning Power BI, PowerApps, and Flow are driving momentum with customers and have made us a leader in no-code app building and business analytics in the cloud.","Our Open Data Initiative, a strategic partnership with Adobe and SAP takes this even further, delivering on our vision of one unified data model to provide unparalleled business insight from behavioral, transactional, financial and operational data. Together we'll enable data to be exchanged and enriched across systems, making it a renewable resource that enables new intelligent customer experiences.","LinkedIn continues to be an essential platform to connect the world's professionals, with sessions growth of 34% year-over-year and record levels of messages sent and content shared. We're innovating with new experiences that leverage the LinkedIn and Microsoft Graphs such as the ability to e-mail LinkedIn connections directly from Microsoft 365. Strong engagement across the platform is fueling demand for sponsored content and marketing solutions and talent solutions, which saw record job postings again this quarter.","Talent Insights is a new self-service analytics solution that gives HR professionals competitive intelligence and labor market trends for an increasingly competitive jobs market. And the pending acquisition of Glint brings employee insights alongside LinkedIn's Workforce Insights to create a powerful solution to help customers attract, retain and develop the best talent.","Now turning to Azure. Customers from multinationals like Volkswagen, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Mastercard to fast-growing startups like Grab are recognizing the architectural advantage of a consistent computing stack from the cloud to the edge.","Azure is the only hyperscale cloud that extends to the edge across identity, data, application, platform, as well as security and management. We introduced 100 new Azure capabilities this quarter alone, focused on both existing workloads like security and new workloads like IoT and edge AI.","With Azure Confidential Computing, Azure is now the first cloud to provide a secure platform for protecting the confidentiality and the integrity of data while in use adding to our existing security protections to encrypt data in transit as well as in rest.","Every company needs a strategy to take advantage of the billions of IoT devices entering the market each year. Azure Sphere, our end-to-end solution for securing microcontroller powered devices is now broadly available and seeing strong customer interest. Azure Digital Twins is a new service that models relationships and interactions across people, places and devices.","We're investing to make Azure the best cloud for enterprise data. Our data services spanning SQL Database, Cosmos DB, Data Warehouse, and Data Lake provide the most comprehensive data platform needed for enterprise data estates. Azure ML builds on this foundation to further democratize data and AI to unlock insights, helping data scientists build and train AI models faster then deploy them through the cloud or to the Edge.","Across industries, our customers and partners are using services like these to transform. BMW introduced an agent to redefine how people interact with their cars. Beulah, which processes 65% of the world's grain, is relying on Azure Cognitive Services to improve food safety. Shell is applying AI across its enterprise to optimize deal productivity and keep workers safe. And this week at Sibos Conference, the Microsoft cloud is front and center, powering financial services transformation for organizations such as SWIFT, which is enabling secure payment transfers on Azure.","Finally, our pending acquisition of GitHub, which we expect to close shortly, recognizes the increasingly vital role developers play in value creation and growth across every industry. I'm excited about the opportunity to bring our tools and services to new audiences while enabling GitHub to grow and retain its developer-first ethos.","Now I'll turn to gaming. We continue to broaden our reach with more than 2 billion gamers worldwide and expand our opportunity, from the way games are distributed, to how they're played and viewed. We are investing in content, community and cloud services across every endpoint to expand usage and deepen engagement.","First-party content is key to our approach and we now have 11 game studios in our portfolio to deliver differentiated content for our fast-growing services like Game Pass. Xbox Live now has 57 million monthly active users and Mixer usage growth is accelerating. This loyal, high-value community is our strongest asset, creating expanding opportunity for monetization of first- and third-party games. Fortnite is a good example of that and all up, we are seeing record software and services revenue and engagement being driven on our platform.","Earlier this month, we announced Project xCloud, a breakthrough game streaming technology that puts gamers at the center of their gaming experience, enabling them to play games in high fidelity wherever and whenever they want on any device. And it will empower game developers to scale to hundreds of millions of new users across devices. It's early days, but I'm excited about our road map.","Across our businesses, we are accelerating innovation, picking the right secular trends, investing in large growing markets, many of which are still in their infancy. Additionally, every one of our solutions is reinforcing our core intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform. Not only are we optimistic about the opportunity for us and for our customers, we also recognize our responsibility.","We were one of the first companies in the United States to require suppliers doing substantial business with us to provide paid time off for their employees. And this quarter we took a further step to ensure that these suppliers also provide their employees with paid parental leave. We're ensuring that our enterprise class security innovation not only helps our largest customers but also protects small businesses and consumers who are often the most vulnerable to attacks.","Finally, we are putting AI into the hands of change makers to address society's most pressing challenges with initiatives like AI for Humanitarian Action, which supports critical disaster recovery efforts around the world and more. This recognition of our broader responsibility coupled with our bold innovation makes me incredibly optimistic about our opportunity ahead.","With that, now I'll hand over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook and I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter revenue was $29.1 billion, up 19% and 18% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 18%. Operating income increased 29% and 28% in constant currency and earnings per share was $1.14, increasing 36% and 33% in constant currency, another quarter of double-digit revenue and operating income growth drove a record start to the fiscal year.","We saw strength across each of our segments with strong sales execution by our partners and sales teams. Customer demand for our hybrid and cloud offerings drove the quarter and we continued to benefit from favorable macroeconomic and IT spending trends.","Now to our commercial business. As a reminder, starting this quarter, the commercial portion of LinkedIn is included in these metrics. Our commercial revenue annuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 90%. Commercial unearned revenue was $27.3 billion, growing 22% and 21% in constant currency, in line with expectations.","On an expiry base that was roughly flat year-over-year, commercial bookings were better than expected and increased 15% and 16% in constant currency, benefiting from larger long-term Azure contracts, growth in Azure consumption overages and pay-as-you-go contracts and strength in on-premises revenue.","These contract types impact bookings, reported revenue and unearned revenue in different ways. Let me explain. First, under ASC 606, hybrid and on-premises offerings drive bookings growth and more in-period revenue recognition. Therefore, there's less impact on unearned revenue.","Second, growth in Azure consumption overages and pay-as-you-go contracts drive bookings growth and in-period revenue, but have little impact on unearned revenue. And finally, long-term Azure contracts drive significant bookings growth, but have a smaller impact on in-period revenue and unearned revenue. The inclusion of LinkedIn results was immaterial to the growth rates of commercial unearned and commercial bookings.","Commercial cloud revenue was $8.5 billion, growing 47% and 46% in constant currency with strong performance in the U.S., Western Europe and the UK. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 4 points to 62%, driven again by significant improvement in Azure gross margin.","Company level, gross margin percentage was 66%, down slightly year-over-year, with sales mix shift to gaming and commercial cloud. FX increased overall company and Productivity and Business Processes revenue by 1 point, in line with guidance. The impact to Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing revenue was immaterial, 1 point less favorable than expected. FX impact was immaterial to COGS and operating expenses, about 1 point less favorable than expected. Even with that headwind, operating expenses grew 8%, in line with expectations.","Our engineering and sales capacity investments in large growing markets continue to deliver differentiated value for our customers, while generating material operating income leverage. This quarter, we increased operating margin nearly 3 points year-over-year.","Now to the segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $9.8 billion, increasing 19% and 18% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by both the on-premises and cloud businesses. Office commercial revenue grew 17% and 16% in constant currency, driven by continued Office 365 commercial growth and approximately 3 points of growth from increased demand ahead of a price increase with the launch of Office 2019.","Office 365 commercial revenue grew 36% and 35% in constant currency, with installed base expansion across all customer segments and ARPU growth as customers shift to E3 and E5 workloads. Office 365 commercial seats grew 29%, and in line with last quarter, benefited from strong performance of our Microsoft 365 academic offers.","Office consumer revenue increased 16% and 17% in constant currency, driven by growth in Office 365 subscription revenue and approximately 5 points of growth from increased channel demand ahead of a price increase with the launch of Office 2019. Office 365 consumer subscribers grew to 32.5 million.","Dynamics revenue grew 20%, including a few points from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition under ASC 606. Dynamics 365 grew 51% and 49% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 33% with strong execution across all businesses.","Segment gross margin dollars grew 18% and 17% in constant currency and gross margin percentage declined slightly year-over-year as cloud mix offset LinkedIn and Office 365 margin expansion. Operating expenses increased 7% and 8% in constant currency with ongoing investments in LinkedIn, cloud engineering and commercial sales capacity to support top-line growth. Operating income increased 29% and 27% in constant currency.","Revenue from Intelligent Cloud was $8.6 billion, increasing 24%, better than anticipated, driven by demand for our hybrid offerings. Server products and cloud services revenue grew 28%. Azure revenue increased 76%, in line with our expectations with strong growth across both consumption and per-user base businesses.","Our on-premises server business grew 10% and 9% in constant currency, driven by continued demand for premium versions and hybrid solutions, as well as increased demand ahead of Q2 price increases for certain versions of our server products.","Enterprise services revenue grew 6% as growth in Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services was partially offset by a decline in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003. Segment gross margin dollars increased 28% and 27% in constant currency.","Gross margin percentage increased year-over-year as material improvement in Azure gross margin percentage offset the growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue. Operating expenses increased 19% and 20% in constant currency, driven by ongoing investments in cloud and AI engineering and commercial sales capacity. Operating income grew 37% and 35% in constant currency.","Now to more Personal Computing. Revenue was $10.7 billion, increasing 15% with significantly better than expected results in gaming. Gaming revenue increased 44% and 45% in constant currency with better than expected results across both software and services and hardware.","Xbox software and services revenue grew 36%, with continued strength from a third-party title. Xbox hardware revenue grew 94% and 96% in constant currency with earlier than expected sell-in of holiday hardware bundles.","In Windows, we saw healthy Windows 10 commercial deployments as the OEM ecosystem continued to benefit from customer demand for modern and secure software and hardware. OEM Pro revenue grew 8%, a few points ahead of the commercial PC market from a higher mix of premium licenses. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 12%.","In consumer, OEM non-Pro revenue declined 5%, below the consumer PC market with continued pressure in the entry-level price category. Inventory levels were within the normal range.","Search revenue ex-TAC increased 17%, driven by Bing rate growth and increased volume in U.S. and international markets. In Surface, revenue grew 14%, driven by Surface Book 2 and Surface Go.","Segment gross margin dollars grew 10% and gross margin percentage decreased due to sales mix to our lower-margin gaming business. Operating expenses declined 1%. As a result, operating income grew 23%.","Now back to our total company results. As expected, capital expenditures including financed leases were up sequentially to $4.3 billion, driven by ongoing investment to meet demand for our cloud services. Cash paid for property, plant and equipment was $3.6 billion. Free cash flow was $10.1 billion and decreased 2% year-over-year due to higher capital expenditures in support of our cloud business.","Cash flow from operations increased 10% year-over-year with strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by our first annual TCJA payment of $1.5 billion. Excluding the TCJA payment, free cash flow grew 12% and operating cash flow grew 22%. Other income was $266 million, higher than anticipated, due to realized gains in the recording of mark-to-market gains under the new accounting rules for financial investments.","Our effective tax rate was 14%. As a reminder Q1 and Q3 rates are impacted by the volume of equity vest during those quarters. This Q1, the impact was a bit more than expected due to the movement of our share price within the quarter. And finally, in line with our continued commitment, we returned $6.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, an increase of 27% year-over-year.","Now let's turn to our outlook. Given that we expect the GitHub acquisition to close shortly, my commentary includes the full impact of the deal including purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related expenses based on our current understanding of the purchase price allocation and related deal accounting. We continue to expect the deal to be minimally dilutive to FY 2019 and FY 2020 EPS on a non-GAAP basis and accretive to FY 2020 operating income on a non-GAAP basis.","For Q2, first FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect no impact to revenue growth. FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point.","Second, our commercial business. We expect another quarter of healthy performance with solid bookings growth. Commercial unearned revenue is expected to grow approximately 19% year-over-year even with the ongoing shift toward the cloud contracts discussed earlier. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage should continue to improve on a year-over-year basis though at a more moderated rate than prior years given the continued mix of revenue toward Azure consumption-based services. Margin improvement will continue to vary on a quarterly basis driven by revenue mix, seasonality and the timing of infrastructure spend.","Third, we expect ongoing year-over-year growth in capital expenditure as we support growing demand. Given infrastructure spend timing, Q2 CapEx should be roughly in line with Q1.","Now to our segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $9.95 billion and $10.15 billion. Office commercial and Dynamics should continue to exhibit double-digit growth, driven by strong cloud performance but with some moderation due to the on-premise drivers discussed earlier. Office consumer will see continued momentum in new subscribers but overall revenue growth will be negatively impacted as channel inventories normalize. LinkedIn revenue growth should remain healthy though on a stronger prior-year comparable.","For Intelligent Cloud, which includes GitHub, we expect revenue between $9.15 billion and $9.35 billion. In Azure, we expect healthy growth across our consumption and per-user base businesses though per-user services growth will moderate given the size of the installed base.","In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $12.8 billion and $13.2 billion. OEM Pro revenue growth should be in line with the commercial PC market. As a reminder, prior year comparables strengthened throughout the remainder of the year.","In Windows commercial products and cloud services, we expect continued strength, as well as the benefit of a low prior-year comparable. And for OEM non-Pro, we expect similar dynamics to Q1. In Surface, revenue growth should accelerate, with the impact of recently launched devices including Surface Pro 6 and Surface Laptop 2. Search ex-TAC results should be similar to Q1 with durable growth in rate and volume.","In gaming, we expect revenue growth to moderate due to a prior year comparable that included the launch of Xbox One X. Software and services growth should be similar to Q1, with continued benefit from a third-party title plus overall platform strength.","Now back to our company results. We expect COGS of $12.2 billion to $12.4 billion and operating expenses of $9.8 billion to $9.9 billion. Other income and expense should be approximately $50 million as interest income and investment gains are partially offset by interest expense. And finally we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be slightly above the full year estimate of 17%.","Now a few comments on the fiscal year. First FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect a 1 point headwind to full-year revenue growth with any benefit in H1 offset in H2. FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point.","Second, operating expenses. We remain unchanged in our commitment to invest in strategic priorities that are key to driving long-term value creation. With the addition of GitHub as a strategic priority, we now expect operating expenses to grow roughly 8%. Growth excluding GitHub is expected to be in line with our prior guidance of roughly 7%.","Third, on operating margin. Even with the full GAAP impact of GitHub purchase accounting now included in our guidance, we continue to expect our operating margin to be up slightly year-over-year. Margin leverage is a direct result of our focused investments in the right technology trends coupled with consistent execution.","For CapEx, we continue to expect the growth rate for the year to moderate even as we meet demand for our cloud services. Regarding the GitHub acquisition, we remain committed to an incremental share buyback beyond the normal quarterly pace, though it's expected to fully offset stock consideration issue in the transaction by the end of the fiscal year. And finally, we continue to expect the full year effective tax rate to be roughly 17% with quarterly variability.","And with that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.","[0JNPYG-E Michael Spencer]","Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much for the question. Amy and Satya, if I look at your Intelligent Cloud segment, and in particular the server products and cloud services, those continue to defy gravity a little bit here. And I'm just wondering if you could just give us a sense of how much may be the pricing changes that went into effect at the beginning of the quarter that you're in now might have helped drive spending last quarter ahead of them going into effect. But also, can you share with us how the Azure Hybrid Benefit message might also be impacting Azure growth rates? Thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Sure. Thanks Heather for the question. I'll start and then Amy you can add. I mean, I think what you're fundamentally seeing in that overall KPI is what I think are two major advantages we have. One is an architectural technology advantage around hybrid, right. So we don't think of hybrid as some stopgap as a move to the cloud. We think about it's the coming together of distributed computing where the cloud and the edge work together for not just the old workloads, but most importantly for new workloads. And that's where we are seeing some very significant good feedback loops and shaping even our future road map. And this is a place where we are leading.","The second thing, as you pointed out in your question, is we have a business model advantage. The Azure benefits are things both for Windows Server as well as for SQL which I think are very, very unique to us and you see that. So the combination of the technology advantage and the business model advantage is what I see in the results, whether it's the standalone Azure growth, which is what we expected and it's very strong and the server KPI is even stronger. So I think that's at least how I would answer that question.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And to your specific question, Heather, on the impact of some of the price increases that went into effect in Q2, I'd say it's a couple of points. So I would not sort of over-rotate on that topic. The overall number, even if you take a couple points off that 28% is a very good performance, that I believe to Satya's point, is the impact you've seen of the very aligned technology road map on the architecture plus a business model that matches it.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Heather. Operator, we'll take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you for taking the question and very nice quarter guys. I wanted to dig into capital efficiency here around your cloud assets a little bit. This quarter you talked about Azure gross margins coming in, sort of continuing to improve really nicely. CapEx came in. I mean the growth there is slowing a little bit. Can you talk to us about sort of what's kind of driving that? Is it sort of the move to higher-level services so you get like better pricing against the capital? Is this sort of you're just not sort of pouring down as much cement, if you will, in terms of database expansion? Is it like better productivity of the core sort of compute stuff? Like can you help us understand sort of how capital intensity is trending in that Azure in particular but more broadly in the cloud businesses?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","It's a great question, Keith. I would say the way we think about our capital efficiency and I in fact added that even to my commentary this time, which is we're building this intelligent cloud, intelligent edge platform to span everything, not only the Azure business but also the future of game streaming to what we are doing at Microsoft 365 or Dynamics 365.","For the first time, what you see across Microsoft is really one platform which spans all of these businesses and all of the margin structures that are there represented in it. So that's where if you think about the thing that Amy and I focus a lot on is the capital efficiency end-to-end in that context versus getting caught up in even the capital efficiency as measured by any one of these individual pieces, because we think that's what Microsoft's uniqueness long term lies.","But that said on Azure, you're absolutely right. What you are seeing is two things. One is things like the Azure Hybrid Benefits as well as the higher-level services that create I think uniqueness both as well as good margins long term. I mean, especially on the database side is one place where I would say from a year-over-year worth of progress, whether it's just Azure database by itself. I mean that service with full compatibility with SQL Server is a fantastic value proposition for our customers who have huge estates whether it's the Data Warehouse that's become very, very competitive, the Data Lake. And Cosmos DB I think is very unique in its capability. So that's one place where as you know, any AI project first starts with data, and that's one place where we are seeing good traction.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Keith. Operator, we'll move to the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys, for talking my question and congrats on another great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on Office. Obviously, Amy, you called out some of the positives from the price increase that's coming up. But if I look at just Office 365 both commercial and consumer, just continued just strong growth on both those two. And especially on the commercial side, there's still that gap between seat growth and revenue growth. So if you kind of just think where you are and I guess in terms of just sort of the life cycle here and obviously, we've got multiple SKUs, maybe just kind of give us an update of how you're sort of think about where you stand and then especially as you think about the full year here, how you sort of expect these metrics to progress?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Sure. And I'm actually going to expand my comments a little bit because the sales motion is really broader than Office 365. The sales motion is really about Microsoft 365. And what that encompasses is both the Office 365 value proposition, but also our management and security value proposition with EMS as well as Advanced Threat Protection and Windows value that shows up in that Windows commercial services KPI.","So the bucket of those together, what we're seeing is many of the workloads and movement to E3 within Microsoft 365 and to E5 continue to have good pull. There's great customer demand for the value that comes in security and analytics, in meetings, in voice, in collab. And I think when you look at the value, I think we feel good about the opportunity to continue to move these users including new first-line or frontline users that we've not had access before.","We got room on user growth, which you continue to see that number go up across segments. And we've got room in ARPU, which you've continued to see us have. So in many ways your question shows itself in Office, but the trends are the same if you look at EMS growth or if you were to look at that Windows commercial growth number.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","And I'd just add that the seat growth as well as the ARPU growth, one of the things even in spite of the success we may have achieved in the past, we never were that successful in penetrating with all of our workloads when it comes to small business and definitely across the globe. So that's another dimension that you see play out as well.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Awesome. Thanks.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Great. Thanks, Phil. Yeah, thanks, Phil. Operator, we'll move to the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking it. Satya, can you focus on gaming for a little bit? With the xCloud you kind of announced something that the whole industry have kind of been dreaming about as like the Holy Grail where you want to go eventually have it all in the cloud, delivered from the cloud and subscription service. Can you talk a little bit about the innovation that is involved in you being able to starting to deliver that now? Thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Sure. But before I get to streaming, the thing that I'll say is most critical when you think about gaming is having a platform where the gamers are already there. That means you need to have a platform that has a community around it and monetize as well.","So when you see some of the KPIs and some of the strength you saw in quarter, that's the foundation of Xbox. Xbox has the key gaming community and the monetization capabilities. Whether it's first-party games or third-party games, we are best-in-class in that monetization and that's what's reflected in the results.","So given that structural position, we are going to make sure that we keep increasing the strength of the community. You see that already with Minecraft going to all platforms and that increasing the intensity of the community and you'll see us do more of that. Obviously, bringing Game Pass to even the PC is going to be a big element of that.","And then streaming is just a natural sequence of it. And the advantage we have with streaming is, we have a massive cloud advantage. And so we're going to bring obviously what we're doing with Azure, Azure networking, all to bear in ensuring that Xbox and xCloud is one of the best workloads for it.","So that's how I see it. It, of course, will increase our reach, but what I am most excited about is the core content and community and the platform we have for monetizing that usage. And that I think is really what gives us even the permission to think about streaming.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Great. Thanks, Raimo. Operator, we'll please move to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. I know you mentioned GitHub is closing soon. It's obviously not closed yet. But given you've got a few months under your belt now since it was announced and an opportunity to solicit some feedback from the developer communities that maybe aren't using Microsoft technologies on a regular basis, but are very active with GitHub, do you have a sense yet of what the opportunities might be to do outreach to those developers that might be working closely with competing platforms? And how closely you can kind of hug them into the Microsoft ecosystem versus just leaving GitHub as sort of a self-sustaining entity now that you have a little bit more opportunities to discuss that with customers in the field?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Sure. First of all, thank you for the question. We're very excited about GitHub closing. And quite frankly, primarily I'm excited because for us, as I've always said, GitHub is not a means to some other end. It's an end on to its own, which is, we've always cared about developer and developer productivity and especially at a time like this when there are more developers outside of the tech industry as the world goes digital.","We think this is perhaps one of the big SaaS opportunities going forward. And so therefore that's why we want to ensure that everything we do and the number one priority for Nat and team at GitHub will be all about maintaining that GitHub community, the ethos around developers at the core.","That said, I think we will do what is necessary to make sure that our products and services that are on Azure or elsewhere, our tooling, which are already many open source projects on GitHub, we do a good job of earning that developer trust and developer adoption. But we are very grounded in the fact that it has to be earned and not something that we will inherit because of being owners of GitHub.","The second thing I'll also mention is that, to me the opportunity to win, I would say, new class of developers, we are making progress. In fact, this morning I was reading a news article in Hacker News, which is a community where we have been working hard to make sure that Azure is growing in popularity. And I was pleasantly surprised to see that we have made a lot of progress, in some sense, that at least basically said that we are neck to neck with Amazon when it comes to even elite developers as represented in that community. So we have more work to do, but we're making progress on all dimensions.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Jen. Operator, we'll move to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks very much and congrats on a great start to the year. Amy, in your comments, you cited the continued benefit from a strong IT spending environment and it's very clear from your results there's a lot of Microsoft-specific success and execution happening here as well. But as you look at your pipelines and all the various signals you see in the market, do you have a view on how long the environment persists and what are the indicators that give you confidence?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Brad, for the question. In general, the way I tend to look at this is the interactions we have with customers and the markets we're in and do we feel like they're expansive. And so, when I look at the businesses that we've built and the businesses we're investing in and do I feel like this needs for tech intensity that Satya talked about, that will ultimately drive the desire and need for customers to adopt technology, we're in the right places.","And that's the signal actually we hear back from customers, whether that is Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365 and a new worldview on what business processes and business applications can look like. Whether it's frankly our views on gaming that Satya just discussed, I feel like the signal we're hearing is that we're in the right part of the market with customer-focused value that can deliver a high ROI to them, no matter what that IT budget looks like. And so I think as long as we focus on providing that value, we'll feel good about our opportunity to both grow and take share in the market.","Brad Alan Zelnick - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Fantastic. Thank you.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Brad. Yeah, thanks Brad. Operator, we'll please move to next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citi Investment Research (Europe)","Thanks. Amy, I'm wondering if you could talk about Azure, the outlook for the year. I know growth rate's been a bit volatile. I think you had a pretty strong Q4 including (45:02) that business. Maybe you could help us understand relative to the growth we're seeing right now how you expect the Azure trajectory to play out for the year?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Sure. Let me spend a couple minutes on that. We actually saw better bookings in Q1 again on Azure, as I mentioned, just like we did in Q4. And so obviously that's certainly encouraging as we look on a go-forward basis for the rest of the year. But as I think about \u2013 I tend to focus as you know on the all-up server and product KPI because the Azure hybrid benefits that exist with Windows Server and SQL Server are really valuable to customers if they want to move to Azure on their own terms, is the single best value proposition to a customer to make a commitment there.","And so, if we start to focus on one number or the other, I think we're missing the fact that our customer method and go-to-market is actually through the overall product portfolio. And so, I tend to probably as you might imagine be more confident than I was in coming out of Q4 with a strong Q1 in that overall hybrid demand and Azure signal plus good Azure bookings when I talked about my confidence in high teens growth in that KPI for the rest of the year.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citi Investment Research (Europe)","Great. Thank you, Amy.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Walter. Operator we'll take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, and I will add my congrats. Amy, last quarter you had mentioned that you could see increased volatility in time, in commercial bookings growth as you were talking about the commitments were increasing to larger and longer-term agreements. But this quarter, the ex-free portfolio was flattish and yet your commercial bookings grew 16%. I think presumably a very powerful performance with the renewals, the expansions and the new bookings, and I don't think you repeated that comment about bookings volatility in the same way. So I'm just curious, maybe could you help us connect the dots on that performance and also the potential for volatility in either direction going forward?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Sure, thank you. That's a great question. You will see volatility in the bookings number for the reasons we've laid out before, the changing expiry base, but also large contracts and commitments done by Azure. And to your point, we actually saw it this quarter because we again saw a quite good performance in some of these larger long-term Azure contracts which added on a flat expiry base to that 15% bookings growth, which was good.","And so what that means is, you'll see some volatility in that and you're also going to see some volatility in commercial unearned, specifically because whenever you see hybrid strength, it won't land as much in unearned. So as the business gets bigger and we do bigger and larger deals and some of them are on-prem and some of them are in Azure, you're going to see volatility frankly in both of those.","But what I try to do is think about the impact of all the key data points which is how did we do in-quarter, how did we do on the unearned revenue on the balance sheet and how did we do in overall bookings. And if I triangulate between all those three, just like I did in Q4, I feel really good about our commercial performance.","Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Great. Thanks, Mark. Operator, we'll move to the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much. Maybe two for Amy. Just first on that KPI of Azure plus server products, that high teens number was obviously a lot better this quarter. But is that still the framework for the year? And then actually on Windows, we've seen such elevated strength on the Pro side, I think because of the corporate Win 10 cycle. And I wondered if you could just, as we think about the back half of the current fiscal year and we come up against some tougher comps, I wondered if you could just help us sort of think through that and how we should think about the puts and takes on that refresh cycle? Thanks.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Sure. On the first question on the server and product KPI, obviously the strong performance this quarter gives me higher confidence in my commitment to high teens growth in that number. But I'll update that generally longer in the quarter and will give me through Q2 before I make a longer commitment.","And then separately on Windows 10 and the strength we've seen in OEM Pro, and I would also say it mirrors in some ways you're also going to see some of that growth and strength in Windows commercial, so let me answer them a bit together. The Windows 10 Pro strength and I think commercial strength we've seen, we continue to see good signs on the commercial refresh, really security, manageability of modern hardware and software together continues to be a good signal for us.","We continue to watch the end of support. It's really critical for us for customers to have a terrific experience as we upgrade them and ask them to move to Windows 10 with a lot of value. That end of support is about five quarters away, so we'll continue to expect good signal and good demand in that Pro segment. And it should, to your point, match increasingly the market and we do get to some slightly bigger comps in H2 which I would agree with.","But I don't want to diminish the signal because the signal is demand is very good for Windows 10 and upgrades in modern hardware when they realize the benefits. And so even if you have a tougher comp, I think the demand signal and our opportunity to continue to sell Microsoft 365 in that process and then upgrade to Office 365 as they do deployments is a big opportunity for us to excel.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much.","Michael Spencer - Microsoft Corp.","Great. Thanks, Ross. Operator, this will be our last question. We'll take it now please.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Brad Robert Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks very much. Maybe one for Satya. Satya, as you think about the Dynamics business going forward, how do you weigh the potential need to do a larger acquisition there versus just organic development or small tuck-ins? Thanks.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah. I mean overall, I feel very, very good about the opportunity ahead in business applications for us. And I think about the combination of both Dynamics 365 as well as what we're doing on the LinkedIn side. They all represent our participation in business applications. And the thing that I \u2013 what's happening out there in the marketplace is, as things become more digital, there is in fact more need for business process automation.","At the same time, there is a need for the application suite to be built very differently. And that's where I think we have an architectural advantage again with Dynamics 365. It's much more modular, it's modern, it's extensible with this power platform that gives us the ability to do things for customers and serve them in ways that is very differentiated. So that's our primary focus. We'll always look at opportunities outside. But in a time when there is a real fundamental shift in the category when it comes to both business models and technology, we feel we're well positioned to ride that.","Brad Robert Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","[0JNPYG-E Michael Spencer]","Thanks, Brad. That wraps up the Q&A portion for today's earnings call.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Chris Suh, General Manager, Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are: Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. On our website, microsoft.com\/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.","Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's fourth quarter performance in addition to the impact of these items and events had on financial results.","Additionally, any mention of operating expense refers to segment operating expenses as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q, which includes research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative, but excludes the impact of integration and restructuring charges. As a reminder, in May we announced plans to further streamline the phone hardware business. During the fourth quarter, restructuring and related impairment expenses were $1.1 billion.","All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying business has performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. At the segment level, we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to recent changes to our segment reporting groupings, we are not able to provide segment-level constant currency operating expense growth and consequently cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant currency operating expense and operating income growth at the companywide level.","We'll post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until July 19, 2017.","During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Chris, and to everyone on the phone for joining. I want to thank all the Microsoft team members and partners who contributed to a successful year. We are proud of what we achieved and particularly how we are positioned for new growth. Today, Amy and I will share our fourth quarter results and our perspective on the year ahead.","We delivered $22.6 billion in revenue this quarter, an increase of 5% for the quarter in constant currency. This past year was a pivotal one in both our transformation and in our partnerships with customers who are also driving their own digital transformation. Our progress is best captured in the results of our three ambitions, starting with Productivity and Business Process. In a world of infinite information but finite attention and time, we aim to change the nature of work with digital technology. In pursuit of this ambition, we continue to add value to our products, grow usage, and increase our addressable market. Along these lines, let me start with Office 365 and then move to Dynamics 365.","In the last quarter, we advanced our collaboration tools. We launched Microsoft Planner, which helps teams manage operations, as well as Skype Meetings, which is aimed at helping small businesses collaborate. In June, we further strengthened our security value proposition with the release of Advanced Security Management.","Lastly, we continue to add intelligence in machine learning to Office to help people automate their tasks and glean insights from data. These advancements helped to drive increased usage across enterprises, small and medium businesses, and consumers. In the enterprise, Office 365 Commercial seats grew 45% year over year, and revenue grew 59% in constant currency. Also 70% of our Office Enterprise agreement renewals are in the cloud. Innovative companies like Facebook, Hershey's, Discovery Communications, Cushman Wakefield all adopted Office 365 and now see how transformative this service can be for their own business.","We are enthusiastic about the early feedback and growth opportunity from companies using our newly released Office 365 E5, which includes powerful security controls, advanced analytics, and cloud voice. These customers tell us that they love the simplification that comes with standardizing across all of our productivity workloads.","We see momentum in small and medium businesses, with a growing number of partners selling Office 365, now up to nearly 90,000, a 25% increase year over year. We continue to grab share and adding over 50,000 customers each month for 28 consecutive months.","We also see momentum amongst consumers, with now more than 23 million Office 365 subscribers. Across segments, customers increasingly experience the power of Office on their iOS and Android mobile devices. In fact, we now have more than 50 million iOS and Android monthly active devices, up more than four times over last year.","Now let's talk about progress with the other pillar of this ambition, Dynamics 365. We are removing any impedance that exists between productivity, collaboration, and business process. This month we took a major step forward with the introduction of Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft AppSource. Dynamics 365 provides business users with purpose-built SaaS applications. These applications have intelligence built in. They integrate deeply with communications and collaboration capabilities of Office 365.","Dynamics 365 along with AppSource and our rich application platform introduces a disruptive and customer-centric business model so customers can build what they want and use just the capabilities they need. The launch of Dynamics 365 builds on the momentum we're already seeing in this business. Customers around the globe are harnessing the power of Dynamics in their own transformation, including 24 Hour Fitness and AccuWeather. Overall, Dynamics now has nearly 10 million monthly paid seats, up more than 20% year over year, and Q4 billings grew more than 20% year over year.","Overall, Business Processes represent an enormous addressable market, projected to be more than $100 billion by 2020. It's a market we are increasingly focused on, and I believe we are poised with both Dynamics 365 and Microsoft AppSource to grow and drive opportunity for our partners.","Across Office 365 and Dynamics 365, developers increasingly see the opportunity to build innovative apps and experiences with the Microsoft Graph, and we now have over 27,000 apps connected to it. Microsoft AppSource will be a new way for developers to offer their services and reach customers worldwide.","Lastly, with Office 365 and Dynamics 365, we have the opportunity to connect the world's professional cloud and the world's professional network with our pending LinkedIn deal. Overall, the Microsoft Cloud is winning significant customer support. With more than $12 billion in Commercial Cloud annualized revenue run rate, we are on track to achieve our goal of $20 billion in fiscal year 2018. Also, nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 companies have at least three of our cloud offerings. And we continue to grow our annuity mix of our business. In fact, commercial annuity mix increased year over year to 83%.","Now let's get into the specifics of the Intelligent Cloud, an area of massive opportunity, as we are clearly one of the two enterprise cloud leaders. Companies looking to digitally transform need a trusted cloud partner and turn to Microsoft. As a result, Azure revenue and usage again grew by more than 100% this quarter. We see customers choose Microsoft for three reasons. They want a cloud provider that offers solutions that reflect the realities of today's world and their enterprise-grade needs. They want higher level services to drive digital transformation, and they want a cloud open to developers of all types. Let me expand on each.","To start, a wide variety of customers turn to Azure because of their specific real-world needs. Multinationals choose us because we are the only hybrid and hyperscale cloud spanning multiple jurisdictions. We cover more countries and regions than any other cloud provider, from North America to Asia to Europe to Latin America. Our cloud respects data sovereignty and makes it possible for an enterprise application to work across these regions and jurisdictions. More than 80% of the world's largest banks are Azure customers because of our leadership support for regulatory requirements, advanced security, and commitment to privacy. Large ISVs like SAP and Citrix as well as startups like Sprinklr also choose Azure because of our global reach and a broad set of platform services. Last week GE announced it will adopt our cloud for its IoT approach.","Next, Azure customers also value our unique higher-level services. Now at 33,000, we nearly doubled in one year the number of companies worldwide that have selected our Enterprise Mobility Solutions. The Dow Chemical Company leverages EMS along with Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics to give its thousands of employees secure real-time access to data and apps from anywhere.","Just yesterday, we announced Boeing will use Azure, our IoT suite, and Cortana Intelligence to drive digital transformation in commercial aviation, with connected airline systems optimization, predictive maintenance, and much more. This builds on great momentum in IoT, including our work with Rolls-Royce, Schneider Electric, and others.","This is great progress, but our ambitions are set even higher. Our Intelligent Cloud also enables cognitive services. Cortana Intelligence Suite offers machine learning capabilities and advanced predictive analytics. Customers like Jabil Circuit, Fruit of the Loom, Land O'Lakes, LIBER already realize the benefits of these new capabilities.","Lastly, central to our Intelligent Cloud ambition is providing developers with the tools and capabilities they need to build apps and services for the platforms and devices of their choice. The new Azure Container service as well as .NET Core 1.0 for open source and our ongoing work with companies such as Red Hat, Docker, and Mesosphere reflects significant progress on this front. We continue to see traction from open source, with nearly a third of customer virtual machines on Azure running Linux.","On the server side, premium server revenue grew double digits in constant currency year over year. New SQL Server 2016 helps us expand into new markets with built-in advanced analytics and unparalleled performance. More than 15,000 customers, including over 50% of the Fortune 500, have registered for the private preview of SQL Server for Linux. And we're not slowing down. We will launch Windows Server 2016 and System Server 2016 later this year.","Now let's talk about the progress in More Personal Computing. We have increased Windows 10 monthly active devices and are now at more than 350 million. This is the fastest adoption rate of any prior Windows release. While we are proud of these results, given changes to our phone plan, we changed how we will assess progress. Going forward, we will track progress by regularly reporting the growth of Windows 10 monthly active devices in addition to progress on three aspects of our Windows strategy: first, deliver more value and innovation, particularly for enterprise customers; second, grow new monetization through services across our unified Windows platform; third, innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs. Let me walk through each.","We continue to pursue our goal of moving people from needing Windows to choosing Windows to loving Windows. In two weeks, we will launch Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which takes a significant step forward in security. We are also extending Windows Hello to support apps and websites and delivering a range of new features like Windows Ink and updates to Microsoft Edge. We expect these advances will drive increased adoption of Windows 10, particularly in the enterprise, in the coming year. We already have strong traction, with over 96% of our enterprise customers piloting Windows 10.","Next, as we grow our install base and engagement, we generate more opportunity for Microsoft and our ecosystem. Bing profitability continues to grow, with greater than 40% of the search revenue in June from Windows 10 devices. Bing PC query share in the United States approached 22% this quarter, not including volume from AOL and Yahoo!. The Cortana search box has over 100 million monthly active users, with 8 billion questions asked to date.","We continue to drive growth in gaming by connecting fans on Xbox Live across Windows 10, iOS, and Android. Just this quarter we launched our Minecraft Realm subscription on Android and iOS. Overall engagement on Xbox Live is at record levels, with more than 49 million monthly active users, up 33% year over year. At E3 we announced our biggest lineup of exclusive games ever for Xbox One and Windows 10 PCs. And we announced Xbox Play Anywhere titles, where gamers can buy a game once and play it on both their Windows 10 PC and Xbox One. We also announced two new members of the Xbox One console family, the Xbox One S and Project Scorpio.","The Windows Store continues to grow, with new universal Windows apps like Bank of America, Roku, SiriusXM, Instagram, Facebook, Wine, Hulu, and popular PC games like Quantum Break.","Finally, we are innovating in new device categories in partnership with OEMs. Our hardware partners are embracing the new personal computing vision, with over 1,500 new devices designed to take advantage of Windows 10 innovations like Touch, Pen, Hello, and better performance and power efficiency.","Microsoft's family of Surface devices continues to drive category growth, and we are reaching more commercial customers of all sizes with the support of our channel partners. We recently announced new Surface enterprise initiatives with IBM and Booz Allen Hamilton to enable more customer segments. Also in the past year, we grew our commercial Surface partner channel from over 150 to over 10,000.","Lastly this quarter, more and more developers and enterprise customers got to experience two entirely new device categories from Microsoft Surface Hub and Microsoft HoloLens. While we are still in the early days of both of these devices, we are seeing great traction with both enterprise customers and developers, making us optimistic about future growth.","In closing, I want to reflect on the opportunity ahead of us. Simply put, businesses will not just use digital technologies, but they will become digital companies. This generates enormous opportunity for Microsoft and our partners. We are the ones who can empower digital transformation across all industries, companies, and geographies with our technology and platforms.","With that, I'll hand it over to Amy to go through this quarter's results in greater detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you after that to answer questions","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $22.6 billion, up 2% and 5% in constant currency. Gross margin was flat but up 4% in constant currency. Operating income this quarter declined by 3% and grew 6% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $0.69, increasing 11% year over year or 27% in constant currency.","Across most markets, our execution and results were generally as expected, with some strength in the U.S. But we did see additional softness in Brazil, the Middle East, and Africa, which were impacted by macroeconomic headwinds.","From a seasonality perspective, the fourth quarter is always an important one for our Commercial business. Our results were strong, as our sales teams led with our cloud offers. Healthy renewals helped to drive double-digit annuity performance in constant currency. Our total annuity mix reached 83%, up one point year over year. While our Commercial Cloud continued to drive a higher annuity mix overall, we also had better than expected transactional revenue performance, as products like Office 2016 and SQL Server 2016 generated more deal volume.","The dollar volume of expiring enterprise agreements was smaller this quarter than last year. On that base, our commercial bookings increased 4% in constant currency, driven by customer preference for our cloud offers. Commercial unearned revenue slightly beat our expectations at $24.6 billion or 8% growth in constant currency. Our contracted-not-billed [CNB] balance exceeded $25.5 billion. As Satya called out earlier, our Commercial Cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeded $12.1 billion, growing more than 50% year over year. Additionally, more than 70% of customers who signed enterprise agreements this quarter attached cloud offerings. Our Commercial Cloud gross margin was 42%, declining year over year, driven by investments for cloud capacity, deployment, and support.","Now let's turn to company gross margin performance. We were above our COGS expectations due to approximately $200 million of inventory adjustments from the change in our phone hardware business. And as expected, our mix of cloud services revenue continued to increase, resulting in gross margin percentage declines in the Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments. Importantly, gross margin dollars expanded year over year in constant currency.","In Q4, the FX impact on total and segment-level revenue was in line with expectations. FX had a three-point negative impact on Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud results and a two-point negative impact on More Personal Computing results.","As we've noted in previous quarters, we're not able to provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses and therefore segment operating income. This quarter, total operating expenses grew 1% in constant currency, above our expectations due to legal settlements and revenue-driven sales cost. At the company level, our operating income grew 6% in constant currency, as FX had a nine-point impact on our results.","Now let's turn to each segment. This quarter, our Productivity and Business Processes segment delivered results above our expectations, with nearly $7 billion in revenue, an increase of 5% and 8% in constant currency. In Office Commercial, revenue increased by 5% and 9% in constant currency, as Office 365 growth outpaced the shift from our on-premises business.","Our seat growth was driven by broad-based momentum across commercial customers of all sizes. While we generally expect transactional purchasing to continue to decline, results across all products came in higher than anticipated this quarter. Office Consumer revenue increased 19% and 18% in constant currency, outperforming the consumer PC market, driven by seat growth, recurring subscription revenue, and six points of growth from Japan, which had a particularly weak quarter a year ago. And our Dynamics business grew 6%, up 7% in constant currency, with strong billings and seat growth.","Segment gross margin dollars were flat and up 4% in constant currency. The gross margin percentage declined on a higher cloud revenue mix within the segment coupled with an increase in cloud investments. Operating expenses grew 6% from investments in Commercial Cloud sales programs and engineering. As a result, operating income declined 5%.","The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered slightly more than $6.7 billion in revenue, growing 7% and 10% in constant currency. Demand and use of our hybrid cloud offerings led to another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth within server products and cloud services, partially offset by a decline in our Transactional on-premises server business.","Enterprise Services revenue grew 12%, 14% in constant currency, as customer demand for Windows Server 2003 and the support agreement and Premier Services continued this quarter. Gross margin dollars grew 1% and 5% in constant currency. And gross margin percentages declined as cloud mix accelerated. This quarter, operating income declined 17%, driven by investment in sales resources and engineering.","Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing; revenue was $8.9 billion, down 4% and 2% in constant currency. First, our OEM results; our total OEM business grew 11% this quarter, outperforming the overall PC market, which was better than we expected in most markets, including the U.S., the UK, and Germany, partially offset by incremental weakness in India and Russia. OEM non-Pro revenue increased 27%, and similar to last quarter, was driven by a higher mix of premium devices. OEM Pro revenue grew 2%, reflecting a stabilizing commercial PC market and a higher mix of business PCs sold with Windows Pro. Inventory across both OEM Pro and non-Pro remained at normal levels.","Windows volume licensing grew 3% and 9% in constant currency, with ongoing annuity growth. IP licensing declined, impacted by both a decrease in total unit volume and lower revenue per unit.","We continued to execute well in our search business this quarter. And as we committed, Bing was profitable for the full fiscal year, driven by increasing revenue per search and search volume. As expected, devices revenue significantly decreased this quarter. Revenue declined 35%, also 35% in constant currency due to phone, where revenue declined 70% in constant currency.","Surface revenue increased 9% in constant currency, as Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book growth was partially offset by unit declines in our prior-generation Surface 3. And in gaming, revenue declined 9% or 8% in constant currency, driven by lower Xbox 360 unit volume and reduced Xbox One pricing. Our overall gaming ecosystem showed healthy growth with 49 million monthly active Xbox Live users, or a 33% increase, and 4% Xbox Live revenue growth.","Segment gross margin dollars declined 3% or roughly flat in constant currency, as decreases due to Xbox consoles and the phone inventory adjustment were partially offset by our OEM and search results.","Operating expenses decreased this quarter by 13%, based primarily on reduced phone spend and the transition of display advertising sales to AOL, resulting in segment operating income growth of 59%.","Now back to our overall company results. We invested $3.1 billion in capital expenditures, consistent with our plan for accelerated investment, as we added both commercial and consumer global cloud capacity to meet near-term and longer-term customer demand. During the quarter, we continued to rebalance our investment portfolio, which resulted in other income and expense of $267 million from net recognized gains on investments, partially offset by interest expense.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 15% this quarter, lower than we expected. Our income tax expense reflected a favorable mix between U.S. and foreign countries as well as benefits associated with distributions from foreign affiliates. This quarter, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends.","Before turning to next quarter's outlook, I want to share our view on the shape of next fiscal year. My commentary both on the year and next quarter does not include LinkedIn. However, we still expect the transaction to close in the second quarter.","For the full year, we expect the FX impact to lessen throughout the year, assuming current rates remain stable. In H1, we expect a total impact of one point, reducing to zero in H2. The fundamentals of our Commercial business remain strong, and we anticipate that cloud services and healthy renewals will continue to drive high annuity mix.","As I've noted before, our commercial Transactional business is influenced by different dynamics. Most important, it's impacted by a structural transition to the cloud across all workloads. But it's also more sensitive to overall macroeconomic conditions and changes in corporate budgets. We expect volatility, as we saw in both Q3 and Q4 this year, to continue in the next fiscal year.","Before discussing our total company gross margin expectations, let me first address Commercial Cloud gross margin. We expect the Commercial Cloud gross margin percentage and dollars to materially improve next fiscal year. We have invested heavily to build share, expand geographically, and ensure world-class support and reliability for our commercial customers. Going forward, we expect those investments to provide benefits of scale. We also anticipate our cloud capital expenditure growth curve will slow. Given seasonality and revenue mix, Commercial Cloud gross margin will see variability quarter to quarter but an overall trend of material improvement. At the company level, as each cloud service continues to grow and improve its gross margin percentage, our company gross margin should only decline roughly a point in FY 2017.","We now expect our full-year operating expense will be $31.1 billion to $31.4 billion, as we continue to prioritize spend on strategic growth opportunities.","Lastly, our effective tax rate. Our tax rate is impacted by three factors: the proportion of services revenue versus licensing revenue; the geographic mix of revenue; and the timing of equity vests. As our cloud continues to gain momentum, we expect our tax rate to increase. With quarterly variability based on these factors, we anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to be 20% for the full year plus or minus two points.","Now for the outlook for the next quarter. Based on current currency rates and forecasted geographic mix of revenue, we expect two points of negative impact on total revenue in Q1. By segment, the negative impact is two points in Productivity and Business Process, two points in Intelligent Cloud, and one point in More Personal Computing.","We expect Commercial unearned revenue to be within the range of $21.8 billion to $22 billion, in line with historic seasonality. In Productivity and Business Process, we expect revenue to be $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion. We will continue to grow our install base and drive premium mix through offers like Office 365 E5. We anticipate continued transactional declines as customer migration to the cloud accelerates.","In our Consumer business, we will outpace the consumer PC market, but the benefit from Japan's improved results over a weak prior period and the benefit from last year's Office 2016 launch are not expected to repeat.","For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $6.1 billion and $6.3 billion, driven by continued annuity strength across Azure and our hybrid cloud offerings, offset by ongoing declines in our transactional on-premises server business, and moderating growth from support agreements in Enterprise Services.","In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $8.7 billion and $9 billion. We anticipate that our OEM revenue will be more in line with overall PC market trends. Devices revenue will decline again from our actions in phone. Gaming revenue will be driven by the same factors as in Q4. And in search, we expect Bing's growth trajectory to continue. We expect COGS to be $7.5 billion to $7.6 billion, with variability due to device sales.","We expect operating expenses between $7.35 billion and $7.45 billion. We expect other income and expenses to be approximately zero, as realized gains on investments should offset debt expense.","And with that, Chris, let's go to Q&A.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Amy. We'll move now to the Q&A section. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent, thank you, guys, for taking the question and a very nice quarter. I wanted to dig into Azure, maybe one question for Satya and one question for Amy. Satya, you mentioned the Boeing agreement. What was interesting about that is not just a large company moving significant workloads onto Azure. But from my reading, it sounds like there's a distribution side of this agreement that you guys are going to help them distribute some of those applications on a going-forward basis. I was wondering if you could touch a little bit on that. Is that a one-time thing, or is that something that you look to do more often with some of these large companies, moving workloads onto Azure?","And then for Amy, thank you for the additional detail on the cloud gross margin profile on a going-forward basis. When we dig into just Azure, you said in the past that you expect to match the gross margin profile of what we're seeing in Amazon Web Services. Does that commentary still hold? And maybe you can give us a mark-to-market on how you're doing in terms of matching up Azure's gross margin profile to what you're seeing from your top competitor there.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Keith, for those questions, so let me start on the first one. You're absolutely right that one of the phenomena now is that pretty much anyone who is a customer of Azure is also in some form an ISV, and that's no longer just limited to people who are \"in the classic tech industry\" or the software business. That's the same case with GE. It's the same case with Boeing. It's the same case with Schneider Electric or ABB or any one of the customers we are working with because they all are taking some of their assets and converting them into SaaS applications on Azure. And that's something that we will in fact have distribution agreements with.","And AppSource is a pretty major announcement for us because we essentially created for SaaS applications and infrastructure applications a way to distribute their applications through us and our channel. And I think it makes in fact our cloud more attractive to many of them because of that. So we look \u2013 I think going forward, you'll look to see \u2013 or you'll see us do much more of this with many other customers of ours.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And to your question on Azure gross margins specifically and how we think about that in comparison, let me first say the additional color I gave in terms of comments in terms of material improvement clearly also apply to our Azure portfolio as well. We're encouraged by the improvements we've seen year over year. And we do expect material improvement in FY 2017, both from the benefits of scale and the investments we've made, but importantly also in the revenue trajectory we're seeing and the makeup of that revenue. Boeing's agreement is one such agreement in terms of embedding a premium service at a premium gross margin. We signed many of those this quarter that we feel quite good about.","I think I have a strong line of sight to AWS's margin profile and still feel good about the progress we're making, not just on the workloads that are relevant, apples to apples with Azure, but also in our broader cloud portfolio and our ability to have very healthy margins across Dynamics 365 as well as Office 365 in conjunction with many of the innovations we're doing across Azure. So while I am focused on both the workload improvement, I'm also focused on what's possible across the entirety of the cloud. Thanks, Keith.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent, thank you very much.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Keith. We'll go to the next question, please, operator.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. So, Satya or Amy, last quarter the stock was hit in part on a deceleration in your on-premise server product business, and I think your commentary around the Transactional part of that suggested it softened a little bit. I think your tone on this call is a lot better around the Transactional performance, and it looks like that business accelerated a little bit. Perhaps you could explain what changed in the course of the three months to make the transactional piece, at least if I'm hearing you correctly, feel a little bit better. Thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Let me start, and then, Amy, you can add to it. Overall, Karl, the focus for us is in what I describe as this hyperscale-plus-hybrid approach when you think about the current approach, which is pretty unique to us. And the way we track progress is to see how is our annuity growth of our server business, and how is our cloud growth. And if you look at this last quarter, our annuity grew double digits and our cloud grew triple digits. And that's a pretty healthy growth rate, and that's something that by design both in terms of the technical architecture as well as the traction we have in the marketplace and our sales efforts and so on are playing out well, and we are very bullish about that going forward.","The Transactional business is much more volatile because of the macro environment, IT budgets, and also the secular shift to the cloud. The question again that gets asked is about the cannibalization. But if you look at Boeing or you look at any of the other examples that I talk about when it comes to the cloud, our servers never did what these customers are now doing in our cloud. So at a fundamental long-term secular basis, we have new growth, new workloads, and that's what we are focused on, and that's a much bigger addressable market than anything our Transactional Server business had in the past.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Karl. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Amy, in Q3 the Transactional business was weak, and you said that the business bounced back in Q4. Was that just a mere fact of you cleaning up some of the slipped business, or did you see additional strength on top of some of those closed transactions on the Transactional business in Q4?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Brent. Let me split your question into two components. The first thing really that I think Satya and I both focus on every quarter, every month, is how much of our business are we continuing to shift to annuity and specifically to the cloud. We structure all of our motions at this company, from how we engineer to how we do our go-to-markets to how we think about sales engagement to how we do our investments, fundamentally toward that long-term structural transition in the market.","And so to your question on Transactional performance, there were some deals that didn't get done in Q3 that got done in Q4, and there were some deals done in Q4 on the Office side with large companies that I'm thrilled by. But at the same time, we still will focus on those deals moving to the cloud over time. And so this volatility that we are going to see because of macro and because of budget constraints, especially on Transactional, we will focus on because we expect excellent execution and have accountability to do that in the field. But our first priority, every time, is to make sure we are focused on annuity growth and digital transformation at our company, which is best done through that motion.","Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Just to be clear, Amy, in terms of the sales motion, are they incented more towards cloud versus Transactional going into this year?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Yes.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Absolutely.","Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Brent. We'll move to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Satya, I had a question for you on Azure. I was just wondering if you could talk about the percentage of Azure revenue coming from ISVs. And then how do you see this helping you compete with AWS? And can you talk about why these partners may be choosing you over the competition? Thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Sure, let me take that second part in terms of what is our differentiation. And I think in my remarks, I pointed out the couple of dimensions. But overall, I believe this hyperscale plus hybrid architecturally helps us a lot with enterprise customers because we meet them where their realities are today and also the digital transformation needs going forward, so that's one massive advantage we have.","The second area for us is also the nexus between what's happening in Office 365, Dynamics 365, AppSource. And in fact, this last quarter, some of the most strategic announcements were all around our application platform. At our partner conference, there was a significant amount of excitement with the tools that we announced like PowerApps and Power BI, Azure functions and Flow. These are tools that our developers and system integrators and solution partners will use in order to be able to customize applications around Azure. And so to me that's another huge advantage and a competitive differentiation for us.","And then lastly, we have the best support for what I would say is the most open platform for all developers. Not only is .NET first class but Linux is first class, Java is first class. Azure Container service cuts across both containers running on Windows, running across Linux. So again, it speaks to the enterprise reality. So those would be the places where we are fairly differentiated, and that's what you see us gaining both for enterprise customers and ISVs.","The question you asked is an interesting one, which is if I had to slice it by classic ISVs, it would be one-third or so of our revenue. But the thing that \u2013 the first question that Keith asked is probably more indicative of what's happening, which is every customer is also an ISV. So every customer who starts off consuming Azure is also turning what is their IP in most cases into an ISV solution, which ultimately will even participate in AppSource. So at least the vision that we have is that every customer is a digital company that will have a digital IP component to it, and that we want to be able to partner with them in pretty unique ways.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","I would also add, Heather, the importance of the motion in our field organization and go-to-market with ISVs is incredibly high in terms of selling with and along with those ISVs, both making them successful and thereby helping us build very important scale through the platform. And we've seen a lot of improvement in the past four quarters on that front.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Heather.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Heather. We'll move to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Amy, how much of the weakness in Transactional has been caused by clients that otherwise would have bought a license now under annuity? In other words, are you driving the Transactional weakness to some extent by driving the growth in on-prem? And then I have a quick follow-up for Satya.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","It's probably not exactly how I would say it, Mark. I do believe that every conversation that we're having with customers is cloud-led. That cloud-led conversation and making a plan for customers to best change and transform their own business certainly is a far more in-depth one than on occasion is required by long-time Transactional purchasers, especially in Office, as an example, because what we're talking about now is really pivoting your business for the long term.","And so I'm sure there are examples where that has elongated the sales cycle, for good reason. But I would generally point back and say most of these are driven at the structural level, which is \u2013 structurally over time, on-premises Transactional business will move to the cloud or to a hybrid structure through an annuity revenue stream.","Now over any short-term period, the majority of what we have seen is really either a budget constraint, a macroeconomic change, or people, to the question you've laid out, maybe in the midst of making their cloud transition plan, and maybe that has elongated the sales cycle to an extent. But again, I don't view that as negative performance. I view that as strategic relevance long term inside of digital accounts.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That makes a lot of sense. Thank you.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thanks. Amy, I'm wondering, you saw very strong unearned revenue in the quarter, but I note that you saw contracted backlog that grew sequentially below what a typical June quarter does and commercial bookings that were up about 4% off of a fairly easy comp. And I'm wondering if you could just help us understand the dynamics in new and renewal signings that drove that combination of really strong unearned but somewhat weaker trends in the bookings.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Sure. Strong unearned in particular was actually better than expected Azure billings in the quarter that drove unearned above the high end of our guide, and I think we were quite pleased by that performance.","In terms of CNB, that's the reference I made in my comments to the lower expiry base. Quarter to quarter and year to year, we just have different amounts of contracts expiring. And so this was one of our lower contract bases and was lower than a year ago. So the fact that we were able to grow in that low expiry base is actually very good structural performance.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Walter. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you, two questions on the Office side. First of all, you're obviously reaching very large numbers in terms of the numbers of seats that you have. Can you talk a little bit about what's the seat growth? Because both for Consumer and for Commercial, it seemed to be coming down. Is that the law of large numbers coming in, or is there anything else?","And in the Consumer Office, the Consumer Office performance was very, very strong, and that almost needs to be stronger from transactions because otherwise I don't get to the numbers. Can you talk a little bit about the source of the strength there? Thank you.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Raimo. Let me start with the Office Consumer question. We haven't had a chance to touch on that. And then we'll talk about Commercial seat growth. You're right, the Office Consumer growth still has quite a bit of transactional business to it, even though we have moved, and you saw that growth, the subscriber base, materially.","The growth in quarter versus our expectations was really two things that are transactionally focused. One, the PC market was a little bit better than we thought. And particularly in developed markets, the PC growth was better than we thought. And developed markets are where we see the most transactional business with Consumer Office that impacts in quarter. So the strength from that outperformance or better market in consumer PCs in developed markets is a direct correlation to our performance in Office Consumer. And so that's how to think about that big delta.","The other thing was Japan was a little better. And when Japan is better, it's why you also see the interesting relationship in constant currency. We have a lot of yen exposure in that segment, so the Japan performance being better also helped. And that is a purely \u2013 it's more transactional than even our rest-of-world business. So you're right, Raimo, in terms of what impacted that number in quarter versus the underlying market dynamic.","On commercial seats, listen, we're very proud of that big number, growth number. But you're right, we're also getting a very big base. And so while we feel great about continuing to add seats at that type of rate, converting and adding net new into our install base, you will see that growth rate come down just because the business is getting quite big.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Very clear, thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Raimo. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks very much and good afternoon. Amy, you spoke about a slowdown in the cloud CapEx growth curve in fiscal 2017. I assume you're referring to the growth in absolute dollars moderating and not just the rate of change in percentage terms. But any additional color that you could provide on the company's CapEx requirements over the course of the next year would be appreciated.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Gregg. You're right, my comments are more pivoted toward the absolute dollar amount, which is what I tend to focus on in my comments. So it's a good clarification, and thanks for asking.","In terms of how we think about the absolute numbers, first I should say I think most people assume \u2013 and it is true to a certain extent \u2013 so much of this is the growth in our Commercial businesses across Azure and Dynamics and Office 365, and that's true. But we're also seeing quite good growth in some of the Consumer businesses, which also are built on our cloud infrastructure, Search, some of our gaming assets, our Xbox Live business going forward. And so many of these assets, including increased usage of our consumer properties inside our productivity business and Office, do require capital spend. And so the growth is pretty broad-based to support.","And so as I think about moderation, it is the absolute dollar. It's not due to any change in our aspiration or belief in the growth curve of revenue, and I wanted to be clear on that. It really is about continuing to benefit from scale and engineering improvements that will allow us to do that even as we see broad-based growth.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Gregg. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much for taking my question. Amy, I had one on the same lines on CapEx, and I just wondered if you could provide some insights. We're at 26 data center regions today. I think you have 34 planned, so that would imply we're about three-quarters of the way through that spending cycle. But should we view 34 as a ceiling, or is it possible that we could see further data center regions built out beyond that 34? And then I had one follow-up.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Let me start, and then, Amy, you can add to this. In some sense, Ross, you're trying to ask us to project forward and say what is the legitimate digital security and digital sovereignty needs of all the different types of businesses that we want to serve using the cloud all over the world. The position that we have taken is that we want to serve customers where they are and not assume very simplistically that the digital sovereignty needs of customers can be met out of a fewer data center approach. Because right now, given the secular trend to move to the cloud across all of the regulated industries across the globe, we think it's wiser for us and our investors long term to be able to meet them where they are. And that's what you see us. We are the only cloud that operates in China under Chinese law, the only cloud that operates in Germany under German law. And these are very critical competitive advantages to us.","And so we will track that, and we will be very demand driven. So in this case we're not taking these positions of which regions to open and where to open them well in advance of our demand. If anything, I think our cycle times have significantly come down. So it will be demand-driven, but I don't want to essentially put a cap because if the opportunity arises, and for us it's a high ROI decision to open a new region, we will do so.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And I would add, in addition to the number of regions which Satya is talking about, it's also the capacity inside a region. Much of our spend is, as you note, on some of the infrastructure to put in place when you pick a location. The rest of it is continuing to build out in that location the number of servers and networking equipment required. So there are really two components, and I think Satya has talked about why you would enter a region and its ROI, and there's also the correlation to how many servers and that spend and pace over time based on demand.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much, maybe just one quick follow-up. The server products business that Karl talked about did rebound this quarter, and I think it was up about 4% constant currency for the year. I know you're not guiding that to that number specifically and you talked about potential volatility. But is there any range of outcomes that you're thinking about for that business? Will it grow, is it not clear that it will grow? I'd just love any additional color there. Thank you.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","In terms of server products and services, I tend to think of it as the all-up growth. It's really about growing the cloud, growing the hybrid, and then whatever happens in the Transactional business happens. And I'm very proud actually of the growth this quarter. I think our guide for Q1, given some of the headwinds we expect in terms of support agreements that we talked about in Enterprise Services, continues to expect very healthy double-digit annuity growth, driven fundamentally by Azure in that segment.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Ross.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks again. Congrats.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","We'll go to the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Satya, around the LinkedIn announcement, there was a lot of discussion about some of the opportunities to use the assets and information there to help build your HCM and CRM capabilities. And then we fairly shortly afterwards got the announcement of Dynamics 365 and AppSource. So maybe given the amount of discussion here, you could comment on the evolution of the strategy and your thought process around broad enterprise application.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks for that question. So I look at what we are doing with Office 365, Dynamics 365, AppSource, LinkedIn as all being part of one strategy. So the move to the cloud for our customers and for us is not just about a new way of delivering the same value just as a SaaS service. It's really the transformation from having applications that are silos to becoming more services in the cloud where you can reason about the activity and the data underneath these services to benefit the customers who are using these services. So that's what this notion of a graph represents.","So when somebody moves to Office 365, their graph, their people, their relationships with other people inside the organization, their work artifacts all move to the cloud. You can connect them with all the business process data that's in Dynamics 365, but not just in Dynamics 365 but all the applications in AppSource because business process will always be a much more fragmented market as opposed to just one market share leader by industry, by vertical, by country. And so that's our strategy there.","And now the professional cloud or the professional network helps usage across all of that professional usage. Whether it's in Office 365 or whether you're a salesperson using any application related to sales, you want your professional network there. Of course, it's relevant in recruiting, it's relevant in training, it's relevant in marketing. So that's really our strategy with LinkedIn as the professional network meeting the professional cloud. And so you were right to point out that these are all part of one overarching strategy, and ultimately it's about adding value to customers.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Michael.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks so much. We'll have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, thank you very much. So, Satya, we noticed Office 365 commercial seat growth of 45% produced Office 365 commercial revenue growth of 59% in constant currency, so a favorable spread of about 14 points suggesting ASP growth. I'm wondering if you could help us understand the drivers both now and into the future, particularly in terms of the initial response to the E5 plan, and also which products you think are driving the strength as you consider across Exchange, Skype for Business, Power BI, Yammer, SharePoint, et cetera.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Let me start and, Amy, you can add to it. Overall, I would say even in this last year, even just a broader spread of E3 has driven a lot of the growth. And then of course, we are very excited about E5, but they're very, very early days of E5. And E5 value proposition across all three of the areas, whether it's cloud voice or analytics or security are all three massive areas for us. And I would say if anything, the initial data from our customers around security is gaining a lot of traction. But at the same time, one of the things that customers are looking for is making an enterprise-wide architectural decision across all of the workloads.","So E3, E5, and higher penetration of this is what's going to drive ASP growth. And you will look \u2013 you can see \u2013 you'll see us add more value to these packages as time goes on as well because our R&D is focused on that, which is how do we take these buckets of value creation and reinforce them with all of the future R&D as well.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Great.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. On our website, microsoft.com\/investor, you could find are earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.","Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP measures exclude the net impact from revenue deferrals and the impact of integration and restructuring charges. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's third-quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results.","All growth comparisons we make on the call relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. At the segment level, we provide constant currency growth for both revenue and gross margin. However, due to recent change to our external reporting segments, we aren't able to provide segment level constant currency operating expense growth, and consequently cannot derive constant currency segment operating income either. We do provide constant currency operating expense and operating income growth at the company-wide level.","Please note that in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we adopted a new standard issued by the FASB that made certain changes to accounting for stock-based compensation. One of the more significant changes require that excess tax benefits and deficiencies be recorded as part of income tax expense rather than as part of additional paid-in capital. Adoption of the new guidance requires us to reflect adjustments as of July 1, 2015, and hence impacts our previously reported quarterly results for fiscal 2016. You can find additional information in the financial summary slide deck and in our 10-Q filing.","We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available.

These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and then the Risk Factor section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Overall, we had a solid quarter. Amy and I look forward to sharing more about the results and what's ahead. We delivered $22.1 billion in revenue with an operating income of $6.8 billion. We exceeded $10 billion in commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate. We're halfway to our FY 2018 goal of $20 billion. This quarter, we surpassed 270 million monthly active devices running Windows 10. We're proud of our progress and look forward to making more as enterprise deployments accelerate.","Now let's get to the specifics of each of our three segments, starting with Productivity and Business Process. We set out to reinvent Productivity and Business Process because we believe that people should get more out of every moment, and organizations should be able to reach new levels of effectiveness. This approach is opening up new growth opportunity for Microsoft in three ways. We can reach more users, enter new markets, and build a developer platform. Let me talk through each.","First, we are reaching new users and strengthening our productivity platform. Consumer subscriptions of Office grew to more than 22 million. Devices with our mobile apps grew approximately four times year-over-year. Commercial Office 365 customers surpassed 70 million monthly active users, and we grew seats by 57%.","Second, we're expanding into new markets such as security, analytics and cloud voice, where we see an opportunity and where we can differentiate. For example, the cyber security market is expanding rapidly, and it's a place where we have unique capabilities, like Advanced Threat Protection, Cloud App Security and Advanced eDiscovery. This combination drove a 35% quarter-over-quarter growth of monthly active users of our premium information protection services in Office 365. A key driver of this growth is our new premium Office 365 suite, E5.","Lastly, we're making Office 365 more than a world-class productivity and communications service. It's becoming a growing platform for developers. There is an incredible amount of value developers can deliver by harnessing the data in this platform. It can be as simple as Starbucks enabling somebody to email a cup of coffee, or it can be as sophisticated as DocuSign streamlining processes for digital signatures based on the understanding of people's availability and organizational hierarchy. We continue to make advances in our developer platform by expanding Microsoft Graph APIs and opening Skype to developers. This is generating developer momentum. In fact, active apps calling on Microsoft Graph APIs are up month-over-month.","In business process application, our Dynamics product line is expanding to include new scenarios, such as IoT, field service, customer self-service and built-in business intelligence and advanced analytics. For example, Ecolab uses CRM online with Azure IoT, not only to help their customers use water systems more efficiently, but also to predict equipment failure and direct field engineers to respond. And JUST EAT in the UK uses Dynamics AX to make it easy for millions of people to order food for take-outs online. These scenarios are driving new growth. Dynamics CRM online seats more than doubled this quarter with over 80% of our new CRM customers deploying in the cloud. We grew Dynamics AX revenue double-digits.","Now let's move to the Intelligent Cloud segment. The cloud is being built into every organization's quest to optimize and grow. With our results this quarter, it remains clear we are one of the two leaders in this market. Azure revenue increased 120% in constant currency, with revenue from premium services growing triple digits for the seventh consecutive quarter. We are innovating in new areas to help organizations digitally transform. We're expanding our competitive strength in hybrid computing. We're generating opportunity for developers and partners.","To start, we added more differentiation to high-value services in Azure this quarter in three areas that are top-of-mind for our customers, artificial intelligence, IoT, and business analytics. We expanded Cortana Intelligence Suite, our big data and analytics service that transforms data into predictions and intelligent action. It now includes over 20 cognitive services ranging from object-in-motion recognition to text and linguistic analysis. The IoT market is expanding as companies look to deliver new services and value. Our new Azure IoT suite streamlines the process of building IoT applications and acts as a hub for managing and monitoring millions of assets.","Each week, more than 2 trillion IoT messages are processed by Azure, and analytics is another rapidly growing market where Power BI has more than 200,000 customers and 5 million users. Companies like Toyota, BMW, Johnson Controls are all using Cortana Intelligence Suite, Azure IoT and Power BI to transform themselves as well as their industries. Siemens is also using Azure to connect and analyze data from medical imaging systems around the world, helping providers in their effort to transform healthcare. We are the only cloud provider that helps companies embrace the cloud on their own term, and we continue to innovate in areas that make it easier for our customers, including the recently released preview of Azure Stack and by bringing SQL Server to Linux.","A critical part of this flexibility is giving customers tools to secure their data wherever it is, on-premise, in the cloud and across all their devices. We continue to grow in this market with Enterprise Mobility Suite customers more than doubling to over 27,000. This is three consecutive quarters of triple-digit customer growth. This growth is driven by strong adoption across cloud services. For example, more than one-third of our Office 365 Enterprise Suite installed base has also purchased Enterprise Mobility Services.","And as I said earlier, perhaps the biggest impact we can make is to empower developers. To this end, we're making Windows and Azure the very best environments for developers who want to build applications that run across multiple platforms. Our acquisition of Xamarin and the inclusion of Bash in Windows 10 will make it easier to build intelligent experiences and apps that leverage our cloud and run natively on Windows, iOS and Android. We are excited to announce at Build that we are making Xamarin freely available as part of Visual Studio.","Now let's move to More Personal Computing segment. We are reinventing personal computers and personal computing for the mobile first, cloud first world. In this world, what matters most is the mobility of a person's experience, not any one single device. As I shared last quarter, we think about our strategy along three lines. First, we will deliver more value and innovation, particularly for enterprise customers. Second, we will grow new monetization through services across the unified Windows platform. Third, we will innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs.","First, let me talk through the innovation we're delivering that brings new levels of ease-of-use, trust, productivity to Windows and specifically more value to our enterprise customers. What we hear most frequently from these customers is how much they value the advanced productivity security and device management capabilities in Windows 10. In fact, this is what led to one of the most security-conscious organizations in the world, the United States Department of Defense, to upgrade all of their PCs and mobile devices to Windows 10 this year. We see this trend across our enterprise customers with 83% of them in active pilots today. We believe enterprise deployments will continue to drive up the over 270 million monthly active devices running Windows 10. The number of Windows 10 devices is twice that of Windows 7 over the same time period since launch.","At Build, we gave people more reasons to upgrade with the announcement of new features in Ink and Touch interfaces as well as Windows Hello biometric security and deeper integration with Cortana, all coming this summer with a Windows 10 anniversary update.","Second, we are seeing new monetization through services across the Windows platform. Windows Store received more than 5 billion visits. We are exciting about compelling new apps coming from Disney, Square Enix, Bank of America, King, Instagram and many others. We grew the number of universal Windows app developers 60% this quarter. In search, developers have already built over 1,000 apps designed for Cortana. These new third-party experiences and the 6.3 billion questions people have asked are helping make Cortana smarter and driving search engagement. Over 35% of our search revenue last month came from Windows 10 devices.","In gaming, monthly active users of Xbox Live grew 26% year over year, driven by the growth of Xbox One and Windows 10. Xbox One continues to outpace prior generations in both reach and engagement. At the same time, we continue to create synergies between Xbox One and Windows 10 devices. Bringing top Xbox One titles to Windows Store helped grow gaming hours on Windows 10 by 50% over last quarter. And starting this summer, universal Windows apps will run on Xbox One, making it easy to build applications and games that work across devices.","Third, we continue to innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs. We are pleased with the results from Surface this quarter. This is our second $1 billion revenue quarter for Surface in a row, and it's the first outside of a holiday period. Revenue grew 61% in constant currency, driven by Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. Certainly consumers value these devices, but where we see the strongest momentum is through adoption in the commercial space, with particular strength in financial services, manufacturing and healthcare.","Our OEM partners are also innovating in new device areas for consumers and business customers. In particular, they too are seeing growth in the 2-in-1 device category. As you can see, we think about renewing growth of Windows, we think broadly about where growth can come from. We see early signs of success in Windows driving increased engagement in monetization of services like search, Store, and gaming as well as new sources of revenue from Surface. As we build premium devices and premium categories, we are also stimulating demand across our entire ecosystem.","Ultimately, the largest potential for Microsoft's growth will come through reinvention of personal computers and personal computing as well as the new platforms we create. This broader mobile first, cloud first opportunity cuts across all of our financial segments and technology ambition. And this is what we shared with developers at Build and with business leaders at Envision a few weeks ago. I hope you have had a chance to watch these events as well. We are creating entirely new ways for people to interact with technology and also new ways for them to build technology. HoloLens developer kit is one such example. Organizations around the world like Volvo and NASA are using HoloLens to redefine what it means to build and explore, and Case Western University is redefining how students learn to be world-class surgeons.","Conversational interfaces is another example. We envision a world where people will more naturally interact with their devices in the future through conversation. Imagine simply asking Cortana to book a hotel or being able to order a pizza through instant message and Skype. Conversations will be a new platform that every business, every app and every website will begin to embrace, and we are at the forefront driving this platform shift.","We are building out cloud services and platform to enable every business across every industry to digitally transform themselves and in turn build their own capability to create more digital technology. Empowering people and organizations to thrive in this digital world is central to Microsoft's mission. I am proud of our execution so far and what we have achieved, and I am also grounded in the work ahead of us.","With that, I'll hand over to Amy to go through this quarter's results in greater detail and share our outlook for the next quarter, and I look forward to rejoining you after that to answer questions.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter revenue was $22.1 billion, up 2% and up 5% in constant currency. Gross margin declined slightly but was up 4% in constant currency. We grew operating income this quarter by 1% and 10% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $0.62, flat year over year and up 10% in constant currency. Our effective tax rate was 24%, higher than we anticipated, which impacted our EPS.","From a geographic perspective, our performance in most markets was as anticipated. However, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa were more unfavorable than we expected. In our commercial business, we continued to see healthy fundamentals, which led to a solid quarter of results. Commercial bookings increased 7%, up 9% in constant currency. Our total commercial annuity business had double-digit revenue growth in constant currency and commercial annuity mix reached 86%, up 4 points year over year.","Commercial unearned revenue grew to just under $18.8 billion, up 3% and 8% in constant currency, slightly below expectations due to a higher mix of contracts with more in-period recognition and some deal weakness in the geographic markets mentioned earlier. Our contracted not billed balance again exceeded $25 billion. Most important, as Satya mentioned earlier, our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate surpassed $10 billion. This quarter, more than 65% of customers who signed enterprise agreements attached our commercial cloud offers, up 15 points from last year. Our customers continue to make long-term commitments based on our compelling roadmap.","Our commercial cloud gross margin was 45% this quarter, declining year over year. This decrease was driven by a higher mix of Azure revenue, our ongoing investment in data center capacity and geographic expansion, and a small FX headwind. As I mentioned last quarter, even as we are focused on gross margin improvement within each of our key cloud services, our total commercial cloud gross margin will reflect the dynamics of changing revenue mix and targeted investments.","In Q3, the FX impact of 3 points on year-over-year revenue growth was generally in line with the guidance, as the recent weakening in the US dollar created less than 1 point of impact overall and across segments. As Chris explained earlier, we're not able to provide constant currency impact at the segment level for operating expenses, and therefore segment operating income. In general, FX had a favorable impact of 1 point on operating expenses at the total company level. As expected, our company gross margin percentage declined this quarter, driven by our accelerating mix of cloud services and our Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes segment, offset by higher gross margin percentage performance from products within More Personal Computing.","Now to our segment results. This quarter our Productivity and Business Processes segment delivered in line with our expectations, with $6.5 billion in revenue, increasing 1% and 6% in constant currency with higher annuity mix offsetting lower transactional weakness results due to a weaker PC market. In Office commercial, revenue was flat and grew 7% in constant currency, driven by continued momentum in Office 365 with installed base growth across Office, Exchange, SharePoint and Skype workload.","Our channel again expanded this quarter as more than 85,000 transacting partners sold Office 365 to small business customers. Office consumer revenue increased 3% and 6% in constant currency due to an increasing base of subscribers and recurring subscription revenue. And our Dynamics business grew 4%, up 9% in constant currency. We more than doubled CRM online seats for the sixth consecutive quarter. Segment gross margin dollars declined 4%, up 1% in constant currency. As we've discussed, gross margin percentage declined on a higher cloud services revenue mix within the segment. Operating expenses decreased 1%, even as we continued engineering investments in our Office 365 and Dynamics businesses and prioritized spend in growth areas like E5, security and voice capabilities. As a result, operating income declined 7%.","The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $6.1 billion in revenue, which grew 3% and 8% in constant currency, just at the low end of our guidance range. Our total server products and cloud services revenue was flat year over year and increased 5% in constant currency against a prior year comparable that had 16% constant currency growth. This quarter, our enterprise server customers continued their commitment to our hybrid cloud platform offerings, which resulted in double-digit annuity revenue growth in constant currency, including over 100% growth in Azure. That growth was partially offset by a larger than expected decline in our transactional on-premise server business, which impacted the in-quarter results. Enterprise services continued to perform well, with 11% revenue growth or 15% in constant currency driven by customer demand for our support services and solutions.","Gross margin declined 2% and grew 3% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage declined as cloud mix accelerated, offsetting margin improvements in Azure and enterprise services. In response to enterprise customer demand, and to increase our share in the cloud market, we grew operating expenses by 13% through Azure-focused investments across engineering, additional sales and marketing capacity and the acquisition of Xamarin. This quarter, operating income declined 14%.","Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing. Revenue exceeded our expectations at $9.5 billion, up 1% and 3% in constant currency. First, our OEM results. Our total OEM business declined 2% this quarter, outperforming the overall PC market, which was weaker than we expected. OEM non-Pro revenue increased 15%, driven primarily by a higher than expected mix of premium devices. OEM Pro revenue underperformed the commercial PC market, declining 11% due to the higher inventory level in Q2 that I mentioned in my last earnings commentary. Windows volume licensing grew 6% in constant currency and IP licensing continued to decline, impacted by both a decrease in total unit volume and a higher mix of lower royalty units.","As expected, devices revenue decreased this quarter. Revenue declined 11%, or 9% in constant currency, primarily due to phone, where revenue declined 46% in constant currency. Additionally, sell through of our Lumia products was weak, and we exited the quarter with relatively high channel inventory. As Satya mentioned, momentum in our Surface business continued as revenue increased 56%, or 61% in constant currency with strong commercial and consumer demand for our Surface lineup. Overall, device gross margin dollars grew and gross margin percentage improved, primarily driven by a shift to our higher gross margin Surface portfolio. Our search business remained strong this quarter, with growth driven by higher revenue per search and higher search volume. We again had US PC share growth and search continued to be profitable.","In gaming, revenue grew 4%, or 6% in constant currency with continued progress in the monetization of our installed base. We saw higher revenue from Xbox Live, driven by both higher volumes of transactions and higher revenue per transaction, as well as an increase in revenue from our gaming studios. As expected, Xbox hardware revenue declined, mainly driven by lower Xbox 360 consoles sold and lower Xbox One pricing. Segment gross margin increased 2%, or 6% in constant currency, driven primarily by gross margin percentage improvements in devices and gaming. Operating expenses decreased 14%, primarily through our actions in phone, and the transition of our display business to AOL. As a result, segment operating income grew 57%.","Now back to our overall company results. As planned, we accelerated our data center and cloud services investments to meet growing global demand. This quarter, we invested $2.3 billion in total capital expenditures, including an increase of 65% year-over-year primarily for data centers and servers. Other income was negative $247 million, driven by interest expense and net losses on derivatives, partially offset by dividends, interest income and net recognized gains on investments.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24%, higher than we expected, which reflected the changing mix of revenue across geographies, as well as an accelerating shift in revenue from software licensing to cloud services. The rate for the quarter included a catchup adjustment from Q1 and Q2, reflecting the new full year \u2013 the new expected full year non-GAAP effective tax rate. This quarter, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","Now let's move to the outlook. First, on FX. Consistent with our guidance last quarter, we still expect FX to negatively impact year-over-year growth in Q4 by 3 points. By segment, we expect 3 points of impact on Productivity and Business Processes, 3 points Intelligent Cloud and 2 points in More Personal Computing.","Second, our commercial business. Our commercial business will be on pace for continued strong annuity growth, as both new and existing enterprise customers adopt and use our growing portfolio of cloud services. Even with projections of tightening global IT spend and currency headwinds, we expect commercial unearned revenue to be $24.3 billion to $24.5 billion, in line with historic seasonality. We remain on track toward our $20 billion commercial cloud revenue run rate goal, as we grow revenue, drive consumption and focus on gross margin improvement in Office 365, Azure and Dynamics Online. Finally, we will continue our investment in data centers and capital equipment to address customer demand for our cloud services.","With that, let me share our view by segment. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to be $6.5 billion to $6.7 billion, with continued annuity shift to the cloud, offsetting the impact of a weaker PC market on our transactional business and our consumer and commercial segments. In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion, driven by annuity growth, offset by continued transactional weakness. In more Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $8.7 billion and $9 billion.","Here's a bit more detail on its individual components. In Windows, we expect our OEM Pro revenue to be largely in line with the commercial PC market. Our non-Pro revenue is expected to be above the consumer PC market, similar to what we saw in Q3, primarily due to the continued benefit from a strong mix of premium devices. In devices, we anticipate continued momentum and growth for Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, particularly with business customers. For phone, we expect year-over-year revenue declines to steepen in Q4 as we work through our Lumia channel position. In search, we will continue to show healthy revenue growth with full-year profitability.","Finally in gaming, we expect to see continued healthy user engagement on our Xbox platform, and we look forward to E3, where we will announce new titles for the upcoming fiscal year. We expect COGS to be $7.8 billion to $7.9 billion, and we expect operating expenses between $8.2 billion and $8.3 billion. Our full-year guidance is now down to $31 billion, to $31.1 billion as we concentrate our investments in engineering and technical sales to accelerate our cloud growth heading into the next fiscal year.","We expect other income and expenses to be negative $200 million in Q4. This includes the net cost of hedging and interest expense offset by dividend and interest income. For tax, based on trends reflected in this quarter's full-year catchup adjustment, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be 21% and 23%. We expect our full-year effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%.","Before I wrap up, I'd like to share a few directional comments on fiscal 2017. This year we saw strong growth in our commercial cloud portfolio, and we grew our annuity penetration across our commercial business. We anticipate those trends will continue next fiscal year, driving our revenue growth and impacting our gross margin percentages. As we continue to unify and modernize our Windows installed base across our consumer and business customers, we will advance our progress in our post-sale monetization scenarios and execute on the Windows 10 enterprise deployment opportunity.","Throughout fiscal 2016, our significant investment in engineering, sales and marketing has positioned us to support our customers' digital transformations and to innovate in device form factors, like Surface and HoloLens. In fiscal 2017, we expect to continue that investment and reallocation process. Therefore, total operating expenses should be flat to up slightly. I look forward to sharing more on our FY 2017 plans in July.","With that, Chris, let's go to Q&A.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to Q&A. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.","Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Amy, just on the Q4 guide, you're guiding below the Street on many of the individual line items on the top line. I'm just curious, is this more the shift to the cloud? Or is there some demand execution issues that you are seeing in the business?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Brent. It's really as we talked about transactional weakness in Productivity and Business Process. We're continuing to expect strong annuity growth. We're continuing to expect a strong mix to the cloud. We're continuing to expect ARPU increases, premium mix increases and installed base growth. So really in that segment, it's the PC weakness in our traditional transactional Office business that's impacting that segment. In Intelligent Cloud, it's a very similar dynamic. We're expecting renewal rates to remain strong as they've been. We're expecting the mix to Azure to continue to grow. We're expecting annuity double-digit revenue growth and again it's the transactional weakness that you're seeing overall as well as the very specific geo weakness we saw which I called out earlier. And in More Personal Computing, the largest change in that segment is frankly the phone. So I would really focus on that in that segment. The rest of it, frankly, is quite good.","Brent Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Brent. We'll take the next question now, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks guys for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. I just want to focus in on Office there. Obviously you call that Office 365 commercial suites you're growing 57% year-over-year, so very consistent with what your last quarter was. And Satya, you mentioned the mix shift as well with the release of E5. Why don't you just provide some color there, sort of I guess a grade of kind of where you are right now and then as you're contemplating guidance for Q4 and then kind of thinking about 2017, how should we think or how are you guys thinking about sort of that Office 365 transition there sort of units and pricing?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","I can start and then Amy can add. Overall the thing that we are most focused on with Office 365 is how do we make sure that we have the Office 365 end points everywhere and good usage. And I talked about how the mobile end points has been growing and the mobile usage has been growing. I also talked about the 70 million monthly active users of Office. So we feel very good about that, which is users with in terms of coverage and usage. The next place where we are very focused on is really the new scenarios and E5 is obviously a big element of it. I talked about in some detail the security value proposition. That is really showing a lot of good traction for us, but we're also seeing traction in analytics and voice.","So we're in the very early innings of E5, but the value proposition and the TAM or the total addressable market of those three scenarios is huge, and so we remain very excited about it. The other thing that I am also sort of excited about when it comes to Office 365 is for the first time, we're opening up Office 365 not just as a end-user and a enterprise tool in the service, but as a developer platform. In its own right, we think of Office as perhaps one of the most strategic developer assets we have and with the Microsoft Graph API and what we see as activity around it, we think about the platform effects of that as also being very key. So that's at least at the macro level how I look at it and, Amy, if you want to talk a little more.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Again, I think the way that shows itself in our financial results is you'd expect to continue to see the strong mix shift to the cloud. You'd expect to continue to see installed base growth as even some of the items I've talked about have more relevance and continue to make us the value prop higher even in small business, which is where you've seen the user adds. I would continue to expect to see ARPU growth as we see E5 have its impact through the year and so think about these same dynamics still for us where we focus on new users and ARPU increases as we shift to Office 365. Those are trends I'd expect to see obviously as we look into 2017.","Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Phil. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Sure. Thank you very much. So if you look at productivity and process and Intelligent Cloud, obviously we're having a margin decrease that's occurring and a good chunk of that is cloud. How should we think about the standalone license business in terms of the margin separated from the cloud side of it?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","The standalone margins on the licensing business have been pretty stable just because transactionally, we understand and continue to bring down the fixed cost base there and any that's required. So I don't feel like you'd expect any material change in those, Mark.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Mark. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you so much. Satya, I wanted to see if you could share a little bit on Azure, just how you're thinking about the competitive positioning versus Amazon, where you think your strengths are versus them. And also as the business continues to ramp at such a fast pace, how do we think about the progression in gross margin? I mean, Amazon gives us operating margins, but I guess I'm wondering is there reason you shouldn't be able to reach similar operating margins with Azure at a similar scale if we went back and looked at the progression that Amazon's been disclosing?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Sure, Heather. Thanks for the question. First of all, when Amy and I think about both our CapEx as well as our OpEx, both at the engineering side as well as on our sales and marketing side, we think about this still at a Microsoft cloud level. Just because if you take something like Enterprise Mobility Suite, that gives you an indication of how, for example, we attach to Office 365 essentially an infrastructure service that has SaaS-like margins, or even some of our application services in Azure that attach to Office developer experiences. So we think about this part more holistically, and same thing with Dynamics.","But having said that, if to your specific question of where our differentiation lies, the first one is hybrid. Most people think about hybrid where they think about the cloud as the edge of their server. We obviously support that with all of our servers. Every server product of ours has cloud enrollment right, whether it be SQL, whether it be Windows Server, and you'll see that increasingly, even in this next wave of servers. But we also think of in fact our servers as the edge of our cloud. That I think is where the world is going to go to, where distributed computing will remain distributers. So Azure's stack is completely unique to Microsoft. No one else who is in the public cloud business at any scale has that kind of capability. So I would say that's another point of differentiation.","So to your point about margins, I feel that we actually will have software licenses with hybrid rights. That's a different margin structure. We will have IaaS services, and you talked about the existence, proof at least from Amazon about what margins at scale can be achieved there. We have PaaS services in infrastructure like EMS that have SaaS-like margins, and then of course we have SaaS services in Office 365. So I think the mix of our gross, or rather that mix will define our long-term gross margin and operating margin for our cloud services. But the mix will also shift each quarter, just because the mix is not a stable mix. We'll see growth in different parts at different times.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Heather. We'll go to the next one, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you guys for taking my question. Amy, when you're talking about the transactional declines, particularly (41:11) and the server portion of that, can you help us understand how much of that is due to maybe more macro factors, weaker overall server spending environment, and how much of that comes from perhaps demand being reallocated towards infrastructure as a service offerings that you guys have in Azure? Is there something of a cannibalization taking place within that transactional business today?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Keith, it's a good question. Let me go through a number of factors that really impact transactional business. First, you're right. There is clearly a macro impact, especially on the transactional business. Transactional businesses tend to be more impacted in emerging markets where we have a higher percentage of non-annuity business that's transactional business. Those have been the weakest markets in this macro environment and specifically some of the geos we called out have more exposure in this place. And so you're certainly seeing the macro impact in the intelligent cloud segment and the server weakness is there.","And because frankly we saw that macro weakness, you have even seen it in terms of server shipments, right. If you look at server shipments, you'd say that's actually a macro statement. We didn't see it in any one particular workload; it's weakness across workloads, which tends to make more sense frankly with a macro or a budget IT spend constraint. And so I actually think between those two items, it's the biggest impact that we've seen in the quarter, and I expect to see it again next quarter, given I don't think the macro or IT spend environment should change in any way between these two quarters.","So I think less about it being cannibalistic because so many of the scenarios in this time period, we've seen the growth we expected. We've seen it across our premium services as well as core compute. I should also say most of the weakness we saw was in the standard workloads, which I think lends itself to again some of those pressures. We also saw, and I would expect annuity shifts there, which is the final component. Our annuity numbers and renewal numbers were very good in Intelligent Cloud. And in fact, they came right where we expected in terms of unearned balances. And so for me, I do tend to think it's a bit more of the macro pressure and budget impacts than it is frankly any other statement or execution.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. That's very helpful.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Keith. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Amy, this one for you. I wouldn't mind asking about the gross margin guidance. If I take the midpoint of your revenue guidance, midpoint of your COGS guidance, it looks like you're guiding to another roughly 200 basis point decline in gross margins in the June quarter, which is about what you did in March. So if we look out to fiscal 2017, I know you touched on it a little bit, but just to be clear, it feels like you're guiding to a further year-over-year decline in gross margins. But sounds like that'll be offset in part by continued good OpEx control. So is that the right way to think about it, and is there any way that you could sort of bracket what the gross margin percentage decline might be in fiscal 2017? You probably don't want to give specific guidance, but maybe some high-level color. Thanks.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Directional. Karl, thanks for the question. And you're right. In general, let me spend a few seconds on that. You're right. We saw about a 200 basis point change this quarter. It's entirely due to the shift to the cloud, both in our Productivity and Business Process segment as well as the Intelligent Cloud segment. Those were the exact same drivers in the gross margin change that we guided to in Q4, and I would expect stability as we've seen it in our More Personal Computing segment.","And so as you think about 2017, with the continued acceleration of our cloud mix and actually continued momentum in annuity, I would expect to see those same pressures continue to exist. And you're right in that our strong operating expense focus, because really, this is the quarter when you've been able to see actually in Q2 and Q3 now us really pivoting that investment in OpEx to our Intelligent Cloud and the opportunity we see there across engineering, sales and marketing. And you're right, we do expect to see and continue to do that as we lead into 2017 within the overall envelope I discussed.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Amy.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Karl. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. Amy, my question just on guidance and your posture on guidance, a two-part question. I think we've seen you give very conservative guidance say for the first half of this year, and in Q3, you ended up sort of putting it all together at the lower end of your guidance. And I'm wondering, your posture just generally around guidance, if it's changed at all, that you're factoring in things differently and we should think about that range going forward. Should it be more like it's been in the past where you've had very conservative assumptions, or more like what you just did here?","And then the second part is, as you look forward maybe towards longer-term guidance and the prospects of giving longer-term guidance, because I don't think I've seen an estimate spread on a company as large as this in a long time, how are you thinking about possibly giving long-term guidance? What are the factors that are influencing your comfort in doing that, or is it more philosophical and it's something you're not going to do, that's not necessarily dependent on your view of the business?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Walter. My philosophical position doesn't change much. I give the guidance that I expect for the quarter and I do it on the earnings call to the best of my ability. What you've seen this quarter is in fact the biggest in-quarter delta for us all the time is the non-annuity performance. And in all of our segments, that is transactional business. That is the most impacted in-quarter by budget changes or macro changes. And so the inherent volatility that you are talking about really is about changes in-quarter that we see and the impact of that.","So I don't think it's a philosophical shift. It's just where you see volatility in-quarter has always been in the transactional side of our business. The guidance we gave and our annuity positions in terms of renewals and where we saw them were exactly, frankly, what we expected with the small exception of the geos that I called out. So I tend to think, I'll talk a little bit about 2017, as I always do, come July, give you all more of a shape to that. But I tend to think I like to focus on where the company is going, which is cloud mix shift, annuity growth, and overall worldview of bringing Windows and the ecosystem growth through MPC.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Okay, thank you, Walter. Thanks. We'll take one more, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital. Please proceed.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks a lot. Amy, I just wanted to go back on the Intelligent Cloud. We did see that deceleration in server product growth, but the comp was very tough, and as you commented, your annuity was up and your deferred growth accelerated. That server product line has grown about 5% constant currency in the last 12 months. I guess the question is, is there any structural reason why, going back to Keith's question, why that would decelerate more ex-macro? And then another question I just had, it's related to this. Can you just remind us in the server product ex-Azure line and in the commercial Office traditional non-365 line, how much is transactional in those two segments? Thank you.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Sure. Ross, let me try to take those. The first question around is there anything structural or different in that server product line, really it has been and is that transactional component. You're right. We continue to see the annuity growth. We continue to see the growth through Azure and the offset to that has been the transactional business. I'm not sure that I would say that there's any structural reason other than, the change in my worldview, other than maybe the budget and macro pressure tend to exert itself on that transactional business. But overall, continuing to see the renewals we've seen, continue to see the cloud growth we've seen, I'm not sure I think of it as a fundamental trajectory change outside of that component we discussed.","In terms of overall, rough orders of magnitude, the Intelligent Cloud segment has the least exposure to the transactional business. It's still less than 20%. But that 20%, right, lends itself in-quarter to the volatility you see. The Productivity and Business Process segment has a bit more transactional exposure just because it has both the consumer and the commercial Office business, which is more attached on a transactional basis to PCs, so it's slightly higher all up.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Ross. We'll go to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Question for Amy. Amy, you've been able to grow your op income on a constant currency basis nicely double digits as you've been investing in the cloud. As you look at the results this quarter, and as you pointed out the op margins in Intelligent Cloud, and business process productivity that were impacted due to shift to the cloud. Do you think that as you look into next year that the cloud business is at scale, that it continues to grow and take share relative to overall revenue? And the transaction business, who knows, it could be a bit of a macro pressure. Do you think that we're at the point where we could continue to entertain a scenario that op income could still continue to grow nicely as it has in the last three, four quarters? Or is there some other structural changes with respect to the margin of the cloud business? Or maybe the transaction business drops off a lot more dramatically that it may be hard to sustain this nice double digit op income at a very high level without going into the details. Thank you.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah, at a very high level, Kash, let me talk about the opportunity. The opportunity for us across what the cloud makes possible for our commercial business and this moment in time that I am a believer in of where companies are going to change their businesses to rely more deeply on technology than they ever have. I believe that our set up for that is the investments we've been making for the past couple years, as well as the investments we're going to make for the next couple. I mean that both in the capital concept, but also in my operating expense line. We've managed to do that by continuing to pivot to what I believe are these very high ROI opportunities, and pivoting away from opportunities where we've had a chance to become more efficient, and the rate of returns are not going to be as high, or the structural growth isn't there.","And so for me, to your point, at a high-level, I think we can continue to drive revenue, especially annuity and cloud revenue. I think we can continue to improve gross margin percentages in the cloud across all the core cloud services. I think that we can grow profit dollars, and I think that we can do that in the OpEx guidance I gave you for 2017, as we continue to pivot to that opportunity. So I think this is one where my optimism, frankly, for the structure of the market in the segment you chose, and my optimism for our positioning within that market is reflected in that investment number that you have seen. And so I would continue to expect to see us do it.","Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","It's good to see that you still expect profit to grow, because this seems like the new Microsoft, where you're balancing the need to invest strategically, but at the same time trying to grow profits in the near-term versus the old Microsoft, where the investments were made but with a more of a longer-term quote-unquote you never knew when the payoff was supposed to going to happen. So it's good to see you emphasize that you're focused on profit growth, notwithstanding the mix of factors that you cannot forecast.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Kash. We'll go to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. Satya, regarding the announcement that you will release your SQL Server database on the Linux platform, I was wondering if you can walk us through your decision tree, just in terms of what you think the potential risks are, and what you think the potential rewards are of reaching for that level of openness, if you will. And just how impactful do you think that that product can be in enhancing Microsoft's share of the database market?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks for the question. So the decision logic was driven primarily by what I would say is the increased competitiveness of SQL Server. If you think about where SQL Server now with this new release, SQL Server 2016, it's become a fantastic database for many, many of the workloads, everything from OLTP to data warehousing to BI to advanced analytics for the Tier 1. This is a capability that's been multiple decades in the work, but here we are with very competitive total cost of ownership price competitiveness, but with a technology that is in many cases, as Gartner talks about, at the top of the charts when it comes to all of these workloads.","So now that we find ourselves at that capability, we're saying look, what's the way to think about all the markets that we can in fact take this product to, and the Linux operating system database market is not something that, which is mostly primarily a Tier 1 segment, is something that we never worked in. And so therefore, we look at that as an expansion opportunity, so we take that. We've already made the call that Azure for Linux is first class. We already have 20 plus points of, or 20%-plus of VMs in Azure are Linux, and we'll all increasingly have Linux be a big share of our percentage of what is happening in Azure. So for the first time now, we have the ability to go to an enterprise and talk about their entire data estate across Windows and Linux. Now people don't really move between operating systems. Those choices have been made, but at the same time, now they have a choice around database, and so we think that that's a very good incremental opportunity for us.","Mark R. Murphy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Mark. We'll have time for one more question, operator.","Operator","Thank you, and our last question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Stewart Kirk Materne III - Evercore ISI","Thanks very much, and thanks for squeezing me in. Satya, I wanted to talk a little bit about just the ISV ecosystem on top of Azure, and where you think that is today, and where you'd hope that potentially to be in 12 months, when we think about the opportunity around sort of platform as a service and building out more enterprise apps. I think you made some comments around some IoT applications there that are now sitting on Azure. What's sort of a good \u2013 what should we be looking for in terms of new partners from survey ISV perspective? You've had companies like [Black Box or Replatforma]. I'm wondering, do you expect that sort of momentum to potentially accelerate as we get in further into the calendar year? Thanks.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah, thanks for the question. I mean, I think the overall for me across all of our product lines, whether it be Windows or whether it be Office 365 or Azure, developer momentum, ISV momentum is super important priority for us, both in terms of our developer evangelism, our product engineering teams, as well as everything that we will do to even create success for our partners through our field sales organization is a top of mind priority. And this is something that Kevin Turner, myself and Amy and all of our leadership team is very focused on. So you will only increasingly see us deliver more design wins there. In fact, I'm looking forward to our partner conference to talk much more about what it is that we will be doing in the coming year to drive more success for our partners and in particular ISVs.","The thing that I'm seeing a lot of is we've had traditional strength with SQL as well as .Net. They are moving a significant number of them to the cloud, and in fact replatting to be even multitenant and cloud native. At the same time, we're also seeing a lot of open source ISVs also be part of the Azure marketplace. If you go up to the Azure marketplace today, you'll see that. So we're not only bringing people who have traditionally worked with us, helping them replat to a completely new model but we're also bringing a lot of new ISVs into the fold as well and that's pretty exciting to see.","Stewart Kirk Materne III - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks a lot.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Great. Thank you, Kirk.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","So that wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Jesse. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.","On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call. As a reminder, this is the first quarter we're reporting our results under the new revenue standard, ASC 606. As we detailed during a conference call we hosted on August 3, the adoption of the standard had several impacts, but most materially, the revenue recognition of Windows 10 OEM licenses and the license component of on-premises annuity contracts.","As we discuss our Q1 results and share our outlook on the call, please keep in mind the following: first, the new standard allows us to simplify the communication of our results by eliminating the non-GAAP revenue reporting; second, there's no change in customer billings, cash flows or revenue recognition for our cloud services, hardware, enterprise services and advertising businesses; and lastly, the quarterly seasonality of our revenue within a given year does change, and we may experience higher quarterly volatility as well.","The prior periods we will reference on this call and in the earnings materials on our IR website have been restated to reflect adoption of this new standard. During our August 3 call, we also translated our outlook for Q1 into the new standard, and all references to expectations on this call refer to that translated guidance. You can find additional information on this accounting change located on the IR website.","All growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We'll also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until October 26, 2018.","During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. We are off to a very strong start in FY 2018, delivering double digit top and bottom line growth and exceeding $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR, outpacing the goal we set just over two years ago. I'm proud of our team's work behind these results that spanned all of our segments.","We now have 120 million monthly active users of Office 365 Commercial. We have more than 530 million LinkedIn members. Dynamics 365 customers grew 40% year over year. Azure Compute usage more than doubled this quarter and revenue grew 90%, and Windows 10 Commercial monthly active devices grew 90% year over year. These results reflect our accelerating innovation as well as increased usage and engagement across all businesses as customers continue to choose Microsoft to help them transform.","Amy will cover our financial results in more detail, but today I wanted to talk about the key areas of innovation and opportunity for growth in 2018 and beyond. Our focus is on bringing our technology and products together into experiences and solutions that deliver new value for customers by galvanizing around five key solution areas.","First, top of mind for every CEO is empowering their own employees for the modern workplace. Microsoft 365 is our core offering to address this $500 billion-plus market. We are bringing together Office 365, Windows 10 and Enterprise Mobility + Security as a complete integrated solution for organizations of all sizes. It represents a profound shift in the way we design, build and deliver our productivity solutions, moving to a people-centered approach, spanning all their devices to unlock creativity and inspire teamwork while simplifying security and management.","This past quarter, we launched a wave of innovation across Microsoft 365. The Windows 10 Fall Creators Update empowers people with new AI-first interfaces, ranging from voice-activated commands through Cortana, inking, immersive 3D content storytelling and Mixed Reality experiences.","Cloud sharing and co-authoring experiences are now natively enabled with OneDrive files on demand. We are making Windows 10 more accessible to everyone with new features like the eye control, which gives people the ability to operate a PC using just their eyes.","You'll see a great lineup of Windows 10 devices this holiday from the new Surface Book 2 to a vibrant range of devices from our OEM partners.","This month, we also introduced Windows Mixed Reality broadly. Mixed Reality, which is a voice, gaze and gesture interface, will fundamentally change the way people and teams collaborate. Our work with Ford is a great example of this promise. Ford's designers are using Mixed Reality to blend 3D holograms digitally with models and physical production vehicles, allowing them to experiment and iterate on design much more quickly.","HoloLens, Windows VR headsets and Microsoft 365 enable any customer to blend physical and digital worlds across devices, empowering people to collaborate in the same shared experience from anywhere in the world. AI is infused across Microsoft 365 in a myriad of helpful ways, making it easier for people to create high-impact presentations and documents, automate routine tasks and search and discover people and content in highly personalized and relevant ways.","Beyond new AI capabilities in PowerPoint, Word, OneNote, SharePoint, we're enabling AI-first workloads like Bing and Cortana using the Microsoft Graph. Soon, you'll be able to search not only the public Internet but also corporate intranet sites, line of business applications and people with Bing for Business, now in private preview. With Cortana, you'll be able to query your calendar and automate tasks like scheduling a meeting or replying to an e-mail using just your voice.","Microsoft Teams is core to our vision for the modern workplace as a digital hub for teamwork, bringing together conversations, meetings and content into a single canvas. We are integrating AI and cognitive services to make meetings more productive for users today and longer-term.","Lastly, Microsoft 365 connects users, devices and SaaS applications into a single control plane to simplify IT management while providing comprehensive security across the entire digital estate. Today's sophisticated threats require AI-based security approaches. Using the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph, we process billions of signals to detect and remediate threats. New conditional access capabilities evaluate risk in real-time based on the user's account, device and application and physical location. Our leading-edge security and management capabilities are just one reason customers trust Microsoft 365 for their modern workplace needs.","Now, I'll turn to LinkedIn and our business applications. From the outset, the priority one was to ensure that LinkedIn, on its own, accelerate its mission and growth while retaining its culture as part of Microsoft. Nearly one year in, we are ahead of plan with LinkedIn contributing positively to EPS ex-purchase accounting in fiscal 2018.","Second, we're seeing record levels of engagement. LinkedIn is on target to surpass 21 billion sessions this calendar year and has seen its fourth consecutive quarter of 20%-plus sessions growth. Engagement across the platform is strong, with 65% year-over-year growth in jobs, visitors across mobile and desktop, 60% growth in feed update views and nearly 40% growth in messages sent, driven by more ubiquitous messaging.","Third, innovation and execution are accelerating in both the business and in the product integrations across Microsoft, with a positive reception to native video, career advice marketplace and this week's launch of smart reply messaging. LinkedIn profile integration in Office 365 delivers rich people insights from both the LinkedIn Graph and the Microsoft Graph. The Microsoft Relationship Sales solution brings together LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Microsoft Dynamics to transform business-to-business sales through social selling.","Dynamics 365 for talent with LinkedIn Recruiter and Learning gives HR professionals a complete solution to compete in the talent marketplace. You'll see more product integration in fiscal 2018 as we continue to accelerate our innovation to connect the world's leading professional cloud with the world's leading professional network.","Now, I'll turn to two areas of our hybrid cloud value proposition, applications and infrastructure and data and AI. We've been focused on addressing the real-world needs of customers with our differentiated approach to the cloud, architecting for hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities and trusted security and compliance. Moreover, customers are choosing the Microsoft Cloud for its operational consistency, productivity and security that spans the entire digital estate, inclusive of Windows 10 security and management, Dynamics 365, Enterprise Mobility + Security and Azure.","Let's double-click on hybrid. To support the emerging intelligent cloud, intelligent edge application pattern, you need a consistent stack across the public cloud and the edge. Merely providing colocation services or connectivity between on-premise data centers and the public cloud is not sufficient to meet customer needs. You need consistency across the development environment, operating models and technology stacks.","Azure provides this consistency across the entire stack, inclusive of identity, data, app platform, security and management at the edge and in the cloud. Our hybrid cloud is one of the reasons nearly every Fortune 500 company has chosen to partner with Microsoft. Costco recently chose Azure as its hybrid cloud platform, and we are excited to partner with them on their digital transformation.","Core currency of any business going forward will be the ability to convert their data into AI that drives competitive advantage. Azure SQL DB makes it possible for customers to take SQL Server from their on-premise data center to a fully-managed instance in the cloud with no code changes. SQL 2017 is now broadly available on Windows, Linux, Docker containers, with everything built in, including the ability to run AI compute close to the data with Python or R.","Azure Cosmos DB is the first globally distributed multimodal database that enables developers to write apps for IoT and other event-based serverless applications. We're accelerating our innovation to help every developer be an AI developer with approachable new tools from Azure Machine Learning Studio for creating simple ML models to powerful Azure Machine Learning Workbench for the most advanced AI modeling and data science. We continue to enhance our cognitive services to give every enterprise powerful building blocks to create their own AI applications.","Finally, we continue to invest in making Azure the most trusted cloud with AI-based security built in. Azure confidential computing enables encryption of in-use data to ensure that information is always under customer control, a first for any public cloud.","Our ongoing data center expansion brings Azure to 42 regions globally, more than any other cloud provider and 69 compliance offerings and the most comprehensive compliance coverage in the industry. And new Azure availability zones provide new levels of resiliency for high-availability apps within a region and across regions.","Now, let me turn to our last solution area, Gaming. We are mobilizing to pursue our expansive opportunity in the $100 billion-plus gaming industry, broadening our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end, from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed.","We will continue to connect our Gaming assets across PC, console and mobile and work to grow and engage the more than 53 million Xbox Live member network more deeply and frequently with new services like Game Pass and Mixer. And we are a few days away from launching the Xbox One X, the most technically advanced and powerful console ever built.","Moreover, we have high expectations for our Gaming business to bring more people to more Microsoft experiences and broaden our engagement and usage scenarios. This means fundamentally rethinking how we measure progress in Gaming. While we continue to innovate across the console, PC and Xbox Live services, we see substantial additional opportunities across e-sports and streaming.","At 20% this quarter, our software and services revenue growth reflects the early-stage potential of this larger opportunity. We also see the opportunity to empower developers who work on console, PC and mobile games to use our cloud infrastructure and services to enhance their game play and community.","Gaming pushes the boundaries of hardware and software innovation, with some of the most CPU and GPU-intensive applications and content, giving us a huge opportunity in the cloud. As one example, PUBG Corp., with the hit game PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS, is not only partnering to make Xbox the exclusive console at launch but is also running on Azure.","In closing, across the company, we are mobilizing to pursue our five core customer solution areas. We are partnering deeply with our customers so that our new technologies and innovations can help them digitally transform, grow and thrive.","Now I'll hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you for the questions.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter revenue was $24.5 billion, up 12% and 11% in constant currency with better than expected performance across all segments. Gross margin increased 15%. Operating income increased 15% and earnings per share was $0.84, increasing 17%. Our strong start to the fiscal year with double digit top and bottom line growth is a result of our consistent execution and ongoing investment in product innovation and sales capacity.","At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 5 points of revenue and gross margin growth and had a 4 point drag on operating income. Excluding the cost of amortization of acquired intangibles, LinkedIn contributed $78 million to operating income. We are confidently ahead of our original financial commitment for LinkedIn. We now expect LinkedIn, ex-purchase accounting, to be accretive to EPS this fiscal year.","Our results were in line with macroeconomic trends, with better than expected performance from large markets like France, Japan and the UK and stabilization in markets like Brazil and Russia. Our sales team and partners delivered strong commercial results this quarter. Multiyear commitments from customers contributed to an 89% annuity mix. On a roughly flat dollar volume of EA expirations, we grew commercial bookings 14% and 9% in constant currency.","Commercial unearned revenue came in higher than we expected at $21.5 billion, primarily from higher Software Assurance billings and FX benefit.","Our commercial cloud business had another quarter of robust revenue growth and material gross margin improvement. Revenue exceeded $5 billion this quarter, growing 56% year over year and gross margin increased 8 points to 57%, with improvement in each cloud service, most notably in Azure.","Our company gross margin was 66%, up 2 points from prior year as sales mix of higher-margin products and services, along with improving cloud margins, more than offset the impact of the growing cloud mix of revenue and LinkedIn amortization cost.","The FX impact of a weaker than expected U.S. dollar increased total company revenue growth by 1 point. At the segment level, FX had minimal impact on Productivity and Business Processes and increased revenue growth in both Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing by 1 point. FX added 1 point of growth to operating expenses this quarter, which grew 16% and 15% in constant currency. LinkedIn contributed 14 points of growth, including $154 million of amortization of acquired intangible expense.","Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes segment grew 28%, also 28% in constant currency, to $8.2 billion with better than expected results due to FX as well as Office commercial, consumer and LinkedIn.","LinkedIn contributed 18 points of growth. Office commercial revenue increased 10% as revenue mix continued to shift to Office 365 Commercial. Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 42% from strong installed base growth and ARPU expansion.","Companies like Lowe's and Devon Energy chose Office 365 to connect their employees and empower them in the modern workplace. And with our channel partners, we added on average more than 50,000 small and medium business customers each month, a trend we have sustained for more than 3 years.","Office 365 Commercial seat growth was up 1 point sequentially to 32% and declined 8 points year over year. We do expect that year over year trend to continue, given the increasing size of the base.","Office consumer revenue increased 12% or 10% in constant currency, driven by recurring subscription revenue and growth in our subscriber base, now at 28 million. Our Dynamics business grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, driven by the revenue mix shift to Dynamics 365. Customers like the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Seattle Seahawks have adopted Dynamics 365 to modernize their business processes. Dynamics 365 grew 69%, same in constant currency, with continued installed base and ARPU growth.","LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was approximately $1.1 billion, a bit better than we expected. Post-acquisition sales execution has been strong with record levels of user engagement. This quarter, LinkedIn sessions again grew more than 20%.","Segment gross margin dollars grew 25% and 24% in constant currency with 15 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $218 million of amortization. Gross margin percentage declined due to the impact of LinkedIn-related amortization.","Operating expenses grew 54% and 53% in constant currency with 49 points from LinkedIn, including $154 million of amortization expense. Operating income increased 3% and 4% in constant currency, with 10 points of negative impact from LinkedIn.","The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $6.9 billion in revenue, growing 14% and 13% in constant currency with better than expected performance driven by hybrid cloud results as well as FX.","Server products and cloud services revenue grew 17%, also 17% in constant currency, with another quarter of double digit annuity revenue growth. Azure revenue grew 90% and 89% in constant currency and Azure premium revenue grew triple digits for the 13th consecutive quarter.","Our unique ability to provide a distributed hybrid model for the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge continues to attract customers to Microsoft. Symantec, the industry's largest security vendor, has adopted a company-wide hybrid strategy with Azure, including delivery of its Norton consumer products to a global community of more than 50 million people. And financial services firms like Bank of America, TD Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation are all using Azure and its data services to improve customer experiences.","Enterprise Services revenue grew 1% and was flat in constant currency as premium support services growth offset declines in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003. Segment gross margin dollars grew 10%, the same in constant currency, and segment gross margin percentage declined due to the increasing cloud revenue mix and lower Enterprise Services margins, partially offset by material improvement in Azure gross margin.","This quarter, operating expenses grew 3%, or 2% in constant currency, from ongoing investments in sales capacity and engineering. Operating income increased 20%, the same in constant currency.","Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue from this segment was $9.4 billion with FX as well as each core business contributing to the segment's better than expected results. Excluding phone, revenue grew 3%, the same in constant currency. Both the commercial and the consumer PC markets were better than we expected, contributing to OEM revenue growth of 4%. OEM Pro revenue grew 7%, ahead of the commercial PC market from a higher mix of premium SKUs and a couple points from timing of license purchases. We continued to see Windows 10 deployment cycles drive commercial customer hardware demand.","OEM non-Pro revenue was down 1%, in line with the consumer PC market and reflecting healthier conditions in key markets like Brazil and Russia. Inventory levels were in the normal range for a pre-holiday quarter. Windows commercial products and services grew 7% and 6% in constant currency, mainly driven by seat growth. We continue to see enterprise customer momentum, with Coca-Cola Company, Her Majesty Revenue & Customs and Rogers Communications choosing Windows 10 for its intelligent security features and advanced management capabilities.","Patent licensing declined this quarter, primarily due to a one-time impact of IP deals signed in the prior year. Search revenue ex TAC grew 15%, the same in constant currency, from higher revenue per search and stronger than expected performance from volume. Our online businesses showed healthy improvement in revenue growth and profitability as we realized the benefits of scale. Our Surface business grew 12% and 11% in constant currency, driven by sales of the new Surface Laptop in both the commercial and consumer segments. We continued to see solid execution through the product lifecycle transition between Pro 4 and our new devices.","Gaming revenue grew 1% and was flat in constant currency as Xbox software and services growth offset declines in hardware. Software and services revenue grew 21%, or 20% in constant currency, driven by continued growth in monetization. Our engaged user base grew 13% to 53 million monthly active users across Xbox One, Windows 10 and mobile platforms. Additionally, new services like Game Pass and Mixer, which create more opportunity for engagement and monetization, showed encouraging early results.","Segment gross margin dollars increased 10%. Gross margin percentage increased primarily due to sales mix shift to higher-margin products and services. Operating expenses declined 1%, or 2% in constant currency, from lower Windows and Gaming marketing spend and our last full quarter of significant benefit from phone savings. Operating income grew 26%, the same in constant currency.","Now back to our overall company results. This quarter, we invested approximately $2.7 billion in capital expenditures, including finance leases, down sequentially and lower than originally planned mainly due to quarter to quarter volatility. Cash paid for property and equipment was approximately $2.1 billion. Our significant capital investment continues, mainly based on customer demand and usage signal, and the teams remain focused on gross margin improvement as they deploy services globally to meet that demand signal.","Free cash flow grew 10% from operating cash flow growth of 8%. As a reminder, in the prior year, we had $1.3 billion in unsettled cash equivalent positions that reversed the following quarter. Excluding this amount, free cash flow increased 27% from higher customer collections following strong billings growth and working capital improvements in the hardware business, primarily driven by our exit from the phone business.","Other income and expense was $276 million, a little more than planned, as we continued to see opportunities in the equity market to realize gains throughout the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 18%, 1 point lower than we expected, primarily due to geographic mix of revenue. This quarter, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchasers.","Now, let's turn to the Q2 outlook. First on FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 1 point, COGS growth by 1 point and OpEx growth by 2 points. Our commercial business should remain healthy, with solid renewal execution and increasing customer demand for our hybrid cloud services and new cloud solutions like Microsoft 365.","Turning to commercial bookings. As you know, the underlying dollar volume of EA expirations impacts commercial bookings growth. For the full year, total expirations will be up slightly, but Q2 expiration dollar volume will be down roughly 20%, impacting our Q2 commercial bookings growth. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be down approximately 7% sequentially, reflecting normal seasonality. We remain committed to material improvement in our commercial cloud gross margin percentage.","Margin performance is variable quarter to quarter, driven by revenue mix and seasonality, as well as the timing of infrastructure spend. We expect continued year-over-year margin improvement and sequential trends consistent with prior years.","Next to CapEx. We will increase our capital investment to meet growing demand and capacity needs. And on accrual dollar basis, we expect a sequential dollar increase next quarter.","In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $8.75 billion and $8.95 billion. Office 365 commercial growth will continue to outpace the transactional decline. We expect a more moderate rate of growth in our Office consumer business, given the prior-year comparable. In Dynamics, we expect continued double-digit revenue growth, driven by the shift to Dynamics 365. And we expect approximately $1.2 billion of LinkedIn revenue, reflecting continued strong sales execution by the team.","In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $7.35 billion and $7.55 billion, with another quarter of double-digit revenue growth across server products and cloud services. As a reminder, starting in Q2 of last year, the launch of Windows Server 2016 drove strong on-premises performance, resulting in 6% constant currency growth for server products. This comparable will impact the segment's year-over-year growth rate. We expect Enterprise Services revenue growth to be similar to last quarter, driven by Premier Support Services offsetting declines in custom support agreements.","In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $11.7 billion to $12.1 billion. First on Windows. OEM revenue should track roughly in-line with the overall PC market. Specifically, OEM Pro revenue growth should be more aligned to the commercial PC market, normalizing for a couple points of growth from the timing of licensing purchasing in the first quarter.","Next, Devices. In Surface, we expect revenue to be up slightly from Q1 as we continue to transition to the new Surface Pro, ramp Surface Laptop and launch the Surface Book 2. Also in November of last year, we closed the sale of our feature phone business, so this will be the final quarter of revenue comparability impacted by the phone. We expect double-digit revenue growth in search ex-TAC, reflecting continued strong performance in both rate and volume.","And finally, Gaming. We expect revenue growth from the launch of the Xbox One console and continued healthy growth of software and services revenue. In Q2, the higher mix of Gaming hardware revenue will significantly impact both the segment and company gross margin percentages.","We expect COGS between $11 billion and $11.2 billion, in the normal range for a holiday quarter with new device launches and including 1 point of FX headwind. This includes approximately $400 million of LinkedIn COGS, of which $220 million is related to amortization expense.","We expect operating expenses of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, which includes 2 points of FX headwind. This includes $1.1 billion of LinkedIn expenses, of which $154 million is related to amortization.","Other income and expense should be approximately $450 million as we continued to take gains in our equities portfolio. And we expect this pace to continue until the end of the fiscal year.","Now, let me share some additional comments on fiscal 2018, given our strong first quarter results, our business momentum and the changing currency landscape. First on FX. For the full year at current rates, we expect FX to increase revenue, COGS and OpEx growth at the company level by 1 point. Therefore, we now expect full-year operating expense growth, excluding LinkedIn, to be between 4% and 5%. This is unchanged from our prior outlook except for the updated FX impact.","Second, on margins. With our strong Q1 results and the FX impacts I just outlined, we are trending a bit better on both gross and operating margin relative to our original full-year outlook of down roughly 1 point each. We now expect operating margin, ex-LinkedIn, to be up year over year, even as we increase investment to support long-term top-line growth in commercial cloud, AI, Mixed Reality, quantum, new hardware launches and the continued transformation of our sales team.","Third, tax rate. We're updating our full-year tax rate to 22%, plus or minus 2 points, with variability due to the mix of service and license revenue, geographic mix of revenue and timing of equity vest, and expect next quarter's tax rates to come in at the midpoint of that full-year range.","Chris, let's go to Q&A.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Amy. We'll now move to Q&A. Jesse, can you please repeat your instructions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and very nice quarter. Satya, a question for you. We've been seeing Intelligent Cloud growing very well for quite some time, Azure sustaining very, very impressive growth rates, but even the server and tools businesses sustaining growth. When we think about the drivers of that growth, is this just continued share gains by Microsoft, enabling you guys to outgrow the market? Or have you started to see stuff like AI and all these additional cognitive services that you bring to the market actually accelerating workload growth within your customers? You're actually like building new market opportunity for yourselves with these additional services.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Keith, for the question. And I would say all of the above. One of the things that we started always, we always believed in distributed computing, and we've built for that so when we say hybrid, we never thought of it as some kind of a temporary state but we always thought the edge and the cloud was going to be where the application pattern was in fact going to get to. In fact, I'm very excited about some of the new workloads.","If I look at whether it's IoT or AI, the two workloads that are new, both of them require both computation and intelligence on the edge and a very new way to do even computation, which event-driven computation. So we feel good about new workload growth. We feel good about this lift-shift modernize motions that are happening. We feel that we're well positioned for both meeting today's realities of our enterprise customers, but most importantly, where on a secular basis I believe hybrid computing is going, which is to this architectural pattern of intelligent cloud, intelligent edge.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Keith.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, we'll take the next question now, Jesse, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. I had a question related to Azure. You guys mentioned on the call that premium services grew triple digits for the 13th quarter in a row. And I was wondering if you could give us a sense for how to think about the percentage of workloads that are now running premium services as a percentage of the total. And\/or are we at the point now where that's a high enough percentage of the mix that we're at a tipping point here, where what seems like very significant gross margin progression is going to continue at this similar clip? Thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","I mean, I can start and, Amy, you can add to this. The premium services, for example, the way we think about them is in everything related to our data is, and especially the higher level databases, so I'm not talking about raw storage but this is Cosmos DB or Azure DB or any of data services, our IoT services, our AI services are all the premium services. And there is a path. Every customer sometimes just starts with infrastructure as a service and some storage. And then the lift-shift turns into lift-shift and modernize and that's where these premium services get activated. So they definitely are margin accretive for us, but most importantly, they add a tremendous amount of value to the customers. And I'll let Amy add any additional color to that.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And I think, Heather, it gives me a good opportunity to talk a little bit about the real drivers of the Azure gross margin improvement. There are really, when you think about it, three. The first one's just pure revenue scale. We've done such a terrific job, I think, of growing and focusing and the innovation we put in and having our sales teams, through investments we've made for the past couple of years, and competency building, land that at customers.","The second component, and the one you'd asked about, is a little bit about that premium services revenue mix. And you're absolutely seeing the impact of that growth as mix show up in the gross margin. And addition to the workloads Satya mentioned, I'll also bring up EMF. EMF continues to be I think of incredible value to customers. And I think we've done a very good job of pointing out its competitive advantages, and we're seeing that also benefit margins.","And finally, just the strong work on the infrastructure team, both between hardware innovation done at everything from the network, all the way to the prox and their integration with each other as well as the software innovation being done on top of it. Those things together, with premium being a component of that, are all lending itself to gross margin improvement.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Heather. We'll take the next question now, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks guys, and congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on Office because you've obviously spent a fair amount of time on Azure, the gross margins there. But within Office, you've got several secular trends as well as just mix shift going on there just from a price point perspective as well as the gross margin between the different levels of E1, E3, E5. So wondering if you could give us some color of what we're seeing there, because obviously, there's healthy, healthy seat growth, revenues outpacing and it seems like margins are as well. So just provide us more color on sort of what we've been seeing and kind of how you think about that trending going forward?","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Let me just start at the highest of levels, because for us again, and in this last quarter, some of the innovation that we launched I think is also pretty key as you look forward to what it means for Office and Office growth. One of the new suites we have is called F1 and this is about first-line work. So Office is no longer limited just to the knowledge workers. In fact, we see significant opportunity for some of our teamwork, collaboration, communications, as well as scheduling software to be very, very relevant for anyone who's on the manufacturing plant or a retail specialist. Some of our social tools like Yammer are increasingly getting used for broad communications, inclusive of Skype for Teams.","So I just wanted to put that in there as well, as there is of course E3. There is E3 to E5. But there is also F1, which is increasing the overall penetration and not to mention the small business segment, and of course all the markets that we participate in with Office 365 where we don't have much of a server business at all. We sold Office on-premise or Office perpetual clients. But now you can have a small business in a country like India, buy Office 365 as a subscription service. So those are all the things that are in play.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And I do think that's important, Keith, in terms of the innovation and the value. I think sometimes, on this call in particular, we talk about there's installed base growth and there's ARPU increases. Sitting underneath that is this very large 120 million dollar-monthly active users in commercial. And they're experiencing frankly the latest innovations that the company has built. So I look and say, seeing growth in that number allows us to actually grow the ARPU, and the new services that Satya mentioned continues to let us grow the installed base.","Innovations around teams, innovations in AI in the actual Office products themselves are now being experienced by our customers. I think when you have that happen over time, it builds confidence in the product and it builds confidence in end-user confidence in itself. And then purchasers are happy to continue to add SKUs and add and move up the scale. We still, this is primarily the ARPU growth, continues to be some of the earlier transitions we've always talked about. It's that E3 transition as well as installed base growth. E5 continues to see encouraging signs. We're starting to see it enter but that will take a long time, as we've talked about, to actually land in ARPU.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Phil. We'll move to next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. This one for Amy. Amy, just a general sort of corporate-wide question on gross margins. Your revenue and COGS guide, if I ran the math correctly, imply about 60% gross margins for the December quarter. So that's going to be down year over year and I suspect below some of the street estimates. But it sounds like your tone is a little bit better for gross margins for the full year. So I just want to make sure I leave the call understanding what's happening here. Is the conclusion that 2Q is somewhat of a one-off, given the uptick in lower-margin hardware and thereafter will return to a more normal year over year pattern on gross margins? Thank you.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Karl. Actually, this is really all the gaming Xbox One console launch. It's very specific. And so every other gross margin trend across IC, across PBP and across the rest of the MPC portfolio exhibits the exact same fundamental drivers and improvement. And so really, this is really 100% the Xbox One X impact in Q2 of the launch on the company gross margin and in particular, the MPC gross margin.","Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Karl. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks. I think another question for Amy here. Just looking at the dependent \u2013 trying to figure out the dependency of your Azure growth this year on the volume of annuity up for renewal. I know last year, you had very, very strong growth in annuity on that renewal cycle, and you're talking about some pressure in the Q2 and then a slightly up trend for the year. But how dependent is Azure growth in customers attaching that to the volume of annuity up?","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah, I wouldn't call it pressure, Walter, just how I think about it. There's just an expiration base that comes up every quarter.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Understood.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And there's volatility to it. So the way to think about it is over the year, it's up a little and in Q2, it happens to be just a low quarter of the 12 that come up through the cycle, much like Q4 was quite large in the cycle. And Azure actually falls a couple of patterns. It's not just about EA attach although it absolutely can be one of the motions. Because it tends to be project-based as well and many of the investments we've made in sales capacity, and the reason we did some of the sales transformation, was to invest a lot more in that project-led motion, which is a bit disconnected actually from the EA renewal cycle, and you've really seen that. The Azure pace is not, if you drew a line, as correlated to EAs as it even was 3 years ago, as we've I think matured the product and matured our sales cycles.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great, thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Walter. We'll go to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Kirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks very much and I'll add my congrats on the quarter. Satya, yesterday you were down at the GE event and announcing the partnership with them around Predix. And I was wondering, when we think about the opportunities for Azure to be that sort of trusted platform for ISVs, can you just talk about how you think the progress is going on that front? Because it seems to obviously just expand your overall TAM and the kind of use cases you can address by bringing partners like GE onto your platform. Thanks.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yeah. Thank you for the question. Overall, I think you sort of speak to I think one of the big advantages and one of the big value propositions we have on to both sides. One is to the enterprise customer. We are a trusted partner. And we support them with their hybrid computing needs and their AI needs. One of the things that we emphasize is it's not about our technology, but it's our ability to transfer that capability to our customer because they're increasingly becoming, whether you're in retail or you're in oil and gas or you're in financial services, every one of them is trying to build their own software capability and we are uniquely capable of doing so.","The second part is the ISVs. We now, in fact, one of the big areas of investment this year was the core sell capacity in our field so that ISVs can be successful on our platform. Whether it is GE or Adobe and many others can all now benefit, both because of our enterprise partnership and credibility, and more importantly because of the field resources we have put in place. So we are really looking forward to accelerating our business with GE and many others to come. But it's a very important core sell motion and more importantly building trust on both sides of that equation.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Kirk.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you. We'll take the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my question, and again congrats on the quarter. I'd like to look at Dynamics 365. It's been growing really fast. It was center stage at Envision in almost every presentation and discussion. Can you talk more about how you think about the opportunity and give us a sense of which of the offerings right now within 365, whether it's CRM or Talent or ERP or whatever, are driving the growth and could be part of the future growth? Thanks.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Mark, for that question. The way we designed Dynamics 365, both on the technology front as well as on the business model front was to get away from what I would describe as the old-school suite-based selling or suite-based building of these things, whether it's CRM or ERP or SCM. Because we realized that, for example, you take any IoT project that is starting in Azure, it first translates into an analytics workload that pulls through some Azure high router analytics services. And then immediately after you do something like preventive maintenance, you need field service. And all they need is just a very robust field service module that's cost-effective and efficient. And so we're able to attach that to that project.","Similarly on Talent, they want to be able to \u2013 if you start on LinkedIn with hiring, you want to be able to do the on-boarding and talent management. That's the module you want. Even on the operations side, we are realizing that even if you keep your financials the same, there is need, and with increasing digitization, there is more operational modules that you need. So that's what we've designed it for. So the growth is actually across the board. It's coming in customer service. It's coming in sales. It's coming in talent. It's coming in operations, and we have some very competitive price points there.","The other one is that there is no such thing as a canonical business. There's no such thing as a canonical business in time. That means things are always changing. So customization, customization and composition, especially with Office 365, is very important, and this is where we have some very differentiated offer with Power BI, PowerApps and Flow. And that's another big driver of some of that growth across our enterprise customers.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Mark.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","We'll go to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Adam Holt with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Holt - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi, everyone. That was some quarter. I'm tempted to ask about the strength in Windows, which I know you don't talk about much and don't get much questions about. But really since we've launched, the question that I get by far the most is around the long-term margin potential in Azure. And with the gross margins being as good as they were this quarter, without giving us long-term guidance, is there any reason to believe that the long-term operating margins in Azure couldn't be \u2013 we just saw AWS put up a mid-20s operating margin. Is there anything structural that would lead us to believe that you couldn't do something in that range? Or how should we think about the long-term framework for that business? Thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","I'll start, Adam. The one thing I'd say is when I think about the long-term margin, I actually think of the long-term margin across our cloud. I mean, when we even make our CapEx decisions, which is one of the drivers of margin, we think of first of all, first party equals third party. A lot of what we do even in Windows, mostly people don't recognize it, but one of the most important services we run is Windows Update as a cloud service. And so we have a lot of value that is across the board cloud services, whether it's Xbox Live, Windows Update, Office 365, Dynamics 365, and of course all of the Azure services. And we're going to build scale across all of them.","And so we would not \u2013 in fact, we will be very aggressive in taking margin in one place, which is different as we see a path to margin in a different spot. That's something that we want to make sure we follow more our opportunity in a customer across the board versus trying to micromanage to certain margins in very specific opportunities, because we think that it's the integrated ability for us to deliver value is which I think long term is what the customers expect of Microsoft.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And I would just add that as we think about that long-term trajectory, our ability to continue to improve margins in our SaaS portfolio and our PaaS portfolio and IaaS portfolio still exists. And our ability to blend them into interesting products that solve customer solutions, which may not even be priced as the component parts, is I think how we think about, especially in our solution areas that Satya talks about, how we talk about delivering it to a customer. So while I'm confident in our ability to continue to grow the core margin, I do think for us in particular, it really is a portfolio that we believe that we need to manage appropriately.","Adam Holt - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thanks, Adam. Thank you. We'll go to the next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. And thanks for taking my question. My question is on the Gaming business. Given the even larger focus you're putting on this segment in the near-term, how quickly or in what timeframe do you think Gaming revenue could grow at or above the average gaming industry growth rate of mid to high-single digits? And I know you don't break out segment margins, but could you give us a sense of how you think about Gaming from a normalized contribution margin perspective relative to MPC and your overall company-wide margins, excluding the one-time Xbox launch effects? Thanks.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","I can start again. I would say from a Gaming perspective, one of the bigger changes that has happened in the last, I would say, couple of years is one, of course the vibrancy of the Xbox Live network across the PC and the console and now increasingly even on the phone because of titles like Minecraft. And once you have the network, you have plenty of different opportunities. In particular, we now have a subscription offer with Game Pass that's off to a good very good start and our goal is to be able to have essentially a Netflix for games, so that we can have the game subscriptions that people can use across all of the devices that they play in.","The other area is streaming. As you know, there is game playing and game watching and there is secular growth on both fronts. And we feel very, very good about the engagement increases in a pretty unique value proposition we have in Mixer. So that's another opportunity that we believe will shape in addition to things like e-sports and so on.","So it's the totality of that. And one of the numbers that I did put in my script was that 20% growth in what we call software and services, that's perhaps a leading indicator of where we think the opportunity lies. These are early days for us, but that said, that's probably one of the key numbers to watch as we make progress and execute.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And because of that, you're actually already seeing that impact in the MPC gross margins. Even this quarter is a great example. There was material improvement in gross margin in that segment, and a lot of that was actually due to the higher margins that we have structurally in that software and services revenue from Xbox. And as I believe, the industry that Satya is talking about pivots to be more about the engagement and monetization of that member network, you can expect that margin profile as well of our traditional, more hardware-focused Xbox to evolve, to be a real combination of those two things going forward. And structurally, that would of course have higher operating margin.","Michael Nemeroff - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you very much.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Great. Thanks. We'll take next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking my question. The conversation we have on around Azure and adoption there seems to be changing with customers, where they seem to be seeking a deeper relationship with you guys now, given that your maturity has increased quite a bit over the last few quarters. Can you talk to that? Is that something that just I picked up, or is that what you're seeing in your conversations as well? Thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Hopefully, we picked it up a lot earlier than you did. But we have. So we do have a very different dialogue. You think about it, all of the customers that we have worked with, we have always worked with them historically even in our server days. But to your point, Raimo, I think what has happened is the change, even in the financial services, the segments that you all represent, the kinds of workloads now that are moving to the cloud has qualitatively changed.","In the past we participated, but a lot of Tier 1 workloads were not on Microsoft stack, whereas now, a lot of Tier 1 workloads are in fact increasingly on Microsoft cloud. And so to me, that represents a qualitative change, and so the type of dialogue we have, whether it's with an auto company or a financial services company or a retail company, is much deeper, much broader. And I would use the word we are deeply partnering with them. It's no longer just simple vendor relationships, because as they are trying to build their own software capability, they need a trusted partner who's more interested in making sure that they build their own technology capability. And that's what we're investing in.","Amy E. Hood - Microsoft Corp.","And I would say, Raimo, a way to think about this is we've always had that trusted relationship, which we're incredibly proud of as a company with our enterprise customers. The investments we've made over the past years are about hiring the type of talent that can go and sit with a customer and drive the customer's successful outcomes of the projects they deploy. And that's what we mean. It's about the investment we've made in capability, the evolution of the product and its innovation. And I think using and trying to continue to earn the customer trust to deliver these world-class workloads. So I do think this is really an output of multiple years of concentration on delivering that capability.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","Chris Suh - Microsoft Corp.","Thank you, Raimo. Jessie, we'll have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Satya, I was curious. You've made a number of announcements with Adobe over the last year or so. And it seems like Microsoft's product and Adobe's products are getting more intertwined. And just curious from your perspective, if you could just maybe give us some insights into where you see the big opportunities to work with a vendor like Adobe and what are the go to market actions that you're seeing being more successful? Thank you.","Satya Nadella - Microsoft Corp.","Yes, we're very excited about the partnership with Adobe. And as you said, Adobe and Microsoft have partnered. In fact, across our entire histories in many of the areas, but increasingly across of the creative cloud and their Document Cloud as well as their Experience Cloud, we have plenty going on.","In fact, we are very excited about what we are doing with our devices and Adobe and with Windows because I think Windows and Windows 10 Creators Update is the ideal platform for all of the creators in the world because of the innovation in Windows and the innovation in devices, both Surface Book as well as our OEM devices. So that's one area that I think you will see. I would love if you're an illustrator or a Photoshop user, you should just check out the dial support that they have in Surface, which just is beautiful.","And then you go to Office 365. We have a partnership with them on e-signatures. We have good interoperability between our respective document clouds. That will in fact continue. And then on the creative side or on the experience side, in fact we are adding a lot of data and AI capability, which is obviously key to Adobe as an ISV.","So we're looking forward to the, ultimately the impact all this has with customers in terms of their ability to take advantage of our respective value and for them to be able to benefit from it all. And so these kinds of partnerships, whether it's with Adobe or others, we are very focused on making sure that ISVs and partners have success on our platforms. And that's sort of our core heritage, and that's something that we want to absolutely focus on.","Amy E.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Koefoed, General Manager of Investor Relations. Bill, you may begin.","Bill Koefoed","Thank you, Sharon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. As usual, with me today are Peter Klein, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel. ","Our financial summary slide deck is on our website, microsoft.com\/investor, and is intended to follow our prepared remarks and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","Okay. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.","Peter S. Klein","Thanks, Bill, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I'm pleased with our performance as we delivered another quarter of solid financial results. Our robust portfolio of enterprise products and services drove revenue growth of 6% to a third quarter record $17.4 billion. Combined with our ongoing operating expense discipline, even as we prepare for one of our biggest launch years, we delivered operating income growth of 12%. ","Let me provide more color on the business. Our Business Desktop offerings remain a top priority for CIOs. This quarter, businesses continued to refresh their hardware. And as a result, we saw healthy growth in business PCs around the world. As they purchase new PCs, businesses are also deploying Windows 7 and Office 2010 to increase productivity and manageability while reducing their total cost of ownership. Today, approximately 40% of enterprise desktops worldwide are on Windows 7, and we see continued momentum as the remaining desktops upgrade from Windows XP over the next 2 years. ","As CIOs look to address the needs of a more social and mobile workforce. Our productivity services such as Office 365 have become an important solution. Our communication and collaboration offerings such as Exchange, SharePoint and Lync all grew revenue double digits and are well positioned in this growing market. ","On the infrastructure side, the Server & Tools Business delivered double-digit revenue growth, with SQL Server leading the way. We've now launched System Center 2012 and SQL Server 2012, and the new versions of Windows Server and Visual Studio are on the horizon. Our product roadmap and vision are driving new customer wins and strong Enterprise Agreement renewals. We are confident that we are uniquely positioned to address the needs of CIOs as they strive to efficiently manage private and public clouds. ","Establishing a vibrant Windows Phone ecosystem is a priority for us, and we are working with our partners, including Nokia, to enable more features, markets and devices. We are pleased with our Nokia partnership and the pace of innovation across devices, including the Lumia 900, which recently launched on AT&T's 4G LTE network. ","In gaming and entertainment, while industry console sales were softer than our expectations, we continue to maintain our shared leadership position. With Xbox LIVE, we are adding more content and partners as we expand the entertainment experience and build on our leading position in the living room. ","And in Search, we are focused on addressing RPS and operating performance. We are seeing our hard work pay off with year-over-year improvements in both areas. ","In summary, solid revenue growth, and our ongoing commitment to fiscal discipline delivered strong financial results. We are enthusiastic about the market reception to our products and services as we continue to execute well, heading into our launch wave. With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on this quarter's results, then I'll come back and provide some thoughts on our outlook for our fourth quarter and the next fiscal year.","Bill Koefoed","Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results and then I'll move on to the details by business segment. ","Revenue for the quarter was $17.4 billion, up 16% or roughly $1 billion. Operating income was up 12% to $6.4 billion, cash flow from operations was a record $9.6 billion and earnings per share was $0.60. Remember, in Q3 last year, we had a $461 million or $0.05 per share benefit related to a partial tax settlement with the IRS. And if you exclude that, EPS grew 7% for the quarter. ","Foreign exchange did not materially impact our net income this quarter. From a geographic perspective, developed markets remained healthy, and we saw strong double-digit growth in emerging markets. Businesses continue to make long-term investments in the Microsoft platform, and as a result, multi-year licensing, as a percentage of our total revenue, grew to approximately 40%. ","This quarter, we saw strong Enterprise Agreement growth in both new business and renewals. At the end of the quarter, unearned revenue was $15.2 billion, up 17%, and our contracted not billed balance was over $19 billion. ","Moving on to the PC market. We estimate the worldwide PC market grew 2% to 4% this quarter. Business PCs grew 8% as businesses continued to upgrade their hardware and software to Windows 7. When excluding netbooks, consumer PCs grew 6%. We are pleased with the early demand for Ultrabooks as they reinvigorate personal computing with innovative design, high performance and enhanced battery life. ","Now I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live Division, where revenue was up 4%. As in past quarters, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck. Overall, Windows revenues slightly outgrew the underlying PC market due to the strength of the business refresh and attach gains in several geographic regions. ","In late February, we made the Windows 8 Consumer Preview available. It is important to note that the development of Windows 8 on both Intel and ARM is proceeding on our schedule. ","Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division where revenue grew 9%. Consumer revenue increased 2%, while business transactional revenue grew 5%, again, outperforming our historical trends. Multi-year licensing revenue grew 13% as customers continued their commitment to our productivity services. As businesses embrace social enterprise scenarios, they are turning to the combined power of Exchange, SharePoint and Lync to enable their presence, collaboration and communication needs. This quarter, Exchange and SharePoint both grew double digits, while Lync revenue growth accelerated to over 35%. ","During the quarter, we launched the technical preview of the next version of Office, codenamed Office 15, with public beta coming later this summer. Our Dynamics business continued its momentum and revenue grew double-digits. Dynamics CRM revenue grew over 30% with more than 2.25 million users and 33,000 customers who leverage Dynamics CRM every day. ","Now let's move to Server & Tools, which posted another solid quarter with 14% revenue growth and over 20% bookings growth. Transactional revenue grew low single-digits, roughly in line with the underlying server hardware market growth. Multi-year licensing revenue was up high teens, and Enterprise Services once again grew more than 20%. ","Our growth and market success this quarter demonstrates that our customers really value our unique ability to deliver a solution which spans the private and public cloud. In the private cloud, Windows Server premium revenue grew high teens, and System Center grew more than 20%. We launched the beta version of Windows Server 2012 and announced the general availability of System Center 2012, which will help customers progress beyond virtualization to build efficient and secure hybrid cloud. ","In the public cloud, we recently announced strategic partnerships with leading service providers, Accenture and Hitachi, to offer enterprise-ready cloud solutions on our Windows Azure platform to accelerate application deployment and migration. We are the only company which can deliver a common identity, virtualization, management and development platform to our customers across both private and public clouds. ","In our data platform business, SQL Server revenue grew high teens while SQL premium revenue grew more than 30% as customers increasingly selected the premium edition to power their business intelligence and mission-critical workload needs. In early April, we announced general availability of SQL Server 2012, which now enables businesses to scale on-demand and create flexible hybrid deployment. Hundreds of global industry-leading customers such as Mitsui, Volvo, Revlon and LG Chemical have already deployed SQL Server 2012 for production use to leverage its enhanced performance, reliability and high-availability features. ","We also recently announced the second preview of Hadoop-based services with customers such as Webtrends using it to glean simple, actionable insights from complex data sets hosted in the cloud. Hadoop integration, along with the powerful analytic capabilities in SQL Server 2012, position us well to capture the full potential of big data growth. ","With major releases in each of our server product offerings, we continue to strengthen our enterprise portfolio and empower businesses to be both more agile and efficient. ","Moving on to the Online Services Division, revenue grew 6% and operating performance improved by $300 million. This quarter, online advertising revenue was up 9%, driven by volume and rate improvements in our Search business. ","In the Entertainment & Devices Division, revenue declined 16%, reflecting the soft gaming console market. Xbox maintained its share leadership in the U.S. this quarter, and we continue to expand the content available in Xbox LIVE with the release of 3 new major entertainment applications: Comcast XFINITY TV, HBO GO and MLB.TV, all with Kinect integration. ","We are working to bring Windows Phone to more people. Our progress can be seen with the April launch of 4G LTE phone through AT&T, our launch in China with multiple OEMs and the enabling of sub-$200 phones with more silicon support. With this work and with the building enthusiasm around Windows Phones, we have seen the number of apps published in the marketplace increase by 50% over the past 3 months. ","Turning to Skype, we continue to be pleased with both the pace of the integration and the rapid growth of the business. This quarter, Skype users made over 100 billion minutes of calls over the Skype network, an increase of 40% from the prior year. ","I will now cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 1%, reflecting changes in the mix of products and services sold. Operating expenses were $7.1 billion, an increase of 4%, mainly due to higher people costs. Operating income increased 12% to $6.4 billion.  And this quarter, we returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in buybacks and dividends. ","To summarize, we saw strong enterprise uptake for our server and Office products and continued business demand for PCs, leading to healthy top line growth. Along with our revenue growth, we were able to drive margin expansion with our strong focus on cost management. And with that, I will hand it back to Peter who's going to discuss our business outlook.","Peter S. Klein","Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the fourth quarter and some high-level themes as we begin to think about fiscal 2013. ","Let me start with the fourth quarter. Within the PC market, we expect growth in business PCs to outpace consumer PCs and growth in emerging markets to outpace developed markets. In the Microsoft Business Division, multi-year licensing revenue, which is approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow low double-digits. Transactional revenue, which is the remaining revenue in the division, should lag the overall PC market, reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to emerging markets. ","Within Server & Tools, approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50% from multi-year licensing and 20% from Enterprise Services. We expect transactional revenue to generally track with the server hardware market, and multi-year licensing and Enterprise Services revenue to both grow high teens. ","In the Online Services Division, we will continue to focus on RPS improvements, as well as operating efficiencies. For our Entertainment & Devices Division, we expect revenue to grow low double-digits. We expect COGS to grow 8% to 12% for the fourth quarter. As has been the case in the prior quarters, the mix of revenues will continue to impact this number. ","We are revising our operating expense guidance downward to $28.3 billion to $28.7 billion for fiscal 2012. We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year to be about $2.5 billion. Unearned revenue will roughly follow historical sequential growth pattern. ","Now I'd like to spend a few minutes looking ahead to fiscal 2013, which will include an unprecedented refresh of our major products. With Windows 8 and its availability on both x86 and ARM, we believe the ecosystem will capitalize on the new range of capabilities and scenarios Windows 8 enable. ","In the enterprise, the addition of Windows Server 2012, combined with the momentum of SQL Server and System Center, position us to take share as businesses increasingly look to cloud-optimize their IT infrastructure. And in productivity, we believe Office 15 will help people work, collaborate and communicate smarter and faster than before, driving growth in the Office business. Consumers will see ongoing innovation in Xbox, Skype, Windows Phone and Bing. So as you can see, there is a lot to look forward to next year. ","We expect fiscal 2013 operating expenses to be $30.3 billion to $30.9 billion, which represents growth of 6% to 8% from the midpoint of our updated fiscal 2012 guidance, as we continue to prioritize our spending and manage our expenses against the backdrop of a big product release year. ","In closing, our product portfolio is stronger than it has ever been, and customer satisfaction with our products and services is high. And with our latest wave of innovation, paired with the ongoing operating expense discipline, we are well positioned to continue delivering value to shareholders. ","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill, and we'll take some questions.","Bill Koefoed","Thanks, Peter. We want to get to questions from as many of you as possible, so please stick to just one question and avoid long or multi-part question. Operator, can you please go ahead and repeat your instruction?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Holt of Morgan Stanley.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question is about the enterprise upgrade cycle. The clock is ticking on XP obviously, but you're only at 40% of the enterprises upgraded. Where do you think that number goes? Do you think it's front-end loaded towards calendar '12 versus calendar '13? And how do you think about how that impacts the model given some recovery with ELAs?","Peter S. Klein","Well, the only thing I could say, Adam, is obviously, it's high on the priority list for CIOs to upgrade their business desktop. And we've seen that. We've seen that in deployments as we talked about, and it remains a high priority. Exactly how that will play out over the next couple of years is hard to say. The momentum's been great so far. It remains a top priority, so we see that momentum continuing really over the next couple years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering, Peter, a few years ago, and you might not have been CFO at the time, you guys had talked about online and what your goals were 5 years out, and talking about 20% organic market share and that could get you to breakeven. I mean, given what we're seeing in terms of RPS, although you're doing a very good job on the OpEx side, how would you say you're thinking about that today?","Peter S. Klein","Well, thanks, Heather. The same basic dynamics continue, right? We need to do 2 things: we need to grow our share, we need to grow our RPS. So really improve our monetization. At the same time, it's managing the operating performance, which we've been doing. So the same characteristics apply. We are making progress on both counts, as Bill indicated. We saw gains in both volume and rate, and we need to continue to do that sort of monotonically sort of quarter after quarter and year after year.","Bill Koefoed","Yes, I would just add on to that, and I've been reminding some investors to go back and watch the FAM presentation that Qi Lu gave back in September. We do view our Search asset as a pretty strategic asset for the company. The capabilities that it offers are leveraged across our -- we think can be leveraged across our whole product set. So I do think our strategy has evolved from whatever conversation you had a couple, 3 years ago because we see the opportunity to leverage the asset being even more powerful than maybe we did at that point. But a good reminder if people haven't looked at that video, you can go back and look at it on the site.","Operator","The next question comes from Rick Sherlund of Nomura.","Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","On EDD, just sort of curious whether there's anticipation. We're not really looking for much at E3 this year. I think new console, people are thinking is maybe next year. There is Halo 4 coming. Just how are you thinking about, with more and more gaming going to mobile, what do you think the outlook is beyond next quarter for EDD? Or do we need a new console cycle to create growth in that segment?","Peter S. Klein","Thanks, Rick. We feel really good about both our sort of market position and our strategy. If you think about what we've done over the last couple of years, we've really staked out a unique value proposition and a unique strategy when it comes to not just the gaming console but also the UI technology with Kinect, and importantly, our Xbox LIVE and all the entertainment content that comes with that, which we view as a persistent long-term revenue stream, both from a subscriber perspective as well as a transactional perspective. And so we feel great about our leadership position. We've been the #1 console for the last 15 months or so. We feel great about our unique value proposition and the growing business we have with both Kinect and LIVE, and we think that's really persistent. If you look at the engagement that our subscribers have, the amount of time they spend doing entertainment as opposed to gaming is increasing all the time. And so I think the strategy and the value proposition there plays out very well over the next several years.","Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And will Skype be a big benefit to that division going forward?","Peter S. Klein","Skype will be a big benefit across the company as we've talked about how it plays across all of our businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citi.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Peter, you guys had a much better enterprise performance than I think most of the peers that we've seen report that are enterprise-exposed, IBM, et cetera. And I'm wondering if you could help us out with understanding where you saw strength across your business there. Was it more small business, medium business enterprise? Was there any trends there that might help us understand why you're outperforming some of your peers?","Peter S. Klein","Thanks, Walter. Yes, it was all segments, but I would highlight the enterprise, and it's really broad-based. I mean, businesses are investing in data centers. They're investing in their desktops because they see technology as a way to really both cut costs and improve their strategic positioning. For a while, CIOs have been saying Microsoft is a top priority, and we're really, really starting to see that both on the infrastructure side and the desktop side. We feel great about our product lineup, particularly in Server & Tools. If you think of what we've done with System Center and SQL Server and the upcoming release of Windows Server 2012, we kind of have a unique value proposition for enterprises, which is all about the hybrid private and public cloud which nobody else really has. And we've seen growth across both of those things. Similarly on the Business division side, we've broadened the Office business in several important ways over the last several years. One is in the experiences and workloads that people are getting in communications and collaboration, and that's been a huge growth driver. And secondly, again, it's cloud services and how that expands from helping people understand our roadmap from where they are today to how to get to the public cloud. I think those things taken together across-the-board have allowed us to take share and allowed us to grow both of those business, and you're really starting to see that take hold. And we're really excited about the product lineup that's coming in the next 6 to 9 months.","Bill Koefoed","Yes, I'd just add on to that, that I think that -- I think investors sometimes put companies in a box and say, \"You're either in private cloud or you're in public cloud. \" And as Peter mentioned, we're in both. I mean, we have high growth rates in both and we are, as Peter said, really the only company that's got that breadth of offerings and the growth rate on both the private, the public and then importantly, we've kind of coined this term, of hybrid IT where you can have a roadmap as you kind of want to use both to manage your IT infrastructure. So yes, we feel really good about where we are and the share that we're taking in the marketplace for sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brent Thill of UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You commented that you saw strong multiyear licensing, and I was just curious if you could just talk about how the upcoming cycle is helping influence that. And if I caught this right, Bill, I think you mentioned new enterprise agreements. You also saw strength there. So if could you talk through the dynamics of what you're seeing on these multiyear deals.","Peter S. Klein","Yes, the way that the product pipeline impacts our multiyear licensing business is enterprises are, when they invest in a multiyear licensing agreement, they're invest -- they're making a long-term investment in their platforms, in their infrastructure and they're making a long-term investment in their vendors. And so it's important to really understand the roadmap. And that's where the pipeline really helps, and that's really been, I think, a big driver so far. And that applies not only to the workloads and the capabilities and the products themselves, but as Bill just mentioned, the private and public cloud roadmap because people really are starting to think about long term, how do they make that transition from where they are today in their data centers to a public cloud world. So having that roadmap and having that pipeline really impacts our current period Enterprise business, and I think that's what you saw, not only in Server & Tools but also in the Business division as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler of Sanford Bernstein.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So you've seen -- we saw strong numbers in System Center growing well as well as SQL Server, and yet we're just about to enter a product cycle. Normally, I guess they would slow down a bit. What do you think is the driver of why this has continued to accelerate into the cycle?","Peter S. Klein","I'll just go back to our continued vision, our continued roadmap, the capabilities that we're offering. I mean, it's a combination of the features and capabilities particularly in System Center 2012 and SQL Server 2012. And SQL Server 2012 is an amazing value proposition when you think about its scalability, when you think about business intelligence and analytics and when you think about the roadmap to the public cloud. People are understanding not only current features in the product, but they are looking towards the future roadmap. And I think that's what's really, really driving that.","Operator","The next question comes from Philip Winslow of Credit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just got another question on the Server & Tools division. Obviously, Intel is coming out with a new chip, Romley here, probably shipping to OEMs now, probably see it actually being delivered in servers late Q2, Q3 in the calendar. How do you think that these chip cycles actually are going to impact your business?","Peter S. Klein","Super excited about it, but I think about the business more broadly obviously, customers making long-term investments in their roadmap. We love what they're doing. We think that's an interesting thing. And to the extent the ecosystem technology evolves, that's always a good thing for how businesses are investing in their infrastructure. But I wouldn't want to overstate it as a much broader issue in terms of the long-term roadmap. But certainly having advances in technology, whether it's in hardware or in the data center, is a great thing, I'll allow.","Operator","Our next question comes from John DiFucci of JPMorgan.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Peter and then Bill, I think the Windows numbers were a little stale out there as far as consensus numbers. But even when you adjust for the more recent PC unit shipment data and something in line with what you guys said, I think PC, I think Gartner and IDC were at least in the neighborhood there. Maybe when you make those adjustments, the Windows business was even stronger than what we would have expected anyway. And I guess I'm just trying to try to get a little more color on that or figure that out. I guess a question maybe on the OEM revenue bridge, you got plus 2% from attach and inventory. Bill, I think you said that business refresh in attach was strong in some regions. But I think -- I would think anyway that given that PC shipments are much stronger in emerging markets, even if some emerging markets were a little bit better than normal, you'd still wouldn't necessarily get an aggregate attach that would be stronger. So I guess the question is, was there a meaningful move in inventory, OEM inventory that helped a bit this quarter? Because those numbers are stronger than they I would've thought.","Peter S. Klein","Thanks. I know -- it's actually a couple things. One, yes, on emerging markets. The business PC is what really drove the Windows business. And so if you think about the Windows revenue growth being really on the high end of our estimated PC shipment range, it's really a function of: one, business PC is really doing well relative to consumers. And again, that's consistent with the theme we've seen on businesses investing in their technology. And in addition to that, we had -- we did see some attach gains. I mean, and that's just reductions in piracy kind of broadly, not in any one place. That was a tailwind this quarter. As you know, sometimes that's not always a tailwind. In general, in the long term, that tends to be on the uptick. But this quarter, that attach and inventory gain is really partially attach.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I don't have any questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colin Gillis of BGC Financial.","Colin Gillis - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Can you just update us on the changes and the refresh in the marketing group? Where the priorities are for the spend? And any major upcoming campaigns?","Peter S. Klein","Yes, the marketing organization continues on. We are always making sort of tweaks and changes and making sure we're being as efficient and effective as possible and getting all the resources where we want them. If you think more broadly about our marketing focus as a company, clearly heading into this launch wave of our major core products like Windows, like Office, like Windows Server, you can imagine we're going to be focusing most of our marketing talent and most of our attention on those areas.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle of Pacific Crest Securities.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Peter, should we assume that we're going to see the same Windows upgrade rights around Windows 8 that we've seen around prior releases? And therefore, should we be expecting to see some big swings in Windows revenue at some point in the middle of next year because -- or at some point during next year because of the deferrals like we've seen in the past?","Peter S. Klein","Thanks, Brendan. Obviously, we're super excited about the launch of Windows 8, and we're heads down trying to get that released. We haven't said anything and will not today, but we'll have more to talk about in terms of programs and promotions as we get closer to the launch date.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Maguire of CLSA.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","When you look through the pretty extensive product refreshes you have across the portfolio, are you thinking that there may be the possibility that customers may pause in any of your products? And as you look at seasonality, is there a likelihood that we might see a bit more pronounced seasonality leading up into some of the big launches?","Peter S. Klein","I think generally, particularly in the enterprise, you don't really see a seasonality impact. If you think about how large enterprises plan their information technology spend, they sort of have a long-term roadmap. They're on it. They execute against it when they do. Obviously, our long-term roadmap, as I've said, impacts that. And so it's more about their long-term planning cycles than it is about sort of any product cycle, particularly in the enterprise, which is where a lot of the growth is coming from and a lot of the products are coming for.","Operator","Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was having a forward-looking question on the gross margin. Remember in the last few quarters where you had a slight negative mix effect there. As I look into the new product launches into the next year, is there anything -- they're all kind of high gross margin areas. Is there anything that stops that feeding through in the P&L? Or should it be a straightforward one?","Peter S. Klein","You're correct, mix is what drives the gross margin percentage and obviously we saw that this quarter. And so you're right in the math of that. If there's good growth, better growth in higher-margin products, that will have a positive impact on gross margin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","This past quarter, both Gartner and IDC saw a better-than-expected PC uptick in the European corporate market. And your reported Windows revenues certainly support that. I know broadly speaking the business refresh was healthy. Just was wondering if there's anything you would add that might have contributed to an uptick in Europe PC growth.","Peter S. Klein","Nothing specific to add to that. We did -- as we talked about, we saw broad-based growth geographically in business in particular, and so there's nothing sort of unusual or specific in Europe about that.","Operator","Our last question comes from Jason Maynard of Wells Fargo.","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I had a question on this fiscal '13 OpEx guidance, which is a couple points, looks like if you use the midpoint, ahead of the fiscal '12 growth rate. And I'm just curious, the delta, obviously, I would assume would come to some of the product launches. But the question broader is do you think you have enough spend baked into that model to account for the big push you're going to need to make around perhaps on the smartphone side, given that, that's an area where you're coming from behind, given all the other products that you're going to be releasing and obviously consumer push in some of the new enterprise products?","Peter S. Klein","Thanks, Jason. Obviously, over the last several years and even longer, we've really been focused on making sure we're prioritizing our spend to the highest value areas, so you asked a good question. And our approach is exactly the same. Like we've done the last couple of years, we're really looking at next year and saying, \"How can we most effectively and most efficiently allocate the resources to the areas that drive the best long-term results?\" And we think we've got a good balance there as we've had in the past. We've tried to be transparent and consistent in that, really predictably execute against that. And I think what we've got next year is a good balance between the exciting launches that we have that really drive both short- and long-term growth, as well as hopefully a good financial result. Okay, so that will wrap up our Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you at the numerous conferences in which we'll be participating this quarter.

I also want to thank Bill for all he has accomplished over the past four years and congratulate him on his new role as the CFO of the Skype division.","This quarter we had record revenue of $22 billion and record earnings per share of $0.81. It has been an exciting quarter with the launch of Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8. In the enterprise, we continue to see solid demand for our business products and services with particularly strong growth in multiyear licensing. Multiyear licensing revenue benefited from healthy renewals of enterprise agreements as customers continue to make long-term commitments to the Microsoft platform.","Our robust portfolio of enterprise products and services enable CIOs to build efficient infrastructure, unlock business insight, improve productivity and support bring your own device. In the data center, recent releases of Windows Server 2012 and System Center 2012 are driving customer wins and strong renewals. Our cloud OS roadmap uniquely positions us to support the hybrid infrastructure needs of CIOs by providing one consistent platform that can span their own data center, our partners data center, or Windows Azure with ultimate flexibility, portability and scale.","On the data platform, we are growing our revenue share as enterprises continue to move mission-critical workloads to SQL Server and deploy it for their business intelligence solutions. In productivity, we are excited about the upcoming launch of the new Office, and how it redefines user experience with mobility, social and cloud features. The new Office features a fast fluid design that takes full advantage of the new Windows interface.","With Skype and Yammer integration it unlocks new experiences for communication and collaboration and brings social directly into productivity scenarios. With Windows 8, businesses will now be able to give their employees thin and light devices without compromising on security or manageability. Windows 7 momentum in the enterprise continues and today, over 60% of enterprise desktops worldwide are on Windows 7.","We've talked about Windows 8 as Windows re-imagined from the chipset to the user experience. As we undergo this transformation, it is important for us to bring the entire ecosystem along with us. With the launch in October, we collectively took the first of many steps changing the way people use technology at work and in play. Since then, the number of Windows 8 certified systems has nearly doubled. The number of apps in the Windows store has quadrupled and Windows users have downloaded over 100 million apps.","To-date, we have sold over 60 million licenses of Windows 8. Our partners, including OEM hardware manufacturers, app developers and retailers have worked hard to get us to where we are today. It\u2019s early days and an ambitious endeavor like takes time. Together with our partners, we remain focused on fully delivering the promise of Windows 8.","As part of our work to advance the ecosystem, we launched Surface Windows RT last quarter. Surface is one part of the overall Windows 8 story. With tight integration across hardware and software, Surface highlights the unique innovation enabled by Windows 8, we launched it exclusively in our stores and in select geography and are expanding our retail and geographic footprint.","As we look forward, we strive to deliver seamless experiences across hardware, software and services. Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 and Xbox 360, provide a similar look and feel to users. This consistency complemented with our cloud services like Bing, SkyDrive, Xbox LIVE and SmartGlass unifies the consumer experience.","In the Enterprise, we continue to design and deliver world-class cloud solutions that allow our customers to move to the cloud on their own terms. The compelling experiences we deliver across our devices and services as well as our large partnering customer base uniquely positions us for sustained future growth.","In summary, this quarter strength of our product portfolio delivered record revenue and earnings per share. As we enter calendar year 2013, there is tremendous opportunity for our partners, developers and customers to leverage the capabilities and scenarios our significant product releases have enabled.","With that, I am going to hand it back to Chris to provide more details on our results.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Peter. First, I am going to review our overall results and then I'll move on to the detail by business segment.","Revenue for the quarter was up 5% to $22 billion. Operating income was $8.3 billion, up 4% and earnings per share was $0.81, also up 4%. Foreign exchange had a $200 million, or one percentage point negative impact to revenue this quarter and $154 million, or two percentage point negative impact to net income.","From a geographic perspective, we saw growth return in developed markets and saw mid-teens growth in emerging markets. Bookings were strong growing 11% as we're continuing to see customers making long-term commitments to our products. You see the results in the following metrics. Multi-year licensing revenue grew 15%. Unearned revenue grew 13% to $17.4 billion, and our contracted not billed balance was over $21 billion.","Moving to Windows. This quarter total revenue grew 11%. Within that OEM revenue outperformed underlying x86 PC market, reflecting increased demand in our distribution channel. While inventory levels ended the quarter at slightly higher levels than the prior year, we believe them to be in a healthy range given the recent launch.","Non-OEM revenue grew over 40% driven by Windows 8 upgrade, sales of Surface and double-digit growth in volume licensing. Within the x86 PC market, we saw similar trends to prior quarters with emerging market outperforming developed markets and business outperforming consumer. The Consumer segment was the most impacted by the ecosystem transition as demand exceed the limited assortment of touch devices available.","Next, I'll walk through our server and tools business, which posted another solid quarter with 9% revenue growth. Product revenue grew 9%, and within that multi-year licensing revenue grew 17%. On the strength of both, new and existing customer bookings grew a solid 15%.","For the modern data center, we continue to be on the forefront of the innovation with our Cloud OS roadmap, which provides a flexible platform for CIOs to manage their infrastructure, applications and data. With the launch of Windows Server 2012 in September, we delivered a cloud-optimized operating system and have continued to gain share in virtualization.","To further strengthen our cloud OS platform, we have introduced steady stream of innovation in Windows Azure, including virtual machines, media services, website services and mobile services. Our management product, System Center continued its momentum and delivered 18% revenue growth.","In our data platform business, SQL Server revenue grew 16% driven by strength in SQL Server premium. Revenue growth continues to outpace the market as customers increasingly use SQL Server for their mission-critical application and business intelligence needs, making it the most pervasive data platform. On the BI side, we are delivering on our strategy to enable analysis of all types of data while also accelerating time to insight. We are powering organizations to realize the power of big data as Hadoop is now compatible on Windows Server and Windows Azure. With SQL Server 2012, we took the next step forward in advancing in-memory capabilities and see tremendous opportunities ahead.","Now I will move on to the Microsoft Business Division, where revenue grew 3%. Consumer revenue declined 2% with x86 PC market dynamics being partially offset by gains in attach. Businesses are choosing Microsoft as their productivity platform for the future. This is evidenced by the healthy 18% bookings growth and near historical high renewal rates for Office. Business revenue grew 4%, and within that, multi-year licensing revenue grew 10%.","Our productivity server offerings continue to perform well, and again this quarter, Exchange, SharePoint, and Lync collectively grew double digits. Lync revenue grew at an impressive rate of 35%, as customers continue to be drawn to both the enhanced productivity that it enables, and also the economic benefits of our solution.","Next, I will move on to the Online Services Division, where revenue grew 11%. Online advertising revenue was up 15%, driven by significant search rate improvements, offset in part by a decline in display revenue. With revenue growth, and ongoing expense management, we delivered another quarter of operating performance improvement.","In the Entertainment & Devices Division, revenue declined 2%. In the important holiday season, Xbox continued its leadership position in the U.S. console market. Halo 4 launched in November, and has already become the best-selling title of the critically acclaimed gaming franchise. We did defer $380 million this quarter for games where the buyer has rights to receive content in the future. The video game deferral was included in the Q2 guidance, and we expect it to be recognized in Q3. We also continued to expand the content available in Xbox LIVE, further solidifying Xbox LIVE as the premier entertainment service in the family room.","Windows Phone saw strong growth in both phone and patent licensing revenue. In November, we launched Windows Phone 8, with our strongest lineup of both carriers and devices. Windows Phone sales were over four times higher than they were last year and at CES this year more partners were announced, as the Windows Phone ecosystem continues to grow. Skype had 138 billion minutes of calls on its network this quarter, which was up 59%.","Now I will cover the remainder of the income statement. Cost of goods sold increased 1%, due to the full quarter of Nokia platform payments, Surface and growth in cloud infrastructure, partially offset by declines in Xbox consoles. Operating expenses grew 10% to $8 billion, primarily related to marketing for product launches. This quarter, our tax rate was approximately 18%. Finally, we returned $3.5 billion to shareholders in buyback and dividends.","Now I will turn the call back over to Peter for our outlook.","Peter Klein","Thanks, Chris. Through the remainder of the call, I will discuss our expectations for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2013. Looking ahead with Windows, we know that our growth depends on our ability to give customers the exciting hardware they want, at the price-points they demand and a wider range of apps and services to meet their diverse needs.","We are hard at work with our partners to meet these goals. One of our biggest partners, Intel, not only delivered the Clover Trail chip this year, they have said they will deliver their next generation chip, Haswell, in 2013, which will enable even more advances in the device market. This is just one example of the innovation we are seeing from our chip partners.","We also need to continue to work with our hardware partners as they create thin and lightweight devices on both x86 and ARM chipsets that offer compelling touch experiences that bring Windows 8 to life. You have started to see the next wave of Windows devices at CES, and collectively we will work to ensure that we have the most compelling devices and the right mix of devices in the marketplace.","During the quarter, we launched the first device in our Surface family of products. We recently increased production and expanded distribution to third-party retail partners. Next month, we will make Surface Windows RT available in 14 additional countries.","At the same time, we will also launch Surface Windows 8 Pro, which provides the power and performance of a laptop in a tablet package. With the broadening of the Surface lineup, we will continue to highlight the power of Windows 8 tightly integrated with fantastic hardware.","On the app front, we are deepening our engagement with developers. While the number of apps in the Windows Store has quadrupled since launch, we clearly have more work to do. We need more rich, immersive apps that give users access to content that informs, entertains and inspires.","While there is a lot of work ahead of us, we are incredibly excited by the opportunities to both, broaden and enrich the Windows ecosystem. With the launch of Windows 8 and Windows RT, we are positioned for growth across a massive addressable market from tablets to laptops and Ultrabooks to all-in-ones. We will continue to work closely with our partners through this transformation as we collectively re-imagine Windows.","As you update your models remember that the Windows Upgrade Offer expires at the end of February. At that time, we will recognize $1.1 billion, which is all of the remaining deferred revenue related to the Upgrade Offer.","Within Server and Tools, product revenue, including transactional and multi-year licensing, is about 80% of the division's total revenue and enterprise services is the remaining 20%. We expect product revenue to grow low teens for the third quarter and low double digits for the full fiscal year. And we expect enterprise services to grow mid-teens for the third quarter and the full fiscal year.","In the Microsoft Business Division, multi-year licensing revenue, which is approximately 60% of the division's total, should grow low double-digits for both, the third quarter and full fiscal year. Excluding the Office deferral, transactional revenue, which is the remaining revenue in the division, should outperform the x86 PC market in the third quarter and for the full fiscal year.","As a reminder, when updating your Q3 models, we expect to recognize between $250 and $300 million of revenue related to pre-sales into the channel and the Office Offer. We expect most of the remainder of the deferral to be recognized at the expiration of the program in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013.","In the Online Services Division, we look to build upon improvements in share and search monetization. For the third quarter and full fiscal year, we expect revenue growth to be consistent with the dynamics seen in the second quarter with search revenue growth partially offset by lower display revenue.","Moving on to the Entertainment and Devices Division, in the third quarter we expect to recognize $380 million related to the video game deferral. Excluding recognition of deferrals, we expect revenue to grow high teens in the third quarter and low-single digits for the full fiscal year.","Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company, COGS growth will continue to be impacted by the changing mix of revenue as we have seen in the past few quarters. As we look forward, excluding Surface, we expect COGS to grow high single-digits for the full fiscal year.","We are reaffirming our full fiscal year guidance for operating expenses of $30.3 billion to $30.9 billion.","Other income and expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of hedging. In the current low interest rate environment, we expect these items to generally offset one another for the remainder of the year.","We expect our effective tax rate to be 17% to 20% for the full fiscal year, and we expect capital expenditures to be about $3.5 billion for the full fiscal year. For the third quarter, excluding the impact of deferrals, unearned revenue should roughly follow historical seasonal patterns.","In summary, we delivered solid financial results for the second quarter. We have good product momentum in the market and are excited about the opportunity to help our customers take advantage of the advancing trends in technology.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris and we\u2019ll take some questions.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Peter. We want to get questions from as many of you as possible, so please just stick to one question and avoid long and multi-part question. Operator, please go ahead and repeat the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Philip Winslow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open, sir.","Philip Winslow - Credit Suisse","Thank, guys and congrats on a good quarter in a pretty tough macro environment. Just wanted to spend a moment on Surface. You obviously talked about ramping up production and distribution of that. Just what are some of your goals as you look at Surface, RT and Pro for this year? Within that context, how should we think about the profitability of the Surface? Thanks.","Peter Klein","Thank, Phil. As we said, we think of Surface as one part of the overall Windows 8 story. Certainly this quarter it was a contributing factor to the revenue growth in Windows Business. What it does is it highlights some interesting innovation that can happen to demonstrate the power of Windows 8 when tightly integrated hardware and software and new categories of devices, and where, obviously we had some limited distribution this quarter in our stores.","As you know, we are excited about expanding that. So our goal is to continue to build that business to highlight the incredible power of Windows 8 in an interesting set of devices. We are going to expand geographically. We are going to expand the product line up. We are going to expand retail distribution and capacity. So we look forward to continuing the growth of that business.","Chris Suh","Thanks, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Sir, your line is open.","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","Just wondering, Peter, if you could talk about, obviously, one of the big differences here between your devices and market and some of the competing devices I think is price point of touch machines, Windows devices, are much higher. I am wondering if you could just talk about what you learned here in the first three or four months of the Windows launch? How important price is to the customer base in terms of driving units? What do you think the outlook is in terms of getting price points down on the devices in aggregate in order to potentially drive some demand?","Peter Klein","Thanks, Walter. We have learned a lot this quarter. We learned a lot about the types of experiences and scenarios and to some extent the price points the customers are looking for from their devices. We saw some really great demand for some of the touch devices that we brought to market. In some cases, we didn\u2019t have the supply that we needed to satisfy that demand.","From a price point, we learned what we have always suspected, which is this segmentation and differentiation. There is one of the powers in the Windows ecosystem, obviously, is the variety of devices and form factors and experiences at a variety of price points. We learned that that continues to be important.","As I said, we are working very closely with both our chip partners as well as the OEMs to bring the right mix of devices which means, to your point, the right set of touch devices at the right price point depending on the unique needs of the individual. We learned a lot about that and one of things you will see is a greater variety of devices at a bigger variety of price points that meet the differentiated needs of our consumers.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Walter. We will take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Your line is open.","Rick Sherlund - Nomura","Thank you, and Chris, welcome back to IR.","Chris Suh","Thanks, Rick.","Rick Sherlund - Nomura","MBD, I just want clarification because the revenue growth is a little slower than I would have thought but it looks like what we are seeing is a transition in the business. It looks like in business transactional, it is more multiyear licensing and the bookings growth would suggest that that business is changing to be more revenue over time versus upfront. Just want a clarification if I am thinking about that correctly.","Peter Klein","Thanks, Rick. You are thinking about that absolutely correctly. We have seen big increases in multiyear annuity business. Bookings growth was very strong. So you are seeing that transition to long-term commitment to the business.","Secondarily, this quarter obviously in a prelaunch quarter, cyclically you tend to see a slowdown in transactional business as well but that was secondary to this longer-term trend of transition to the multiyear commitment.","Chris Suh","Okay, thanks, Rick. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.","Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley","Great, thank you. Sorry to ask a model question. My question is about cash flow and I guess two factors around cash flow. Could you just drill in a little bit into the delta between bookings growth and billings growth in the quarter? Then could you also just touch on the inventory in the quarter? It looked like it was a little above what it normally is. Thank you.","Peter Klein","Well, as always there's sort of difference between bookings growth and billings growth is going to be function of the mix of long-term agreements, right? Because, our multi-year licensing agreements are three-year agreements and so bookings will include all of that revenue from the agreements and then typically those are billed a year a time, so the billings growth sort of that one-year of billings.","And, so to the extent we see this sort of growth in the multi-year licensing business, you are going to see a buildup of bookings growth is going to be fast. You are going to see a buildup of deferred revenue now move in sort of into billings and then recognition for the income statement over time. And, so to the extent we continue to see transition to long-term commitment, you will expect to see that trend continue.","Your second question was on inventory, when you say inventory, you mean on the balance sheet?","Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley","Yes.","Peter Klein","Yes. The inventory is a function of both, what's happening in the Xbox business and Surface. They are sort of offsetting impact this quarter. Some of it is from Surface and then some of it is from the Xbox business.","Adam Holt - Morgan Stanley","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Great. I had a question about, Peter, you mentioned the renewal rates in MBD continue. I guess, they are at a record and continue to move higher. I am just wondering if you could share with us what's driving the increase in the renewal rates and how much runway do you have left there.","Then actually I had a follow-on Adam's question about inventory, because usually it goes down in the December quarter. Obviously, you have Surface now, so it jumped up, but did we see the traditional Xbox work down of inventory that we normally see? So, should we be looking at the fact that the delta between the drawdown that you normally see and the fact I think it went up or was roughly flat this quarter was the result of Surface?","Peter Klein","Okay. I'll start with your first question, which was MBD renewal rate, you know, I think it's a combination of things. Heather as you know over time, we've been broadening the notion of how we think about productivity and so I think it's a combination of a couple of things. One is, just the product set, Lync is a big driver, SharePoint, Exchange, so the connection between the collaboration and communications' technology and the enhancements to just the productivity applications themselves, I think Office 365 and the roadmap to the cloud is really exciting to customers and part of the reason they are making the long-term commitment to MBD and to the Office and related products, is because our roadmap to the cloud really resonates with them in how they get there over time and how that works.","I think also, our roadmap from a capability perspective and what's coming in the new Office, with social, again, advances in the cloud is really driving sort of a roadmap that's compelling to customers and so that's why they are making long-term commitments to the platform, so that's great to see. In inventory, yes, you are thinking about it right. I think we saw the normal sort of drawdown from the Xbox business in any offsetting increase there was related to Surface.","Operator","Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thank you very much and happy New Year. It's already quite a bit into the year, but what I was wondering was in the holiday season post a launch for Microsoft typically we get a big effect to the PC industry. It's happened every cycle, and I guess we had some competition from tablets and we didn't quite see that kind of whiz-bang effect with a typical Windows launch.","I am curious to get your take on what is it that the media and the industry seems to have gotten it wrong? What are the misperceptions about Windows 8, and how do you think the year is going to play out as far as Windows 8 receptivity in the consumer market and business market.","Peter Klein","Yes. Thanks, Kash. Windows, as I talked about, Windows 8 is a sort of big, bold, re-imagining of Windows across the whole ecosystem, and I think this was the start of that process. I think, we all collectively learned a lot about from the user interface to the touch devices. And, as I tried to give context on the call, there's a lot of things we are working on with our partners that I think to continue to drive this process forward over the next several quarters whether it's the chipset, whether it's with developers or the kinds of applications that people want and certainly for the kinds of touch devices that they write price points that consumers want I think all of that continuously improving, we are continuously learning and happens over time, but this is a big ambitious re-imagining of Windows, and this quarter was the first step in that process.","Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. So, the traction, the ramp should get better over time and so we should not be judging the cycle for the December quarter necessarily.","Peter Klein","I highlighted the things that drive that exactly.","Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Chris Suh","Thank you, Next question, please.","Operator","Brent Thill with UBS, your line is open.","Brent Thill - UBS","Peter, just on the gross margins, they have been under pressure the last several years. There is a lot of components that go in that you get to see but certainly we don\u2019t get to see. Can you give us just the puts and takes of perhaps, is there any change later in the year, when you start to see some of the components of the COG, the expenses start to come off, or not?","Peter Klein","Well, COGS is always going to be a function of the mix of the types of revenue and so its really depend on what your underlying assumptions are about the differing components of the revenue, whether that\u2019s hardware related revenue in Xbox and now in Surface, whether its multiyear licensing business in enterprises and what online services. So at any point in time, it's really going to depend on that mix of revenue, which is just going to cycle over time. So we try to give you some sense for the rest of the year how we see that playing out in total at Microsoft and again that\u2019s going to be a function of the mix we see between the various components.","Chris Suh","And tend to reiterate in Peter's guidance, excluding Surface. I think Peter just high-single digits COGS for (inaudible) Surface.","Peter Klein","That\u2019s right.","Chris Suh","Thank very much. Next question, please.","Operator","John DiFucci with JPMC, your line is open.","John DiFucci - JPMC","Thank you. Peter, you said that the Windows OEM revenue outperformed the x86 PC market and your comments imply some Windows inventory build into the channel which I believe you normally see during a quarter with a Windows launch as OEMs build inventory in preparation for the launch. Would it be accurate to assume that the Windows outperformance was primarily relative to the PC market? Was it primarily due to the inventory build or was there something else there happening? Was there anything else used to give us that bridge which you haven\u2019t for a while now, but I just wondered if any of those other factors had a big influence?","Peter Klein","Yes, the three biggest components of the 11% total revenue growth, that 11% adjusted for the recognition of the deferrals, in the Windows business were the retail upgrades, the sales of the Surface and then multiyear licensing agreements within enterprises. To your point, there was some tailwind from inventory which was normally as you highlight what we see in the launch quarter and as Chris said, it's within the healthy range that we typically see. But that was some tailwind. But the three big impacts all up on the Windows revenue were the retail upgrades, sales of Surface and the enterprise annuity business which continues to grow double-digit.","John DiFucci - JPMC","Any detection of any piracy effects or changes?","Peter Klein","We are going to run the same long-term trend on piracy that we have always been. I wouldn't highlight anything specific to this quarter, but as always we are fighting piracy across all the dimensions and the long-term trend should be good, but that will cycle up and down in any given quarter.","Chris Suh","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Colin Gillis with BGC Financials, your line is open.","Colin Gillis - BGC Financials","Hi, Peter, the trend in OSD in terms of the smaller losses. Is that a run rate that we can think about going into the March quarter? Also when you talked about the improvement in revenue per search, is there any more color or quantification you can put around that?","Peter Klein","On the first question, the guidance we gave on the revenue, we continue to work hard on the cost structure, but certainly as we highlighted the dynamics on revenue will be relatively consistent to what you see this quarter. In terms of the monetization, it's what we have been very focused on here.","Part of it is the work we have done with our partnership with Yahoo. Part of it's the quality of the searches that we have been doing. It's the realization of all the work we have been doing on both the search engine as well as the app platform to make sure it's finally tuned to deliver the best economic result and that's what we been talking about this for, gosh, a year and a half, two years. We have been really focused on that with our best talent and you start to see that paying off and that's what's driving the monetization.","Chris Suh","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities, your line is open.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks so much. Peter, you highlighted the market share gains you guys are seeing in SQL Server and specifically you talked about BI and mission-critical applications. I was just wondering if you could give us any more color on the use cases and applications where you guys are particularly seeing the biggest gains and any impact that pricing maybe having on that. Thanks.","Peter Klein","The biggest impact is the capabilities that we have delivered with SQL Server 2012. In terms of the use cases, there is couple of things that fall into those buckets of mission-critical and BI. In terms of mission-critical, we are seeing large enterprise customers re-platform on SQL for any number of things, underneath their ERP, underneath what are the major sort of LOB apps they have that sort of drive their business and that's really an emerging trend with 2012 and what that does.","That's really advance and I would add that that's been one of the drivers of our transition to multi-year licensing, because now we're seeing customers commit more and more to SQL as part of their multi-year enterprise agreements as well.","On BI side, the combination of SQL as well as SharePoint and Excel is really compelling to customers in terms of the business insights they can generate from their line of business application systems, and I think really the combination of the types what you see frontend on Excel, on top of the SQL database is really good of a driver for both businesses frankly and that's a lot of what's driving the multi-year licensing business up about MBD and FTB.","Operator","Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Company","Okay. Thank you. You had mentioned that over 60% of enterprise desktops now are running on Windows 7, looking forward how do you expect the cadence of migration activity to unfold from now until the termination of XP support in early to mid-2014. Does it continue at a similar pace for a while and at what point do we probably see this moderate?","Peter Klein","Well, the one thing I would say is not only over 60% of Windows 7, but about 90% have expressed, they have a plan to do that and so I expect to see sort of steady drumbeat between now and end-of-life for XP support in April 2014 for that to continue because the incentive is there and the express desire to do that has been expressed by our customers, so I would expect to see that continue over the next year, year-and-a-quarter.","Chris Suh","Operator, I think we have time for two more questions, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just to follow-on, on that one. You had one quarter Windows 8 now. What was the feedback that you had from the enterprise so far? I mean, obviously, they are still in the middle of the Windows 7 upgrade as well, but what's the point that they liked about Windows 8?","Peter Klein","Yes. There's a couple of things. They like the ability to get thin lightweight devices with the kind of security and manageability that they are used to manage their business and also there's early interest in new applications being developed with the Windows 8 interface which is a new way for their users to interact with their business applications, so I think you will see those two things are early information in driving the business interest in Windows 8.","Chris Suh","Final question, please.","Operator","Yes, sir. Last question comes from Ed Maguire with CLSA. Sir, your line is open.","Ed Maguire - CLSA","Thank you. Good evening. I wanted to follow-up on Rick's question about the transition from the transactional to a multi-year deal. How much --","Chris Suh","I think we lost the question.","Operator","I am sorry. Mr. Maguire, (Operator Instructions). Mr. Maguire, your line is open.","Ed Maguire - CLSA","Thank you. How much of your. Just going back to Rick's question, regarding the transition of transactional to multi-year revenues, what in your business reflects the transition in purchasing of on-premise to hosted or cloud offering like from Office to Office 365 or Server to Azure and other similar transitions?","Peter Klein","Well, a cloud purchase will sort of mirror multi-year annuity pressures. It's a very similar way to accomplish the same thing. You are making a long-term commitment, the revenue is going to be recognized in a similar fashion.","Today, we see a hybrid where customers are buying multi-year enterprise agreements. They'll also add-on some cloud services with that, but it will manifest itself in our financial results in a very similar way.","Chris Suh","Okay. So, that will wrap up our Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you at the numerous events and conferences, which we'll be participating in this quarter.","For those of you unable to attend in person, these events will generally webcast and you will be able to follow our comments at microsoft.com\/investor. Please contact us if you have any additional questions or details. Thanks again for joining us. Take care.","Operator","Thank you for your participation on today's call. The call has concluded. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you."]}}
