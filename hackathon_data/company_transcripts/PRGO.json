[Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Art Shannon, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please begin.","Arthur J. Shannon","Thank you very much, Melissa. Welcome to Perrigo's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. I hope you all had a chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the press release is available on our website. Also on our website is the slide presentation for this call.","Before we proceed with the call, I would like to remind everyone that during the process of this call, management will make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for investors and shareholders and Safe Harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued this morning.","Following management's review of the presentation, we will open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to now turn the call over to Perrigo's Chairman and CEO, Joe Papa.","Joseph C. Papa","Thank you, Art, and welcome, everyone, to Perrigo's third quarter fiscal 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today is Judy Brown, Perrigo's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Now let's go through the agenda for today's call. I will begin by providing a few comments on the quarter. Next, Judy will go through the details of the results from the fiscal third quarter and walk through our new guidance for consolidated Perrigo. Then I will provide an update on each business area as well as an overview of our expectations for the rest of the fiscal year. We will conclude by providing you an opportunity for Q&A.","First, the team delivered all-time record quarterly revenue and record third quarter adjusted operating income. This significant milestone was achieved despite a weak cough, cold and flu season compared to last year. Also, during the quarter, we acquired a number of OTC products in Australia and New Zealand. We executed on our integration plan for Elan by transferring the development of the D5 asset, and we sold our interest in Prothena. The Rx team shipped the generic versions of Vanos, Prandin and Neptazane to our customers, while the Nutritionals team partnered with KanPak to manufacture store brand adult nutritional drinks.","Now let's discuss our fiscal third quarter. On Slide 3, our quarterly performance is highlighted by all-time record net sales of over $1 billion, a 9% increase on a consolidated basis, with great numbers for adjusted gross profit and operating margin and record third quarter adjusted operating income.","On to Slide 5. Let's review the business units. We had a difficult quarter for our Consumer Healthcare and Nutritionals businesses. Consumer Healthcare was flat this quarter versus last year's all-time record third quarter. Sales for the quarter were $537 million, with $12 million of new product sales. However, as we stated in February, it was a weak cough, cold and flu season. No one would have expected the season to be so slow with the kind of winter we experienced. Retailers have stated that foot traffic in their stores was down in the quarter due to numerous storms across the country. This, coupled with retailers aggressively reducing their inventory, made for a very tough quarter across-the-board.","We realize that this segment missed your consensus numbers and our internal expectations. There were 3 factors impacting our sales, as follows: year-over-year, our cough\/cold category and analgesics sales accounted for approximately 40% of the miss; and the inventory reduction by our retailers accounted for approximately another 40%; and finally, due to the freezing weather throughout the country, especially in the south, the normal tick and flea season in the Southern U.S. was nonexistent through March, which accounted for approximately the remaining 20%.","Turning to the rest of our businesses. Our Rx segment grew sales 18%, with an adjusted operating margin of 45%. Our Nutritionals segment grew sales 3%, and adjusted operating income grew 16%.","Now let's look at the OTC market on Slide 6. The main driver of market share change is the return to the market of a major national brand analgesic and cough\/cold\/flu player after [ph] multi-year assets. We will expect this trend to continue for the next couple of quarters as we anniversary their return to the market. Store brand does continue to gain share in diabetes, smoking cessation and infant formula.","For some perspective on our results, let's look at a year-to-date growth rate for all of our segments. Despite all of the challenging dynamics in our CHC business, net sales are up 6% year-to-date, and that is compared to an all-time record performance last year. Our Nutritional business is up 13% year-to-date, and our RX segment is up 31%.","Now let me turn the call over to Judy.","Judy L. Brown","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. As you just heard, the team was able to post record revenue as well as record quarterly adjusted operating income and adjusted gross margin despite a dynamic and, quite frankly, difficult quarter. Our planning had always anticipated that the second half of our fiscal year would be more heavily weighted than the first. And our February guidance anticipated an even heavier fiscal fourth quarter as we considered timing of new product approvals, robust animal health introductions, et cetera.","As I'll discuss in a few minutes, the 9% revenue growth in this fiscal third quarter brought us over the $1 billion mark for the first time, a cause for celebration. However, the results admittedly fell short of our own expectations and have created an immediate impetus driving many directed initiatives around the organization for the remainder of the year. I'll talk about priority setting for our fourth quarter and going into fiscal 2015 in a few minutes.","But now, let's dive into the fiscal third quarter results by business segment beginning on Slide 7. Net sales were essentially flat in Consumer Healthcare. We had approximately $12 million in new product sales, $6 million of inorganic growth attributable to the acquisitions of Velcera and OTC products acquired from Aspen Global and also saw an increase in sales of existing products of $17 million, primarily in the smoking cessation and dermatologic categories. These combined increases were offset by a $36 million decline in sales of existing products in the cough\/cold, contract manufacturing and analgesics categories.","Two major headwinds which we highlighted last quarter also impacted year-over-year net sales this quarter. First, sales within our U.S. contract manufacturing business were down more than 25% year-over-year, as a certain contract customer that we supplied product to in fiscal 2013 resumed production at its own facilities, thereby reducing the need for products sourced from Perrigo. This decline impacted Consumer Healthcare's top line by nearly 200 basis points in the quarter.","Second, the return of product to market by a specific national brand competitor impacted year-over-year net sales, particularly in the analgesic and cough\/cold categories.","Now I'd like to discuss how the \"perfect storm\" of unexpected exogenous factors, including many of which you've heard and read about endlessly in the news, impacted Consumer Healthcare's net sales this quarter. First, as Jeff Needham discussed at Analyst Day, this cough\/cold\/flu season was much weaker than last year's and yielded a very difficult year-over-year sales comparison. In fact, according to IMS FAN data, the incidence of cough, cold and flu was down double digits year-over-year. Second, according to the most recent Morgan Stanley retail atlas report, approximately 36% of all retail outlets in the U.S. and Canada are located in cold climate zones, with another 24% located in the southeast, which saw its own share of ice storms throughout the quarter. As we've all heard in recent reports, U.S. retailers have been affirming lower year-over-year consumer foot traffic trends due to this inclement weather. We believe that this factor impacted our sales as well. And lastly, our net sales were impacted by inventory reduction programs at a number of our retail customers, which Joe highlighted just a few moments ago.","Adjusted gross margin contracted 140 basis points, primarily due to underabsorption of fixed production costs relative to lower volume output year-over-year. As we frequently discuss, our high-efficiency and high-volume production is a terrific competitive advantage for us. However, the significant scale of these Consumer Healthcare plans create unique challenges for us when sale volumes drop rapidly below our plan for thresholds. And as Joe mentioned, we closed our plants more this winter than the last 10 years combined, clearly a factor we had not anticipated.","The team controlled variable SG&A to compensate for the slower-than-expected quarter. But given the significant number of known and potential Rx-to-OTC switches on deck, they continue to increase their investments in R&D for future expected approvals and launches. These important business investments drove the incremental decrease in adjusted operating margin you see here.","On Slide 8, you can see that net sales within the Nutritionals segment increased more than 3% year-over-year, as new product sales contributed $7 million and existing product sales increased $4 million. These increases were partially offset by $6 million in discontinued products.","While we did see a net increase, year-over-year, net sales growth was constrained by 2 major factors. First, net sales were lower in our oral electrolyte solutions category due to the weak cough\/cold\/flu season, as the severity of winter illness is a major driver of product usage. Second, while consumers have accepted the plastic tub within the infant formula category, as evidenced by store brand market penetration of approximately 12%, 2 major infant formula manufacturers launched value-size promotional items during the quarter. While we anticipate launching store brand versions of these items within the current calendar year, these promotional items have caused a short-term disruption in market share gains. Sales within the VMS category were 11% higher year-over-year, fueled by the launch of insync, our internally developed natural probiotic, which is sold as a national brand. We expect full distribution of our insync over the coming months at multiple retail outlets.","The adjusted gross margin in the Nutritionals segment increased 230 basis points, driven by the higher relative adjusted gross margin of the insync brand and improved operating efficiencies over the last year. The adjusted operating margin grew, but at a slower pace than adjusted gross margin, as we chose to make more incremental promotional and selling expenditures related to the launch of insync.","As you can see on Slide 9, the Rx team continue to perform extremely well on nearly all metrics. Net sales within our Rx segment increased 18% to $223 million in the quarter due to new product sales of $33 million and incremental net sales of $17 million from the Rosemont and Fera acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in existing product sales of $9 million and $8 million of discontinued products.","Adjusted gross margin increased due to acquisitions, favorable product mix versus last year and higher margin on new product sales. The adjusted operating margin was affected by higher DSG&A costs due to the inclusion of Rosemont, coupled with investments in our specialty sales force, which Doug Boothe highlighted at our Analyst Day in February.","Next, on Slide 10, net sales in the API segment declined to $32 million due to a decrease in existing product sales of $17 million as a result of increased competition on certain products, partially offset by $8 million in new product sales. API growth and operating margins were impacted by the decrease in sales of existing products I just referred to and lower volumes, resulting in lower absorption of fixed costs.","Turning to Slide 11. Specialty sciences revenues were $53 million for the quarter, representing 12% of Biogen Idec's global sales of Tysabri. Adjusted operating margin incorporated R&D investments related to the ELND005 clinical program, which was transferred to Transition Therapeutics during the quarter, plus other administrative operating costs.","As we discussed last quarter, our consolidated adjusted effective tax rate for the full year was expected to be approximately 21% to 22%. The adjusted effective rate this third fiscal quarter was approximately 17.9%, lower than we had anticipated due to the actual jurisdictional mix of earnings before tax reported. This mix shift was a direct result of the relatively weak cough\/cold\/flu and retail season in the U.S.","Now some quick highlights on our balance sheet, including cash, current investments and current maturities and short-term debt. Working capital was $876 million at the end of the quarter compared to $754 million at June 29, 2013, for an increase of $122 million, which is primarily due to the Elan acquisition and strong Rx organic growth. As of March 29, 2014, total current and long-term debt on the face of the balance sheet was $3.3 billion, flat sequentially from last quarter.","Net debt, that is gross debt less cash, cash equivalents and current securities, was $2.7 billion, which equals a net debt-to-total capital at the end of our third quarter of 24%. Year-to-date net cash flow from operations was $401 million, even with the inclusion of an estimated $185 million of transaction and acquisition cost cash flows related to Elan.","Now I'd like to discuss our updated earnings outlook for fiscal 2014 on Slide 12 in further detail.","For Consumer Healthcare, we are making further adjustments to revenue expectations to reflect the weak cough\/cold\/flu season, the lower consumer activity at retail due to extreme winter weather conditions and inventory reductions we are experiencing at a number of our retail customers. Our expectations do include, however, the effects of an expected much stronger fiscal fourth quarter in our Animal Health category as we launch new products, such as PetArmor Plus flea and tick product, and as we move into what we anticipate will be a robust flea and tick season.","Despite these headwinds, we are not making any adjustments to margins.","Within the API segment, we are adjusting revenue expectations to reflect the increasingly competitive market dynamic of the products in our portfolio. And as such, you see here the impact both of the fiscal third quarter results and a more competitive fourth quarter than initially anticipated.","Summing all of this back to the consolidated P&L on Slide 13. We now estimate consolidated year-over-year revenue growth to be in a range of 13% to 15% with no change to our expectations for adjusted gross and operating margin expansion. As noted last quarter, we expect the adjusted effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to be approximately 21% to 22%. As a reminder, we continue to expect our total shares outstanding to be approximately 134 million shares on a go-forward basis, which equates to a full year fiscal 2014 weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 116 million shares. All of these rolls up to an adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $6.15 to $6.30 per share for full year fiscal 2014.","We've adjusted our expected range of cash flow from operations slightly from last quarter, bringing it back to our original August guidance. Please note, though, that we expect to achieve this level of operating cash flow while absorbing approximately $190 million of Elan-related acquisition costs which were not in the original August guidance range.","Despite a confluence of external dynamics that adversely affected several areas of our business, this team still delivered top line growth of 9% and adjusted net income growth of 31%. We believe that our overall diversified business model is strong, and we are fully aware of what our to-do list is to execute on our underlying longer-term plans. This team is laser-focused on mitigating the impact of external challenges through both cost containment and strictly prioritizing only those investments critical for our long term.","Our CHC team is running hard to make the Animal Health new product and store brand launches on deck for the fourth quarter a success. Effective May 1, we will be realizing 18% royalties on all worldwide sales of Tysabri, increasing the anticipated run rate in our Specialty Sciences segment quarter-over-quarter.","Through all of this, we remain firmly committed to doing the right things to drive new product approval, technology development and consumer awareness to enable the success of the many exciting growth initiatives we have on deck for our future. And now let me turn it back to Joe.","Joseph C. Papa","Thank you, Judy. It was a difficult quarter for our Consumer business, but we are working on positively impacting our business despite the weather and cough\/cold\/flu season. First, we have to bring the store brand version of new 600 milligrams ER back to the market, and I've challenged the team to relaunch this product as soon as possible. We have pathways to get this product to the market, but we are meeting weekly to improve upon our return-to-market timing.","We are working with our suppliers to make API and excipients that meet our specifications. It is a top priority for us to bring this product back to the market in our fiscal 2015.","Second, we are continuing to invest in future growth. As evidenced by what Judy stated, we continue to invest in important new products, anticipate reaping the benefits from those products in the future. We also continue to invest in research and development to be first to market in Rx-to-OTC switches, new products and innovation. These investments give us every reason to believe in the strength and long-term viability of our business model. That belief is further supported by the same 3 positive mega trends that we discussed at our Analyst Day in February: first, the continued movement of consumers purchasing store brand products, coupled with retailers promoting store brand products; second, the continued movement of prescription products switching to over-the-counter status; third, rising healthcare costs, combined with an aging population, will continue to drive the global need for low-cost healthcare products.","Our business model is poised to take advantage of each of these mega trends, which is why we believe we have an attractive growth opportunity for the future.","Now as you can see on Slide 14, our team launched a number of products thus far in fiscal 2014, highlighted by launches of our store brand versions of Mucinex allergy and Vicks Severe Cold & Flu store brand products. Year-to-date, we have launched an impressive $167 million in new products, and we anticipate launching over 75 new products across all segments, contributing more than $190 million in revenue this year.","Moving on to our growth opportunities in our Rx segment. On Slide 15, we have a robust pipeline of 30 ANDAs pending FDA approval, representing approximately $4 billion in branded sales. This includes 7 confirmed first-to-file ANDAs, including the generic version of Androgel 1.62%.","The positive momentum in this segment should continue with the best new product pipeline in our history.","Additionally, in our nutrition business, we just received an approval to supply China with our U.S.-manufactured infant formula.","In summary, on Slide 16, while we work through these near-term issues, the fundamental business remains strong. The strength of our enhanced platform for growth, combined with the mega trends I just reviewed, means that Perrigo is well positioned for further growth as we continue to execute on our mission of making quality healthcare more affordable for consumers.","Operator, let's now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Louise Chen, Guggenheim.","Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And so I had a question on the Tysabri royalties. We get a lot of questions on that. And we've gotten concerns that a partial or a full divestiture of the royalties would be dilutive to earnings, at least for a short period of time while you decide what to do to reinvest the profits. So I'm just kind of curious, what is the right way to really think about this opportunity?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Well, let me start, and then Judy, if you want to add anything. First and foremost, I have to say that as we think about Tysabri, we really, really think this is a great asset with great escalating royalties. We believe that we have a great partner with Biogen. And we're -- in the MS category, we occupy a very important position for -- Tysabri occupies a very important position. So we really like the asset. It has -- as we've stated in the past, we are going to continue to evaluate all of our options for this asset. But as we approach the asset, we think it's a good long-term asset that has a great long life with a 1% tax rate. So I think the important comment that we would say is that we're obviously always been focused out of being a shareholder-friendly company. We're going to make sure that if we make any moves with this particular asset, they're aligned with other things that we are doing on our M&A strategy for the long term for the business. Judy, anything you want to add to that?","Judy L. Brown","Sure. So Louise, as you think about this, we had always said that having this asset, it drives terrific cash flows. The EBITDA generation allows us to continue to march down on our delevering profile, to which we are committed. And we also -- it allows us then to go and reinvest and do other acquisitions and think about our future growth strategies. We're one to divest a portion of it, you are correct, because it is a royalty stream. That means it has 100% operating margin and it has a very, very low single-digit tax rate, which means were you to just sell off a portion of it and not reinvest, it would be dilutive because you would be taking out top line margin and a low tax rate. However, that is -- as Joe just said, we would not be divesting that just to divest it. And the whole point here is to have a strong balance sheet, strong cash flow generation and looking for opportunities longer term to reinvest.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky, ARC Capital (sic) [RBC Capital].","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, just a couple of questions on Consumer. So if we think about that the midpoint of the Consumer revenue guidance reduction of about 250 basis points at the midpoint, that's about $52 million. I know, Judy, you called out 3 different components. The question is, how much of that is cough and cold that we're not going to see versus inventory in flea and tick that perhaps could be pushed into next quarter? And then maybe if you could comment on the swing factors between the 300 basis points range for next quarter.","Judy L. Brown","Let me just address your first question on Consumer Healthcare first. As we looked at the adjustments, we took into consideration knowing that the extreme level of detail that we compile our forecast is different than you're able to do by doing your estimates. But suffice it to say that as we thought about Consumer Healthcare, about half of the change in the guidance adjustment came from what we experienced in Q3, and about half came with some of that spilling into the beginning of Q4. So about 60% Q3, about 40% into Q4. And the Q4 adjustments were to fully reflect Joe's comments already on Mucinex, to reflect a slower start that we had seen, at least at retail in the allergy season, and making adjustments that we thought were appropriate to fill out a very strong Animal Health big launch in Q4, but to make sure that we were reflective of the statistics we were seeing, at least in the month of April with respect to the outbreak of flea and tick problems throughout the country, given the strange anomalies we've seen in the season. So those are the moving parts that led us to adjust that range to where it is. And so your numbers were about right, in line with where we had been.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I mean, Joe, is there a way to help us get better visibility so that we don't see the quarterly volatility going forward? I mean, there's a lot of moving parts and seasonality in your business. The last couple of quarters have been obviously difficult from a variance to where the Street has been. Is there something you guys can do to help us out?","Joseph C. Papa","Well, obviously, we have a lot of discussions of that -- about that with our investor relations team and ourselves in finance and myself. And I think what we clearly have to look toward the future is providing a lot of visibility as best as we can to the question. So we're going to continue to work towards that. The other part on the winter, the cough\/cold\/flu season winter, I mean, I think that was being down 12% versus a year ago, was somewhat unexpected in terms of the magnitude, at least as compared with the weather that we experienced. On the question of some of the inventory reduction part that I talked about, we have seen that inventory reduction occur. It was something that we clearly noted. I think, though, really maybe the only thing I was going to say to comment on yours is that what was interesting to us is that in the full year-to-date, the numbers are not that different in terms of where we have achieved, I mean, in terms of where we have gone through for Consumer Healthcare sales being up 6% year-to-date, being clearly the direction of what we had expected, albeit we did have to reduce it. But it was -- there is some seasonality to what we've seen. And I think what we've tried to do, at least as I have been a part of Perrigo, is to diversify the business and continue to try to offset with some of the diversifications, things that we've seen with the Nutritionals business, 13% year-to-date growth, albeit this quarter not at that level, and our Rx business being up 31% year-to-date. I think we've tried to look at some diversification to try to offset some of these issues, but I agree that we need to do a great job or have better visibility into what we see as quarterly changes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Steinberg, Jefferies.","David Michael Steinberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just curious, you mentioned there was a -- you were producing for a contract manufacturer. They've resolved their issues, and that took about 200 basis points out of your top line. Just curious, do you have any other situations like that we should be aware of? And then secondly, on pricing. Obviously, the trade has a very, very high markup on your products. Any opportunity for price, particularly in the Nutritionals segment?","Judy L. Brown","I'll take the contract question. So we have always had that contract manufacturing business for decades. This particular one contract was particularly large. We called it out last year as being a big bump. And this -- with that project coming to, for all intents and purposes, coming to a close, that is the one larger contract in our portfolio. The remainder, we have dozens of other smaller contracts with other third parties in our portfolio.","Joseph C. Papa","And David, on the pricing part of our -- of your question, I think what we -- how we approach the pricing. Is there opportunities in a couple of our different business segments? The answer is yes, but what I think we basically have tried to do, at least for the 7 years I've been at Perrigo, is to look at pricing to keep pricing flat to up slightly across our total Perrigo businesses across all of our portfolio. We believe that's probably the best approach to our pricing in terms of a prospect. That means in some quarters, in some business units, some of the pricing may be down, but in other business units, it will be up. And we're trying to balance that so that we keep our pricing flat to up slightly. But I absolutely agree that there are some opportunities for us in different business segments. We just want to be smart about how we look at those across our total business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger, Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have questions on, I guess, 3 topics, if that's okay. Well, I'll try to keep it efficient. First of all, Joe, if you could frame Mucinex so that we can better understand it. I think that it was a $600 million branded over-the-counter franchise. Could you just sort of characterize what your run rate is today? And then you mentioned reintroducing the 600. Could you just talk about what portion of the $600 million you are selling private label against today and then what portion you'll be selling against in a year so that we can understand whether you're just going to be targeting a fraction of the Mucinex opportunity in '15 or the majority of it and that type of thing? In addition, if you could just comment on Nasacort and just explain when we should expect that to launch, what quarter of 2015. And then on the Rx side, the sales growth was well below what IMS sales dollars implied. And the sales were down $23 million sequentially versus the December quarter, so if you could explain that and then what big Rx launches to watch over the next year.","Joseph C. Papa","Well, David, you've got quite a few questions here. I'll try to get -- make sure I get to them all. First of all, maybe on Mucinex, let me start there. At this time, in the Mucinex family, we are shipping very minimal amounts of Mucinex in -- and they tend to be the newer products that we launched, as I mentioned, the Mucinex allergy product. We are not shipping the Mucinex 600 milligrams extended-release product. We shipped that up probably through, I think -- as we made a note in October, we shipped it going into our second quarter, but there were no shipments in our third quarter at this time. So that's where we are with it. In terms of the question, the question of minimal sales for the Mucinex family of products at this time. The Mucinex family of products, though, is a very significant product category, and it continues to expand and grow. And Reckitt Benckiser does a nice job with the growth in the -- adding additional line extensions to the family. So we are going to be very busy with bringing out additional products there. In terms of 2015, it is our intent in 2015 to the return to the market with a 600-milligram product, the extended-release product, as well as to get the remaining members of the family through our partnership with another company to bring out some additional members of the family during the 2015 timeframe. That is all what we have for our plans. I probably will say more about that in August, when we come out with our 2015 guidance. But we do have plans in place to return to the market with the 600-milligram ER during our fiscal 2015 as well as bringing out additional members of the family of products. On the question of Nasacort, we think the Sanofi team has done a great job in launching the Nasacort product out into the marketplace. They've invested in the product significantly. At this time, we are still working with our partner, Teva, to get a product, a store brand private label product, in the market. We do not have a final path to the market yet, but we do expect to work through some of the questions and issues with our partners. But at this time, there is no specific date that I could share with you. But we are working very closely with our partner, Teva, and we'll have more to comment when we can get specific details about when we can enter into that marketplace. But once again, a good product. On the question of the Rx business, I can't really make any specific comments about IMS data. We do look at it, but I don't want make any specific comments on that. I think what I would simply say is that a couple of things are going on there, and it is really all around our new product launches during the quarter. We had the opportunity to launch Vanos. We launched Prandin. And we have -- just after our fiscal third quarter ended, we also launched an AG of Taclonex. That, though, does not show up in these results. It will show up in our fourth quarter results because it was after the quarter concluded. So I think that's really probably the comments I can offer on potentially any differences in the Rx businesses versus the quarter. The only final point I would say is that, clearly, the Rx business is one that we are going to continue to invest behind, both on the R&D side but also what we're doing by building a specialty sales force to help us with our ophthalmic products, which we think have some very significant opportunities for promotional support behind some of our products. And the team is building up that infrastructure to do that for the future. Judy, any comments you want to make?","Judy L. Brown","Just getting just a tiny bit more granular for some color for you, David, is if I roll forward Q2 to Q3, as I noted on my prepared remarks, we specifically discontinued -- we had discontinuances of approximately $9 million in the quarter versus last quarter. And also, just we did have -- saw some shifts in inventory levels between end of Q2, which was at the holiday, and some of our retailers or some of our customers absorbed more inventory just at the very end there versus the end of Q3, when we saw some of those similar adjustments going on end of Q3 with a few of our customers rebalancing inventory. So not a big number, but if you take discontinuances and some of those small inventory shifts in a couple of places, it adds up pretty much to that roll-forward that you talked about on the quarter-over-quarter basis.","Joseph C. Papa","[Operator Instructions]","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin, Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Joe, just I'll try to keep it to 1 slash 2 questions. You -- right, but you cite in your press release and during your prepared remarks that the weak results just -- was not just seasonality issues but the return of a competitor, presumably J&J. Why should that have been a surprise? And is J&J gaining more market share than you had anticipated? And how should we think about that going forward? And then just, if I may, high-level question, Joe. We're seeing a tremendous amount of M&A breakup, spinout activity across really global pharma, sec pharma. And what we're seeing is a lot of companies are looking to get more specialized, focusing more on what they're good at, getting out of what they're not good at. And yet, Perrigo is really going the opposite way by diversifying into other businesses. And I'm just wondering if you could share with us if you have any different thoughts on -- is that the right strategy for Perrigo? Because clearly, the last several quarters have been quite volatile for reasons that I understand are beyond your control, but you would think that with the more diversified portfolio of businesses, that should have ameliorated some of the ups and the downs. So if you could kind of comment on that. Is that still M&A strategy diversification the right strategy for Perrigo?","Joseph C. Papa","Thank you, Jami. A couple of comments. First of all, as I talk about really where we were talking relative to the quarter on the Consumer Healthcare, I've got to make a couple of comments relative to where we are. First, the real issue's on the miss. J&J was not a surprise. J&J returning to the market is not a surprise to us. We've known it. As we've stated going back, I guess, 3 years ago, we always felt when they came back to market, they were going to gain much of their share back. We had said 50% of the share, they gain. We still believe it's about that 50% range.","[Technical Difficulty]","Joseph C. Papa","Number two, so J&J's return was not really a surprise to us. We're still at about expectation of keeping about 50% of the share we gained. On the question of the seasonality, there is no question that, that did affect our Consumer Healthcare business and any of our consumer businesses. Even the nutrition business was somewhat affected by the weather and then, more specifically, the cough\/cold\/flu season as it related to Consumer Healthcare. As I tried to make mention in my comments, we felt that as we thought about the miss that you were talking about, about 40% of it came from the weak season, a weak cough\/cold\/flu season. About 40% of the difference was what I referred to as some of the inventory reductions that occurred during the quarter with the retail customers. And then about 20% of it was the issue on the weather effect of -- relative to a late start with the flea and tick season in our Animal Healthcare business. On the issue -- the second part of the question, on our issue relative to M&A, as you know, what Perrigo is really trying to do is focus our M&A strategy on going after places where we think our model works really well in terms of trying to add that next new adjacent category, like ophthalmics, like what we're doing at pet care, adult nutrition, diabetes. The basic premise of what we're seeking to do, Jami, is simply saying we've got a great distribution channel with the large retailers, how do I get one more item on the truck that's at Perrigo today going to the large retailer that will be important to the retailer. Well, you may think that is a diversification. I simply would say to you that we believe that strategy allows us just to get -- be more important for our large retailers. And I think that is the overriding, what we believe, unique, sustainable, competitive position Perrigo has, is that we've got these relationships and distribution channel with the retailers. And therefore, by adding additional adjacencies, it allows us to have a longer-term stronger business with each of the retailers. Relative to the M&A activity, so I do think it's going to continue to be a very dynamic market with M&A activities, and companies will continue to look to find ways in which they will seek to have competitive advantage. And I think that's exactly what Perrigo is doing. And as we talked at the Analyst Day, we continue to look after what are those things that give Perrigo a unique competitive advantage. It is our distribution channel. It is what we do from a critical mass point of view. We clearly think it's the ability to have a quality reputation in the marketplace, this mass customization. Our #1 position in a number of our brands is really what's going to continue to drive Perrigo for the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Annabel Sam (sic) [Samimy] of Stifel.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","This is a little bit along the lines of Jami's question. But in terms of your guidance for retention of national brand, you've guided to about 50% in the past, I guess, was in your guidance. But you have said that, usually, you can see a little bit higher retention. So you're seeing some of these national brands coming back with greater force than you would have anticipated and especially now when you've got a lot of investment in consumer by larger players. Are you going to see an increase in competition and, I guess, increase in value promotions that the national brands put forth to gain that retailer share? And along those same lines, why were there such reductions in inventories in the retailer channel? Was it partly due to some of this increased competition?","Joseph C. Papa","Okay. So as we say -- said before, when we thought about what was happening when national brands were out of the marketplace, we did gain share. There's no question about that. As we see them return to the market, we normally -- when consumers make a move from national brand to store brand, we get 91% of them stay with store brand. In the case where they were forced to make a switch, such as the manufacturers not being able to supply, we felt the data was somewhere around that 50% range, is probably the most specific data. I will say, though, that we had panel data that said it was actually around 67%, but we said we'd be conservative and use the 50% number. And we haven't seen anything at this time that deviates from that 50% retention that we talked about before. So I feel pretty comfortable with where we are with our projections for retention. I do think there is going to be incremental branded efforts in the OTC market, but as we've said before, I think that's great news for Perrigo. That incremental activity in the branded OTC market is just going to be a stronger OTC market. We'll have more brands out there, which, in the long term, gives us more opportunities to launch the store brand Perrigo product for the future. So we actually think the activities in the larger branded pharma market are good news for Perrigo because we'll have more focus on OTC products. Companies are paying very high multiples to go and acquire businesses in OTC. And presumably, they're going to do that because they're going to invest behind those businesses, which we think is good news. Over the long term, they will drive the store brand business. On the question of store brands, though, I do -- I would say that the activities we're seeing in market share changes today are not unexpected when the national brands come back to the market after an absence. I would look to the categories in which there haven't been significant national brand reentries to really talk about how is store brand doing versus national brand. And that's in the areas of diabetes. That's in the areas of nicotine replacement therapy. Those are the areas where there haven't been disruptions in the market, and we're still showing some significant gains in those categories. On the last question of inventory, we just see that as just being -- the fact happens is that the large retailers purchased inventory early in our fiscal year in anticipation of the cough\/cold\/flu season. In the absence of a large season, they just worked down their inventory just through a normal process of working through inventory over time through the 6 months that -- since the quarter -- first quarter ending commentary. So that's really all that we saw in the inventory. Judy, you want to add anything?","Judy L. Brown","On the inventory cycle, we always talk about how our business -- especially at this time of year, we would see that reorder point. And when we've seen many of you in January and February, talked at Analyst Day about what a slow season it was, that reorder point never really happened. And many of our retailers have year ends, fiscal year ends, in that January or February timeframe, after the Christmas holiday has passed. And as such, they were seeing sluggish retail numbers, and they're also going to be doing what they can to manage through their own financials through the end of the year, i.e. inventory management. So if you're not seeing a lot of foot traffic, there isn't a reorder point. You have inventory on hand, you're going to work it down. I wouldn't say -- I'd say when we were giving last guidance, that would be a surprise. As you look back and say what happened over the course of the season for the retailers and for us, the fact that they were working down their inventory is not entirely unprecedented, and hence, we wanted to plan for that also as we considered the dynamics through the remainder of the year, taking into consideration that they have been working down their inventories.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman, UBS.","Marc Harold Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So Joe, I know you don't want to talk about '15 yet with respect to guidance, but just based on the quarter and what's happened here, I mean, obviously, we've got some type of rebasing. Help us understand what's changed. I mean, if we look out to fiscal '15, does anything really change? Should we be changing our models in any major way? And then just I think someone previously, I forget who it was, asked the question about Rx products and launches over fiscal '15. What are some of the products that we should be expecting that could come in on a risk-adjusted basis as you guys start to think about your modeling for next year?","Joseph C. Papa","Let me start with the first question on the fiscal year '15. We don't specifically talk about the upcoming year until the August timeframe. But what I can say on this is very consistent with what we've said in the past relative to how we look at the total Perrigo business. As we said in our February Analyst Day, we expect to be able to grow the top line in this business by somewhere in that 5% to 10% range and then -- that's organic growth, and then to grow the operating income line approximately double that range, from a compounded annual growth rate for both of those numbers. So 5%, 10% compounded annual growth rate over a 3-year time period per year and then approximately double that on the operating income line. Having said that, we also do believe we could supplement that growth with -- based on history, what we've been able to historically is be able to show a growth rate of approximately 15%, 16% top line growth, which was half was organic, half was inorganic through M&A. I mean, that is the model that we continue to believe is appropriate for Perrigo as we add these adjacent categories into our business to help us to continue to grow. Specifically, on the organic commentaries, without getting into any specific products, Marc, what I've said is that we do expect additional products in the Mucinex family of products that we -- in our fiscal year '15. So that's something we've said previously. In the Rx category, there's a number of products that we have already talked about. We'll get the full year effect of all of those products for the launch of the fiscal year '15, products like Prandin, Nitrolingual, the Derma-Smoothe, the Cutivate, the Vanos, and then we have 3 additional products that we have not yet talked about launching. But those are important parts of our launch programs for fiscal year '15 and get the full year effect of that. Judy, you probably want to add some things to it. Part of his question...","Judy L. Brown","Yes, Marc, I just wanted to add one item because you were talking about are you -- do you need to reengage '15. And to Joe's point, we talked about that at Analyst Day. We talked about those compounded annual growth rates going forward. You'll probably never meet a more self-aware and hard-on-themselves team as this one. And we've obviously looked at these numbers very carefully as we talk about finishing up the rest of the year and the run rates going into next year. But I would -- it behooves me to mention that even if you look right now at the midpoints of the ranges that we've just given you for fiscal '14, just taking into consideration the midpoint, this business is growing without Elan 10% year-over-year at the midpoint, 14% on the operating income line. And if you look at the midpoints of net income, take out the noise for all the share changes that have happened in the denominator, the business is growing in the mid-30% range. So yes, we're going to be doing some very careful evaluation of what goes into '15. To Joe's point, those compounded annual growth rates are still published. But I also know that while we are going to do a lot around focusing on cost and the right priorities of investment opportunities, we also can feel pretty good that we have double-digit top line, mid-teens operating income, mid -- double digits, mid 20s, mid 30s as you walk your way through the P&L and look at the growth rates. So we feel good about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur, Needham & Company.","Elliot Wilbur - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Question for Joe. I know the cough\/cold is about 25% of your Consumer Healthcare business on a full year basis. But maybe you could just, for my own analytical framework, just a little bit of color commentary on the relative gross margin profitability of that line versus the rest of the business. And then the question I really want to ask here is, basically, when you go back in the war room and debrief after the call and after you talk to investors, I mean, do you really anticipate making any strategic or tactical changes in terms of how you manage the Consumer Healthcare business? Obviously, you can't control the weather or foot traffic. But if you look at sort of the profitability expectations for that business the last couple of years, I mean, sales have gone up about 50%. The margins, at least on a gross margin basis, have been stuck in the low-30% range despite the fact that you've enjoyed a very nice new product cycle. And I'm just wondering if you're, at this point, willing to discuss the possibility of some sort of broad restructuring of that business. It just seems like, from my perspective, anyway, that we should at least be generating profitability kind of in the mid to high 30s, which I think it's been kind of the longer-term target for some time.","Joseph C. Papa","Okay. Well, you've got a lot of great questions that are comments that -- let me try to address them one at a time here. Relative to our total business, the cough\/cold\/flu, which really brings in -- flu brings in analgesics, represents about 27% of our business. So relative to the totality of it, I agree with you. On the question of the gross margin percentage, it's roughly comparable to the rest of the business. It depends on which new products gets launched, et cetera, but it's roughly comparable with our total business. There's some areas of cough\/cold\/flu analgesics that are a little better in analgesics or others, but roughly comparable there. On the question of what we look at for our total business, and I guess you referred to it as a war room debrief or tactical changes, what we really continue to focus on, as I stated before, is our overall strategy is quality affordable healthcare. We're going to continue to focus on quality affordable healthcare and, importantly, launch new products. That's an important part of it. And we need to get the Mucinex product back into the marketplace. I absolutely think that, that's not something we're satisfied with, is being out of the market with Mucinex product. It's an important product. And more importantly, we've got to get it back in the marketplace. And that's something that we are working with meeting the team on a regular basis to get that to occur. So if there's an issue that we have that is something that needs some tactical work on, it clearly is Mucinex, as an example. But I would say it's for all of the other products. Relative to the question, though, I really do believe that the mega trends that have driven this business for the last 7 years are the same things that are happening today. We're still going to -- store brand is still going to take share away from national brand. Everything we've seen in that is still true. I will admit that as a result of those national brands being out of the market for several years, that we're having some disruption in that overall number. But if you look at the categories where there is no disruption, store brand continues to take share from national brand, and that's something we expect. I think the other thing that, in terms of growth, that you're asking about is how many products are going to go from prescription to OTC. We look at it as a very exciting time. But at the end of this month, we expect that we'll see Nexium launch occur. You know that Oxytrol has moved from prescription to OTC status, which opens up other products in the category of overactive bladder. We've seen Nasacort go from prescription to OTC, which opens up, I believe, other products that are nasal spray steroidal-type products. So I think there's a number of category movements that we are still very excited about. And what we're doing is -- as a management team, we had a choice. We could have hit a better number from an operating income if we cut back on R&D, and it's not my mindset to do that. I want to make sure that we are positioning this product for -- and the company for the future by getting these products to the marketplace as soon as possible. So those are the types of questions one faces in making decisions. Another area that we've made an investment in, and we think it's the right investment, is we're building some specialty sales capabilities in our Rx business for our ophthalmic products that we've acquired that are unique, promotable opportunities, and that's another area where we're going to invest for the future. So those are, I guess, what I would refer more to the tactical changes that I mentioned. But continue to reinforce our belief that we've got a great position, great opportunity for the future for Perrigo.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott, JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones here. Maybe the first one, just so there's no confusion with the annual guidance versus the quarterly, given this kind of step-up in share count, can you -- let me -- can you just confirm what your actual 4Q EPS range is based on your guidance? I just to make sure we're all clear on that. Second question, OTC Singulair, just interested in any thoughts you might have had from the panel last week, what they'll pledge [ph] for the opportunity. And then a final quick one. Business development, you're obviously in some very attractive markets here. I guess just are you seeing signs of price inflation in the targets you're going after? Just it seems like, again, some of these markets are attracting more interest. Is that kind of raising some of the prices you're having to pay for these assets? Just any comments on that front.","Judy L. Brown","Sure. I'll take the Q4 piece first. So that implies the full year guidance, which, as you very astutely note, is essentially Q4 guidance. The push, if you will, means that the implied range is approximately $1.52 to $1.67 for the quarter. That would imply also 116 million shares outstanding weighted average for the full year but 134 million shares outstanding in the Q4. And it also implies an effective tax rate of 21% to 22% in Q4 but also for the full year. So that's the implication for the Q4.","Joseph C. Papa","On the question of OTC Singulair, obviously, we are very interested in that question. We did have attendees at the meeting. I think I'd start with saying we think Merck did a very good job in presenting the data on montelukast and Singulair. Obviously, it was voted against, the movement from prescription to OTC. I think we're just going to continue to monitor the situation. We still believe that there's an opportunity there, but obviously, we've got to wait and see what the FDA decides on that question. I would simply say that we think Merck did a good job of presenting the information. We'll wait and see what the FDA makes decision. But as to our specific activities at Perrigo, we will specifically continue to work towards getting ready for a potential switch, realizing that, at this time, it is certainly uncertain at best as to whether the product will move. On the business development side, we have been very active. We've been talking to many different companies and looking at activities in the marketplace. And I do think the -- I've been in pharmaceuticals for 31 years. I'd say this is probably the most dynamic time for companies' movements in the business development, corporate development world that I've seen in 31 years. So it is a very active time period. Relative to what we're doing, I think Perrigo is going to continue to stay very disciplined in what we will offer for assets. We think it's -- we use a concept of return on invested capital for measuring any asset that we are going after. We will continue to take that same focus that we've taken for the past 7 years, but I won't discount the fact that the market is very dynamic at this time relative to M&A transactions in the marketplace. I think where we go with it, though, is we try to go after assets that play to the Perrigo competitive advantages that we've talked about before, being the customer relationships we had, how to find that next new adjacent category that comes into the marketplace. That's really what we're trying to do, and that's what we're going to continue to do for the future.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser, B. Riley.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","So in terms of your operating margins in all the different segments, here in the third fiscal quarter, you're actually at the low end or actually below what the guidance is for the margins for the full year, and that's because you've been experiencing sequential declines in margins in almost all of the segments. So I'm just kind of wondering how to think about it heading into 2015. And I know you've alluded to things already, but I'm wondering if we should think about margin declines year-over-year in the first half of the fiscal year and then, as things improve, see margin increase in the second half? Because at the level your margins are at now, we're really not looking at margin increases in the first half of 2015. So is that an accurate thought process, if you could comment?","Joseph C. Papa","Right. Well, let me just start with -- I'll make a couple of comments. Judy, you may want to add to that as well. But I mean, I understand the nature of the sequential comment that you made. But I also think you have to go back to the year-over-year comparison. As a total company, the operating margin for the total company in third quarter fiscal year '13 was 22.6%, and today, I'm at 24% as a total company, albeit, though, I understand your comments relative to individual -- the individual business units. But where we are going with our business is that -- what I said before, Linda, is that what we are seeking to do is make some investments. We've looked at what we've done in the R&D part of our business. Our total R&D is up approximately -- I think it was 57%, 57% in the quarter for total R&D. Even absent the Elan effects, it's up dramatically during the quarter. Even if you take out Elan, it's up approximately 25%. So I think that investment is something that we feel very good about because we are looking for not just the next quarter, but we're looking for what opportunities are in front of us from an R&D point of view. It's all these new products that we expect to go from prescription to OTC. We've got to get ourselves ready for that, and that's why we're spending behind that. I don't really want to offer any other specific comments on our -- other than what we put in the guidance for our operating margins for the -- for each of the individual businesses. But just to be clear, know we're investing in R&D, know we're investing in adding some sales capabilities for our Rx business, which we think is going to help the long-term opportunities we have, for example, in our ophthalmic business. Judy, anything you want to add?","Judy L. Brown","I would just say that as we think about next year and modeling out how FY '15 is going to look, obviously, one of the pieces we're going to be taking into consideration is volume and throughput. Because to the points raised throughout the morning on volume changes this quarter, in particular, and to some extent -- to a lesser extent but still there in our fiscal second quarter, is how do changes in volume impact our absorption in the plans and making sure that we're on top of that. Because to the points raised, when we come out and first have a dialogue about the year, it's based on one expectation of volume. And when no one's shopping and buying products, that dramatically changes the way that the plans can quickly react and absorb. So that will be part of the planning. And as we commented throughout this quarter and last quarter, in CHC at least, that had an approximately 150-basis-point impact on gross margin. So we will be working on planning for that appropriately.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sumant Kulkarni, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Is there anything other than winter conditions that could have affected retail traffic, such as could this be a potential inflection point in the emergence of new selling challenges because of the Internet? And, second, does the company think it makes sense to have more internal national brands such as insync?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Good questions. I do believe the majority of what we've heard from the retailers, it is predominantly the winter conditions, the storms that I've talked about. At least as we've heard from the large retailers, we do think that is the predominant reason. I cannot, though, exclude that the Internet and e-commerce is having an impact, both in terms of foot traffics because that clearly is something we also know. But I would only say, as it relates to e-commerce, I think you know that one of the things that Perrigo has done certainly over the last 12 to 18 months is really make some investments into the e-commerce world to ensure that we are well represented in that space. And that's, hopefully, an opportunity for some significant growth in e-commerce for us, for that specific question. And then, I'm sorry, the second part of your question was...","Sumant S. Kulkarni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","More national brands like insync.","Joseph C. Papa","Yes. I'm sorry. Thank you. The question on insync is -- we think, is a very important question for Perrigo. I will say you're not going to see Perrigo try to launch national brands with a $200 million marketing and distribution and promotion budget. But we do believe there are some specific niches where we can take our technology, enter into the marketplace and have a national brand opportunity. But that also rewards the retailers with some promotional dollars but also delivers a quality product into the marketplace. We do think that insync is an important first effort on our part. But we do think there are other examples of insync-type products, and that, we think, is something that we talked about in the Analyst Day, was moving up the value-branded curve rather than just simply staying in the store brand business. So those are some things that we're doing. It's clearly -- the other example that I mentioned before is what we were doing in the Rx business with our Rx sales force as an opportunity. That's -- those are things we'll do opportunistically. We'll look for the opportunities and go after them where we see they exist.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Buck, Buckingham Research.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","First, on the inventory situation in the quarter, I know, Judy and Joe, you explained part of that. But why wouldn't we want to assume that retailers are going to be more cautious the next cough\/cold season? And what gives us confidence that for the flea\/tick season, which I believe was weak a year ago, you won't see a similar caution from retailers on that front? And then one separate question. For API, you obviously took down guidance on revenues. What will change in fiscal '15? And why shouldn't we assume that the fading of API, which is a high-margin business, continues into fiscal '15?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. So let me just try to take the question on the inventory first. What I would say, David, is that there is always a certain amount of retail anticipation of the cough\/cold\/flu season. As you think about it, last year was a very strong cough\/cold\/flu season. So indeed, it was not surprising that, in our first quarter of our fiscal year, there was some anticipation of cough\/cold\/flu season and some activities that looked at that. When the season then did not develop anywhere close to the previous season, it was just a natural opportunity for retailers to work down their inventories, similar to the comments I made and Judy made. So I don't think there was any real surprises there. I mean, I guess the lack of the season is the surprise -- or a very weak season, I probably -- is better stated. A weak season was the surprise. But the fact that the inventory followed that down, that, I don't know it was very much a surprise. It just -- we just tried to put some -- give you some sense of that contributed about 40% of the miss that I mentioned in the call. On the question of flea and tick, we do look at that very closely in that we try to incorporate that into the guidance, as per the comments by myself and Judy. So we have tried to look at that in anticipation of our fourth quarter guidance. On the question of API, that really was really a result of just knowing that we had some competition in our business for API. But I think importantly, what we've said in the past is we do expect that the external sales of that business to ramp down as we increase the amount of vertical integration we get out of that business to lower our cost of goods across our total Rx and Consumer Healthcare business. So that's been just -- the vertical integration activities that we have talked about for our API business have been underway for quite some time. We still will opportunistically go after a raw material or an API that we can supply to others that is a challenging API because of -- it's a hormonal product or there's some -- it's an oncology product. Things that are challenges, APIs will go after. Absolutely expect to see more of our business shift towards vertical integration, consistent with what we've said previously. And I think I got all your questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen, William Blair.","Jon Andersen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","My question is on infant formula, which is a significant business for you. Can you talk a little bit more about the dynamic affecting that business in Q3 and how quickly you can respond? I think you mentioned, Joe, in the prepared comments that you've been approved to ship in China. How quickly can you initiate that effort? And what should we expect there?","Joseph C. Papa","Yes. Judy, do you want to take the first part of the infant formula question about Q3 and the size, the introduction of the [indiscernible]...","Judy L. Brown","Yes. So qualitatively -- so we have our new tubs out. We've talked about that in great detail in these calls, and hopefully, you've seen the product on the shelf when you've been shopping. Just within this last fiscal quarter, the brands, with the same look and feel on the tubs, introduced a new value size that is same price, more quantity. We are able to ramp up to that, but it was the kind of promotional item that was on the shelves that attracted consumers. So we absolutely know how to do that and how to respond to it. And it's a classic example of the types of things brands always do to duck and weave, if you will, around the store brand competition. So it's -- that's something we absolutely know how to go after and are addressing that immediately. So that was part of it. My prepared remark was sales were -- sales grew, but they could have grown more had that not happened. But again, the approach is we know how to get in there and deal with that immediately.","Joseph C. Papa","On the second part of your comment, you picked up my comment relative to our certification and accreditation by the People's Republic of China to get -- ship our products from the U.S. into China. That is absolutely good news on our part, we believe. We were approved. Perrigo was approved. But also, the 3 other expected branded players from the U.S. also were approved. So Abbott, Mead Johnson and Gerber were also approved. What we're really -- what I think the opportunity here is that the -- China, as a country, is sanctioning our products to be introduced into China. There are some other U.S. manufacturers of infant formula that were not approved based on -- these companies make product here in the U.S. and ship it to China, but they were not approved to go into China for the future, is how we understand this rule to be. I don't think it will make a significant change in how we look at China, but it will reduce some of the product coming into China from U.S.-manufactured sources that is not approved for future entry into China. So that really, we think, gives us an opportunity for the future.","Judy L. Brown","Joe, maybe I can just drop in with a little color. If any of you are wondering, well, wait a minute, I thought you already were approved to be selling products in China, and I thought you already were shipping despite at a lower rate than you had anticipated. In just the recent months, we had the inspectors from China were in the U.S. visiting sites and going through a process to add additional approvals for those companies that they were going to give an official stamp of approval to. So that is the development that Joe just referred to and the inspections that just happened. So we were approved under old standards. The standards were upgraded. We went through that process, and we got approval just now to be able to say, unequivocally, we can continue on with our business as we had anticipated.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Chiang, CRT Capital.","Timothy Chiang - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Joe, as you -- certainly, you guys now have a PLC status, and you have an attractive offshore corporate tax structure. As you look at M&A, I look at your businesses, and certainly, your prescription pharmaceutical business is still your highest-margin business. It still seems to be your most profitable business, but it's only about 20% of your total revenues. I mean, when you look at M&A, do you have a target as to how big you want some of these divisions as a percentage of your total revenues? Do you want to get bigger in prescription pharmaceuticals?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. So I agree with your -- all your comments. I would say that, relative to our business, the Rx business is an important business to us. We absolutely agree. We take a very specific approach to the generic Rx business that we have and try to find specific niches where we can be unique or be one of 2 players or 3 players, not one of 20 players. That's what got us into this area of what we refer to as extended topicals. So drugs that are absorbed topically, including dermatology, respiratory, nasal, ophthalmic, those are all the same categories we are still interested in. So if there are specific opportunities for us to improve our position in these categories called extended topicals, we clearly will seek to do that, both here in the United States and around the world. So absolutely, those are things that we are interested in doing. On the question as a percentage of our business, I do think we can grow the Rx business both organically and inorganically. Yes, I agree. But I would say, the majority of our business we still expect to be the consumer-facing businesses of our Consumer Healthcare store brand OTC and store brand private label of our nutritional products, will still remain the majority of our business. But I do think there are some select opportunities to increase the size and the scale of our Rx business, sticking to this commentary of really trying to stay in areas that we are more niche rather than being a commodity generic Rx player.","Timothy Chiang - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","And maybe I have one follow-up for Judy. Judy, do you have a target in terms of where you want to be on a debt-to-EBITDA basis? I guess you guys are, what, 2.5x levered? A lot of your peers are well north of 3x levered, even 4x levered. Is that -- would that be an acceptable target to you?","Judy L. Brown","So my visceral, off-the-cuff response is no because we are an investment-grade company. We have investment-grade debt. We have stated a commitment to delever down. We are -- we believe, right now, with -- there are no GAAP EBITDA numbers, but we believe we are south of 3x levered right now and that we are on a path to delever down towards 2x levered. Remember that we have new public investment-grade debt. That was -- we did our first IPO in May and our second IPO as a PLC in November, when we were working on the path of closing Elan. And as such, we needed to prove that we have a track record of being able to have a balance sheet that deserves that investment-grade status. And we're committed to investment grade because there's no better and deeper pool of resource to be able to fund long-term growth initiatives than the investment-grade market. And so while there are those in our universe who don't have an issue being more heavily levered today because of the relative expensive levels of debt today, if there are shocks to the system, the change between investment grade and high yield become fairly dramatic. So in order to be able to have a real long view on long-term growth initiatives, we are committed to that investment grade and, as such, are going to be -- at least in the short term, while we prove our credit worthiness at an investment-grade level to the agencies, we'll be working on that delevering scenario.","Joseph C. Papa","Operator, I'm going to conclude the call at this time. I would certainly like to say thank you for everyone for joining us on today's call. Perrigo remains committed on growing our business and focusing on quality affordable healthcare. Thank you very much, everyone. Have a good day.","Judy L.

[Operator Instructions] Mr. Shannon, please go ahead.","Arthur Shannon","Thank you very much, Christa. Welcome to Perrigo\u2019s second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. I hope you all had a chance to review our press release which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the release is available on our website and also on our website is the slide presentation for this call.","Before we proceed with the call, I'd like to remind everyone that during the process of this call, management will make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for investors and shareholders and safe harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued this morning. Following management's review of the presentation, we will open up the call for questions.","I'd like to now turn the call over to Perrigo's Chairman and CEO, Joe Papa. Joe?","Joseph Papa","Thank you, Art, and welcome everyone to Perrigo's second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings conference call. Joining us today is Judy Brown, Perrigo's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Now, let's go through the agenda for today's call. First, I'll provide a brief overview on Omega and the quarter. Next, Judy will go through the details of the fiscal second quarter results and walk you through our guidance. Then I'll provide some additional details on our expectations for the rest of the fiscal year. Finally, we'll have the opportunity for questions.","First, regarding Omega. Omega is a great company. Mark and his team have built an absolutely great team of individuals leading his company. We look forward to bringing together two great companies with Perrigo and Omega. We continue to expect to close the Omega transaction in late March and are excited to expand our global presence.","As we continued our transformation to a more global company, we continue to focus on the five pillars I've outlined to you when I joined Perrigo 8.5 years ago. We are excited about the opportunities to leverage the strength of our new platform.","Now I would discuss our recent concluded fiscal second quarter. On slide 4, you can see that this was a strong quarter, but not without its challenges. Our quarterly performance is highlighted by all-time record net sales of $1.072 billion and an adjusted gross margin of over 45% and operating margin of 29.5%, record adjusted net income and record operating cash flow.","Moving on to slide 5, you can see consolidated Perrigo grew top line 9%, driven by record sales in the Rx business and the addition of the Specialty Side segment. New products contributed $54 million. Based on this top line growth, we continue to invest in our future, R&D investments were up 15% versus last year. Including these investments, we achieved record adjusted operating margins which improved by 520 basis points over last year and in fact sequentially, adjusted operating margins improved 340 basis points.","The strong sales results correlate with impressive improvements in adjusting operating income. Operating margin expansion has been a focus for the company for quite a long time and we were able to achieve this goal while we continue to invest in research and development.","Judy will give you details, but let me just give you a few highlights from the business segment. Consumer healthcare sales were below our expectations, but they achieved $530 million this quarter, highlighted by the growth of approximately 2% in the OTC category, which was in line with overall store brand market OTC growth. However, this growth was offset by lower than expected contract sales in the animal health category and expected lower year over year contract sales.","As we announced last month, our animal health segment launched the store brand and value brand versions of Frontline Plus in December. We believe we have contractual exclusivity rights to sell this product and we have filed a breach of contract litigation against the innovator. We'll keep you updated on the status of this legal action.","Finally, I\u2019m delighted to say we relaunched guaifenesin in the quarter. Our Nutritional Sales segment fell 7%. VMS and infant foods were the major contributor to this shortfall versus our expectations. VMS sales in particular impacted by the pricing pressure from a Chinese competitor that continues to ship product to the US.","Our Rx once again achieved record results, growing sales 12% with an adjusted operating margin of 46%. New product sales in the quarter were driven by the launch of the authorized generic of Protopic ointment and the launch of the generic version of our AB rated Androgel 1% gel. Operating margins were slightly below last year, based on the launch of an AG product and higher investments in the research and development.","Finally in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of products for Lumara, which expands our specialty pharma offering by entering the women's health category. The acquisition also provides infrastructure to sell our product offering into this new channel with access to over 50 sales professionals. Congratulations to the Rx team for a strong quarter.","Especially scientists, we\u2019ve been very pleased with the market performance of Tysabri. It's a great asset that is generating terrific cash flow, particularly with the current 18% royalty rate it provides. As you can see on slide 6, over the last 52 weeks, store brands continued to gain share in smoking cessation, diabetes care, and infant formula.","Turning to slide 7, you\u2019ll see store brand has strengthened in the past 13 weeks. For the first time since the national brands returned to the market, we can see store brand growth in the cough\/cold category and Analgesics category. When you compare national brand versus store brand like-for-like products and take out the effect of new products in national brands returned to the market, store brand market share continues to grow.","Given the megatrends I have talked to you about many years with an ageing population, increased use of medication as individuals get older and the rising healthcare cost, Perrigo is well positioned to meet the needs for the global healthcare community.","Now, let me turn the call over to Judy.","Judy Brown","Thank you, Joe. Good morning everyone. As Joe previewed, we closed the books on a very busy and eventful second fiscal quarter, both operationally and financially, as we raised funding and prepared for the closing of the Omega acquisition. Accordingly, there are a lot of moving parts in these financials.","In order to try to provide you with the cleanest and most thoughtful analysis of the operating results and underlining business performance in the quarter, our adjusted financial results discussed here and reconciled in the appendix do not include the operational benefits of Omega, as the acquisition has not yet closed, do not include transaction- related charges, and do not include the financing costs or additional equity from our November, December 2014 debt and equity raises.","While our consolidated top line results for the quarter were below our own expectations, the strength of our durable business portfolio, combined with manufacturing efficiencies and cost discipline, allowed us to deliver 32% growth in adjusted net income, in line with the guidance provided to you on November 6.","Consolidated adjusted gross margins were 45.2%, a 450 basis points expansion compared to the same quarter last year. Obviously, this year\u2019s number includes the positive impacts of a full quarter\u2019s contribution from Tysabri royalties. Importantly though, I\u2019d like to note that we are used to exclude the $87 million gross profit contribution from Tysabri. Adjusted consolidated gross margins were still at a fiscal second quarter record of 40.4%. The continued improvement in our profitability affirms the soundness of our consolidated business model.","So now, I\u2019d like to turn to our business segments, starting with the review of our results in consumer healthcare on slide 8. As Joe mentioned, in the quarter, our OTC store brand categories grew in line with the store brand market, up 2%, led by our nicotine replacement franchise, benefiting from the continued absence of a national brand competitor and our relaunch of store brand 600 milligram Mucinex ER.","In addition, we recognized $13 million in new products and sales attributable and sales attributable to OTC products from our Aspen acquisition. These positive forces however were more than offset by a decline of $13 million, primarily in contract OTC, contract animal health, as well as a small negative foreign exchange impact.","So let me take a moment to explain a few of the drivers for the decline. First, net sales were impacted by the expected lapping of the year-over-year benefit related to a large customer in our contract manufacturing category, which annualized in the quarter. Second, as presented at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference last month, while we are excited about the December 2014 launch of the store and value brand versions of Frontline Plus within our Animal Health category, we have filed a breach of contract litigation against a third party, as we believe the third party has wrongly enabled a competitor into the market, thereby negating our contractual exclusivity.","While this unfortunate situation had only a slight impact on our expected revenue this quarter, it does impact our forecast update for the full year. And I'll comment on that further in a few minutes in context of the guidance update. However, with respect to analyzing the year-over-year results, I\u2019d like to clarify that we also had a supply agreement with this third party last year that has not been renewed and therefore resulted in the majority of the $7 million decline in animal health contract sales in the quarter.","Adjusted gross margin expanded, due primarily to greater sales of a mix of higher margin products versus this time last year. At the same time we continued our spending discipline and SG&A and as a result, adjusted operating margin increased year over year.","On slide 9, you can see that net sales within the nutritional segment were $131 million as new product sales of $12 million primarily in contract organic infant formula, were more than offset by a decline of $12 million in the VMS and infant food categories, as well as the discontinuance of $8 million of various SKUs.","Net sales within the VMS category were down 11% year-over-year, due primarily to continued pricing pressures and competitive market dynamics as national brands continued heavy promotional activity at retail. Second quarter adjusted gross margin contracted, due primarily to pricing pressure in VMS and a $3 million charge related to a specific isolated inventory loss, which the company expects to recover in the future through an insurance claim.","Turning to slide 10, you can see that our Rx team continues to outperform expectations, delivering 12% net sales growth, to a record $277 million in the second fiscal quarter. As Joe stated earlier, the team generated $33 million in new products sales, driven by the launches of generic versions of Androgel 1% and Protopic. Volume increases were partially offset by $14 million of discontinued products.","Adjusted gross profit margins of 60.5% were slightly below the prior year, due to product mix. However, improved 220 basis points sequentially, due primarily to pricing actions taken in the first quarter. Adjusted operating margin was impacted by the fact that we elected to increase our R&D investments in the segment, driving to a level of 7.1% of Rx net sales, reflecting the team\u2019s optimism in our pipeline projects for the future.","In addition, we continued our investments to grow our nascent specialty pharma sales force to both support the women's healthcare products we acquired from Lumara, as well as our broader spec pharma strategies for the future. Next on slide 11, you will see that API's second fiscal quarter net sales were $30 million, effectively unchanged year over year.","Turning to slide 12, specialty sciences revenue were $87 million, comprised of Tysabri royalties at 18% for an entire quarter, versus 12% a year ago for the 13 days between December 18, 2013 closing of the Elan transaction and the fiscal quarter end.","Before I turn to the forecast, a quick comment on the balance sheet. As of December 27, 2014, total cash on the face of the balance sheet was $3.6 billion and current and long-term debt was $4.8 billion, reflecting the additional equity and debt financing, respectively, raised in November and December for the Omega acquisition. Net cash flow from operations for the second quarter was a record $273 million, up $151 million from the second fiscal quarter of 2014.","So moving into our updated fiscal 2015 guidance, I'd like to start with noting that we are tightening our November 6 consolidated adjusted earnings per share guidance around the same midpoint. The composition of this tighter range does change, however, given a variety of moving parts, which I\u2019ll walk you through in just a moment.","Before I go any further though, let me remind you once again that these guidance figures do not include any operational results, debt\/equity financing or related transactional costs associated with our planned acquisition of Omega. We are currently anticipating closing that transaction toward the end of March.","Following the close of the Omega deal, we plan to provide you with new updated guidance for the combined companies on a calendar 2015 basis. We anticipate sharing this new information with you in conjunction with our March quarter close earnings release in early May and we\u2019ll have available at that time appropriate comparative historical data using these new conventions to assist you in refreshing you model.","Before outlining specific segment guidance, I\u2019d like to first highlight the impact of foreign currency on our forecast. As I\u2019ve noted in the past, our current mix of business around the globe have been generally neutral for the bottom line. That is, we are currently fairly well naturally hedged through net income. As you\u2019re modeling this updated forecast, I want you to note that our full year updated consolidated revenue guidance has been negatively impacted by approximately $45 million, given the extreme movement in the euro since December.","However, the majority of this is offset by positive impacts within adjusted cost of goods sold and adjusted operating expenses, essentially washing out of the bottom line. Hence, ForEx is most visible at the top line and explains a portion of the segment and consolidated revenue adjustments. Please do note that once we close the Omega acquisition, however, this conversation of foreign exchange impact will certainly be an important part of the ongoing dialog.","Now, moving into the updated segment guidance for fiscal 2015 on slide 13 in further detail, starting with consumer healthcare, this range change in consumer healthcare revenue guidance can basically be broken down as: approximately one- third due to the situation in our animal health category, approximately one-third due to updated weightings of expected new product sales in this fiscal year, and the remaining one-third due to the combined impact of currency and OTC contract sales in this segment.","First, we expect meaningfully lower sales within the animal health category, due to the previously discussed filed litigation related to our store brand, value brand, and Frontline Plus launch. While we continue to exert exclusive rights to market this product and the competitor\u2019s product is not yet on the retail shelf, customer discussion with order volumes and pricing is causing disruptions in the marketplace, thus affecting our anticipated new product for the remainder of the year.","Second, in addition to this product, we've recently updated our risk weightings within the remaining CHC new product launch portfolio to reflect new best information on expected regulatory approval timings, as well as timing of product availability from some of our third-party launch partners.","And third, our revenue guidance adjustment includes a headwind due to foreign exchange fluctuations since November 6 and reduced OTC contract revenues due to changes in timelines and updated forecast information communicated from our customers.","Please note that we have included in this updated guidance based on our observations at retail through January, an expectation of relatively stronger demand in the cough, cold, allergy category due to higher incidence of cough, cold and flu versus last year as well as the expected launch of store brand version of Nasacort.","Within the nutritional segment, we continue to model headwinds in our VMS business due to inexpensive imported products from China, multiple negative news headlines questioning the benefits of using multi vitamins, and competitive market dynamics. Additionally, we\u2019re also adjusting our new product assumptions on our adult nutrition drink and certain infant foods.","Given the continued positive momentum in the Rx based business, coupled with strong recent product launches, we are raising our expectations for the Rx segment in this fiscal year. In fact, we have updated our new product launch risk probability weightings in Rx such that they significantly for the downward adjustments made to the CHC new product list I just mentioned, thereby allowing us to maintain our overall consolidated new product target amount of greater than $235 million for the full year. As a reminder, we have consistently guided that these new product launches would be more than 70% in the second half of this fiscal year.","Summing all this information up at the consolidated level, you can see we are fine tuning the overall Perrigo revenue guidance range for fiscal 2015, which at the midpoint indicates consolidated revenues of $4.35 billion, growth of 7% year over year and a record for Perrigo.","As a result of the updated expected favorable new product mix across the segments in the second half of the fiscal year, targeted cost efficiencies and a refinement to the adjusted effective tax rate to 15%, our adjusted net income guidance range is being tightened around the same midpoint.","As I noted earlier, we are now expecting the adjusted diluted EPS range to be between $7.25 and $7.45. Joe will provide some color on activities planned for the second half of the year in a few moments.","Also, for the first two quarters of this fiscal year, I provided you with guidance on how to model the adjusted net income for the upcoming quarter. For the third fiscal quarter, we anticipate adjusted net income growth to be in the middle of the updated 32% to 36% annual growth you see on page 13.","In summation, despite some headwinds and softer results on the top line than we had anticipated, the diversified Perrigo portfolio once again delivered expanding margins and strong operating cash flows, as well as quarterly net income growth in line with the guidance provided on November 6. We are excited about the further diversification of this platform as we welcome the Omega team to Perrigo and move into our eagerly anticipated next phase of global growth in the next month.","And in the meantime, the team continues to see new avenues to leverage our current and newly acquired European competencies to generate a healthy pipeline of future inorganic opportunities as well.","Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Joe.","Joseph Papa","Thank you, Judy. Now, I\u2019d like to provide some additional thoughts on our business going forward. Turning to slide 14, the Omega acquisition gives Perrigo the commercial infrastructure to take our products to the rest of Europe, which has been our goal for the company for quite some time. Omega\u2019s regulatory and brand management expertise coupled with our supply chain efficiencies make for a great combination for the future. I can certainly say today I'm even more excited than I was in November 6 when we announced this transaction.","We\u2019ve been working with the Omega team on the post close integration and we've had meetings with country managers, finance team and our supply chain teams. We look forward to welcoming their 2,500 employees to the Perrigo family. Also, I\u2019d like to congratulate the Perrigo finance and legal team for completing the debt and equity raise in anticipation of the transaction closing in such a timely manner and its well done by the teams.","In summary, on slide 15, the drivers for 2015 and beyond are very straightforward. First, close the Omega deal. Second, launch our pipeline of new products. Significant new product launches announced in the second quarter give us the confidence in achieving our new product sales goals. Even if we receive no additional FDA approvals, we expect to achieve new product sales of over $235 million in the fiscal year.","I\u2019m also so pleased to announce that we now have FDA approval for store brand Nasacort OTC and importantly have reached an agreement with our partner Teva to market a store brand version of Nasacort OTC, which has branded sales of greater than $150 million in annual national brand sales, we expect to launch for the upcoming allergy season.","Also, within the past week, our ANDA for scopolamine transdermal patch was approved by the FDA. This is the generic equivalent to Transderm Scope, which has brand sales of approximately $120 million. Third, leverage the positive momentum of Tysabri. Annual sales in the calendar year 2014 were above $1.9 billion mark and are closing in on $2 billion. Just as a reminder, Perrigo receives a 25% royalty on all incremental sales above $2 billion for Tysabri.","Also, Biogen has stated there should be a read out this calendar year on the SPMS indication. Finally, we will continue our disciplined acquisition strategy. We have publicly stated that we will continue to execute acquisitions while we delever over the next 12 to 18 months. The team is focused on delivering strong results for the second half of the year. Our second half performance requires focused execution, and I'm confident the team will deliver.","Operator, let\u2019s now open the call for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital.","Randall Stanicky","Thanks guys for the questions. I just have one and then a follow-up. Joe, maybe just to start off with, has the traditional growth rate for consumer, that 5% to 10% level that we've talked about historically, have you seen any change in that? Should we be thinking on a multi-year basis closer to 5%? And maybe just comment on how you're thinking about that business overall from a big picture perspective?","Joseph Papa","Good question. I would say that right now what we see is all the same things we talked about in the past, the megatrends are still there for our OTC business. We\u2019re still seeing national brand products being converted to store brand products, we are seeing this consumer move to store brand. We\u2019re still seeing a lot of Rx to OTC products to be clear and we\u2019re still seeing how important new products are to Perrigo. But it is that last part that has slowed down this year specifically and there has been some of the issues we\u2019ve seen with the growth rate.","We are very excited that \u2013 I'm excited to tell you that today, on a like-for-like basis, store brands are still gaining share over the national brand, that\u2019s when you take out the effect of a national brand competitor coming back to the market and a lot of the new products. On shelf, when the consumers are looking at national brand versus store brand, more frequently they are picking store brand.","Having said that, though, new products are so critical to us and with the issue that we ran into in the animal health category in terms of not having the exclusivity because what we believe is a breach of contract, that hurt us. It hurt us relative to our expectation. But, we have not at this time changed our 5% to 10% compound annual growth rate for what we\u2019re looking at for consumer, but it is something we\u2019re going to continue to look at as we look to the future. But the major driving factor have still been national brands converting into store brands and Rx to OTC, both of which have been very \u2013 just even yesterday, we just saw Flonase going over the counter and launched by Glaxo, another great opportunity for us.","Judy Brown","And to be fair, just to add a little color to your specific question on long-term CAGRs, we do provide compound annual growth rates over a rolling three-year period. So just always keep in mind that we have never given specific annual targets on a forward three or five-year basis, it\u2019s always been a rolling three-year compound annual growth, couple that with the fact that, as I stated, when we come together with Omega and we anticipate giving consolidated combine new calendar year guidance. It would be refreshing our commentary around that as well.","Randall Stanicky","Got it. And Judy, my follow-up is for you, actually, on the animal health business. If we do the math that you laid out, it looks like there was roughly a $37 million impact relative to guidance, if we go midpoint to midpoint. So I guess the question is, is that the right way to think about it? As you think about the reduction in full year growth for consumer, how does cough\/cold strength factor into that, either as an offset or an opportunity to offset some of those headwinds?","Judy Brown","Sure. So if you look at the total change in the growth expected, so I\u2019ll call it, old midpoint to new midpoint and the movement there. Like we said, like I made in my formal comments, there are a couple moving parts. I think your estimation on animal health is an appropriate one. There's a couple other pieces in there as well. I mentioned a movement in contract sales within animal health also, so you pick up probably a third of the movement in that midpoint to midpoint coming from animal health. Big picture then, we have the adjustment in new products being another third, and then like I said, OTC contracts and ForEx being the remaining third.","If you think about the dynamics there, also, first half to second half, about a half of that total adjustment from midpoint to midpoint has happened, so it\u2019s the movement that has happened already through December, about two thirds of which happen in the second quarter, so just looking at where we thought we will be at this point in the year versus where we now expect to be full year, about half of that is under our belt. So you've got that done with, and the remaining adjustments come through from the reasons I just outlined, animal health, OTC contract, new product adjustments.","Randall Stanicky","With cough and cold benefiting the March quarter?","Judy Brown","Cough and cold would be reflected in the March quarter and our current estimation is based on what we\u2019ve seen at retail through January are reflected in the numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Guggenheim Securities.","Louise Chen","I have three. First question I had was back onto the animal health, the Frontline. Just curious in terms of possible outcome this year in terms of the breach of contract, if you were to prevail on your discussion here, what could be the upside? And then secondly, on Omega, just curious how to think about the FX impact since you announced the deal? And then lastly, a question that we get quite a bit, just curious, what are some of the factors that make it challenging to forecast your quarterly EPS and how should we think about these? Thank you.","Joseph Papa","I\u2019ll start with the first one and then Judy can talk about maybe the FX with Omega and then we\u2019ll go to the quarter EPS. First on animal health, I think Judy said it quite well, we believe that there has been a breach of contract, we think it\u2019s very clear to us that we had an exclusive position to launch the store brand, value brand version of the fripronil plus product, not Frontline Plus store brand. Having said that, it appears that the innovator has given a right to another company to enter into this market place, which we believe is inconsistent with our contract and we will continue to pursue all of our legal options to defend our position here.","The issue on this question always becomes a timing question, we think to not allow that competitor to enter the market, however whether or not we will prevail on that is still uncertain at this time. So really the resolution really can be something that is near term or could be \u2013 take longer term. Because of the concerns we felt it was best not to model an exclusive position into our current fiscal year that we're talking about right now for the next five months. So that\u2019s what we face.","Is there an upside, were we to prevail and rapidly prevail with that? The answer is absolutely yes. I don't think I'm going to put a specific number on that at this time, because it really would depend on the timing of when and how it happens relative to the season and I really don\u2019t want to make any comments on an ongoing litigation.","Judy, second question was on the FX.","Judy Brown","Just one last comment to Joe's point with respect to the Frontline Plus, that is obviously a seasonal product, seasonal selling would really normally be kicking in in the March quarter anyway. So we have made adjustments to reflect where we believe will be at this moment knowing that the, I\u2019ll call it, March through June selling cycle is classically when those products would really be moving from us out to retailers and through retailers to us.","On the Omega question, I\u2019ve already made some comments on foreign exchange, foreign exchange even impacting Perrigo which is classically a very US focused sales business. But on the Omega transaction, we have seen an impact, our original announcement, our discussions of the transaction were on November 6 and we have had our models run at that point at an exchange rate of $1.25 to the euro, obviously that has moved. We're looking at numbers that have even floated south of $1.15 in recent weeks.","I\u2019m not commenting at this stage on specific exchanges to the modeling, I think you\u2019ve all built detailed models of assumptions in terms of revenues, costs, and then we had made a comment on accretion for the fiscal year 2015 ,that is the period ending June of 2015 to get ahead of our \u2013 get too far out over our skis right now and give you updated numbers when the exchange rate is moving multiple percentage points in a day sometimes we think would be going too far because we still don't have a lock down closing date.","So we will make some comment at closing and we will certainly provide updated color on our May call with the exchange rate at that time and also knowing that, again, we\u2019re going to give you information for the nine months ended December for Omega. So a lot of moving parts, we decided to change our fiscal year, we announced that in December. At the time we announced the deal we gave you guidance for the old fiscal year model, but we are going to update all of that with new fiscal year, new exchange rates and nine month period, suffice it to say it is a downward pressure, there is no question there. I don\u2019t want to give specific numbers because the exchange rate could easily flip tomorrow.","Joseph Papa","On the last part of your question, quarterly EPS and some of the challenges in forecasting that quarterly EPS, I think it really comes down to a couple of key factors. The first one is new products, the second one is seasonality. Let me deal with the new products first. The good news is that we forecasted over $235 million of new products to Perrigo in this current fiscal year 2015.","As I sit here today, we still believe we will do over $235 million and as I said on the call, even if I don\u2019t get any new products approved for the remainder of this year, from February 1 on, we already believe we have a run rate that will exceed that $235 million just from the products that are currently improved that we plan to launch. So we feel very good about that. Having said that, though, we did get in that new products approvals more in the Rx category, less in the consumer.","So on balance, our probability weighting was absolutely spot on, but clearly there were some differences in how that occurred within our respective business segments. But for totality of it, new products were still right on the numbers that we projected over $235 million.","The second issue that for us is important, and we try to minimize the seasonality, but it is, as we get more diverse in our business, as Judy was mentioning, but having said that, seasonality still impacts our quarter. If you think about the quarter through December 15 that we're reporting on, it was a very weak cough, cold, flu season, exactly like last year, very weak, not consistent with being an average season or a strong season, it was weak December 15. The season did spike, it became a stronger season or not about mid-December, and we have seen that strong season through February 1, which has been about 10% more than last year.","So we have seen that occur. As to whether or not it will continue, that gets to just \u2013 I\u2019m wanting to make sure that we don\u2019t get too far ahead of ourselves, so we would like to make sure that we built in the strength that we've seen from December 15 through let\u2019s call it February 1. But as to what will happen tomorrow with the season, we really don\u2019t want to make any specific comments. But the seasonality is probably the other big swing factor for us. So new products, probability weighting on that, which certainly is important, and how it individually affects our business segments, and then the seasonality of the two major ingredients for what affects our quarterly EPS.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert","Thanks. Well, I'm glad Siggi at Teva punted that Nasacort question over to you guys. But I had two questions. First is on Omega. How's that business been performing? I'm not asking about FX here. I'm asking how it's been performing since the announcement and how focused are you all on looking longer term biz dev opportunities to leverage that footprint?","And my second question, Joe, is a pricing question in the store brand environment. Obviously, the generic side of your business and many other companies has benefited from an enhanced pricing environment, if we could call it that, in the last several years. And I realize the store brand business is quite different, but you are overwhelmingly the dominant player. Why can't we see more pricing stability or growth over the next few years, given your strength in that area and given that the regulation and other aspects are there for store brands like they are for Rx? Thanks.","Joseph Papa","First of all, we're delighted to say, on the Nasacort comment, that we've reached an agreement with our partner Teva, and that that product will be coming to the market for the upcoming allergy season, so that\u2019s a good news and look forward to working with our partner Teva on the Nasacort OTC store brand launch.","Relative to Omega, Gregg, we believe it\u2019s performing very well. We've looked at the numbers for how marketing team have done even in the \u2013 by country, they shared some information there. And we are delighted to see how they've performed. More importantly, beginning integration activities with the teams from the finance point of view, from the supply chain point of view, with meetings with the country managers and our country manager meeting with their country manager, where, for example, there's an overlap in Australia have gone quite well. And we are very excited by what it means to us for the future, really to leverage the platform.","And as I said in the previous call, with think there is synergy there by taking some of the Omega products and bringing those Omega products into the US, as well as taking some Perrigo products and bringing them into Omega to do some line extensions for their products, and then we think there is tens of millions of dollars of cost of goods sold synergy. So all that is going quite well and we do think that there is additional business development activity to leverage that platform, now that we have the platform in Europe and we will be looking to find additional products that we can basically bolt on to the Omega infrastructure.","The final question you had was on store brand pricing, the first comment I offered is that across the total Perrigo portfolio, our goal is always to keep pricing flat to up slightly, we believe we can continue to do that and it\u2019s been our goal I think for the past seven out of the last eight years that I\u2019ve been with the Perrigo. We\u2019ve always had that goal, keep pricing flat to up slightly. I\u2019m pleased to say that we continue to believe that is attainable for us.","Having said that, within any business segment there can be some ups and depending on the competitive pressures we face and what we try to do is really manage the portfolio for us in terms of take store brand pricing up in year one, but then realize that we are going to have some down comparisons on pricing Rx category. The next year we\u2019re going to look at Rx and raise those prices, realizing that there\u2019s going to be some challenges in nutritional or in the category of store brand. So we are really trying to manage the portfolio there, we do have some challenges, I will be clear on store brand pricing as we sit here today, but we think we can offset those with some of the things we are being in the Rx category and I think that\u2019s really the way we are continuing to manage the portfolio there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","Emil Chen","This is actually Emil Chen filling in for David Risinger today. Just two quick questions. So besides Frontline Plus, what are some of the other key swing factors that could really help drive the consumer business in calendar 2015? And then also on Omega, to follow-up on the previous question, so the organic growth profile of about 7%. How much higher can we really drive that by promoting Perrigo's products in Europe via Omega and their infrastructure there? Thank you.","Joseph Papa","So going back to your question, it really comes down to us always about new products, clearly Frontline Plus is a big one for us, but it is the other new products that we anticipate launching during the fiscal year and actually for the calendar year 2015 that really are the drivers for us. So in addition to that, clearly, is the Nasacort product that we plan to launch, we also have guaifenesin returning that we returned to the marketplace in the October timeframe, so we get that during the second half of the year. I remind you we were not there last year because of the supply issue we had with guaifenesin. So it is those products that will be the major drivers for us for the new product, the new products really is what drives our business.","Your second question was about Omega, the Omega question really comes down to the daily what can we do to leverage it. And what we have said on this particular one is we believe there are specific products that Perrigo already has approved somewhere in the world that we can bring to the Omega organization and utilize those as additional line extensions to launching of their product into the market place. And we have already have been working with the Omega team to do some of those things already, even before the announcement of the deal. Those are the things that we\u2019ve already have some familiarity with. We believe that is going to offer hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue synergies on that site.","Albeit those are going to be think in years two, three or four, not next year to be clear. In addition we believe some of the Omega products that they have available today can be opportunities for us to bring back into the US, Mexico and other places where Perrigo is in and Omega does not. So those are some of the other opportunities for revenue synergies. The final one is that cost of goods sold synergy I mentioned, but we think many of the American products are currently outsourced, some of those products we can bring into the Perrigo and Omega infrastructure and potentially they will go to our cost of goods sold. Those are really the three primary areas for us for Omega synergies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Steinberg with Jefferies.","David Steinberg","Thanks very much. A couple questions. First, Joe, you mentioned guaifenesin coming back to the market. It's clearly one of your most profitable products, any color on how that relaunch is going? Are you pleased with it so far? And then secondly, on the subject of new products, just to go over some of the therapeutic areas, Allergies have largely gone over-the-counter and have done well in store brands, proton pump inhibitors, the same, and you have obviously Nexium coming up, and now nasal corticosteroids. But big picture, looking down the road, what are some of the other therapeutic segments that you are optimistic about that you think could go over-the-counter at some point? I know in the past you've mentioned statins. Any color on some of these therapeutic classes? Thanks.","Joseph Papa","Sure. First of all, [indiscernible] we reintroduced in late October 2014, so we are back in that for several months. We are on our way to get to about 30% store brands here on that kind of direction, we are not there quite yet, but we are on our way there. I\u2019d say though that we always believe that once we are into the marketplace with a product, we usually get to somewhere in that 40% to 45% store brand share within the first 12 to 18 months. And I absolutely believe, because there\u2019s a lot of products, that is an extensive OTC products will get back to that same category.","On the question of the additional Rx OTC products switches and what else is happening, you\u2019re absolutely right. As I mentioned, we are delighted with the nasal allergy products that we have now got Nasacort, OTC store brand, that\u2019s an important opportunity for us. We look forward to launching that. As I mentioned, Flonase just launched their product, just really this week, and we do expect an additional nasal sprays to be launched, we think there is opportunity for products like [indiscernible] and many of the other nasal allergy sprays to launch into the marketplace that we are going to obviously closely following.","On the proton pump inhibitors, a large product of Nexium has gone over the counter, we look forward to launching our product when the exclusivity for that product expires. Beyond that particular category, we still aren\u2019t looking at the other products for overactive bladder [indiscernible] we will potentially \u2013 that\u2019s not a shelf for the large product, but the other overactive bladder products represent $3.3 billion of sales, products like Detrol, Detrol LA, Ditripan, Ditripan XL has opportunities for products to OTC. Should those go, Perrigo of course is going to be a fast follower in those categories.","Additionally, you mentioned statins, that one we are going to get a read out probably in the next, I\u2019m guessing, six months from the work that Pfizer has done with Lipitor. Probably, at this point I want to say \u2013 just confirm to say, it\u2019s probably at 60% probability it will go OTC, 40% it will not. We haven\u2019t changed the opinion on that one at this time.","The other area I think is important to follow is BPH product, also the NLG big products that are topical, NLG, other categories that we expect for the future. Potentially some ophthalmic products as well form the basis of where we think other OTC switches could happen, the ophthalmic [indiscernible].","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Scott with JPMorgan.","Dana Flanders","Thanks. This is actually Dana Flanders on for Chris. Just two questions on the Rx business. First, can you just talk about the Androgel 1% launch, how that's progressing and what you are expecting for the rest of the year regarding AB-related competition? And then secondly, on the Rx business again, just pricing, I know you think of your overall portfolio as flat to slightly up, but it seems like there's a nice opportunity for continued pricing in the extended topical generic space. Can you just elaborate on how you are thinking about that and the sustainability there? Thanks.","Joseph Papa","Sure. So first of all, on Androgel 1% AB-rated products from Perrigo Testosterone has been launched. That product, we believe, is the only \u2013 AB-rated product approved at this time. I can\u2019t speak exactly when the next product will show up, but at this time, we\u2019re out there with the only product. So we think that\u2019s obviously a very favorable environment because it\u2019s a very difficult product to show AB-rating for, to show your bioequivalent, we were able to do that through the way we designed our clinical trial, we don\u2019t think that that\u2019s an important advantage for us and will be a very good product for us this year. I will remind you the Androgel 1% product by itself is about $300 million product and for us that\u2019s a AB-rated product is an important opportunity for us.","On the question of pricing, you\u2019re absolutely correct on how we view it, we view the pricing as across the portfolio, trying to keep it flat to up slightly. And every year we go and look at what, sometimes we have opportunities in the store brand side, sometimes we have opportunities in the Rx side, I will say the Rx side does have, as I sit here today, the greatest upside. I absolutely concur with the comments there. I just though, always wanted to try to manage it as one we manage our portfolio in trying to keep a look across the entire portfolio, some year this is going to be nutrition, some year this is going to be consumer, but certainly over the near-term topical, extend topical products didn\u2019t have the greatest upside for pricing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman","Yes, you had mentioned the Nexium launch by Pfizer, I was curious your thoughts on how Pfizer's doing out there with that product OTC and if this is going to be as big as you think it's going to be when you get to launch three years later. And then the other question is, you have some products, I know, that are prescription brand with sales people actually selling it. And I was curious how that business is going and how you think about expanding that business? Do you look to use M&A to get more into the prescription business at all? Thanks.","Joseph Papa","Sure. First on Nexium, we think Pfizer has done a very good job, they have the product at $300 million run rate, which for a third launch of a proton pump inhibitor is well, has done well. I\u2019m sure they are going to continue to take some ambitional exclusively period, I\u2019m sure there are going to continue to try to improve the performance with the Nexium product, but basically they are about one year in and its running at somewhere around $300 million opportunity. That\u2019s a national brand opportunity. I think it\u2019s done reasonably well, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to continue to promote and spend behind it. I will remind you though it is the third proton pump inhibitor, behind the first one being the Omeprazole, the second one being the Prevacid product. So coming third it\u2019s done reasonably well.","On the question of Rx brand, it is an opportunity for us, the way we entered this product, we were making two of these brands for, the KV Company. When they ran into some manufacturing difficulty, they turned to us and we\u2019re making these brands, we felt it was a way to leverage products that we were making, we already had approvals for to take them and bring them into the Perrigo portfolio as an opportunity to take our technologies, our capabilities and leverage those for going into some branded opportunities. Our process really is building our sales force in the women\u2019s health category to go forward to be successful with these products. These products were significant products in the range of $50 million to $75 million products prior to the problems that KV had with their manufacturing, we feel very comfortable in our ability to manufacture. So it is just really going back to promote the product. But there were a natural opportunity for us to extend them, because we were already making the product.","Having said that, though, what I would be very clear to say is that Perrigo was not looking to try to enter into mass market products, we are looking more at specialty items, in this case women\u2019s health as a specialty place where we can promote, where we don\u2019t need large sales force, we could do with a reasonable size sales force to go after some opportunities, especially when they already correlate with some of the things we do well, like manufacturing of topical products. So we are proud about that and look to do more of it for the future and especially now that you\u2019ve got some infrastructure here in the women\u2019s health category.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Annabel Samimy with Stifel.","Annabel Samimy","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have several, actually. When you mention the consumer health area, that one-third of the guidance change is related to the new product sales, can you just give us a little bit more color on that, because it seems that Nasacort went well, the Mucinex product is out. So just what are some of the bigger products that didn't come in?","And also on that note is, does Flonase have exclusivity for three years? And then on the flip side, the generics business, where you have new product launches, to what extent was that the women's health contribution? And then related to M&A, it seems like you're making more of a statement related to M&A. Are you going to be using more M&A to balance the organic growth more to, it used to be about 50\/50. Are you looking now to M&A to drive growth a little bit more now? Thanks.","Joseph Papa","Annabel, I will try to hit all of those. But there's a lot there that...","Annabel Samimy","They are all related.","Joseph Papa","One big related question, happy to try to do that. So on the questions of new products, absolutely we are excited about Mucinex being back into the product category. We are excited about the opportunity to launch the Nasacort product, but there were some delays. We\u2019ve talked about some of the delays partnered products that we had at Perrigo, we still believe that there are some opportunities, but we are not forecasting getting for example an omeprazole, flavored omeprazole product into the category this year.","We are delaying our view on \u2013 reducing our view on some of these products that Judy talked about the letter to animal health. That was another important category for us. We are not including anything on the Mucinex family of products in terms of the sustained release products as example. In terms of the partnered products that we have, we are pushing off as a result of some of the delays that we\u2019ve seen in the marketplace.","On the question, the second question, of Flonase, I\u2019m going to really talk about \u2013 it's unclear at this time for Flonase. Do I believe Flonase has a three-year exclusivity for the entire product? The answer is no. Do I believe they have a three-year exclusivity on specific allergic eyes, I do believe that they do have that, that exclusivity. As to how it\u2019s going to play out between that time, whether or not we want to go to the market with Flonase prior to the expiration of the allergic eye data which is, as I said, we do believe that will be true, they will have exclusivity there. That\u2019s unclear at this time.","So right now, we are not planning for our Flonase product to get to the market as I sit here 2015. We are working very closely with our partner, though, to enter the product category with that, but that\u2019s something that we\u2019re not sure at this time to exactly the regulatory pathway for the exclusivity position for the product. So therefore we\u2019re excluding it from our current fiscal year 2015. But I do think there are opportunities potentially for a carve out of the allergic eyes, but I just don\u2019t want to go too far and say when we think that we\u2019ll launch. I think we are still working with the regulatory side.","On the generic performance, women\u2019s health really was a very minimal amount of sales, less than $2 million. So very little as we got there with women\u2019s health category, the majority of the growth was truly in these new products that we mentioned, specifically the Androgel 1% generic product.","Final part of the question was the M&A, as you very appropriately pointed out, looked at growing organically and inorganically. Our history is we grew at about mid-teens growth rate. About half of the growth 7%, 8% was organic and the other half was 7%, 8% was in the area of inorganic M&A. I think we will continue to look to try to have a balanced growth with both M&A or inorganic as well as organic. Because of the iterative process we go through, some years you get more of a step function where you will have more growth from M&A, other years it will be more from organic.","Judy Brown","And to be fair, we are commenting a little bit more on business development, our focus there, because frankly with the success of our business model and our strong cash flow generation, we are looking at generating more than $1 billion of operating cash flow this fiscal year and project that to continue to grow into the future. So that is an important part of our long-term investment strategy and our growth strategy, we will continue to talk to you about organic growth rate, because of our stated belief that starting to get into quoting growth rates that include M&A has the risk of, in the long run, promoting bad discipline and we like to stay very focused in our M&A on good disciplined investments that can make sure to generate solid returns on invested capital.","We also are aware that we are going to stay to our stated goal of maintaining our investment grade, we will be delevering and spending this time now focusing on the best priorities to those cash flow that we\u2019re generating and look for the best priorities to make the next growth acquisition in the medium and long term. So that\u2019s the reason we\u2019re talking more about it, because it is a very important and responsible part of our business model.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sumant Kulkarni with Bank of America.","Sumant Kulkarni","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have three quick ones. The first one is on your outlook. What would need to happen for you to come in at the high end of the range that you have? And conversely, on the flip side, how safe is the low end? Second, when do you expect to participate in the other guaifenesin family? And do you have a partnership already there? And the third one is a bigger picture one. Are there any categories, and this is not on Rx to OTC switches, but large categories left in the US that may benefit from, for lack of a better term, Perrigo-ization, to the extent that they could cause an inflection on your consumer healthcare segment, which happens to have a relatively large base?","Judy Brown","Probably I can take the first one, Joe. And I'm very excited to know that a verb has been invented about our company, Perrigo-ization. So what do we need to do to get to the bottom of the top end ranges that we are providing, and I\u2019ll just provide this on an overall consolidated level just to give you the pushes and pulls. So obviously we talk a lot about flexing on new products. So what ends up happening, we do have fipronil plus, Frontline Plus products still in the forecast, depending on the outcome of that process, we\u2019ve talked quite a bit around already this hour, that can be a good add to get us to the top end or it can come down and bring us closer to the bottom end.","Execution of the second half promotional activity, there is quite a bit of promotional activity planned within our consumer facing businesses in the six months ending June and those goals need to be executed well in order to be in our forecast. So that\u2019s an important part of getting to the midpoint of our guidance. Market formation on new products, we need to start talking about, and Joe has already mentioned, Nasacort, getting dummies into the market, variety of products, if those go well, we will end up towards at the top. If they do not go well, that slides down the tail.","We have a competitor that has been out of the nicotine replacement market in the last month where they too returned unexpectedly and quicker than planned that would be a negative. So as those types of things, we\u2019ve seen unfavorable trends in our VMS category, if those continue that\u2019s a negative to our plan, because we have expectations that begins to stabilize in the second half of the fiscal year and we have upside potential as we have better contract sales within our infant formula business and\/or we have upside as we have really strong Androgel continued pull through. So those are the yins and the yans within the 5% to 9% range on the consolidated revenue guidance.","Joseph Papa","So on the question of guaif and the extended family of sustained-release products, yes, we do have a partner, we have not specifically named the partner, but many of you have a guess. It\u2019s a good company, very good company and we think they are a great partner, but they have had some difficulties in getting their product approved by the FDA. We expect that will be someday resolved, we continue to look forward to getting those products to the market. But at this time, as we said on the call, we do not want to build them into our model there, not built into our model for the current fiscal year, we\u2019ll continue to refresh that depending on what\u2019s happened with our partner. But we do expect at some point to get to the market these products, but they\u2019re not built into our numbers at this time.","On the second part of the question, the category that Perrigo will continue to go down, I think clearly you said, the first and most important one, all these products that are prescription today they are going OTC that we are going to file every single category, whether it\u2019d be nasal sprays or topical allergies, proton pump inhibitors, all those categories, overactive bladder et cetera. What other places we can go, though, that we do think do exist, we\u2019ve talked about in the past wound care, wound care has been other category that they are quite expensive products that are used.","And I'm not talking about bandages, tapes and things like that, but it is some categories of specific advanced wound care that we do think are opportunities to look at store brands opportunities. The other area is diabetes, we\u2019ve done a lot with building a very large portfolio of diabetic products, you see some of the changes that are happening in the category as more and more people are going to store brand for the category, we want to build the largest portfolio of diabetic products, because unfortunately diabetes is a growing disorder that we\u2019d like to make sure that we have the broadest portfolio available.","Final area for us that we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we\u2019ve done some things, but there is more to do, is the category of pet health. We think pet health is another category for us and then probably you just mentioned adult nutrition, we\u2019ve already started that, but that would be forthcoming in the near future as well. So I think those are probably the other categories, wound care, diabetes, pet health and then the adult nutrition categories as ones that we think there is a lot more to do there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Robin with Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is [Aria] in for Jami. You mentioned some risk with competitor coming back with smoking sensation products. But I'm just not clear, is that in your guidance or is that just downside risk if they do come back to the market?","Judy Brown","That is a downside risk to our model were they to come back. We have an expected phase back in of the competitor, that is downside risk.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then secondly I was just going to get some clarity on the vitamins business. So obviously it's going to be worse than you had originally expected for this year. But I guess just how should we think about it longer term? Should we assume continued pricing pressure, or will this start to be offset with the entrance into the gummy vitamins, and maybe the adult nutrition, so more for the future or the long-term thoughts on that business.","Joseph Papa","Sure, thank you for that part of the question. The VMS category is one that we continue to follow very closely. What we are seeing, as I mentioned in the call, is there is product coming in from China into the United States that at this time we do not believe is properly labeled, made in China, and it\u2019s being sold in the US. That\u2019s something that we do think we will get resolved, but I don\u2019t want to put a specific time on it because things like that take quite a long time. But that pressure on products coming in from China has been noticed in our pricing for our VMS category in the competitive side. So that is clearly an issue.","Our response to that though is to go into products that we think are less commodity like and more importantly added value with the sense that we go along into the category, as you mentioned gummies as a category, it\u2019s about $700 million category and that is growing rather quickly that we think is a great opportunity for us in which we did a partnership that we announced in early January with the largest gummy manufacturer in the world, which will take their gummy knowledge technology and put it together with our knowledge of vitamins and work together to bring out gummy vitamins and other gummy OTC products we think will be very exciting.","In addition, the adult nutrition products will be \u2013 we will be entering into those, we\u2019ve done a partnership there, we think that\u2019s an important part of continuing to try to improve our nutrition business. So you\u2019ve hit on two of the other very important things that we\u2019re doing for growing the business. Operator, next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry with Leerink Partners.","Jason Gerberry","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Joe, just on the \u2013 going back to the Pfizer Lipitor Rx to OTC switch, can you talk about, now with they're going to data in six months from their user study, just a road map in terms of how this will play out. And I imagine there will be some advisory panels. But ultimately trying to get a sense of what would get you to bump up your odds of success from 60% to a higher threshold. And then my second question, just on SPMS opportunity for Tysabri, just curious your thoughts in terms of how much of the market's already off label and how big of an upside opportunity you think that could be? Thanks.","Joseph Papa","Sure. Let me comment about that in general and then I will talk about Lipitor. As I said, my comment on \u2013 there has been a general comment that about 60% probability for them ultimately going OTC and it\u2019s predominantly because of how the FDA and the medical world has changed their views of, you don\u2019t necessarily treat only to a level of cholesterol, you now start to treat risk factors, those risk factors are something that people can say I know a man, I know were over the age of 55, I know family history of heart disease, or things like that, once you know those risk factors, you should be on a statin, almost irrespective of what the actual cholesterol number is. So it\u2019s that move to risk factors that I think is the important question.","I can\u2019t say specifically anything about Lipitor, I think obviously we had to wait to hear what Pfizer has to say with that, I\u2019d just simply suggest that we expect that we\u2019ll hear more about their outcome of their clinical trial that we know they were \u2013 at least a clinical trial started on time, we expect to hear something probably within the next six months. As to whether or not they make the decision to go over the counter or to take the products to the FDA and bring it over the counter, I think we just had to wait to hear what Pfizer specifically says about Lipitor. My comment was more of a generic comment about what happens.","The next part of the question you asked was SPMS, I think we are going to wait and see what Biogen says about that. All we\u2019ve heard is that that would be a specific readout on their clinical trials sometime in the latter half of 2015, that\u2019s calendar 2015, so we await that.","In terms of the value of an SPMS indication, I\u2019ve heard that there is some off-label usage. We've talked to some neurologists about that, we\u2019ve heard some commentary on those lines, but importantly if this drug can show that it is effective in the area of SPMS, we do think there is a significant upside to it. There\u2019s a whole range of options. I probably can't say whether it\u2019s 10% upside or a 50% upside, there\u2019s an entire range of thoughts on that. But importantly, if this product works for SPMS, that\u2019s an very important improvement for patients that have that [indiscernible] and that would be a great day for the patients.","Operator","Your next question comes from Douglas Dow with Barclays.","Douglas Dow","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. It's just a quick one. Judy, if you could just review where you are, I think you noted that your debt levels pro forma for the Omega deal, if you could just provide some detail in terms of the break down between secured and unsecured?","Judy Brown","Secured and unsecured in terms of our total debt?","Douglas Dow","Yes.","Judy Brown","It\u2019s all.","Douglas Dow","All unsecured, okay.","Judy Brown","When you go over the 10-Q later today, you\u2019ll see that our debt structure today comprised of term loans and covered bonds.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Chiang with CRT Capital.","Tim Chiang","Hi. Joe, I had one question. This Androgel 1% launch, are you guys seeing any conversion from the higher strength branded product over to your lower strength generic product at this point?","Joseph Papa","As you appropriately pointed out, we\u2019ve only launched the 1% Testosterone product at this time. I think it\u2019s too early for it, we\u2019re seeing usage of our products, but I think it\u2019s probably too early to say whether or not any of the specific patients that are on 1.16 will switch to the 1%. Having said that, though, when you can get, when the third party payer and patient can get a generic product with the same AB-rated as a 1% product, the use of the 1.62 with the co-pays of a branded co-pay versus the co-pay of a generic one, I\u2019d guess you\u2019ll see some transition on that, but I think it\u2019s probably a little too early for us to say that and that we\u2019re really in the first month of launch.","We will look to continue to show that we have a great offering here with 1% AB-rated product. But I think we\u2019re just going to have to wait and see what happens from the payer point of view and the patient point of view. We may see some, but it\u2019s too early for me comment right now.","Tim Chiang","And maybe just one follow-up for Judy. Judy, I think we had talked on the last call about your pro forma tax rate with Omega being around 19%, 20%. I noticed your stand-alone tax rate went down a little bit for fiscal 2015, to 15%. Will that positively impact your pro forma tax rate?","Judy Brown","Excellent question. I would say in theory, yes. What moves the needle from our last guidance to this guidance, why did we go from 16% to 15% is jurisdictional mix. So as we think about the plusses and minuses that you see on the overall guidance page in the web material, you\u2019ll see we\u2019re adjusting down some of the consumer and nutrition numbers, we\u2019re adjusting up the Rx number, particularly with respect to new products and that mix has helped favorably impact the effective tax rate.","Now, we started talking about the rate, when we give new calendar guidance including Omega, again it come to the mix in that period ending December with jurisdictional mix, but conceptually that mix of income in the ongoing standalone Perrigo business were to continue, you would see a positive benefit. Again, out of my skies to talk about with Omega until we have those numbers consolidated in with us for the nine months ending December 31 when we give that new guidance.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Linda Weiser with B. Riley.","Linda Weiser","Hi. So Joe, just kind of a big, strategic question, when you think about future acquisitions and you think about some of the OTC areas, is there any possibility of combining with a branded OTC company in the US or is that not strategically, would that not make sense in the way that you interact with the retailers, or do you think over time there could be some possibility of that kind of a combination?","Joseph Papa","I think, Linda it\u2019s a great question, as we think about what we have accomplished in the past, store brands have been very, very important to Perrigo, it is our legacy business both as you think about consumer and our nutritional business. Having said that, there are places where we do think brands could work for us and we\u2019ve launched a branded version of a probiotic, which we learned a lot about. It has some challenges to be clear, but we learned a lot about ability to launch brands to get store placement et cetera. So do I think there\u2019s an opportunity for us to go into branded business in some select categories, the answer is absolutely yes. In fact, Omega I think is a proof point for that, because as we thought about going into Europe with our portfolio, we thought that there is the Omega example, just a best way for us to get that infrastructure and bring our product portfolio there.","As we think about it in the US, we\u2019ve tried with a product here and it had some mixed results. We had good store placement, but there is learnings there for us as we think about the future, I think it\u2019s absolute reason for we will look at that as a way to continue to grow and drive shareholder value for the company. So I do think it\u2019s a good question, Melinda. It\u2019s one that we\u2019ll continue to look at for the future.","Thank you very much everyone for the call today. I would continue to say my confidence in the entire Perrigo team for what they have been able to accomplish and what we look forward to especially as we bring the Omega product portfolio to Perrigo and importantly as we think about launching a lot of these new products, we got a lot of work to do. We go a great team of people, all dedicated to make quality healthcare reality for Perrigo and for around the world. So thank you everyone for your attention today. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this was event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Bradley Joseph, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Bradley Joseph","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Perrigo\u2019s second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. I hope you all had a chance to review the press release we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the release along with the slide deck overview of the quarter and our guidance metrics are available on our website at perrigo.com.","Joining today\u2019s call are Murray Kessler, Perrigo\u2019s President and CEO; and Ray Silcock, Perrigo\u2019s CFO. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that during this call participants will make forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for shareholders and investors and safe harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued earlier this morning. In addition, in the appendix for today\u2019s call, we\u2019ve provided reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Murray.","Murray Kessler","Good morning, everyone. For the most part, I\u2019m pleased with the second quarter results, and importantly, I like the direction Perrigo is heading. Since we shared our strategic direction at May 9 Investor Day, and even before then, we\u2019ve been moving quickly to execute on the 40 major initiatives we discussed. Initiatives that must happen if we are to successfully transform Perrigo from a healthcare company to a consumer self-care company. While we are still in the early stages, significant progress was made during the second quarter.","A few examples. Strong customer service levels have been restored in our Americas and RX businesses and are once north of 90%. Our new products program is beginning to yield higher results, especially in Europe behind the launch of XLS Forte 5 and strong performance by the ACO brand. New products yielded $65 million in consolidated net sales during the quarter.","Third, we closed on the divestiture of the Animal Health business for $185 million. Fourth, we also closed on the acquisition of Ranir, the world\u2019s leading store brand oral self-care company, and raised guidance to reflect the incremental business. Ranir will have a very positive effect on our consolidated results in the second half of the year. We also completed the roadmap of our $100 million Project Momentum cost savings initiative. We\u2019ll share specific plans and the follow on, on this plan, which is crucial to offset the stranded cost resulting from the eventual separation of our RX business.","And finally, we\u2019ve incrementally improved our forecast accuracy, as evidenced, by making this quarter\u2019s adjusted EPS results, marking our third consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding analyst expectations. The most important is that I feel the excitement building among our employees throughout Perrigo. Like me, they believe that the company is getting back on track. I\u2019m delighted to see throughout the company a commitment to our new self-care vision and the priorities necessary to make that vision a reality. Transformations don\u2019t happen without commitment to a shared vision, and we have it.","This excitement and energy is beginning to show itself in business results, which I will briefly discuss. Our CFO, Ray Silcock will provide the specific GAAP and adjusted results, which you can also see reconciled in the earnings release. But I will be speaking to the adjusted results.","Adjusted net sales grew 1% for Perrigo on a consolidated basis, excluding Animal Health, infant foods and currency. Consumer Self-Care Americas adjusted net sales also increased almost 1% for the quarter, excluding Animal Health and infant foods, driven by a very strong quarter for our core OTC business.","Perrigo OTC sales, which represents approximately 80% of the Americas business, increased a robust 4% for the quarter and volume increased nearly 6%, tracing to an increase in category demand associated with an extended cough cold season, a good start to the allergy season and strength in our smoking cessation and GI categories. For a perspective, OTC category growth, consumption that is, rate tripled during the quarter versus a year ago from 1.1% to 3.5%. Store brand outpaced that growth, increasing 3.8%, meaning store brand\u2019s once again gained share from national brands.","I wasn\u2019t happy with the performance of our infant formula business for the quarter, which declined almost 15% versus a year ago. The mass \u2013 the vast majority of that decline was driven by our contract sales business, which suffered due to inventory issues among several of our branded customers that made the strategic decision to exit infant formula. The performance was also affected by a product recall at a leading customer. But importantly, consumer demand on our store brand business has returned to near pre-recall levels. So the good news here is that as contract packed inventory is correct, we would expect this business in our total nutrition business to quickly stabilize in the second half.","Turning to Consumer Self-Care International. Net sales, excluding currency, declined nearly 2% versus year ago, but the results there are better than they look. We had a short-term hiccup in France associated with the sales force restructuring that was large enough to offset growth on the rest of the International business, that is excluding France and currency, CSCI was up 1%. And remember what I shared with you on Investor Day about our purposeful exit of certain nonstrategic brands representing about 4% of the business last year. Well, that\u2019s down to 3% this year already. So when you look at our core branded consumer products portfolio, it grew 3% for the quarter driven by nearly $30 million in new product launches. We believe the CSCI transformation is well underway and are working to resolve the short-term issues in France during the second half of the year. And importantly, in markets with attractive growth, we continue to maintain our market share across Europe, led by our core products.","Our noncore RX segment continued to also perform well and outperform most generic RX companies posting another quarter of topline net sales growth of more than 3%. We continue to see a moderation of downward pricing pressure and the business benefited, like consumer Americas, from improved customer service levels. The RX separation continues to be a strategic priority, and we continue to work on affecting a separation. But uncertainty in the market and generic pharmaceuticals industry, generally, right now requires us to reevaluate timing, so as to optimize value for our shareholders.","Be clear, our RX business remains strong, and we believe as relatively modest exposure to the factors affecting the industry right now. We have written this business to growth, and we expect it will deliver attractive cash flow as we work towards separation. We will keep you posted. But again, to be clear, we remain committed to the separation and to transforming Perrigo into a pure play consumer company.","Looking forward, we have a lot to do. And as I have said before, the transformation will take several years. We are making good progress, and I expect that progress to be more visible through accelerated net sales growth in the second half of the year as we integrate Ranir and we see more of our initiatives come to market. I remain excited about what we as a team are doing at Perrigo, and I am confident we will recapture the Perrigo advantage. I know we will make lives better by bringing quality affordable self-care products that consumers trust everywhere they are sold.","And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ray.","Ray Silcock","Thank you, Murray, and good morning, everyone. I would now like to walk through the details of the Q2 P&L and balance sheet attached to this morning\u2019s press release. I should note that there are also some explanatory financial charts on our website for additional clarity.","Moving now to our second quarter results. Consolidated reported net sales were $1.15 billion in Q2, 3% lower than for the same quarter last year. Consolidated adjusted net sales were 1% higher in Q2 than in the same quarter last year after excluding adverse foreign currency movements, the Animal Health business held for sale in Q2 and then divested at the beginning of Q3, and the infant foods business that we exited at the end of last year. Consolidated reported net income for the quarter was $9 million, and reported EPS was $0.07 a share. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $117 million, and adjusted EPS was $0.86 a share.","Total adjustments in the quarter amounted to $108 million. We had $74 million of amortization expense, primarily related to previously acquired intangible assets and a $28 million impairment charge of a certain definite-lived asset in our RX business. We also incurred $12 million in restructuring charges, primarily due to the reorganization of our sales force in France as well as an $8 million adjustment for a combination of accounting and operational expenses, primarily related to the planned separation of the RX business, plus $3 million of other smaller adjustments, all partially offset by a $17 million non-GAAP tax adjustment. These adjustments can be found delineated in more detail in the non-GAAP reconciliation table attached to this morning\u2019s press release.","Our reported effective tax rate was unusually high for this quarter at 67%, driven by the RX impairment charge of $28 million in the quarter that was not tax deductible. Adding this impairment charge back to our adjusted pretax income increased the denominator of the adjusted tax rate formula with no change to tax expense. This was the primary reason for the reduction on our adjusted effective tax rate to 23.1%.","In Q2, Worldwide Consumer reported net sales of $910 million, 5% lower than for the same quarter last year. Worldwide Consumer adjusted net sales were flat as compared to the same quarter last year, excluding the impacts of adverse foreign currency movements, the held-for-sale Animal Health business and the infant foods business that we exited at the end of last year.","Total new product sales of $38 million and strong volume in our core U.S. OTC business were more than offset by lower sales volumes in our International segment. CSCA reported net sales of $582 million in Q2, down 2.5% from the prior year. Adjusted net sales for Q2 were $559 million, 1% higher than for the same period last year when the held-for-sale Animal Health business and the infant foods business that we exited are excluded. Net sales from our market-leading U.S. OTC business increased by more than 4% compared to the same quarter prior year. But these increases were partially offset by lower sales of infant formula.","International reported net sales of $328 million in the quarter, 8.5% lower than for the same quarter last year. Excluding adverse currency movements, sales were down 1.8% from Q2 last year. Strong new product sales of $30 million were more than offset by the impact of discontinued products, lower sales in certain categories and in France. Lower sales in France were primarily due to a lack of sales coverage there as a realignment of the sales force, part of a number of business optimization initiatives underway in CSCI, as we seek to increase productivity and achieve better profitability, resulted in temporary business disruption.","In realigning the sales force, we offered early retirement packages to help us convince three sales forces into one to improve efficiency and effectiveness. More French sales employees took early retirement than have been anticipated resulting in a reduction of sales effectiveness in the quarter. We expect this disruption to be remedied by year-end as we hire, train and deploy new sales people. When the year-over-year decrease in net sales in France is excluded, in addition to the effect of currency movements, CSCI net sales would have grown 1% in the quarter.","Moving on to gross profits. In Q2, Worldwide Consumer had adjusted gross profit of $366 million, down $42 million from the same quarter last year. Excluding businesses held for sale and adjusting for the impact of currency, second quarter adjusted gross profit was down 3% from Q2 last year. In the Americas segment, adjusted gross profit was a $190 million, down 10.7% compared to the same quarter last year. This decline was principally due to lower infant formula contract manufacturing as well as operational inefficiencies resulting from higher scrap and some raw materials price inflation.","These were partially offset by improved business performance within the U.S. OTC business and by new products introductions. Sequentially, compared to our first quarter, Americas adjusted gross profit margin increased 150 basis points to 34%, primarily due to favorable product mix and higher volumes in our OTC category. In the International segment, adjusted gross profit was $179 million, down 10.1% compared to the same quarter last year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit was down 3.7% compared to prior year, primarily as a result of adverse product mix and the impact from that sales force realignment in France, partially offset by successful new products as we continue to reap the benefits of a healthy new product pipeline.","Continuing on down to P&L, Worldwide Consumer adjusted operating expenses were flat to last year, excluding the impact of currency and held-for-sale business, adjusted operating expenses were up 8% as a result of: one, 13.5% increase in R&D investments compared to prior year; two, performance-based compensation plan accruals being returned to 100%; and three, the absence of a onetime insurance recovery that benefited the second quarter last year.","Moving on to adjusted operating margin. Worldwide Consumer adjusted operating income in Q2 amounted to $118 million, down from $161 million last year and adjusted operating margin of 13.3% versus 16..8% in the prior year. CSCA\u2019s adjusted operating of \u2013 operating margin of 20.3% was down 130 basis points from Q2 last year with lower SG&A expenses being partially offset by increased R&D spending when the $50 million upfront license fee for NASONEX, which was charged to R&D in Q2 last year is excluded. Sequentially, the Americas adjusted operating margin was up 200 basis points from prior quarter due to gross profit flow through and lower SG&A expenses. In the International segment, adjusted operating margin was stable at 15.3% versus 15.6% last year and 15.4% in this year\u2019s first quarter.","Turning now to the RX segment. Net sales for the quarter were $239 million, 3.4% higher as compared to prior year. New product sales of $27 million and improved customer service were partially offset by continued, although moderating, downward pricing pressure and by the impact of discontinued products. Adjusted gross profit of $100 million in the quarter was $16 million lower than in Q2 last year, primarily due to the continued downward pricing pressure and a less favorable product mix, including higher volumes this year of relatively lower margin authorized generic products. RX adjusted operating income of $66 million was down $13 million compared to last year as the gross margin shortfall was partially offset by lower administrative expenses as compared to the prior year. R&D expenses were at a similar to that of last year.","In summary, Perrigo consolidated adjusted earnings per share in Q2 were $0.86, better than we had expected primarily due to improved business performance by both our Americas OTC business and the RX segment. And also as a result of timing differences versus our expectation in R&D and A&P expenditures that we now anticipate incurring in the second half of the year.","A quick comment on the balance sheet. Our working capital levels were up in the second quarter as we built inventories in order to address some customer service issues and in anticipation of plant maintenance and other needs. As a result, cash flow from operations was significantly lower than normal in Q2 with cash flow as a percent \u2013 cash flow conversion, that is, as a percent of adjusted net income at 60% for the quarter. For the balance of the year, we anticipate the cash flow conversion, including from Ranir, will return to between 90% and 97% of adjusted net income.","Following the Ranir acquisition, we are planning to refinance our existing term loan with a new $600 million facility, the proceeds of which we will use to repay our existing term loan and reduce the balance on our revolving credit facility. We expect that the refinancing will close by the end of this month, we\u2019ll be leverage neutral, and we\u2019ll lower interest expense by $2.5 million for the balance of 2019.","Turning now to guidance for the balance of the current year. Our consolidated adjusted EPS guidance is unchanged for the year in the range of $3.75 to $4.05 a share with net sales in the range of $4.75 billion to $4.85 billion. Adjusted Worldwide Consumer net sales on a constant currency basis for 2019, excluding exited businesses are expected to grow by about 5% versus last year. We anticipate this sales growth being driven primarily by the acquisition of Ranir by better performance in our core U.S. OTC business and by \u2013 and from a strong pipeline of new product launches in International.","The RX business continues to perform well in spite of the challenging generic marketplace, we continue to anticipate net sales growth this year as a result of a strong new product pipeline and moderation of the downward pricing pressure on this business. Please bear in mind this guidance does not include any impact in 2019 from generic ProAir. Potential upsides for the balance of 2019 are the launch of generic ProAir, which if achieved, could add as much as $0.10 per share per quarter and incremental cost savings from Project Momentum of up to $0.05 a share.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Murray.","Murray Kessler","Thank you, Ray. One last thing before we move into the Q&A. Last night, we announced that Jeff Smith has resigned from the Perrigo Board. I want to thank him for his service and for his insight and passion to put Perrigo back on track. Perrigo is a better company because of his and store Board\u2019s involvement. And as you know, I would not be at Perrigo if not for Jeff. I believe, as he said himself, his leaving is to allow him to focus on other opportunities and reflects the confidence he has in the Board, leadership team and all our employees to execute on our strategic plan and build shareholder value.","Operator, we\u2019ll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Randall Stanicky","Great. Thanks guys for the question. Murray, the U.S. Consumer business is the value driver for Perrigo. And when you look at the opportunity to drive new launch revenue higher going forward, what are the plans to do that? Or should we think about the current level, which is run rating at just north of $30 million is the new level. And then secondly, I don\u2019t want to focus on your RX business, but just you said if you couldn\u2019t sell it, you would spin it. Is spin still on the table? Thanks.","Murray Kessler","Okay. Well. First off, I mean, we\u2019re just starting on the plans on the new product and the innovation plans on CSCA. So you\u2019re going to see great growth out of CSCA largely in the second half of the year, in the beginning of next year from the bolt on of Ranir, which is exactly I told you. It would take some time ramp up the new product program. So everything is on track. I like what I see in the pipeline and the development of bigger initiatives, and that will ramp over time, and we\u2019ll continue to do bolt-ons to do that. It plays to a total number that I\u2019ve given you that I think I get 1% to 2% organic growth from the core business, and then bolt-ons get me up to the 3% and my 3.57 algorithm that I\u2019m working towards to meet the results of consumer peers.","As it relates to the spin, it\u2019s still an option on the table, we\u2019re just as committed as we always are. But this is a business that\u2019s a good business, it\u2019s differentiated, that doesn\u2019t have the same exposure as others and this is a challenging time to be separating. So I \u2013 we need to do it because it\u2019s the right thing to do. And I believe we have a little bit of time as the business has stabilized, and I need to get the consumer business performing to where it deserves rerate anyway. And I\u2019m going to maximize shareholder value. So we\u2019re still committed to it. I think we spent north of $5 million in the quarter in getting ready and continuing the activities. So we\u2019re not backed off. But I have to be aware of what\u2019s going on in the marketplace.","Randall Stanicky","Fair enough. Okay, thanks, Murray.","Operator","The next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen","Hi, congratulations on the quarter. And thanks for taking my questions. My first question here is on your CBD strategy. Just curious where you are with this? And what type of expertise Perrigo\u2019s management brings in this opportunity? Second one is, how important e-commerce is to Perrigo? And how is your Amazon business growing? And then last question here is just any color you could provide on the generic gross margin progression between first quarter and second quarter?","Murray Kessler","Okay. Let me make sure I have all \u2013 you had the e-commerce question, CBD management expertise and Ray, you can \u2013 after I do that that, you do the gross margin progression. CBD management, I feel like we have a good group of people that are working on it, led by somebody who brought into the company who I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve \u2013 I haven\u2019t \u2013 you haven\u2019t met him yet, but as a person who worked with me at Lorillard, who basically did the same thing and breakthrough technology and something very different in the tobacco industry with vapor products, and was the inventor of Blu e-cigs, and that we eventually bought and went national with first then.","He\u2019s a very innovative-type person, and he is leading the charge in identifying the way to get into CBD in a Perrigo-like way. I don\u2019t want to be the same as everybody else. It\u2019s progressing. We have \u2013 I don\u2019t just want to prematurely talk about it. But I\u2019m not going to get in it to be 1 of 200 people that are just launching a lotion and a cream. So it has to be \u2013 make sense when you hear about it afterwards. And we\u2019ll keep you posted as we go on it. But the management expertise is there for sure because I have set that up as sort of a skunkworks to new products innovation group that doesn\u2019t even sit here at Allegan or Dublin.","From an e-commerce standpoint, our business continues to grow. We continue to book more resources against it, our businesses. We like our relationship with Amazon. We have good margins with them and a good relationship. And as \u2013 well, you saw at the May 9 Investor Day, we have strong double-digit growth in those areas. And we have the same thing internationally. It remains an area of focus, if there is an area I\u2019d like to do better on is to see it more than just e-commerce, but I\u2019d like \u2013 digital is more than e-commerce. So we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m pushing from a consumer perspective that we grow that even further. And then Ray, you want to handle the progression on gross margin on RX?","Ray Silcock","Yes. Hi, Louise. So the margin in Q1 in RX was 48.6% and our margin in Q2 is 41.7%. And that the decline was principally driven by downward pricing pressure plus a mix issue where we had increased sales in the authorized generics business. And these authorized generics products have lower margins, but they do represent incremental sales and incremental dollar margin to the business.","Bradley Joseph","Great. Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Gregg Gilbert with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Greg Fraser","Thank you. It\u2019s actually Greg Fraser on for Greg Gilbert. Good morning, folks. On the Americas business, are you considering options for non-core OTC products? Or does it make more sense to keep those in the portfolio? And then the second question is, has there any progress behind the scenes on the Ireland and U.S. tax issues that you can comment on?","Murray Kessler","Okay. I\u2019m not sure what are you referring to as non-core within\u2026","Bradley Joseph","Did you mean International, Greg?","Greg Fraser","No. The 20% of sales that are non-core\u2026","Murray Kessler","Oh, you\u2019re talking of \u2013 no, I consider nutrition as core to our business. I was that \u2013 this business has started as an OTC business and that\u2019s the heart and soul of what we do. We had a bolt-on a number of years back in nutrition. I like nutrition, I\u2019ve highlighted it as a strategic area globally for growth. I don\u2019t like having to come back 1.5 month later after highlighting it as a strategic area for growth and it had a tough quarter, but it was a recall and a \u2013 some contract patches. It\u2019s not the core business or the core underlying consumption.","So no, I\u2019m not looking at any pruning. I\u2019ve said, I\u2019ll continue to look at the total portfolio worldwide to keep refining it to get to self-care and we have some work to do in that area. The only new news I have on the tax front is that \u2013 we \u2013 there has been filings with the courts on the judicial review, and I believe a date has been set for late April of 2020. So that is sort of the first time there\u2019ll be any real potential progress on that if that date holds. They tend to sometimes gets pushed back even further, but that would be sort of the next milestone in the case, and then however long it would take them to decide it. So I guess that would be the new news in the quarter.","Greg Fraser","Thank you.","Bradley Joseph","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from David Maris with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","David Maris","Good morning. How are you? I hope you are good. Two questions. So first on the generic business. Just assuming that the environment for a spin out doesn\u2019t get any better just because things are so bad. Are you just going to plan to keep it in-house and run it as it is? Or there are other options that you\u2019re considering? The second is, one of the first things that you mentioned that you saw that concerned you were the customer service levels, can you tell us about how you\u2019ve address that so far? Where you stand on it? And any metrics you can provide around the progress of that would be great. Thank you.","Murray Kessler","Okay. The first one on RX, it\u2019s not an either\/or it\u2019s \u2013 the answer to that is yes to both of those. I am evaluating options that are creative and remember what \u2013 for this spin I need to create as much value as I possibly can and put \u2013 send off a very healthy RX business, if it\u2019s a spinner itself. But if it were to be a spin, it has to be very healthy and so does the remain code, and that it has to be able to execute on those strategic plans. There is lots of options to do that. And one of those options is simply to slowdown a little bit and collect a very stable cash flow.","And I feel good about the way that business has stabilized and the new product pipeline that\u2019s come to fruition that was a little dry a year ago. And I think you felt it, the company was banking on generic ProAir, that didn\u2019t happen. But it expected it to happen a year ago, and has now \u2013 I\u2019m getting the benefit of the pipeline that was supposed to come behind it is now coming to the marketplace and there is more behind that. So I don\u2019t see a gap in the company\u2019s ability to compete, and the pricing at least for now feels like it has \u2013 the downward pricing pressure is not nearly to the extent it was on our business, which admittedly is pretty differentiated versus others.","On the customer service, I tried to get some metrics in there. We are \u2013 I\u2019m really pleased with the work that\u2019s going, although it\u2019s a bit manual. So we have strategically built the inventories, which cost us some working capital during the quarter, as Ray referred to, and got ourselves back to good customer service levels in the 90s, which was \u2013 we were in the low \u2013 we were in the mid-70s when I joined the company. So the important part there is the conversations in our customers\u2019 offices are no longer just why \u2013 what\u2019s going on the service, what\u2019s going on with service. We\u2019re back to having conversations on building the business and new products and incremental opportunities and partnerships and all the things we\u2019re supposed to be doing instead of covering for \u2013 and explaining why we\u2019re not doing the most basic thing we\u2019re supposed to do well. So I like that. I like to not have that increased inventory be permanent. So there\u2019s a lot of work underway to systematize and with systems and process that we\u2019re making great progress on to be more nimble and the able to keep those service levels without the extra working capital.","David Maris","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Risinger","Good morning. Congrats on the performance. I have questions regarding the organic revenue growth expectations. So could you just comment on, I guess, first, what we should expect for second half 2019 organic sales growth momentum ex Ranir? And then Second, Murray, I believe, the longer-term target is for 1% to 2% organic revenue growth. I don\u2019t specifically recall that mentioned at the Analyst Day, I may be wrong because it\u2019s been a bit of a whirlwind of new slow in the last couple of weeks with respect to quarterly results, but is that 1% to 2% organic revenue growth the same as you indicated in the Analyst Day? Thank you.","Murray Kessler","Yes. It definitely is the same as we said. And so I would expect Ranir after the incremental \u2013 just putting pro forma into the business, it\u2019s growing at a faster rate to be an example of help accelerating the ongoing rate 2% to 3%. So that\u2019ll improve our organic performance. But that\u2019s exactly what I said \u2013 and the way \u2013 frankly the way, if you sort of take out all these distractions that Animal Health has there and other, the way the business has been performing. In the second half of the year, we\u2019re looking for a little stronger organically even without Ranir. But you\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re looking at 5-plus percent growth in the second half of the year when you count Ranir in there and a stronger performance. And by the way, we had it in the first have, too. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a complex business, I\u2019m getting my hands around it. But infant formula the play \u2013 like we would have had a gang buster quarter if infant formula was just flat. I mean the category tripling and then extended cost currently to 4% is \u2013 and 5% fine is big numbers for us in the store brand core business.","David Risinger","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ami Fadia with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.","Ami Fadia","Good morning, this is Ami. Can you give us some color around the Ranir business, maybe some color around the composition of the $300 million plus Animal revenue run rate? And what\u2019s really going to drive growth? Do you expect it to grow high single digits this year on a year-over-year basis? And what\u2019s really going to drive that growth? And then secondly, you talked about several new areas of self-care at the Analyst Day. What are some of the areas that you are exploring that could add growth over the next 12 to 18 months? Thanks.","Murray Kessler","Yes. It\u2019s a big question. I covered a lot of those in the Investor Day, the second part of the question. I don\u2019t really want to use this call, but I hear the question of giving more detail on the future on Ranir. But Ranir as in \u2013 as their historic algorithm, they\u2019ve been growing in high single digits, low double digit growth for years. And that\u2019s been a combination of both organic and smaller bolt-on acquisitions for those, they\u2019re kind of the same formula that we are. And I \u2013 the percent that comes from me each, I expect that business to continue to grow this year. We\u2019ve given you that within our guidance. And that\u2019s from both a combination of continuing to grow at existing customers, broadening their new product profile \u2013 portfolio, we\u2019re expanding internationally, about 30% of that business is international. They continue to have a robust program that, again, I talked about on Investor Day. But I love the way they\u2019re focused on not just national brand equivalent, but national brand better and national brand different. And in the future, as it goes forward, this opens up a whole leg of growth for us, both organically and inorganically with additional bolt-on there as well, which is all part of the idea.","As it relates to our core business, I gave you opportunities \u2013 despite the tough quarter, I believe nutrition is a big opportunity for this company. And we\u2019re to narrowing our focus, I think nicotine cessation has been too focused and too tiny, and that\u2019s why I said that we had signed the technology agreement and develop \u2013 codevelopment agreement on how we could use sort of the responsibility of Perrigo to work with the FDA to solve some of the problems in tobacco, or bring solutions to smokers wanting to quit in a form that they like, that the FDA can get behind. And that\u2019ll take work, those aren\u2019t easy things to do, but I believe that nicotine cessation is less than a couple of percent of the total tobacco industry numbers with the entire consumer base willing to quit. So it\u2019s got to be an opportunity for us.","And international, the weight loss e-commerce, there is just \u2013 I think we\u2019ve illustrated $0.5 billion of new products that we have put into the pipeline. So we\u2019ll keep you posted as we go forward, and I think I left down naturals as another area. But there\u2019s a lacking of opportunities. There has to the strong discipline. And I continue, I\u2019m a process guy and I push the organization hard. And as an example, at this Board meeting we had done the Ranir, but we \u2013 I got approval to a comprehensive M&A strategy going forward that laid out the priorities and the funnels that we could go out and do these kinds of bolt-ons, but with real discipline that create shareholder value.","Bradley Joseph","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Pat Trucchio with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Pat Trucchio","Good morning. Quick one on the generic ProAir. Can you tell us when we could expect an update on a potential approval on generic ProAir? And what sales assumptions are in that $0.10 per quarter estimates? And then on project momentum savings of $100 million, can you tell us if any of the drivers of the savings have changed since the Investor Day? How much of the savings are expected to be achieved in 2019? And is it possible that incremental savings beyond what you\u2019ve identified over the next three years could be achieved from additional levers or additional learnings, as in, for instance, with the consolidation of the supply chain in Europe and improved inventory systems in Europe?","Murray Kessler","Well, let me do the second half and then, Ray, you talk to the ProAir. Although we\u2019re not going to talk to the \u2013 speculate on the regulatory approval. The regulatory teams \u2013 you can talk to the numbers in a minute, Ray. We believe we have an approvable product right now and there is \u2013 hopefully it could be tomorrow. We believe we\u2019re close. As it relates to a project momentum, the first phase of project momentum when I stood up at May 9, I had confidence at our first cut at it, to believe from an overhead reduction that I could get to the $100 million number. Now I have complete line of sight and probably to a little bit more recognizing you don\u2019t get everything, but I\u2019m comfortable with that number. I\u2019m not really expecting much of any of it in 2019, we\u2019ll come in the fall and layout the actual plan as we\u2019re laying out the execution now.","But I expect it to affect 2020 numbers and 2021 numbers. And the difference in the short term versus the long term is some of them require systems to be put into place, as for an example, you\u2019d start it already to talk about CSCI, but you have literally an omega, there were almost 35-something-plus operating systems across there. So there\u2019s a whole lot of manual labor to consolidate all of that. And it\u2019ll take systems work and investment to accomplish that and that takes a bit longer.","But I really like is the back half of your question, is that it? And the answer is no. This first phase was that we\u2019re focused on the next 1.5 year was overhead related. So operating expenses, cost of products sold or manufacturing, et cetera. So Phase II for us, which we\u2019re just entering, and I have no idea the size of that number as I sit here today is to begin to do the work in that area. And I believe there should be meaningful opportunities. This is very complex organization with 14,000 SKUs and all that. So we\u2019ll begin the work on SKU optimization. And manufacturing configuration and distribution configuration, but that wasn\u2019t part of the initial phase.","Ray you want to enter the sort of the economics of the ProAir?","Ray Silcock","Yes. I mean we\u2019re expecting $0.10 a quarter as we said. And we don\u2019t normally getting to the details of what that revenue would be. But obviously, it\u2019s a fairly modest amount.","Bradley Joseph","Next question.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Bradley Joseph","Last question, please.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Joseph, Vice President of Global Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Bradley Joseph ","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Perrigo's fourth quarter and calendar year 2018 earnings conference call. Hope you all had a chance to review the press release we issued earlier this afternoon. Copies of this release are available on our website, as is the slide presentation for this call. Joining today's call are Murray Kessler, Perrigo's President and CEO; and Ron Winowiecki, Perrigo's CFO.","I'd like to remind everyone that during the call, participants will make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for investors and shareholders and Safe Harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued earlier this afternoon. In addition, in the appendix for today's presentation, we've provided reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures presented.","Turning quickly to the agenda on Slide 3. First, Murray will discuss his early observations and progress we've made since he joined Perrigo, followed by his highlights of the commercial results for the quarter. Ron will then review our fourth quarter performance results and walk through the details of our P&L statement and balance sheet. Ron will then review business trends heading into 2019 before turning the call back over to Murray for closing remarks and Q&A. ","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Murray.","Murray Kessler ","Good afternoon, everyone. I had one quarter under my belt and I'm learning more and more about the business every day. My early observations of what the key issues facing Perrigo are and what we need to do to fix the business remain largely unchanged and can be summarized as follows: ","First, the challenges that we face are fixable. The more time I\u2019ve spent with the business the more I\u2019ve become comfortable that we can not only take Perrigo back to its prior strength but that we can build on the platform to be even stronger. ","Second, new product volume and core brand innovation over the last few years has not been sufficient to offset increased price competition in the USA. ","Third, increased organizational complexity and lack of sufficient investment and capacity and technology has reduced the company service levels and competitive advantage in an area that has historically been a core competency for Perrigo and which inside the company we rightly call the Perrigo advantage.","Four, overhangs of which the recent EUR1.6 billion Irish Notice of Assessment is the most meaningful and which I'll discuss in more detail in a few minutes are a distraction and a resource strain. ","Fifth, over the last few years Perrigo has not made the type of investments that had driven the company's success for so many years. That is a robust pipeline of new products and smaller bolt-on acquisition.","Six, our international consumer business is a good business with attractive upside potential, but has a legacy of having been managed as an amalgamation of many small businesses. Great progress has been made restructuring that business and reducing complexity but there's much more to be done in order to enhance performance and margin. ","Overall, I liked the business and it is performing better than most investors realize. ","Seven, our generic RX business is a diversified and highly differentiated pharmaceutical business. But when RX is combined with our consumer businesses both become neglected. I continue to support the Board's decision to separate the companies so they both can reach their full potential. ","Eight, there is great talent within the company that was waiting to be unleashed and that is being done. There are also some important capability and skill gaps that needed to be addressed in the area of consumer marketing, R&D, innovation and business intelligence. Those voids have been filled with great talent both externally and internally. ","And nine, the company's recent earnings guidance revisions have frustrated investors. While the fourth quarter results were relatively lackluster and negatively impacted by continued executional issues, we delivered exactly what we said we would despite some pretty significant headwinds, so that's a start.","Again, all of these issues are fixable and many are being addressed now with specific actions throughout our company. Most importantly, we have developed a new strategic plan designed to help us deliver our new vision, which is to make lives better by bringing quality affordable self-care products that consumers trust everywhere they are sold. The plan has been approved by our Board and we are now on to the implementation stage. We will share the full plan at our Investor Day which has been scheduled for May 9th at the New York Stock Exchange. ","At that meeting, we will review how we are transforming Perrigo from a healthcare to a consumer self-care company to take advantage of a massive global consumer trend. ","We intend to provide detailed plans and actions we have already taken in areas of portfolio reconfiguration, investments in capacity and technology, innovation initiative, cost savings plans to help fuel growth, capital allocation plans, and organizational effectiveness initiatives, including several key external hires. We will also provide calendar year 2019 guidance at that time.","Turning to the fourth quarter of 2018, let me give you an overview of how I saw consolidated and segment commercial result. Reported fourth quarter net sales for the company were $1.2 billion, down 5% versus a year-ago on an organic constant currency basis and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.97 as we guided which was down 24% versus year ago. We experienced operating income declines across all three of our segments for different reasons, which I'll detail in a minute, but at the 30,000 foot level, the consumer businesses in the Americas were negatively affected by costs and customer service. ","In our International segment, we've purposely invested in advertising and in R&D and in RX, we continued to suffer from downward pricing pressure albeit at a lower rate than we had been previously experiencing.","In the Consumer Market segment, consumer offtake and store brand market share continued to grow. Underlying revenue trends on our core businesses were relatively unchanged. Importantly, sales volumes on the base over-the-counter healthcare lines were once again solid, except for animal health, which you are aware of it has been discussed on previous calls. ","Execution in the fourth quarter remained sloppy which depressed revenues and reduced margins. On top of challenged service levels a significant equipment startup issue in the infant nutrition business resulted in a mid sales opportunity of $10 million with a one-time impact to gross profit of approximately $0.08 of adjusted EPS per share.","Turning to Consumer International, we continue to simplify and upgrade our offerings during 2018 and the fourth quarter. This purposeful pruning of our product line, which has translated to higher margin, masks our businesses really performing. Our core international OTC brands, representing 70% of consumer international\u2019s net sales grew approximately 2.5% for the year and 1.5% fourth the quarter, holding market share in the European OTC market that grew at roughly the same rate. ","We are especially pleased with momentum we are observing in the dermatological space with our ACO brand and cough, cold and analgesic with our Solpadeine brand. Fourth quarter advertising and R&D was increased by $13 million or 28% on a constant currency basis versus last year to keep the momentum going.","And with the bulk of the product line pruning that has occurred over the last few years behind us, we anticipate top-line growth in 2019 for our total International Consumer segment. I'd also note customer service levels had averaged around 95% for the last year, a testament to this team's focus on keeping our winning brands on the shelf and available to consumers. ","Moving on to RX, it was a better quarter as we started to see the benefits of a solid pipeline of new products begin to positively impact the business in both revenue and margin. We saw margin improvement in the fourth quarter both sequentially and year-over-year benefiting from the launch of testosterone 1.62% and an easing of downward pricing pressure. Revenues continued to decline year-over-year by approximately 15%, which is half the rate that we experienced in the third quarter. We expect this business segment to improve as its new product pipeline continues to come to market. ","For perspective, we have 10 tentative approvals awaiting final action and 65 new product projects under development or under FDA review. Also worth noting, customer service levels have been restored to greater than 90%. And as it relates to the separation process, I won't comment on where we are right now on the sale or spin or in the Q&A other than to say it is on track and we remain committed to this strategic initiative.","So in summary, 2018 was a challenging year, but overall our consumer business\u2019 market shares were stable in growing market. Executional issues are being addressed. We have restored customer service levels in the RX segment and we received the $250 million Tysabri royalty payment. We have an exciting strategic plan that we believe will transform Perrigo back into a growing company with the bright future as we evolve from a healthcare company to a consumer self-care company. ","We note that 2019 will be a transformational year that implements the many major changes I have discussed and which we recognize makes it difficult right now to forecast our business. It is our intention to bring significant priority to the strategy and transformation execution, as well as provide full year 2019 guidance on May 9th. ","One last topic I'd like to cover before I turn the call over to Ron. Two days ago, Perrigo filed the petition within the Irish High Court, because we strongly believe Irish revenues Notice of Assessment was issued in breach of the company's legitimate expectations regarding how it would be treated as a tax payer.","As we noticed in our prior disclosure related to the Irish tax assessment, we strongly disagree with the assessment and believe that it is without merit and incorrect as a matter of law. We also said that the company would pursue all available administrative and judicial avenues that may be necessary or appropriate to challenge this assessment. ","We owe it to our shareholders to take every legitimate step to challenge this assessment and that is why we pursued this action in the Irish court. ","I will not go into the details of this filing other than to say that: First, we believe that Irish revenues assessment conflicts with revenue\u2019s longstanding tax treatment of Elan Pharma, which was carrying on a trade of intellectual property for over 20 years. ","As noted in the judicial review proceedings, we believe that Irish revenue breached Elan Pharma\u2019s legitimate expectations based on that tax history when it wrongly recharacterized Elan Pharma\u2019s trade some 20 years later in the amended assessment.","And second, the judicial review proceeding is a separate process that must be pursued in the Irish court rather than before the Tax Appeals Commission. The appeal before the Tax Appeals Commission has been stayed until the court makes a decision in this judicial review proceeding. If the court finds that Elan Pharma\u2019s legitimate expectation was breached, the court would set aside the entire assessment. ","To be clear, this is a challenge of the process, not the assessment itself. If the court does not agree with our assertion, then we will proceed to challenge the tax assessment on its merit and the Tax Appeals Commission. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Ron Winowiecki to cover more specific financial results for the fourth quarter and year. And while I said that we will not provide full 2019 guidance until our Investor Day meeting, he will give you some rough planning input as you think about your model. Ron?","Ron Winowiecki ","Thank you, Murray. And good afternoon everyone. I'll now walk you through the financial details of our P&L and balance sheet starting on Slide 9. On a consolidated basis reported net sales were approximately $1.2 billion with reported net income of $82 million and reported EPS of $0.60 per share. A few adjustments to the GAAP P&L this quarter are worth noting. First, we recognized a $170 million gain in our P&L resulting from the achievements and receipts of the $250 million to Tysabri royalty payment. ","As a reminder, we as a potential for another milestone receipt of $400 million in the event 2022 Tysabri sales exceed $1.95 billion. In addition, as we continue on our plan of separating the RX business we spent $7.3 million which included a combination of clinical accounting, tax work streams and operational actions to segregate the business. ","GAAP tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax income was 60% in the quarter compared to a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 20%. The difference was due primarily to the tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments and the effect of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets and liabilities consistent with the adjusted pre-tax income.","Now turning the Slide 10. Our consolidated net sales were approximately $1.2 billion, 7% lower than the prior year. Unfavorable foreign currency translation impacted net sales by approximately $18 million in the quarter. On an organic constant currency basis, net sales decreased by approximately 5% due to the following: ","One, RX net sales were down approximately 15% as price erosion and lower volumes impacted the business. RX net sales were slightly above our expectation as we saw year-over-year pricing trends improve in the fourth quarter in our core generic portfolio. ","As we have discussed previously, our inability to supply certain products has resulted in lower volume. However, it is worth noting the team has been focusing on correcting these issues and service levels have improved from the low to mid 80% range in mid 2018 to approximately 90% as we sit here today. New product sales of $22 million partially offset these declines.","Two, net sales in the US animal health business were approximately [58%] lower than the prior year due to the previously disclosed loss of partnered product and channel dynamics. In the fourth quarter, excluding the animal health business on an organic constant currency basis, our worldwide consumer businesses were approximately 1% lower year-over-year. ","And three, we experienced a temporary disruption caused by an equipment startup issue at one of our infant formula facilities. And as Murray stated, this disruption caused net sales i9n the quarter to be lower by approximately $10 million. I will discuss the startup issue in more detail shortly. ","Now turning to Slide 11. Adjusted gross profit was approximately $490 million or $75 million lower than the prior year. CHC Americas adjusted gross profit was more than half of the decline down approximately $44 million compared to the prior year due to the following factors: ","First, lower net sales and unfavorable product mix accounted for approximately $15 million of this variant. Second, our infant formula plan in Ohio had undergone a series of major equipment updates as part of our ongoing investment in capacity to support growth in this business. ","When restarting production in this facility during the fourth quarter, our quality system identified an equipment variation inconsistent with our quality control standards. Accordingly, inclusive of scrap product and lost sales, gross profit was impacted by approximately $13 million or $0.08 per share. We anticipate production to resume early next month. ","Finally, as reported in the third quarter, the CHC Americas business continued to experience lower customer service levels, which led to production inefficiencies and operating variances. These factors combined with higher year-over-year input costs, impacted gross profit by approximately $16 million.","CHC International adjusted gross profit was unfavorably impacted by approximately $9 million in the fourth quarter due to currency translation movements. In the RX segment our adjusted gross profit was down in the quarter due to lower net sales. Adjusted gross margin was approximately 55%, an increase of 160 basis points compared to the prior year driven by the launch of higher margin new products.","Slide 12 outlines the primary operating expense drivers in our businesses. In the fourth quarter, we increased growth investments compared to the prior year on a constant currency basis. In our consumer platforms we prioritized investments to drive long range growth. Specifically in the Consumer International business, planned investments in advertising and R&D were approximately 16.1% as a percentage to net sales compared to 12.5% in the prior year. ","Likewise, RX R&D investments were approximately 8% in net sales as we continued to invest in our strong pipeline. ","Selling and administration expenses benefited from favorable foreign currency translation movements of approximately $6 million, lower compensation accruals in the quarter and continued improvement actions and the cost structure of our Consumer International segment.","Turning to Slide 13. The major financial drivers I just reviewed resulted in a consolidated adjusted operating income of $195 million compared to $253 million in the prior year and a reduction in margin. ","A bit of perspective on margins, our overall consolidated operating margin for the quarter was 16.3%, down approximately 350 basis points compared to the prior year, due primarily to: one, the production issues in CHC Americas negatively impacted that segment\u2019s adjusted operating margin by 400 basis points and consolidated Perrigo adjusted margin by 225 basis points; and two, in CHC International, the intentional investments to drive long-term growth in this business impacted the segment\u2019s adjusted operating margin by 350 basis points and consolidated Perrigo adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points.","These are partially offset by RX where our adjusted operating margin increased year-over-year from 38.1% to 39.2% as we continued to invest in R&D.","Slide 14 illustrates the overall consolidated adjusted operating results for the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate was consistent with our expectations at approximately 20%. Overall adjusted earnings per share was $0.97 right in the middle of the revised guidance range we provided last call. And despite the negative impact of approximately $0.08 per share from the Ohio facility equipment production issue.","Turning now to Slide 15. Our balance sheet and cash flow generation remains strong. Cash flow conversion to adjusted net income was 147% for the quarter, which highlights the powerful cash flow generation of our business model. Of note, the December 31, 2018 balance sheet does not include the $250 million Tysabri royalty payment we received in the first quarter of 2019. ","Our capital allocation decisions are focused on total shareholder returns within the context of our longstanding commitment to an investment grade financial policy. As Murray highlighted, we're looking forward to our upcoming Investor Day where we will outline our strategic plan and our 2019 guidance framework. ","In the interim, we're highlighting a few key business trends headed into 2019. Our consumer businesses continued to grow, led by store brand penetration and a healthy new product pipeline in our Consumer International business. ","And as a reminder, the loss of the partnered product in our animal health business will anniversary mid-year, and will no longer affect year-over-year comparisons starting in Q3 of 2019.","Also, given the current weakness of certain currencies to US dollar, translation exposure is expected to negatively impact 2019 growth in our consumer businesses by approximately 190 basis points as we stand here today. ","From an operating perspective, in our consumer businesses, there are two core macro themes headed into 2019. First, as our service levels in our RX and CHC International business are operating above 90%, our top priority is the resolution of the operating variances and customer service dynamics in the Consumer Americas segment. ","Actions to improve service in this segment are underway and include: one, adding capacity and our capital value stream. And two, important process, technology and structural improvements to drive and sustain operational performance. ","As previously indicated, we are now refocused on regaining the Perrigo advantage with customer service as a key pillar. This is a top priority, while we are making progress, it will take time for these actions to be realized in our financial statement. ","As previously inventory operating variances were rolled through our income statement, in 2019, the inventory is sold in the first half of the year. This means that weakness we saw in the second half of 2018 will depress 2019\u2019s first half results in the form of higher cost of products sold. ","Second, we have already begun our strategic investments in various aspects of our consumer businesses. As evidenced by the planned increase in advertising within the Consumer International segment in the fourth quarter along with build out of capabilities in R&D, innovation and business intelligence, which will also impact first half results. ","We will show specific action to help offset these investments at our Investor Day, but they will come later in the year in the form of cost reduction program. ","Given its operating framework, Consumer adjusted operating margins are expected to be lower in the first half of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 improving as we march through the year. ","Finally, within the RX segment, there are two macro themes to consider. First, from a pricing perspective, we saw signs of stabilization in the fourth quarter. And as I sit here today, we expect 2019 price headwinds in our core products to be consistent with our 2018 year-over-year fourth quarter results. ","And second, expect that we will continue to invest in our pipeline with dollar growth and R&D investments versus 2018. At our Investor Day, we plan to provide more details around each of these trends as we provide 2019 guidance at that time.","As you complete your models another important factor to keep in mind is our continued strong operating cash flow profile. In 2018, our adjusted operating cash flow conversion to adjusted net income once again exceeded 100%. Our teams continue to remain confident in our cash flow generation, which will factor into our framework around capital allocation, that will also be outlined at the May 9 Investor Day. ","Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Murray.","Murray Kessler","Thanks, Ron. So look the key takeaway should be that the business is challenged, we understand that. We know what the issues are. The plans have been approved to fix it. We are aggressively making the necessary changes and the tough decisions to get back on track. Significant change is underway and I am excited and our leadership team is excited to share those plans with you on May 9th, and not just the plans, but real progress against those plans. ","So let's open up the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor. Please go ahead","Louise Chen","Based on the business trends that you gave for 2019, is there still a possibility for growth on a full year basis in 2019? And then in terms of the pushes and pulls on the earnings, can you talk a little bit more about what the big levers are? And then my last question is just as it pertains to the tax issue, what percentage of the challenges that go through the process that you're going through now actually result in something positive for the company? Thank you.","Murray Kessler","Well let's break them up into three. Louise it's a little bit hard to answer the question on growth without you seeing the entire plan which is the whole point of the May 9th Investor Day, because there are -- I keep setting the stage for multiple components. So we obviously believe we're going to be, as Ron said, starting the year a little bit slower because of cost but then as we start to bring up a number of these initiatives, which we will give you a real life example of, there's no way for you to be forecasting them in your trend. So I hate to say it, but you're going to have to wait to see the plan on May 9th. So I tried to give you a little bit of a new piece of information that I haven't seen people talking about much which is, that we understand there is dilution from the separation, we understand that there are investments and that -- so that's why you heard us talking about there will be a cost component to this initiative as well, which again is difficult for you to model. But you're going to see some major, major change coming in here May and I think and hope that you will be very excited about where we're going when you see it. ","And I don't know if you want to add anything to it Ron, because I'm not going to put any percentages against the loss?","Operator","Next question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. ","Christopher Schott ","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. The first one I just had is on the CHC International business. If I'm hearing the comments correctly, is this a business that's largely structured how you'd like at this point, so just may be more focused on the Americas side or is there also a significant opportunity on the international side of the business to improve performance and structure, et cetera? That's the first one. The second one is just, turning my hands around with this pending tax liability and you got a very strong view this is something you will prevail ultimately, but how does that pending liability impact your capital deployment priorities and how you think about putting capital to work as you look to reposition the consumer business while you're waiting for some of the organic kind of initiatives to take hold? Thanks very much.","Murray Kessler","Sure. So on the first issue on the CHCI business, the International business, we outlined a little bit that there's been major restructuring. I think in 2018 alone, there were $55 million of purposely discontinued products. That\u2019s the number really.","So, you have to look at that growth within the context of what they've been doing, consolidating markets, they have discontinued thousands of SKUs that were non-profitable, and that's how you're seeing the margin enhancement along with significant organizational changes. They are most of the way through, so you should start seeing the top-line growth that's underlying one of the core business to show itself in 2019, and I think there are plenty of opportunities and they have a very robust new product pipeline they've been working at. ","Having said all that, International, it has plenty of opportunities, it's not the issue facing like company and it's not in my mind what unlocked significant value for our investors. Right now getting the Americas business right, getting service levels, getting that new product engine going again, revisiting and when it makes sense bolt-on acquisitions and doing all the things that made Perrigo great before it, started focus being distracted internationally and with a number of other things we did is the top priority for this company to create value. So job number one is the Americas. And as it relates to -- give me the second question?","Christopher Schott ","[Indiscernible] How does that impact the capital allocation? ","Murray Kessler","As it relates to our capital allocation plans, that was like one of the first questions that I asked and it's a good question because I wanted to make sure that it wasn't going to inhibit any of our ability to do what we need to do and the answer is for the most part it doesn't. Could it influence the way we allocate capital being a little more conservative to shifting some money towards paying down debt for shares versus dividends et cetera we\u2019ll outline all of that in May 9th as well. So we want to make sure that we remove uncertainly, as you invest in us, you don't have to be worried about that and I've had to deal with that for over a decade in the previous industry I was in but it does not get in the way of doing what we want to do. And you know what I think you think about our capital structure, our balance sheet everything, you should be thinking that we have our eyes clearly set on being a top performing CPG consumer-based company with our evolution from healthcare to self-care. And that means we want to stack up well on all of the benchmarks relative to other top performing consumer companies.","Operator"," The next question comes from Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Randall Stanicky","Hey, how you\u2019re doing? So there's been some, I think understandable investor pushback on the differentiation of the new strategy going forward moving the self-care and when we look at the current CHCA business that the new product sales continue to attract under that $50 million level obviously the pressure that you've called that on the core business. So question number one, can you just give some concrete examples in terms of things that you can do to drive the growth higher? Is this going to be a largely a bolt-on strategy or there's things you can do with the core business? And then the second question is, are we going to get an RX announcement on May 9th, and is there a scenario where you guys step back and say, hey, the math or the demand for this asset isn't there, we're going to separate on the platform, but maybe we'll hold on to it for some period longer until things look different? Thanks. ","Murray Kessler","Well as I sit here right now we are full steam ahead on the RX separation and we hope to be able to present very clear plans and believe we're on track to do that. I mean I'm ever going to sit here and make an ultimatum and say nothing could adjust our plans but I don't see it right now. When you talk about the consumer side of the business, that will be a major, major, major portion of May 9th. But if I had to give you an example, and by the way, my answer is it can come from bolt-ons, it can come from innovation on core business, it can come from share building and it all relates to the consumer understanding of how people buy our products and what our relative shares are in different categories. So let's see nicotine cessation as an example, that's the category where we\u2019re the market leader by far, much bigger than the national brand. If you're in that position, that means you need to be the one that's doing a lot of innovation. And you may look at that and say, well, in order to do that, you have to go through FDA long slow processes in that particular category. That's not true. If, there's nothing that stops us from innovating on, forms, packaging, flavors, and alike to drive that business and grow that category, segment itself. ","As I sit here coming from the industry I came in, we in the company at Perrigo I think we've done a good job and but it's tiny compared to what's going on in the world of, let's give an example of how explosive vapor products have been to switch consumers from smoking to vapor. So, the total tobacco industry starts at $100 billion and we're a tiny fraction of that. ","So to me, just sort of treading water the way we are, isn't good enough and innovation needs to ramp up with new forms and new ways to satisfy smokers. Pretty much all of them want to quit. So, that would be an example of an area we push for innovation and I think that one, because we've already gone to market with a couple SKUs this year that are not offered by the national brands.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","David Risinger","I have a couple questions Murray. First, with respect to reinvestment requirement in order to enhance growth, could you just maybe help us with order of magnitude of thinking about the income statement, so are the greatest reinvested requirement in SG&A or in R&D or in cost of goods sold in order to position the company to grow better in the future? Second, with respect to guidance on May 9th, should we assume that, that will be excluding generics, I know that you are thinking of an operating Perrigo now as a consumer company. So I'm just wondering about that? And then with respect to the purposely discontinued hit to Consumer Healthcare International in 2018, could you just mention that number again? And then how much will that dollar hit be in '19? Thanks very much. ","Murray Kessler","Ron, you do the last one.","Ron Winowiecki","You bet. So if you look at our 10-K that will be issued you can look back David on to answer this question. Roughly $35 million of discontinued exited businesses and around $20 million of discontinued products for the total $55 million is the right number. And as Murray referenced that anchor 2018 as we go forward not giving guidance are largely behind us relative to the exiting and discontinuing the portfolio and improving our focused brand strategy. That's largely done through 2018.","Murray Kessler","Yes, it's a pretty small number and by the way those numbers are -- and we'll outline all of this on May 9th, what's happened over the last three or four years, because I don't think we've told that story very much so far. But I mean, what Svend and the team in International have done, they've done a masterful job of cleaning up this portfolio and getting their hands around a very complex and diversified portfolio with a lot of things that didn't make sense in certain markets and didn't make sense.","So you'll see how he is pruned product lines, how he's pruned countries, how he has consolidated markets, how he has changed tone, all of that will become very apparent, but it will not be the same drag that it's been over the past couple of years. ","As it relates to guidance with or without RX, we hope to provide you -- I mean depends on the progresses but we would like to be able to provide you without and show you the impact and where we are, that's what we're working towards but we'll see how it ultimately progresses. But I don't -- I need you to get a good understanding of what remainco, the core business looks like going forward and by the way that's how I'm going to be incenting the management team and leadership team going forward of driving those consumer businesses going forward. ","As it relates to the level of investment, there's a number of things, there are some investments that are related to some new products that will spell those kinds of things out but some of them are on longer term plans, et cetera. ","I said on the last conference call that we had about the right level of R&D in total and about the right level of advertising on in general on our core businesses in total. My concern on the R&D business right now is not that there isn't sufficient money, it's the productivity of the initiatives. If you look at a few years ago and again we'll show you all of these, we were getting bigger hits for our new product development program and higher productivity than we're getting today. We're working on just as many approvals, but we strategically have to identify the right and bigger ideas and that's why I brought in Jim Dillard and consolidated R&D in the last month who is a pro who I -- and you'll love them when you meet him. He's a very aggressive guy and I think, within a very short period of time, you're going to see that, that new product program ramp up pretty aggressively.","Operator","The next question comes from David Maris with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ","David Maris ","Good evening. Just maybe Murray, if you could explain to us what between now and May you need to complete in order to unveil the plan? I know you mentioned a few large hires, I would imagine you have to bring those across the line and then you need to go to King & Co to print up all the presentations. But other than that, what are you still working on between now and then?","Murray Kessler","I think you'll be surprised how much you see on May 9th, David, and I'll remind you of this question on that day. I think you're going to see a lot more activity than you're expecting to see. And I would like to not just talk about promises for the future. I would like to bring you action.","David Maris ","I appreciate that. I'm just trying to understand what's left to do, what you've put in, have you finalized the plans already or where are you in assessing the situation and putting in place the plan?","Murray Kessler","We are through the strategic planning process. And so that the sort of a blueprint, right, you want to build a jet plane, you don't start with a jet engine, you have to have the entire plan. And now all the pieces are in a very aggressive plan are being put together and work through on various themes. And I don't really want to be more specific than that. It's a few months away and you'll get to see the whole plan. And I think you'll see a lot of action when you come in May.","Operator","The next question comes from Ami Fadia with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.","Ami Fadia ","Hi, good evening. Thanks for the question. You talked about a couple of headwinds across the business in 2019. Can you quantify that for maybe at the EPS level? And it sounds like you're saying that you may come up with initiatives to do R&D differently or focus of change the prioritization. So can you confirm that you think that the total spending level is unlikely to change meaningfully from wherever it is at right now? And with regards to the Irish tax rate","appeal process, could you give us a sense of the timelines around how long it would take for the judiciary process to complete and if they rule favorably then do you win the appeal, and then what is the next step beyond that? Thank you.","Ron Winowiecki","Thanks, Ami. This is Ron, I'll start with the answer to your first couple of questions and come back on the tax side. So first of all you asked about headwinds and quantifying those at the EPS level, I tried to give you some good numbers within my commentary, only kind of break it down for you. So first of all, CHC Americas, let\u2019s focus on that segment, so we talked about gross margin effects, there's two items, forget mix, because that doesn\u2019t flow. But the two items are highlighted pretty detailed, was one the Ohio issue, facility issue. We talked about $13 million impact in Q4. I also mentioned in my comments production starts in March, so what we\u2019ll have here some overhangs, I\u2019m not going to give you the dollar amount but you're going to have some overhang as that facility was down for two months, you get it back into production, you recognize the sales, certainly have some overhang in the first half of the year as that converts into production and sales in the first half of 2019. ","The other one is I think I rather quantified and that was the one around service and production variances. I gave you a number of $16 million. That's a pretty firm number. In other words we have to work through now in Q1 and Q2 of 2019 as we've experienced those, if you will look at the accounting part it goes to your balance sheet, it turns with sales, but you can expect margin on CHC Americas to be in the zone that you saw in Q4 working its way back up to that 20% level as we exit the year. So we've been pretty open about that, it's going to take some time for those service dynamics to manifest themselves and benefit the P&L as we resolve the issues and sell the product that we've already produced. ","You asked about R&D in a general context, we look at R&D, I'll reiterate Murray's comments which I thought was a good one, we'll see R&D as a percent of sales changing materially in the consumer businesses, we look at productivity. In other words if you look at the percentage of sales you may see a little bit of shift as a percent of sales in consumer. The real focus will be how do we get better value, margin value per R&D dollar on a go forward basis is really the key focus of the team. So you have some percent of sales increase but it won't be material. ","I did highlight in RX, R&D in RX will be upon a dollar basis, I didn't guide you on a percentage, but assume we take RX dollars in 2018, we are expecting with our strong pipeline to continue investing in that pipeline next year as well. So all that carries forward some color, I should comment and also on CHC International playoff your -- first got your earlier question, listen we're confident high teens margins in this business, I\u2019m assured very clear CHC International we are pointed at those high teens.","Now we\u2019ve been messaging for some time we are reinvesting back in the business, now we don't think we're going to go backwards at Ohio margins but you could see us pause, you could see us flatten out for years, we reinvest in business, we invest in advertising and promotion next year and alike but we're still confident in the next couple of years we are pointed at the high-teen adjusted operating margin percent. So hopefully that gives you Ami the answers to your questions on a go forward look. ","On the tech side, I'll refer you to steer back to Murray on that. ","Murray Kessler","Yes. Just to add and by the way that\u2019s sort of like the ongoing level coming in, has nothing to do with any initiatives that we do going toward. So Ami there are initiatives that will take some investment. We've been very open about that we spent $50 million to buy NASONEX and that product has to be now be bought to market and there's marketing and kinds of investments that go along with that but on -- it's not more R&D dollars that we will be throwing in there. We are making investments in capacity, we are making investments in technology. We will show you why and were on May 9th.","As it relates to the timing of the judicial challenge, the full process has been a surprise so far. But if it wasn't, it wouldn't surprise us of that first round, took around a year, could be longer, could be shorter, if it went through kind of a normal process, which we'll find out, if it does. So -- and then depending on how it goes either side would have the ability to appeal that. And then if all of that didn't come out in our favor, and we hope that it does, then it starts over again in the tax appellate process. So it's going to be a while.","Operator","The next question comes from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Elliot Wilbur","Just want to follow-up on some of the commentary around these service issues in the consumer side. And Ron appreciate the detail you've provided there in terms of the actual impact. But just trying to understanding, is this more of an op income earnings issue or is this more of just an actual cash issue? And when you do have this service issues, I mean what actually happens in terms of, from a customer side. Is it just that you're not able to book sales and there's a risk of losing business to another supplier or do you actually have some sort of performance penalties like you have on the RX side? And just a couple follow-up questions here on the RX business. Ron, you mentioned that price erosion in 2019 probably will be similar to 4Q. What was the rate in 4Q? And could you give us a little bit of insight into some of the key expected launches or re-launches in '19 including albuterol HFA. And maybe more importantly to scopolamine? Thanks.","Murray Kessler","Yes. Let me just do around the first part -- any -- just the rest of the questions. As it relates to the effect of service on customers, the big customer services issue which was a one-time start-up has a meaningful effect, you lose revenues, but we're fortunate that there's not a lot of competition in that particular business. On the ongoing services of course it\u2019s effective. I mean part of your ability to withstand pricing pressure and everything else is your ability to both innovate and service at a higher level than anybody else. ","So when you don't increase more competition, that has to be this company or this division\u2019s top priority to fix that and it is. So I mean, you felt that and you see is as that the businesses are pressured somewhat due to that. So all of these plans are designed to fix that. But in general the business despite that has held up pretty well, still growing when exclude animal health.","Ron Winowiecki","Yes. In that kind of elaborate on that as well Elliot. If you think of a cash effect, you see inventories increase in CHC Americas this last year. You'll see that in our balance sheet and so we've serviced the cash part of it. We don't see inventories increasing next year. And in my comments I commented we are putting capital into our capital value streaming. We have one high class problem here, net volumes are up. We just have not caught up with the volume spike and servicing our customers. So you will see some cash from a capital standpoint come in over the next six to 12 months as well. ","You come back with RX let me give you some details that you've asked for. So you asked about pricing, we did not call pricing, just assume those in high-single-digits on our core products. We talked about Q3 was above that, right north of 10. So again, we saw some stability, I'd like to have to say no erosion, but we're still seeing erosion at a more stabilized level. ","You asked about launches going in the next year. Listen right now, you saw one come out acyclovir was an announcement we made most recently, the nice thing I'll call it a doubles, single doubles that you'll see in our portfolio launch next year. ProAir we are still optimistic and we take a look at that product, we're working very closely with the FDA. We're committed to being a bringing a very important product in the marketplace and we're optimistic so the launch that product in the I\u2019ll call it in very near future. But again we have announced the launch and we will keep the market updated as we move forward with that important launch as well. ","Elliot Wilbur","Scopolamine?","Ron Winowiecki","Scopolamine, still working with the FDA. Similar dynamics. Again we're optimistic. That's a little different product. There's a little different issues. We took it off the market. It's a patch. It is complicated relative to I will it called dissolution curves. We have to work with the FDA in a very complicated product -- partnership products. So it's a little bit different but still we are confident. Again as far as timing, it may not have the same timing as ProAir in 2019. ProAir is likely to come earlier than scopolamine to take away there.","Operator","The next question comes from Greg Gilbert with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead. ","Greg Gilbert","I have just a two parted. Murray year said you wouldn't comment on the progress of the RX sales process. But can you comment on whether Perrigo is also considering strategic options for other parts of the company or the entire company? That's number one. And number two, I suspect will learn a lot more about what self-care means to you guys on May 9th but are you willing to include things in that definition that are not proven to work by FDA standards or things that may not have high barriers to entry from a regulatory standpoint? Just trying to understand how much you would relax the sort of historical Perrigo lens of FDA regulated sort of higher barrier regulatory types of products that would be launched in the future? So any sneak preview on your thinking on that would be helpful? Thanks.","Murray Kessler","Okay. On the self-care issue, I'm not sure I would call it relax, because in any product we would launch, we would want to have a unique selling proposition and a highly differentiated product. It may not be a strict FDA and it won't be and we do that all the time. We have products, 40% of our volume internationally is branded products. That number of those are in self-care categories that present opportunities here in the United States as an example and the company has a good track record of expanding. So there is a two part answer because the first part was some of the expansions we've done have been in the areas where there are good barriers to it like infant nutrition or in nicotine cessation. Although one could argue other companies could get into that but we've done it so well with our overall store brand model which is hard to match up again. So there are plenty of opportunities for growth and companies do that all the time. And we will show you how we've done in the past, how we will do it in the future at various levels from incremental opportunities that help just keep the brands fresh and make it harder for competitors to sort of know where we're going next all the way to bigger incremental opportunities to potential bolt-ons that have the kind of barriers that you're talking about. ","So we'll give you -- I'll tell you that one of the biggest changes I've had from my old job to the new job is just how many opportunities there are. And it's sorting through finding and making sure we're investing in the right ones but there's no shortage of opportunities for growth. It's just doing it the right way and getting to the market with them. ","Refresh my memory on the first question. ","Greg Gilbert","Strategic options for any other parts of the business?","Murray Kessler","Not the business in total or some massive thing but I'm looking at the entire portfolio and whether it belongs and whether it fits the consumer self-care lens. So, of course, whether that's under the timing of May 9th, we\u2019ll see. But yes, no, we're taking look at the whole company, not the whole company, let\u2019s say, pieces within the whole company. ","Operator","The next question comes from Patrick Trucchio with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Patrick Trucchio ","Thanks. Good evening. So understanding and look many more specifics regarding initiatives in May, can you tell us which metrics you believe are most relevant to compare Perrigo to consumer packaged goods peers, are there metrics where you think you\u2019re currently comparing well, where do you see the opportunity to improve? And then if I may, just on the international business, can you discus how you're evaluating which brands, which countries should get the increased investment in advertising and R&D? How are you evaluating return on those investments and just with regard to the R&D specifically, is the investment focused on improving existing products, or introducing new products? Thanks.","Murray Kessler","I mean, on international the answer is that they're doing all the traditional metrics that you would expect, right? So when they go through a very traditional -- they're more of a traditional consumer company than we are here in US, which is more of a store brand business. So that means everything from the quantification of the idea to when they're going to do any kind of advertising, they test the advertising in various research services, they have action standards at each of those. That advertising has to hit, they have action standards on product testing, the product once it goes into the market they measure those and they adjust and they look at the returns they're getting and if the returns in market aren't generating the kind of returns and metrics that pay out that advertising then they shift it elsewhere to somewhere that does. ","They have a priority list of -- this is a very big portfolio of brands and they have split the way they look at the business and sort of their core growth brands, their exit brands, which we already talked about and their sustained that brands and they are -- and again, we'll walk through all of that, but they put the most investment in the ones that meet the criteria to get into that growth category. So -- and markets that may go down and they look at profitability by SKU and all the metrics that you would expect. ","I'm not sure how to answer the consumer company. We will look at top quartile performance. We want to get to be a top quartile performer. That means we're going to measure and target revenue growth, EPS growth, margin, leverage, all the typical balance sheet metrics that you would look at and that's what we'll be working against over the next couple of years. And then hopefully get the multiples that those consumer companies earn, which is part of the idea here.","Bradley Joseph ","We'll take one more question please. ","Operator","Your next question comes from David Steinberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Steinberg ","Yes. Thanks very much, I have three questions. The first one is another one on the Irish tax liability. I want to focus on best case, worst case scenario, so obviously best case is you don't have to pay any money, although you don't know the timing. But in terms of the worst case, if in fact, you\u2019ve determined, however remote the possibility that you do have to pay, an Irish tax expert told us there will be an 8% annual interest charge and I think it was five years ago the transaction happened and then there'll be a penalty on top of that anywhere from 3% to 100%, with 3% being what they call a general penalty and a 100% where there's deliberate willful behavior. So is the calculation of worst case somewhere between no matter how remote it could be $2.3 million and $3.9 million? Does that make sense? Second question -- sorry $1 billion. Second question is a tuck-in, I think Murray, you said, you want to get back to it, made the company great i.e. tuck-ins. How does the outlook appear? Are you close on anything? Are you looking mostly domestically or internationally, private, public and how are valuations shaping up right now? And then thirdly, just to clarify on the input costs you discussed. Is this -- relate to a lot of companies you are seeing now is rising input costs and why is it just a short-term situation versus a longer term impact? Thanks.","Murray Kessler","Now, I'm going to let, Ron, do the first part, do the input costs. But -- and on the first one, I'm just not going to speculate. I mean, it makes no sense. And this company -- if you look at this, read the challenge, to sit there and have a discussion of willful fraud or something like that is silly. But beyond that, we believe, we went on the merits. We believe that, when you look at the actual legitimate expectations that Elan Pharma had based on 20 years of trading history that this is unjust and we'll see how it plays out. But we have good advisors, a good team working on this and you're going to have to watch it. ","What you need to hear from me is answering the question that was very early on in the call here, which is that this will not get in our way of our ability to go forward and do the strategic initiatives that we need to get Perrigo growing. And this will play out over the course of years and we will keep you informed. But I'm quite confident and have built a lot of value whether it was a UST, which had a massive -- and I trust overhang on it or on Lorillard that had massive regulatory challenges that were going on, on that business.","So the key and my experience with those as we fight them very aggressively and a fight on the behalf of our shareholders especially when you believe you're right, and we do believe we're right. And then make sure that you're building the business. So top priority, top focus is build the business, that's what's going to create value here. ","On the tuck-in, I mean my answer is almost like yes. It's are we looking at all kinds of things and going through a funnel here and all that we will put, we will scrutinize and make sure that we are making good investments. But there are many opportunities and we will bring clarity to that on May 9th. And I can hear the frustration by a lot of you that you're looking for more answers right now it's not that far. In a couple months here we will be back to you with the full plan.","Ron Winowiecki","To answer briefly then, David, the input cost, if you step back and take a look at it. First of all, we have incredible advantages, we have scale, we have purchasing power. We think we've appropriately identified and quantified what those input costs are, you heard our comments today. We also partner for our customers. What does that mean from a channel standpoint? These are industry issues. What makes sense from a partner perspective? I would say probably the biggest disappointment from my chair, traditionally we are very, very good at offsetting input costs with productivity and because some of the supply chain issues we've had at customer service and some of that complexity, we have been able to do that. So to my mind that's the reason I look at these in short-term. And we get that supply chain back to the Perrigo advantage that we can continue the productivity curve that we've been very successful at historically. We can offset these input costs in a productive way. That's the core focus that we have as a company to ensure that we offset these input costs appropriately. ","Murray Kessler","So I think we're done with questions. For now, we appreciate your interest in Perrigo. I can't wait to see you all on May 9th. We hope to answer all your questions in great detail and for you to walk away as excited about the opportunities for the company as I am. So thank you again.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"17008":["Perrigo Co.

My name is Darla, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Perrigo calendar year 2016 third quarter earnings results conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Joseph, Vice President, Global Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you. Good morning and welcome, everyone, to Perrigo's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. I hope you all had a chance to review the press releases we issued this morning. Copies of the releases are available on our website, as is the slide presentation for this call. Joining me for today's call are John Hendrickson, Perrigo's Chief Executive Officer, and Judy Brown, Perrigo's Executive Vice President, Business Operations and Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, participants will make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for investors and shareholders and Safe Harbor language regarding these statements in our press releases issued this morning. In addition, in the appendix for today's presentation, we have provided reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures presented.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to John Hendrickson.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Brad, and welcome, everyone, to Perrigo's third quarter 2016 conference call.","We have a lot to cover today. First, I want to provide a comprehensive progress update on the strategic and operational action plan that I outlined during our last earnings call. We've made a lot of progress but there's still much work to be done. Then Judy will walk through the financial results for the quarter, and I will end with a final comment before our Q&A session.","Turning to slide 4, at the outset I want to reinforce the team's strong belief in Perrigo's strategy to providing quality affordable healthcare products to customers and consumers around the world. In fact, we believe it is vital to our current global healthcare environment. Macro trends for our business are strong, and Perrigo is in a unique position to capitalize on those trends.","Regardless of the political or economic climate, global consumers, customers, and insurers alike continue to search for effective healthcare products that provide value. And Perrigo remains a leader in providing both effective products and great value to both consumers in front and behind the pharmacy counter. In fact, every second of every day, nearly 2,200 people around the globe use a Perrigo product, and our products save consumers more than $7.5 billion every year. This is a great place to operate.","Turning to slide 5, foremost I want to begin by saying that we had a solid quarter in line with expectations, which I'm pleased to share with you. Good top line growth in our Consumer Healthcare segment was led by a U.S. Consumer Healthcare adjusted net sales increase of 4% despite a slower allergy season. In addition, this team continues to drive strong adjusted operating margins at 20% in the quarter. And our Rx business performance was in line with our expectations. Importantly, the cash generation of the business model continues to be strong, with $304 million generated in the quarter.","This quarter we also made great progress against a number of our actions to focus and improve our business, and I know you're all interested in hearing about that. With assistance from a leading consulting firm, we continue to make substantial progress against these initiatives to maximize shareholder value. Let me give you some of the highlights here, and then I will dive deeper into them on the slides that follow.","First, corporate governance, I'm excited that we added two new board members with great relevant experience and long track records of creating value. Their unique expertise and skill sets will also support our ongoing portfolio review that I will address next.","Second, we conducted a portfolio review to optimize our business offerings. As announced in April, we have been thoroughly assessing our portfolio through a comprehensive strategic, operational, and financial review of all of our businesses. As I've said, we will not leave any stone unturned. With that in mind, this slide outlines the items we've completed or initiated to date. The board and management believe the next step to unlock shareholder value is today's announcement that we are exploring strategic alternatives for the Tysabri royalty stream. We continue to evaluate all businesses, including the market position and growth opportunities for our U.S. Rx business, which I will also discuss further.","Third, improved performance in BCH; we've taken a number of actions this quarter, leveraging core strengths in Consumer Healthcare, to address a number of challenges, with the goal of enhancing margins. I will discuss in more detail specific market dynamics and actions in the slides that follow.","Fourth, we will focus our efforts to optimize organizational effectiveness. A core strength of Perrigo is to build effective operating systems and organizational structures to deliver performance. A key component of our future success is to match cost structures with existing and future expected market dynamics. We are conducting a review of our optimal cost structure going forward to achieve our business objectives.","And finally, we'll continue to work hard every day for our customers and consumers. I have continued to assert that we have fundamentally sound and attractive businesses and with unique competitive advantages. Despite their challenges, both our CHC and Rx segments continue to deliver strong operating margins.","Now let me dive a little bit further into each of these. Turning to slide 6, this morning we announced that our board appointed two new directors, Geoff Parker, who has already joined the board, and Ted Samuels, who will begin his service on January 4, 2017. Geoff brings a wealth of financial expertise, while Ted brings a significant investor perspective. As you can see on this slide, their experience is directly relevant to our current strategy and ongoing initiatives.","Additionally, two of our current board members, Michael Jandernoa and Gary Kunkle, have elected to not stand for reelection. While they will continue to serve as directors until our next AGM, I would like to thank both Mike and Gary for their long-term service and commitment to Perrigo. We continue to work with a nationally recognized search firm to identify other potential independent directors who possess significant experience and successful track records of delivering shareholder value.","Turning to slide 7, a key outcome of our ongoing portfolio review is today's announcement that we would explore alternatives for the Tysabri royalty stream. As you know, Tysabri dramatically improves the quality of life for patients with MS, and financially it provides a stable and predictable cash flow. After careful consideration, the board and management believe that now is the right time to explore a review of strategic alternatives for Tysabri to potentially monetize the value of this attractive asset, which we believe would enable us to derisk, delever, and continue to focus on Perrigo's core strengths.","In our portfolio review, we are weighing the benefits of divesting or finding alternatives for assets alongside our commitment to maintain an investment-grade rating. Any proceeds from a potential Tysabri sale would be prioritized with this comment in mind, as retaining our investment-grade status is a cornerstone to our capital structure philosophy.","Turning to slide 8, as we all know, the Rx space has been very dynamic over the last year, month, week, however you want to look at it. I have had many conversations with investors over the last few months about the future of our Rx business. And we continue to evaluate the business's market dynamics, portfolio strategies, and long-range growth opportunities in order to generate the best value.","Our strategic review of this segment requires an in-depth comprehensive evaluation of the interdependencies within our business. Such areas as manufacturing, shared service functions, and tax are more complicated and deserve thoughtful consideration. The Perrigo board has formed a special subcommittee with me on our Rx business to evaluate all of these aspects and determine the best path to optimize shareholder value with this segment. We expect to complete this review in the first quarter of 2017.","On to slide 9, now I want to discuss our Branded Consumer Healthcare business. As you may have seen this morning, first we announced a non-cash impairment charge in our BCH segment. Second, Perrigo's Board of Directors has authorized the company to initiate a claim in arbitration against the sellers of Omega Pharma Invest NV, which we plan to do before the end of this year. As you would expect, while you may have questions in this regard, it is our policy to not comment on legal matters, so we will not provide further detail at this time.","Despite the impairment, which Judy will discuss in detail, I continue to believe in the long-term power of this business along with its core platforms and competencies. Across the European continent, there are a number of tailwinds that are encouraging for the long-term outlook in this business. OTC market growth remains healthy at approximately 2% to 3% per year, and consumer demographics and dynamics continue to trend favorably, driving increased use of OTC products.","We have been actively engaged in Europe over the past six months to build out our leadership team, enhance processes, and develop organizational effectiveness needed to improve the performance of the BCH segment.","Our long-term objectives for this business are: first, we are committed to bring in the BCH business to CHC-level profitability. We are currently in the process of overlaying the CHC operational philosophies, experience, and expertise to enhance BCH performance. Second, we are a top-5 European OTC business with scale and reach into multiple channels and in multiple markets. Our goal is to remain a top player within the Europe infrastructure. Finally, we believe that this business can attain at or above-market growth in the long term. We continue to prioritize brand strategies in core markets, which should enable more predictable financial results.","Many of the individual markets in which we operate are performing well, like the UK, Spain, the Netherlands, and the Nordics, and we remain optimistic about the potential of the BCH business given all these factors. That said, there is still much work to be done to achieve these objectives.","Turning to slide 10 and continuing with the BCH business, the European OTC market has different channels to the consumer. For instance, approximately 1\/3 of our business is in the wholesale pharmacy channel, and we are particularly focused on the inventory management systems in those countries employing this model. Order patterns of products we sell into the wholesale pharmacy channels are not always aligned with sell-out patterns to pharmacies, as the wholesalers act as a conduit, which could build inventory inefficiency, something we are systematically addressing.","With our strength, opportunities, and challenges in mind, we have a series of actions to focus on countries and products where we have the ability to win in the marketplace. The action plan comprises four key initiatives which are underway. One, the success of an organization starts with leadership. The countries where we perform well have effective, efficient, great leaders who are able to quickly adapt to changing market dynamics. We have added four new country leaders to expand our expertise and add fresh perspectives on our go-to-market strategies in countries that are not meeting expectations. I am confident that we have the right people in place for these countries.","Two, we are prioritizing certain geographies and brand strategies across the portfolio, aligning investments with our ability to win by product and by market. This means identifying the geographies and opportunities that have the capability to provide high returns on investment and making plans to either divest or partner with others who can better manage commercial sales efforts, in particular countries where there is no clear path.","Currently, there are four challenging countries we are focused on. In Belgium and Italy, we are focused on inventory channel inefficiencies. In Germany, we are focused on working to achieve greater scale. And in France, we are making strategic investments in innovation to diversify our product concentration from seasonal lifestyle products.","Three, we are taking steps to be more efficient and align costs with revenues. We are continuing to integrate the BCH infrastructure onto our Irish platform and overlay CHC operational philosophies, experience, and expertise to enhance the margin profile while incentivizing the business team to focus on margin growth.","Fourth, new products are the lifeline of a growing consumer company, and we are no different. For us to be successful in the long term, we need to increase investments in innovation to bring more novel products to market. As an example, we have had great success with our new multi-symptom formula, Bronchostop, which has achieved the number one position in the UK. This product is currently being launched in other attractive markets.","While they will take time to fully materialize, I am confident that these four specific actions will improve profitability. I see a path to CHC-level operating margins for the business, and I'm committed to taking steps to improve this important business.","Turning to slide 11, we continue to maximize the global infrastructure we have in place, and I'm pleased to note that last year's announced consolidation of our global supply chain activities in Ireland is generating a run rate benefit of approximately $40 million in net income, a nice job by the team to hit this target. We will continue to focus our efforts to optimize organizational effectiveness. As discussed last quarter, we're making good progress towards our goal of realizing an additional $40 million in the Branded Consumer Healthcare supply chain savings, which we expect to achieve over the next two years.","Let me reiterate. One of our core strengths is building effective operating systems and organizational structures to deliver performance results. Our future success relies on matching cost structures with existing and future expected market dynamics. To this end, we are conducting even a more comprehensive review of our overall cost structure going forward to achieve our business objectives. We expect this study to conclude in the first quarter of 2017.","As you can see in slide 12, the store-brand OTC category continues to grow, despite significant national brand product launches that are experiencing a period of exclusivity as well as the return of a prominent national brand. I would like to briefly highlight two store-brand categories on this slide. First, the smoking cessation category continues to grow share, despite the return of a prominent national brand competitor. And second, the infant formula category continues to drive significant store-brand share gains as a result of key investments in infrastructure and marketing programs. I'd especially on this call like to recognize the infant formula team, as our store brand penetration for infant formula is now over 14%.","You can see also on this slide that our strong market position in OTC healthcare continues to be driven by favorable market dynamics. The store-brand proposition continues to resonate well, as consumers look for ways to save money without compromising quality or effectiveness.","One favorable dynamic that I want to highlight is the continued importance of the Rx-to-OTC switches, which can be seen on slide 13. Notably, we believe there are more than $19 billion of potential Rx-to-OTC switch opportunities that Perrigo is well positioned to capitalize on. Given the current backdrop of the healthcare industry, it is reasonable to expect that consumers, insurers, and government programs will continue to seek more affordable healthcare options. Switching prescription products to over-the-counter is a simple way to take cost out of the system and one that we continue to see as a core element of our CHC business.","While I will not touch on all of these categories, we've already seen some of these categories expand, and we believe others have room to grow. Over the past few years, we've seen brands in the nasal category move to over-the-counter: Nasacort, Flonase, Rhinocort. This is typically how we see categories expand. Once one product in a category switches, others will follow. Given this dynamic, I'd like to highlight the recent FDA approval of an acne product to move over-the-counter. We believe this could be a catalyst for other products in the acne category to move OTC, and this is a category where Perrigo already has a strong presence.","As we look over the next three years, we see promising opportunities within our new product pipeline. You can see that recent switches from some of the categories we just discussed will be playing a significant role in our new product sales going forward. With a pipeline representing more than $1 billion in brand sales over the next three years, we are well positioned to leverage industry tailwinds in our OTC business.","Looking at slide 15, updates we implemented in the Rx forecasting process last quarter proved beneficial this quarter, as it achieved its internal forecast. As you can see here, our Rx business is a leader in the extended topical space. The business has grown from its infancy just over 10 years ago to a leader in the space today. We continue to execute against our strategy for the segment, focusing on tougher to manufacture products with higher barriers to entry.","Obviously, price erosion is still a large concern industrywide. However, during the second half of the year, pricing remains in line with our expectations. The segment remains in a leading market position, and we continue to invest in our pipeline. Adjusted operating margins remain attractive. As I discussed earlier, we continue to assess the business and its role with Perrigo going forward.","Turning to slide 16, we continue to anticipate new product launches of approximately $300 million in 2016. This represents growth of approximately 5% over reported net sales in calendar 2015. As a reminder, this year we have already launched store-brand versions of Flonase, Nasacort, and three of the guaifenesin family of products.","With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Judy, who will walk you through the third quarter results. Judy?","Judy L. Brown - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, John.","As you can see on slide 18, reported net sales for the quarter were $1.4 billion, and reported net loss was $1.3 billion compared to net income of $113 million in the prior year. Non-GAAP adjustments to the reported numbers include add-backs of items such as impairment charges, restructuring charges, and acquisition and integration-related items, including the amortization of acquired intangible assets. As outlined in our press release this morning, in the third quarter we realized an impairment for indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets and goodwill related to our BCH business of $1.7 billion. I will provide more details on this charge in a few moments.","On slide 19, you can see third quarter adjusted consolidated net sales were $1.3 billion, an increase of $29 million or 3% year over year on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, these numbers exclude from both periods sales from held-for-sale businesses, including the API business, a European sports brand, and the U.S. VMS business, the sale of which was completed on August 5. Growth in the quarter was driven by higher adjusted net sales in the U.S. OTC business and the infant nutrition category within our CHC segment, as well as higher sales in the Rx segment related to product acquisitions and new product sales. For the quarter, consolidated new product sales of $79 million were offset in part by $10 million of discontinued products.","Looking at the segment results on slide 20, CHC adjusted net sales in the quarter increased approximately $14 million year over year or 3% on a constant currency basis. Our U.S. Consumer business grew nearly 4% in the quarter, largely attributable to continued strong performance in the infant nutrition and smoking cessation categories, and new product sales of $33 million, driven primarily by the store-brand launches of fluticasone and three products in the guaifenesin family. These increases were offset partially by price erosion, lower sales in our antacid category, and discontinued products of $6 million. Our sales were also impacted by the absence of our higher margin Mucinex 600-milligram extended release equivalent store-brand product and unfavorable foreign currency movements of $7 million.","This year, adjusted gross profit margin was 35%. I'd like to remind you that last year was a record quarter for the segment, driven by strong product mix. On a comparative basis, this quarter's adjusted gross margins were lower due primarily to the absence of the product I just mentioned, pricing pressures, and the fact that many of the new product launches this year are partnered products, which means that gross profit dollars are shared with our supplier.","Let me talk to you a little bit about pricing in this segment. As we've discussed in the past, in today's macroeconomic environment, our customers continue to look for value and ask that we pass our material cost efficiencies on to them. This isn't new. Our team has quietly and effectively fought this fight for years, working every day to meet our customers' needs for continually lower prices. In the quarter, this net effect has only slightly impacted adjusted gross profit margins, as we have been able to largely offset this with scale and efficiencies.","The team sustained adjusted operating margins of 20%, as we continue to proactively manage operating expenses, which were lower in the quarter. We continue to invest in our business, increasing spending on R&D investments by 8% compared to last year on an adjusted basis.","Turning to slide 21, the Branded Consumer Healthcare segment's adjusted net sales were $304 million compared to $302 million last year and grew 2% on a constant currency basis. These results included $18 million from acquisitions, while new product sales contributed $26 million. These increases were offset primarily by lower sales in the lifestyle and natural health vitamin product categories as well as lower sales in the markets John discussed earlier.","Adjusted gross profit margins were 47.5%, consistent with the second quarter of 2016. However, compared to the prior year, this segment experienced lower adjusted gross profit margins in the quarter. Approximately half of the margin change compared to the prior year was due to the business dynamics in Belgium, where the new management team there will work on improving the operating model in this market for longer-term consistency and operating results, as John outlined earlier.","We also experienced unfavorable mix in the quarter due to lower sales in lifestyle and natural health vitamins categories, which have higher than average margins. In addition, we experienced unfavorable currency effects on euro-denominated purchases for the UK sterling market.","The BCH segment realized adjusted operating margin of 10% in the quarter. Lower adjusted gross profit was partially offset by cost containment measures and lower advertising and promotion spending, as management moderated A&P priorities in the quarter to align with market dynamics.","In the third quarter, we realized an impairment for indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets and goodwill related to our BCH business of $1.7 billion. The factors that contributed to this impairment were: one, changes in the market and performance of the brand due to moderated new product launch assumptions; two, execution of certain key product strategies falling short of operating management's plans, causing a reduction to baseline forecast models in France, Germany, and Italy; three, certain macroeconomic factors which have continued to impact the business more than expected in addition to unfavorable foreign currency impacts experienced primarily in the UK related to Brexit; and four, a change in the Belgian forecast due to a fundamental reduction in volume with a major wholesaler that is not expected to be short-term in nature.","The calculation of this impairment is a complicated process. While our GAAP net income and EPS include the preliminary calculation for the related tax effect of the impairment, we are completing our final control procedures, which will be finalized by the filing of our 10-Q, which is anticipated to be by the end of the day today. Any changes to this would not impact our adjusted earnings per share discussed throughout this announcement today.","Turning now to Rx on slide 22, net sales were $267 million, 4% higher than last year on a constant currency basis, driven largely by $32 million related to acquisitions and new product sales of $18 million. The Rx adjusted gross margin was 59% in the quarter due to product acquisitions and new products. Pricing pressures in the segment were in line with our expectations announced last quarter. In addition to acquisitions, we also experienced meaningful productivity improvements compared to last year, which were a factor in offsetting the effect of lower pricing. Adjusted operating margin for the segment was 42.5%, an increase of 40 basis points over the same period last year. R&D investments in the quarter increased $6 million, as the team continues to invest in pipeline products.","Our Specialty Sciences segment realized net sales in the quarter of $93 million compared to $85 million last year. Tysabri sales benefited in the quarter from a one-time favorable adjustment to discounts and allowances. Based on the current royalty percentage that Perrigo receives, the effect of this benefit was approximately $3.6 million. In addition, the segment benefited from a $6 million reduction in operating expenses due to lower legal costs in the current year.","Turning to slide 24 and an update on our balance sheet, as of October 1, 2016, total cash on the balance sheet was $363 million, and total debt was approximately $5.9 billion. Our total debt declined by over $500 million from the previous quarter end, as we proactively repaid our $500 million of senior notes, which would have matured on November 8, 2016, consistent with our stated deleveraging strategy and our commitment to our investment-grade ratings.","We generated $304 million of cash from operating activities during the quarter, which brings us to approximately $704 million of cash from operating activities for the first nine months of the year. This represents a cash flow conversion of operating cash flow to adjusted net income of 129% in the quarter. Excluding the contribution of the Tysabri royalty from both the numerator and denominator of this equation, the conversion would increase to 148%.","We will continue to use our strong cash flow conversion to prioritize our capital allocation toward deleveraging. We do not intend to reenter the share repurchase market in the near term. And as John stated earlier, our commitment to our investment-grade rating extends to the alternatives process we are undertaking for Tysabri.","Turning to slide 26, we are confirming the full-year 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance midpoint we announced in August. I would like to take a moment to briefly review the details by segment.","For the CHC segment, we continue to expect 2016 adjusted net sales of approximately $2.6 billion and second half adjusted operating margins in line with those in the first half. I would like to remind you that these expectations continue to exclude 2016 contributions from the U.S. VMS business, which was sold on August 5. We still expect approximately $1.3 billion in adjusted net sales for the BCH segment. And we now anticipate adjusted operating margins for the second half of the year to be approximately 10%, which is due primarily to lower adjusted gross profit contributions due to the effects discussed earlier.","We continue to align A&P spend with sales patterns and therefore expect fourth quarter seasonal A&P spend to be higher relative to the third quarter to support the cough\/cold season. The Rx segment net sales guidance also remains unchanged at approximately $1 billion, and we continue to expect adjusted operating margin in the low 40% range for the full year.","Consistent with our comments last quarter, our forecast continues to assume second half year-over-year price erosion on like-for-like products of 9% to 10%. We expect consolidated full-year 2016 cash flows to be approximately $900 million.","I'll now turn the call back over to John.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you, Judy.","In closing on slide 28, I outlined specific areas of strategic and operational focus shortly after becoming CEO in the spring. I'm pleased to have been able to share with you today the many actions we have completed and initiated, making substantial progress on multiple fronts in line with these focus areas.","While we have challenges to overcome, I believe the team can deliver the Perrigo advantage. CHC adjusted net sales growth was solid in the quarter, and the segment achieved strong margins. We're executing against our plans in BCH to drive greater profitability and enhance the business. Our continued focus on Rx execution paid off in the quarter, as the team was in line with expectations and margins remained attractive.","It's been a busy six months, and I with the help of the board and our management team have been working hard to enhance performance and drive shareholder value, and there is much work left to be done. We are performing our business review expeditiously but thoughtfully, drawing on the right expertise with an objective lens. I am confident we're on the right course to improve our performance and address our challenges. Now more than ever, the importance of affordable healthcare products is clear, and Perrigo is uniquely positioned to provide these products to our customers and patients across the globe.","Thank you. Brad?","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, John. Operator, we'd like to now open the call for questions. We ask that you please ask one question only. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question is from Sumant Kulkarni, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. So the question I have is, you have an impairment charge on the Omega business and you have a reset growth rate in there. Could you give us the before and after that you used in your calculation?","Judy L. Brown - Perrigo Co. Plc","So specifically, I think \u2013 why don't I step back for a second and just give everyone a comment on the impairment overall? Because I am quite certain that many of you are curious as to the fact that we had a large impairment recorded in May and are again going through this same exercise, only six months later.","The entire process of calculating impairments starts with run rate indicators on the underlying assets of the business. So as you I'm sure, Sumant, being the careful reader of the 10-Qs and 10-Ks that you are, I'm sure that you noted that we have outlined that the basis of the original assets, the original purchase price accounting, are definite and indefinite-lived assets by product category. Which means, and I remember commenting on this in our May earnings call, that if expectations on those specific categories change over time, it changes the perspective on the long-term indefinite cash flows discounted back to today.","What does that mean? At the time we did our evaluation in May, we had certain assertions, country by country, on the future cash flows from our XLS Medical technology, a weight loss product, other products in our lifestyle category, as well as certain other products in cough\/cold and our animal health categories in Europe. In the last six months, some of the assertions on those product categories have changed further, both the combination of these four things I outlined in the call: macroeconomic factors and the management team's assertion of how to utilize those assets best on a go-forward basis.","So yes, inherent to your question, has the expectation, the run rate of revenues from those categories changed? Yes, and that is the underlying starting point of an indicator of impairment and the reason that the entire process had to be started over again, to rerun cash flows for those product categories, those definite and indefinite-lived assets. And due to the magnitude of the change projected in those particular products and categories, it did also trigger the indicator to run a goodwill impairment analysis; i.e., what are the total cash flows off the total business, even including those assets that are not specifically targeted as the product categories I've commented on already?","So stepping back, the underlying expectation on run rate for our business in Europe continues to grow at a rate above market. But the combination of products to get there, the assertion of brand strategies to make that successful, and the contributors of two of those cash flows on a long-term basis have changed, thereby creating the underlying impairment that you see in the books today. John, I don't know if you want to comment further on the future run rates.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","No, you said it well. I think we expect that our business will continue to grow faster than the markets we're in. And we need to turn around the specific markets that aren't performing as well as planned, as we said earlier, and that the products and the issues we had in the country certainly caused a big portion of the impairment that we had.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you, next question, please.","Operator","It's from Jami Rubin, Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Hi, Jami.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Hi, Jami, are you there?","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Jami, did we lose you?","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Operator, let's move on to the next question, and we'll get Jami back.","Operator","It's from Louise Chen with Guggenheim.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question. So just curious, I know you haven't said that you're going to do this, but I think one of the things that people have considered is the potential sale of your generics business. I'm just curious why you think there could be any potential to sell that given all the headwinds that we've seen in the industry and the potential dyssynergy to a buyer. Thanks.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yes, thanks, Louise. So we haven't decided that we're going down the sales process or anything like that. We've got the internal team driving hard for creating shareholder value with that, and we're stepping back and assessing all of the options. And that's why the board and I have formed a committee to look at all the places of that, both the internal options, as well as potential other ways to optimize the value from that good business segment. So I don't want to say that we've made any determination to sell the business or do anything like that. We just feel given its market dynamics and everything, we need to do a full assessment of all the potential opportunities for that.","Judy L. Brown - Perrigo Co. Plc","Suffice it to say, as we have said for many years, despite the volatility in the marketplace and the obvious macroeconomic changes that have been in the headlines every day in that particular sub-segment of the industry, our business still has market-leading margins and highly efficient and well-run facilities and attractive products in the portfolio. So to the point of what makes us believe that someone might be interested, it's those basic factors of a well-run business in a \u2013 granted, to your point, a somewhat volatile market right now.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, thank you.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Hi, we got you this time.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I know, I'm sorry about that. That was probably my fault. But anyway, my question surrounds Tysabri and your decision to consider strategic alternatives. Tysabri represented about 33% of earnings this quarter. Obviously, it's highly profitable, it drops right to the bottom line. Judy, can you help us to think about how you guys are balancing the opportunity to monetize the business with the loss of earnings or the dilution to earnings, and how you think \u2013 would you be able to make those earnings up through share buyback, debt paydown, acquisition? How are you thinking about all those things? Because obviously, Tysabri is a third of your earnings, and how should we think about that?","And also, is there anything in the Irish tax laws that would allow you to benefit from a tax loss carry-forward depending on where you sell the business for? I would imagine there's going to be a loss based on the original purchase price. Is there anything in that that would affect your ongoing non-GAAP earnings? Thanks very much.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Jami. I think there were about six questions in there somewhere.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm sorry.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","No, that's okay. Let me start out, and I've said this many times, I want to start out with a broader portfolio perspective. As I look at who we are as an operating company, I go back to we provide quality affordable healthcare products that deliver value to consumers and do those things. We've got a great consumer-facing front. We've got to continue to evolve the branded in Europe to greatness, but frankly, have a good front there.","When we looked at the portfolio from a broader view and perspective, Tysabri, as we said, was a non-core part of that overall portfolio. It wasn't a strategic part of our business. It wasn't one of those links that we wanted to grow, drive, et cetera. And in fact, it was a good contributor of financial, good leverage there, but didn't contribute to the core part of what we were doing.","So as we looked at it from a strategic standpoint, we said it's non-core. And at what point does it make sense to look at other strategic alternatives for it? And was now the right time, was it sometime in the future? But we elected as a board to say, nope, we believe now is the right time to look for that and do that. I'll let Judy jump in on the EPS and potential things. I will tell you, it's hard to replace the EPS of what Tysabri brings. At the same time, it's a good strategic move in my mind to look at those alternatives. So, Judy?","Judy L. Brown - Perrigo Co. Plc","I believe I have in my public comments always been utterly consistent in the statement that if and when we ever came to a place of selling all or a portion of Tysabri that it would be dilutive to earnings. What do I mean? To your point, 100% operating margin running through the P&L at a low tax rate is very hard to replace, irrespective of whether it's deleveraging, share buyback, or some new strategic investment in M&A.","That being said, the plan would be, to John's point, in order to focus the portfolio and focus on core businesses that we would use that cash first and foremost to delever, looking at being able to get down to something more like 3.25 turns, and deploying the cash that would come from that sale \u2013 from any sale first and foremost to delever the balance sheet.","Effective tax rate-wise, you got into a little granularity on trying to prognosticate on any kind of Irish tax structure. Suffice it to say, at the time we would have a sale, the effective tax rate would also go up for the company. Why, jurisdictional mix, this particular asset's royalty streams today are taxed in the single digits. And so without that mix of earnings before tax in there, obviously the RemainCo tax rate will be higher. At this level, I'm not going to get into gory detail of the ins and outs at the time of the sale. But suffice it to say that the tax implications of this on a go-forward basis, we would talk about that at the time of a sale.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","And again, just to end before I go to the next one, when I think about it, Judy said it well. Creating a clear, concise focus for the company on where we're going, where we're headed, and aligning every mind, everything that we do around those is what will ultimately deliver greater success for us. So I know it's more philosophical, but making sure that we are focused on those core elements going forward.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks very much.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Jami.","Operator","Your next question is from Gregg Gilbert, Deutsche Bank.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Good morning, Gregg.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. I got on a few minutes late. I apologize if you said this, but when do you expect to provide the results of your overall strategic review and refresh your long-term growth outlook?","And, Judy, can you talk about the gross margin outlook for the CHC business? And within that, just comment on the pricing that you mentioned. You mentioned an element that it's normal course. I just want to make sure there are no new pricing dynamics developing there that would affect your thinking on gross margin for that segment going forward. Thanks a lot.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yes, Gregg, so first of all, on some of the key strategic things that were left off, we talked about our analysis of our Rx business and how to optimize and create the best value for shareholders out of that. We said that would be completed during Q1. We talked about making sure that our cost structures and operational efficiencies were aligned well with the current dynamics of each of our businesses, which means we've got to look at our structures and everything and what we're doing, and that will be complete in Q1. And we'd expect at the same time there to come out with our forward-looking, here's how it all fits together guidance between all those businesses and cost perspectives from that standpoint. And Judy can talk on the margin.","I would say the pricing on CHC, just where Judy talks about numbers and so forth, we always have pricing pressures. Our customers are always trying to seek the best value that they can get so that they can pass that on to consumers, and we're part of that good chain because we're always trying to reduce our costs as much as we can and trying to pass that on. So it ebbs and flows, but where those always stay in balance. But I think that's the goal, especially when you look at the Consumer business of how we balance our operational efficiencies, our costs, our procurement. All of those things align around, frankly, providing value to consumers and customers alike. And we've done a decent job and I believe we will be able to continue to drive that value. But, Judy, anything on the numbers themselves?","Judy L. Brown - Perrigo Co. Plc","The only thing I would add to what John said with respect to forward-looking margin and pricing dynamics is that the operating teams indicated they anticipate this very competitive pricing landscape to continue overall. It's not just in our categories. I think anyone that follows retail and the dynamics that our important retail customers are going through themselves will know that everyone right now is striving very hard to find value and margin. So that dynamic continues, and the team does a good job.","And part of the cost work that John commented on officially in his comments was directed towards the CHC team working within our manufacturing groups, our supply chain group to help find value within our overall supply chain so that they're in a better position to continue to pass on that savings to their customers while at the same time maintaining adjusted gross margins on a go-forward basis. So while we haven't given long-term guidance or even 2017 guidance in CHC, that is the framework that the team is entering planning with and one that they're planning to, again, pass value on to customers and maintain margins on a go-forward.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you, next question, please.","Operator","It's from David Maris with Wells Fargo.","Patrick Trucchio - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. This is actually Patrick Trucchio on the line for David Maris. Given the write-downs and how Omega has performed over the prior year, John, is there a way you're approaching M&A differently than the previous CEO did? Thank you.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yes, David (sic) [Patrick], thanks. So the way I think about BCH and Consumer Healthcare and our core businesses is the way we deliver the best value is when we can find good M&A opportunities that fit right into those business segments. When we find products, categories that fit into our Consumer Healthcare business, we're able to drop value very quickly to the bottom line because the infrastructure supports it.","My belief is we will get the infrastructure in a better place in Europe. Instead of a number of unique different infrastructures, we will be able to build them together in a more efficient structure and want to continue to have product acquisitions, smaller things that we bolt onto that that can deliver value to the bottom very quickly. So again, I call them bolt-on acquisitions within our core focus, that consumer-facing, the focus on delivering value to the consumers. To me, we can deliver great value there. And so I wouldn't see us in the near term trying to do transformational acquisitions that change the face of who we are. I see us creating focus and looking for bolt-on acquisitions that add value to our core.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Next question, please.","Operator","It's from Randall Stanicky, RBC Capital Markets.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks, guys. John, your prepared comments and also just now seemed to suggest that the BCH business may be more core as opposed to part of the review which it sounds like Rx is. So can you just confirm that?","And then you also hit on some of the monetary synergies or benefits between Rx and OTC, but I wanted to ask you. How much non-monetary benefit or strategic benefit do you get in selling both Rx and OTC products into that same large chain customer base? Thanks.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","That's very good. So let me talk Branded Consumer Healthcare first. So as I said in my comments, I think as a consumer-facing company bringing value, having a larger footprint and presence in Europe in concept is a good place to be. Markets are growing. They're good consumer markets. I think they're going to continue to evolve to need cost-effective solutions, whether it's brands or store brands that we offer in countries, those kinds of things. So at a macroeconomic level, I like being in Europe. I think it's a good place to be.","Now I step back and say, does that mean that every part of our branded business and consumer parts in Europe are operating well and we belong in long term? And I'd say we're going through that analysis. We announced the last time we were doing some restructuring and looking at potential exits from products in Russia \u2013 Argentina, which isn't in Europe \u2013 I realize that \u2013 South Africa, other areas. So we continue to look at the Branded Consumer portfolio and say do we have a right to win in this country? Do we have the right products? Do we have the right go-to-market strategy? And I think there will continue to be pruning of that overall portfolio to make it much more effective.","On the organizational and G&A effectiveness and operating cost of goods effectiveness, we can continue to drive more efficiency and effectiveness there to make sure that the sales we have drop right to the bottom line. So a lot of work in what I call creating the Perrigo of Europe, not from how we sell, not the go-to-market, but the actual back office, how we're able to deliver sales to the bottom is what we've got to continue to work on there. So fundamentally, yes. I like being there. It's not been easy. We still have a lot of work to do, but I think the market ties in with our consumer-facing side.","When I think about the OTC and Rx, and again, I said this before. There are some ties to the business between operating side things, plants, some of the procurement side, those kind of things that are good links from that standpoint. Certainly, going to market, the selling process, the people you call on at the buying groups, et cetera, are different. So on the back side, they're there. They are good synergies we're able to pull out, but they probably aren't game-changers as far as ultimate decisions to make. We'd look at all of those and say those are part of the equation and they wouldn't limit us from deciding to do something else with the business if that's where the data or we chose to go. I hope that's helpful.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, it is. Thank you.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Marc Goodman, UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, just a couple things just related to Omega. So first of all, can you talk about the progress that you've made over the past quarter with respect to revenue synergies in that business, bringing some products from the U.S. over, or vice-versa? Help us understand how big Belgium is and what's going on there. We know that Stada was a big piece of it before. Have they just completely gone away? Or help quantify what's going on there.","And also you've talked about how you're focusing on key brands, and in the past you've given us the top 20 products grew at a certain rate. Can you give us a sense of what's going on there? What's the good news, the underbelly of what is going on there? Maybe you can give us that growth rate of your top 20 products again. Thanks.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Let me go through a number of those in order here. So first of all, revenue synergies between, I'll say Europe and U.S., or U.S. and Europe, those kind of revenue synergies have been slower to materialize than was originally contemplated, just because of the regulatory processes, the unique ingredients in some of the products here that we've got to do changes to, to get them in Europe and vice-versa. So that part of it has been slower than expected. The actual operating synergies, the cost and those kind of things continue to progress as well, but it's taken us longer to get at those reverse synergies.","We have in certain markets, I'll pick the UK as an example, where we had a big presence of store brand from legacy Perrigo and doing a lot to combine our branded business with our store brand with our pharmacy business because of what it is. And we have those all under Neil Lister, a great leader for Perrigo, who runs that whole business now, and he's driving synergies across all combinations of that business structure. So, Marc, we haven't given up on the synergies to move products back and forth, to move that. We're actually doing more processes moving back and forth than products at this point. But we think there still are synergies there and ways to drive some of that.","Let me go to Belgium and some of the issues there. First of all, we still do business with Stada. We still move it through \u2013 we've continued \u2013 we do a number of different distribution methods in Belgium. There's a number of different avenues to go to market. One of the biggest ones is through pharmacy distributors, pharmacy wholesalers as you might call them in the U.S. And they would go out to independent pharmacies throughout the Belgian country. There have been what I call inventory inefficiencies in that model of selling in, where they're selling out, making sure we've got good tracking now with the sell-outs. We know what's going there, but making sure that we understand where all the pockets of inventory are and how to manage and normalize that has created longer than we had originally expected. We expected it to normalize relatively quick. So we continue to work with the distributors, the wholesalers, the chains, everything in Belgium to make that flow smoother. And it has definitely taken us longer than we expected. But the Stada relationship is good. We continue to distribute their products as well as our own OTC products through that same channel.","Your last question was on key brands and how much of the portfolio they made was the question or what the \u2013 can you ask that one more time, Marc? I'm sorry.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","In the past you've given us like the top 20 products grew at a certain rate, and you had talked about fixing this business is focusing on the key brands, so I was hoping you could give us a sense of how the key brands were doing.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yes, so let me talk. First of all, I would say fixing the business does include key brands, so driving across regions and pan-European. We have a big part of our business that we call local jewels. These are brands that may not leave a region, probably leave a country but may not leave a region, and those are important parts of the business too. And within those countries, we have leading positions with some of those brands. So it's not just the brands we want to drive more pan-European, like Bronchostop and some of those. There are regional great products that we're going to try and drive because that's who we are. We're not quite the \u2013 here's the only 20 brands and that's going to be 90% of our portfolio. We're going to drive those brands, but also continue to invest in those regional brands.","Judy L. Brown - Perrigo Co. Plc","To the extent, Marc, you're wondering why we did not reflect a specific growth rate on the top 20 brands in this quarter, suffice it to say, in the month of October when we had initial indicator of impairment conversations with the European operating management team, I made a comment earlier, I think to Sumant, that the growth rates as we look forward are changing. So rather than get into granularity right now on this call talking about specific growth rates of the top brands, we are making changes to certain categories and the expectations of the brand and product growth.","Some of the new leadership in Europe is looking specifically at the combination of their local jewel brand investments versus the potential for developing pan-European or more regional brand strategies. Those will be part of our conversations as we go into 2017. But the main area of focus for that operating team on the ground in the last six weeks has been trying to get very deep dive information on what they plan to do by their product categories in order to put forward meaningful cash flow estimates for those products so that we could do a more refined impairment calculation that we talked about earlier on the call.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Okay, next question, please.","Operator","It's from Elliot Wilbur, Raymond James.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, good morning.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Good morning.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Just a quick question with respect to the Rx generic business and expectations of price deflation. I guess in just doing the math, and correct me if there's some inaccuracy here, but in looking at the decrease in the existing base, $41 million, that works out to an erosion rate of about 16%, and you've indicated the majority of that is price. So I'm just trying to connect that with your prior commentary around expectations of 9% to 10% deflation in the second half and still the maintenance of that deflation expectation for the balance of the year.","And then just as a corollary to that, a lot of companies have talked about another leg down in pricing that occurred post the end of calendar third quarter. I just want to get your color or perspective on that, if there's been any change at this point to the early read on 4Q. Thanks.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you. So first of all, when you look at the actual numbers, if you do it, you've got two things that impact that if you look at Q3. You always have what I call mix\/volume portions of that number. So depending on product, product blend, mix\/volume, that will be part of it. Price was also in there. The price was in line with our expectations that we gave when you just look at price decreases. The rest of the change was just mix\/volume issues. Look forward, we're staying with our guidance for the quarter, as best we know, in that 9% to 10% range, so we're staying with that as far as what we're seeing at this time.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you, the next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from Annabel Samimy with Stifel.","Esther Hong - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, this is Esther in for Annabel. I just wanted to follow up on that last question. So broadly, what do you believe are the biggest growth drivers for Rx pharma to offset what looks like the continued price erosion?","And then just a quick follow-up, I know that you can't go into specifics about the Omega arbitration. But is there any way to give an indication of the generic issue and maybe how this could potentially impact the business going forward?","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","So first of all, I'll hit the first one. When you look at the pharma space, et cetera, pricing again has always been a dynamic that's in there, although it's gotten more dramatic here recently, et cetera. The biggest way to offset that is through new products. You have to have a new product pipeline that is relatively strong and can offset those dynamics. We're pretty strong in the space. We have 27 ANDAs pending FDA approval, five Paragraph IV litigations, a number of active clinical studies. But keeping that pipeline, getting those products approved and launched becomes the way that you work to offset that pricing dynamic. And that continues to be a battle all the time, especially in this dynamic pricing environment we're in.","On the Omega front and our announcements, I'm going to avoid that question. We see we're continuing forward with operating our business and driving it per normal. And in my mind, this legal action and what's happening has nothing to do with the ongoing operations of our business.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you, next question, please.","Esther Hong - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","It's from Douglas Tsao with Barclays.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, just a couple questions on the BCH business. So just to make sure we're understanding in terms of the impairment charges, this really doesn't necessarily reflect specifically a change in long-term outlook from what you think of the business. It's much more just reviewing expectations for very specific product lines as they are today, and that obviously needs to change. And so when we think about long-term growth, it's probably going to be coming via product acquisitions, which Omega was very successful with over the years, as well as internal R&D efforts.","And then my second question is, in terms of the leadership at BCH, I'm just curious if, given the fact that it is a very different business from your store brand core, the thought of bringing in some external people with more traditional OTC, branded OTC experience, just to introduce some new perspectives versus what has always been the Perrigo way of doing things.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yes, very good, and I appreciate that. Let me go through first real quick on the impairment, I'll give philosophically and then I'll get through the others and give it back to Judy on that one.","As we've talked about and laid out the parts of the impairment, that doesn't really say that you can't grow the business going forward or the business won't grow. It doesn't say that anything you buy will layer into there and grow it. So you're exactly right that it's a, here's what we have. Is it performing as we expected? Are different products performing, and Judy will go into those in a minute here.","But it certainly doesn't say there isn't growth for the business and there aren't ways to enhance that growth. Certainly one of those is innovation within the product line. So you know this, once you have a brand, the brand will become stagnant and you've got to follow it up with the Max Strength and the Extra Max and here's the liquid that goes with the tablet, all of those kind of innovations that flow there. That comes both internally, but even more so making sure we fund product acquisitions that can add to that innovation. So that's got to be part and is part of the growth path going forward. And again, I'll let Judy come back to that impairment question in a minute here.","On the innovation side, I think you're exactly right. We hired a new chief strategy and innovation officer to help drive that, to help us look for how we continue to drive that innovation. He comes from the consumer industry, brings great experience with him. And we'll be great there. I think the other leadership we've brought in from the outside has good branded, good consumer, good consumer-facing experience, and brings credibility to all those countries where we're selling. So they clearly are not exports from the Perrigo infrastructure to them from that standpoint.","On the supply chain side, we are bringing a fair amount of our sales and operations planning, inventory management, cost of goods sold, how to consolidate sites, that sort of infrastructure, bringing that to them because that's a universal thing versus a business-specific skill, et cetera. And I will say we're not done adding either. So we've added some good ones. We continue to look at where we need European branded leadership, European leadership, et cetera, to bring into the company to make sure that we are successful in all the objectives we laid out. Judy, please, on the other impairment thoughts.","Judy L. Brown - Perrigo Co. Plc","I just want to make sure, again, going back to my earlier comments, that by definition the fact that there's an impairment of indefinite and definite-lived intangibles means that our expectations for those specific assets and their future cash flows have changed. The fact that we had a goodwill impairment in addition means by definition that the long-term cash flows coming from the entire business that we acquired have stepped down. It's a bounding box algebraic equation that one must reexamine each year to say, are the expected cash flow streams from all of the assets that were acquired the same or have they moved since acquisition or since the last goodwill evaluation. So the answer is yes, it has stepped down.","And then to John's point, there's still growth in the model, to the earlier comment, there are still growth expectations ahead of the market. But importantly, you can't step away from the earlier statement of, have the expectations changed. Absolutely, that's what triggered the impairment calculation. But there is still growth in the model for a host of countries and for pan-European basis, yes.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","It's from David Risinger, Morgan Stanley.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Hi, David.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I am hoping that you could talk about the organic revenue growth outlook for the Consumer Healthcare business and the Rx business, just to provide some color on how we should think about the forward growth rate for those on an organic basis. And maybe you can include some comments about the pace and magnitude of launches ahead. Thank you.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yes, thank you, David. So I'm going to avoid talking about the forward-looking growth and link it into, right now I'm in the process of going business unit by business unit as they prepare the next year's detailed plans as well as looking beyond that. We're in the process right now of reviewing all of those, to assemble that as well as the cost and operating efficiency side of that. So frankly, I'm going to avoid answering that part of the question just because we're in that process. And the way that works at Perrigo is I meet with all the businesses and they bring in their key leaders. And we spend a couple days on each one going through every part and piece to make sure we understand what needs to happen and how we need to support them. Do we need to invest, dis-invest, what do we need to do? So those broader discussions.","I think when you step back, to your second question on the Rx business, a good portfolio on the Consumer Healthcare business, good portfolio of new products. It depends on when products switch. Some of the products in the pipeline are dependent on switches, some are line extensions of what's out there. But we have good engines, good R&D, internal functions that support both of those businesses, well-developed teams that drive that, as well as we continue to look for business development opportunities to supplement that as far as bolt-on acquisitions. So without going product by product, good pipelines between both those businesses.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you. Next question, please.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","It's from David Steinberg with Jefferies.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Hi, David.","David Michael Steinberg - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, a couple questions. First, we're on the cusp of the cough\/cold season, and typically you ship in advance. I was just curious. During the third quarter, did you ship all or most of the products to the trade? And then related to that, could you comment on what the trade \u2013 what the ordering is looking like this year? Would you say the trade is ordering like a typical cough\/cold season, higher or lower?","And then you have a pretty big launch coming up in Nexium, and I was wondering if you could comment on the dynamics. Do you expect this to be one of your biggest products like Prilosec, or are you expecting a little more competition pending for Nexium? Thanks.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yes, so first of all, cough\/cold, allergy, sinus, if I step back, I'd say over the last couple of years, our operating supply team has gotten better and better, and the customers have gotten better and better. And so the inventory they used to buy in the old days \u2013 in the old days if I go back to my junior days, they'd buy five months' worth of product because they were concerned we weren't going to be able to supply them if the cold season hit. That doesn't happen anymore. We do ship some product in, but they are storing small amounts and they expect that our supply chain can keep it flowing. So you don't have these huge surges of big product inflows like we used to, again, 10 years ago or so. So they are sitting where they want to be for the season right now. We are prepped and ready, continue to operate, and ready for that to happen. Allergy was a little bit lighter here in the fall, and cough\/cold really hasn't taken off yet. The weather has been a little bit milder, but we're ready to service that when and if it hits.","On the Nexium issue, we are gearing up and prepared. As you know, we have a tentative approval for that product. There are other filers in that space, but we are preparing for the launch, whenever that date arrives, to get that to market, certainly next year.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","It's from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much, just two quick questions here. Maybe first on the Rx side, just given some of the dynamics in the generic space and the consolidating customer base, do you believe that more scale, whether that's achieved either through buying additional assets or selling the franchise and gaining scale that way would help the portfolio? Or do you feel like given the strength you have in your vertical that that really isn't a consideration we should be thinking about as you look at strategic options for that business?","The second question was on BCH, just latest thinking about long-term operating margin targets. Are there some rough numbers you can point us to about where margins could recover to over time? Thank you.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yes, so first of all, on the generics space, certainly the consolidated number of buyers, the atmosphere right now on drug pricing, all those things that certainly have a dynamic on the pricing and what's been going on, I think there are times when scale certainly is beneficial. You're going in with a basket. I would say on the Rx side, especially in our categories, most of the buyers won't just buy a whole category from you or whatever; they are product-specific. So scale, while good because you've got a broader array of products to bounce any one price \u2013 price decrease, price concession off, they're still bidding, asking you for price, asking you if you want to bid on a product item by item. And so really, that part of it doesn't give you huge benefits from the scale. There is a spreading of risk that helps.","I think when you look at BCH longer term, our goal is to continue to drive that operating margin up to what I call our Consumer Healthcare margins, so up to the higher teens in my mind. Now we have a lot of work to get there because, as Judy said, we're looking at 10% or so. That includes product growth at higher margins than where we're at as well as operating efficiencies to deliver support to those products so more of that sales can drop to the bottom. Judy, do you have anything else to add to that?","Judy L. Brown - Perrigo Co. Plc","Good summary.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Okay, thank you.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Last question, please, operator?","Operator","It's from Linda Bolton Weiser with B. Riley.","Linda Bolton Weiser - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks. Can you just give us an update on the A&P spending ratio within BCH and whether it is projected to be up or down or flat or whatever this year? And is that spending level on par with some of the bigger branded competitors in Europe? Thanks.","Judy L. Brown - Perrigo Co. Plc","So what I can say is that we're expecting it as a percent of sales to be up fourth quarter over third quarter. For the full year, the total spend run rate for this year, remember, we had three quarters last year and we'll have four this year, so the total dollar spend or euro spend in 2016 will definitely be up from 2015, even if only on the back of an additional quarter, and the run rate as a percent to sales is expected to be similar.","But if we think about how we stand in comparison to larger brand companies and their percent to sales spend, our spend is similar. It's different because we are not going on a pan-European basis across all countries in Europe, but doing spend more locally or regionally focused. Part of the initiative of thinking about ongoing enhancements to adjusted operating margin on a long-term basis is just finding ways to go to market in as lean a way as possible, but still even increase our A&P spend as a percent to sales to afford more push marketing through advertising \u2013 sorry, pull marketing through advertising and have the right balance of push; i.e., selling expenses in the portfolio to optimize the overall revenue growth on a long-term basis. So we're trying to strive for enhancing the percent to sales and maintaining that comparability with the larger European pan-European brands.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Great.

This is Art Shannon. Thank you very much. Welcome to Perrigo's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. I hope you all had a chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the press release is available on our website at perrigo.com.

Joe?","Joseph C. Papa","Thank you, Art, and welcome, everyone, to Perrigo's Third Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Also joining me today is Judy Brown, Perrigo's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For our agenda today, I'll provide a brief perspective on the quarter. Next, Judy will go through the details of the quarter, and then I'll provide some additional comments on our key success drivers, including new product launches, plus an overview of our expectations for the remainder of fiscal year '12. Finally, this will be followed by an opportunity for question-and-answer.","Now let's just discuss the quarter. As you can see on Slide 4, we had a great quarter with strong year-over-year growth on an adjusted consolidated basis. The net sales strength was driven by strong execution across our generic prescription business, especially the integration of Paddock Laboratories; and new product sales of $64 million, with the majority of those sales coming from our Consumer Healthcare business in fiscal year '12 Q3.","This top line net sales performance translated into expansion of both our adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin. In fact, adjusted operating margin expanded 250 basis points to a record 22.1% due to continuing operating leverage, even though we made a significantly higher incremental investment in research and development, which was up 19% versus last year.","I want to congratulate the entire Perrigo team for executing a 13% increase in net sales year-over-year, while more than doubling that on the bottom line with an increase of 32% on an adjusted basis. Furthermore, quarter-over-quarter, adjusted operating margin for each of our 4 largest business segments all increased. In this quarter, our store brand private label businesses of Consumer Healthcare and our Nutritionals segment together combined to generate approximately 73% of this quarter's sales. So great performance.","Turning to Slide 5. You can see the business segment breakdown. Judy will walk you through the detail, but I want to touch just on a few items here. First, our Consumer Healthcare unit had all-time record fiscal third quarter sales. Global Consumer Healthcare sales grew 6% in the quarter, while OTC U.S. sales rose 8% despite the historically mild cough, cold, flu season which hurt sales by approximately $25 million. The growth was driven by $34 million in new product sales led by the highly successful fexofenadine product, the store brand version of Allegra; and our launch of Minoxidil Foam, the store brand version of Rogaine Foam.","Adjusted operating income was up versus last year despite competitive pressures in the gastrointestinal category and promotional new product spending in advance of our expected launches in the second half of the fiscal year. We anticipated both the GI pricing pressure and the marketing cost in our plan. As a side note, the gastrointestinal pricing has appeared to stabilize over the past 6 months.","Our Nutritionals segment net sales were down slightly from last year due to difficult comparables this quarter. Remember that during the fiscal second and third quarter last year, a competitor had a recall in the infant formula category, which gave us plus $8 million in additional sales in the third quarter last year. When you remove these additional sales, year-over-year, the infant nutritional business actually grew approximately 12% despite a very weak market.","Also, sales in the Vitamin, Mineral and Supplements were down over 15% in the quarter, which impacted our results. I will discuss the VMS segment further after Judy's comments.","Adjusted margins in the total Nutritionals segment improved over 460 basis points versus quarter 2 fiscal year '12, as long-term supply agreements we implemented last quarter mitigated the impact of rising material cost.","The Rx business had another very strong quarter. Rx net sales increased 84%, and adjusted operating income grew 130% as a result of 3 factors: number one, the successful Paddock integration; number two, the gains of market share from both Paddock and our legacy Rx business; and number three, organic net sales growth of 11% from a favorable pricing environment in our Rx business. The Rx team continues to execute very effectively in the legacy business and the Paddock integration.","Looking at Slide 6, the overall OTC consumer market was relatively flat versus last year, with national brands down 2.2%. But store brands gained 6.8% on new product launches, national brand recalls and just increased market share based on IRI 52 Week Data ending April 8, 2012. This trend has also accelerated in the most recent quarter, with store brands growing 7.6% based on the latest quarterly data ending April 2012.","I want to highlight a couple of areas on -- in this data. First, the cough\/cold\/flu season is down versus last year. However, the category, which includes allergy, is up 2.1% primarily due to a very early and very strong allergy season.","National brands are down slightly, but store brands have gained 8.9%. While the allergy season is going very well, there wasn't much of an impact in our third quarter as this quarter was mostly a channel fill. We are optimistic for the rest of the season, although we are certainly sympathetic to all of you allergy sufferers.","Primarily as a result of the historically mild cough, cold and flu season and the lighter sales of the VMS business, we are adjusting our consolidated revenue guidance for fiscal year 2012 back to our original August 2011 guidance of 15% to 18% growth year-over-year. We still feel confident raising our adjusted diluted earnings guidance to $4.90 to $5 per diluted share, up from the previous guidance range of $4.70 to $4.80 per diluted share, based on stronger operating margin expectations and a onetime tax benefit of approximately 20% realized this quarter.","So now let me turn this call over to Judy, who will provide more detail.","Judy L. Brown","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. As you just heard, we had another very solid quarter. On a consolidated basis, our team continues to perform well, with record third quarter revenue and earnings. I'll provide updated consolidated and segment earnings guidance for the remainder of the year in a few minutes, but first I'll give a brief review of our fiscal 2012 third quarter results.","As always, I'd like to remind you that my comments today are focused exclusively on adjusted results from continuing operations. You can view reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted results in the tables to our press release, as well as the appendices to this morning's presentation.","Now let's walk through the financial results for each business segment. On Slide 7, you can see net sales in the Consumer Healthcare business grew 6% year-over-year, driven by new product sales of $34 million, primarily in the cough, cold and dermatological categories; a $5 million increase in sales of existing products in the smoking cessation category; and net sales attributable to the acquisition of CanAm Care of approximately $8 million.","These increases were partially offset by a decline of approximately $25 million in sales of existing products, primarily due to the historically mild cough, cold and flu season that Joe just mentioned. As we've discussed throughout the quarter, the incidence of cough, cold and flu was down 9% year-over-year, according to IMS FAN data, which helps to explain the absence of typical reorders of product by our customers in this quarter.","The decline in adjusted gross margin was due to several factors. First, as expected, we observed year-over-year relative pricing pressures on a key product in the gastrointestinal category, although increased volume buffered the impact on the top line sales. Secondly, the dynamics of the relatively slower cough, cold and flu season played out in several ways within the CHC adjusted gross margin. Although efficiencies in production processes are improved from this time last year, production volumes in Michigan were down double-digit percentages across the board year-over-year. As a result, we experienced under-absorption of fixed production costs relative to this lower volume output. In addition, as cough, cold and flu product sell-through was lower this quarter, inventory balances have grown and, therefore, the inventory carrying costs have risen, negatively impacting adjusted gross margin. However, we are pleased to report that service levels are much higher than at this point last year.","The adjusted operating margin decreased by a lesser amount than the adjusted gross margin as we were able to control operating expenditures well in the quarter, without sacrificing product investment. DSG&A expense increased on a dollar basis, with both the inclusion of CanAm Care expenses, as well as with the continuation of necessary marketing and promotional investments this quarter to prepare for the fiscal fourth quarter launches of numerous new OTC products. Even with these investments, as a percent of net sales, adjusted DSG&A expense declined 20 basis points year-over-year.","On Slide 8, you can see that net sales within the Nutritionals segment declined 5% year-over-year, due primarily to 2 factors. One, the absence of $8 million of additional sales in the third quarter of last year as a result of a competitor's product recall that Joe mentioned earlier. Removing this effect, we are pleased that, notwithstanding a continued 2% decline in U.S. birth rates, the infant nutrition categories grew by approximately 12% year-over-year. Two, net sales in the VMS category declined year-over-year, due both to unattractive pricing and our continued SKU rationalization program. These factors together caused lower VMS production volume output and pressured the category's adjusted gross margin.","Adjusted gross margin in this segment decreased 390 basis points to 29.2%, due to many of the same factors that affected this segment last quarter: increased cost of raw materials for infant formula such as lactose, nonfat dairy milk and whey protein; weaker product mix between higher-margin infant formula and relatively lower-margin toddler foods; and an under-absorption of fixed cost during the quarter as we continued to run production of infant formula at both our Vermont and Ohio facilities.","Despite these year-over-year challenges, though, I'm pleased to note that the steps outlined last quarter to increase both gross and operating margins have made a substantial impact this quarter, as the adjusted gross margin increased 390 basis points and the adjusted operating margin increased 460 basis points sequentially from the second fiscal quarter. These steps included negotiating long-term agreements with key suppliers of our most expensive raw materials to reduce our cost, and continuing to implement pricing initiatives.","On Slide 9, you can see that our Rx business continues along the strong growth trajectory we have seen over the last several quarters. Net sales growth was driven by the Paddock Labs acquisition, favorable new pricing and new product sales. Our newly combined Rx team has made great strides gaining market share and net sales, bringing our broader, combined portfolio of products to our customers, a real example of how an acquisition can deliver on the promise of 1 plus 1 equals 3.","Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was strong compared to last year due to the favorable pricing on new and selected products and production cost leverage in the business. I'm pleased to note that our organic Rx business' adjusted gross margin expanded by approximately the same amount as the combined segment. DSG&A leverage was once again evident this quarter as the adjusted operating margin increased 200 basis points over the adjusted gross margin and 990 basis points year-over-year.","Next, looking at the API segment on Slide 10. The net sales decline was due to expected unevenness of revenues in the overall business and was not attributable to any one particular product. Adjusted gross and operating margins increased 480 basis points and 210 basis points year-over-year, respectively, due to favorable product mix and improved cost leveraging in our manufacturing operations.","This quarter, the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the conclusions of several tax audits and various statute expirations. As a result, the adjusted effective tax rate this quarter was 17.2%. These tax audit conclusions translated into a $0.20 diluted earnings per share tax benefit or an approximately 12 percentage point improvement to the adjusted effective tax rate for the fiscal third quarter.","Now some quick highlights on our balance sheet. Excluding cash and cash equivalents, working capital from continuing operations was $607 million at the end of the quarter, up from $471 million at this time last year, due primarily to the additional working capital from the Paddock and CanAm Care acquisitions and higher inventory as a result of the mild cough, cold and flu season this year compared to the supply constraints in those categories experienced last year.","Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $91 million. As of March 31, 2012, total current and long-term debt on the face of the balance sheet was $1.49 billion, essentially flat sequentially from last quarter. Excluding cash and cash equivalents, our net debt to total capital at the end of our third quarter fiscal 2012 was 34.7%.","Now I'd like to discuss our updated earnings outlook for fiscal 2012. Looking at Slide 11, you will see that we are making 3 changes to our detailed consolidated guidance. As Joe already highlighted, we are now estimating consolidated year-over-year revenue growth in a range of 15% to 18%, but are raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.20.","Let me explain. As I noted a few moments ago, in the fiscal third quarter, we realized a $0.20 EPS benefit related to the closing of various tax audits. With this benefit, we are adjusting our expectations for the worldwide effective tax rate to be between 25% and 27%. However, although we have adjusted our top line net sales expectations slightly down, we still feel confident in raising the adjusted bottom line guidance by this full $0.20 to be between $4.90 and $5 per diluted share due to the team's ability to translate new product launches and operational efficiencies into operating income dollars.","Looking to our segments on Slide 12. We continue to anticipate strong demand for our product in Consumer Healthcare segment. However, we're making slight adjustments to revenue and adjusted margins. These adjustments are due to a few factors. First, this quarter, we experienced a historically mild cough, cold and flu season, which impacted sales. Second, our international Consumer Healthcare sales and contract manufacturing operations have not performed in line with our internal expectations. Third, we have not seen any indication that the sponsor holder of Desloratadine will be launching an OTC version of the product. And thus, we now do not expect to launch a store brand version of Clarinex. And fourth, we are adjusting our probability weights on new products, including Fexofenadine D12 and Dextromethorphan. And as a reminder, both of these are partnered products and not 100% Perrigo-controlled. Incorporating these factors into our risk-adjusted model, we now expect Consumer Healthcare's year-over-year revenue growth to be in a range of 9% to 11%, with adjusted gross margin in a range of 31% to 32% and adjusted operating margin in a range of 17% to 19%.","In our Nutritionals segment, we've made great strides this quarter-over-quarter and are pleased with our growing market share in the U.S. despite the declining infant formula market. However, given the continued competitive environment within our VMS category, we now estimate Nutritionals revenue to be flat to down 2% year-over-year, with adjusted gross margins of between 28% and 30% and adjusted operating margin of between 13% and 15%.","In Rx, we are now expecting top line growth of 81% to 83% compared to fiscal 2011, driven by new products and operational excellence. We now expect Rx adjusted gross margin to be in a range of 57% to 59% and adjusted operating margin to be in a range of 46% to 48%.","In our API segment, we now expect year-over-year top line sales to grow 5% to 7% compared to fiscal 2011 due to the overall expectations of exact timing on orders of key products. However, given our focus on productivity improvement and expense management, we now expect API adjusted gross margin to be in a range of 48% to 50% and adjusted operating margin to be in a range of 28% to 30%.","Execution will continue as the focal point for the organization throughout the rest of the fiscal year. At the same time, there were external factors that affected our performance for the quarter, which we were able to mitigate with strong operational performance. The next months will be busy as we march towards our many new product launches which will further solidify our foundation for continued growth into the future.","Now let me turn it back to Joe.","Joseph C. Papa","Thank you, Judy. As Judy just outlined for you, we had a great quarter. In fiscal 2012, we are on track to launch over 45 new products totaling more than $190 million in sales, as you can see on Slide 13.","We launched the store brand versions of Claritin-D and Rogaine Foam. We launched the generic version of Mucinex 600 milligrams in bottles to a number of customers, and we are now preparing for a full OTC distribution, including the potential to launch NBE blister packaging prior to the next cough, cold, flu season. We still expect to launch the generic versions of Prevacid, with a date certain market formation of May 19, plus Allegra D12 by fiscal year end as well. Year-to-date, we have launched approximately $160 million in new product sales already this year. We are well positioned for a strong new product year in fiscal 2013, with great momentum as we enter into the new year.","One other note on our CHC business. A competitor has temporarily halted the production at a facility that makes OTC products. We believe this issue represents a store brand opportunity of approximately $15 million to $25 million per quarter. We have realized some sales from this opportunity, but we believe there are additional opportunities in the future. We are focusing on a few of the products and are ramping up production to meet that demand. Since this wasn't a product recall, we will look to replace future shipments by the competitor. We believe there will be more of an impact in fiscal 2013, and we will provide an update in the future.","Another branded competitor continues to have difficulties re-entering the analgesic and cough, cold and flu market. We continue to focus on the children's liquids product line, where we have added capacity target $75 million in annual sales. The historically mild season in cough, cold, flu has dampened sales for these products, but we believe that we are well positioned to capture this opportunity in the upcoming fall season.","In the Nutritionals segment, we are pleased to announce that we signed 2 new large customers for our vitamins business. These new sales will begin shipments in our fiscal 2013 time frame, which gives me optimism for growth in this category.","The generic Rx business continues to grow. We are still awaiting final approval from the FDA for our launch of the generic version of Duac. But add this to the continued growth in our Rx products and our Rx-based business, and we expect to have a terrific year for our Rx team.","In summary, we had another strong quarter on a consolidated basis. As our fiscal year winds down, we are poised for a strong new product launches and strong execution. The market continues to realize the value of store brands, and our Rx business continues to outperform our expectations. Perrigo is the right company in the right place at the right time to meet the world's growing need for quality, affordable health care.","Operator, let's now open up the call for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Frank Pinkerton with SunTrust.","Frank H. Pinkerton - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","This one may be a little long but, Joe, can you speak to the $34 million in new products in the quarter? Was there more to that than just Claritin and Rogaine? And given that was a little bit ahead of what I was thinking those kind of products could do, what does that mean about your efficiency of launching and realization of profits from some of these products as we get to some of the larger things like Mucinex, Allegra and Prevacid?","Joseph C. Papa","Okay. So first of all, Frank, the launches in the quarter were -- yes, was more than Claritin, more than Rogaine Foam. Obviously, the fexofenadine still is a new product launch for us, so that was in there as well, which was obviously a very strong product. But on balance, I think what we -- we are, I think -- I'm pleasantly surprised about is the success we're having with these new products. As I said, to date, we're at $160 million, 45 products. Our plan was $190 million of new product sales for the full year. We are well on track to surpass that $190 million, just based on the $64 million we did in the quarter. So we're delighted. We had always stated that we saw our new products second half-weighted, and we continue to say we think they are second half-weighted, which, if we step back from, we think gives us tremendous momentum as we go into our fiscal year 2013. But clearly, the Minoxidil Foam, the Claritin-D, the fexo were all important products for us.","Frank H. Pinkerton - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up, you made a comment about utilization of manufacturing assets on the consumer health side. And maybe this is a broader question, but can you just explain how a light or a mild cough, cold season doesn't translate over into maybe some pre-manufacturing or other things for the Novartis and Johnson & Johnson recalls? I know not all lines are converted 1:1, but was there an ability to maybe pre-manufacture for some of these opportunities in the future? And how certain are we in capturing some of these opportunities?","Joseph C. Papa","Yes. I'll start, Frank, and then Judy may want to add some follow-up. But as I think about it, is there opportunity for us to move some of the manufacturing capacity we have from the weak cough, cold, flu season to pick up some of the opportunities for any of our competitors that run into problems, certainly on the branded side? The answer is yes. And we are doing that and certainly on a product like Excedrin Migraine, we've seen incremental demand for that product, and we continue to ramp up for that demand. The only thing that I was trying to say with the difference on the recall -- I'm sorry, the Novartis situation, we think that, that's a $15 million to $25 million opportunity. But they did not have a recall and, therefore, it wasn't withdrawn from the shelves. It was simply no further product going to the retailer. Therefore, we're really replacing as those future shipments materialize, if you understand my point. It's different than a recall issue. So we're seeing that really materialize now in our fourth quarter of our fiscal year. That's the primary difference from the previous situation where there are actually -- one of the branded competitors had actual recalls in the marketplace, which means that there's an empty shelf that you have to fill immediately. On the other part of -- probably best, Judy, talk more about the entire absorption of what we're trying to accomplish with our business.","Judy L. Brown","So it's all -- it's based on relativity. And as I said, year-over-year, volumes in the plant are just down dramatically. You remember where we were at this point last year, with tremendous pull as a competitor was pulling things off the shelves, and we were meeting normal demand and compensating for that lack -- additional space on the shelves. So the production process was extremely, extremely high last year. And this year, while the procedures within the plant are actually more efficient than they were last year on a per-unit basis, the lack of volume or the relatively lower volume year-over-year just causes a drag on overall fixed cost absorption. So it's not anything that isn't completely reversible when volumes are at a normal pace. But again, it's back to the relative volume dynamics in the plant year-over-year.","Joseph C. Papa","And the $25 million cough, cold, flus that we just didn't ship this year versus what we would've shipped in a normal season. In fact, if we look at the U.S. business -- if I maybe add just one other point, I mentioned the U.S. OTC business was up 8%. If we had to ship that incremental $25 million of cough, cold, flu sales, the U.S. OTC business would've been up somewhere in the 15% range. So it gives you some sense of how we try to manage through a challenging cough, cold, flu season.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gilbert with Bank of America.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'll ask one 3-part question upfront. First, on Rx, what drove the $20 million or so sequential decline from the December quarter? Was there a buy-in in retrospect? Second, Judy, can you talk to the tax rate longer term in light of the comments you made today about the rest of this fiscal year? And third, for Joe, is there a risk that Nexium may not go OTC? Or if it does, that there would be 3 years of exclusivity on that one?","Joseph C. Papa","Yes. I'm going to -- I'll start with the Rx business. I think the Rx business obviously continues to be very strong, Greg, in terms of total. We looked at the growth rate, still very strong. In fact, as we look at it now, we're actually increasing our growth rate to 81% to 83% for the full year. So that was one part of it. Do we have in a quarter some products that just, for example, imiquimod having some additional competition? Yes. I mean, that clearly is part of it. But on balance, we're still seeing very strong growth in our Rx segment. So we feel very positive about that. I'm going to take the Nexium question, and I'll give it back to you, Judy, for the middle question. Do I think that Nexium will go OTC? I believe the answer is yes. Do I -- can I be 100% confident? No. As you know, we do not control that decision. That decision in the U.S. is controlled by the innovator company. But I look at the success they've had with the Prilosec product and look at that and suggest that, that gives them a great opportunity, for AstraZeneca to do something with the Nexium brand. Also, number two, I look at how much direct-to-consumer promotion they put behind the brand. They are clearly establishing Nexium as a very important brand for consumers. So, I think, for those 2 reasons, I do expect to see Nexium go over-the-counter. On the question of the exclusivity, I do believe they will get exclusivity. I do believe they will get a 3-year exclusivity because their current indications are for ulcers and -- I'm not sure what the other one -- I think it's Zollinger-Ellison or something like that. But I do believe they'll get a 3-year exclusivity for the frequent treatment of heartburn. But obviously, that will be up to the FDA. Judy, do you want to take that middle question?","Judy L. Brown","Sure. Effective tax rate. Great question given the volatility we've seen in the tax rate over the course of this particular fiscal year. I'm proud to say that as of right now, we are audited by the major taxing authorities in our major jurisdictions through fiscal year '08, have a few tax audits underway. But the main driver of course in this quarter was the fact that we resolved a few tax audits and had a few additional statutes expire. So we actually go through a process of evaluating the effective tax rate for our current year and, as we look forward, by looking mainly at jurisdictional mix, as well as the process that we have to go through under U.S. GAAP, to put together tax reserves in expectation of eventual tax audit resolution. So that process is reviewed in great detail by our team, by our auditors, of what is an appropriate tax reserve to put in place by jurisdiction and for specific line items? As you saw this year, we've had 2 quarters where there have been positive adjustments, in the first fiscal quarter, as well as in this fiscal quarter, and we're very pleased to be able to announce those results. And at the same time, the key question is, so what's the core rate going forward? As I noted in my prepared remarks, if you take away that onetime adjustment or that tax benefit this quarter, you're back to a core rate of approximately 29%. So to think about next fiscal year and maybe a little bit beyond that, if you assume that the business stays essentially as -- mix stays essentially as it is today, you're exactly back to where we were in our original, beginning-of-the-year, pretax audit tax rate guidance which, if you remember, was 29% to 31%. And that's exactly where I would be modeling next year. In fact, that's where we're going to be modeling next year as a starting point as we think about FY '13. So core rate, 29% to 31%. And this year, we had the benefit of releasing those tax reserves in accordance with U.S. GAAP at the completion of these tax audits.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Auriga.","Louise A. Chen - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division","First question I had was, what gives you confidence that the weakness that we've seen in CHC relative to expectations this year is due more to the timing of your launches and not deteriorating fundamentals or slowing growth in the OTC category? And then the second question I had was on the margins. It looks like you continued to expand your margins quite a bit. And can you talk about where that could go to over the longer term? And then the last question is just the breakout in sales between -- in CHC between cough, cold and allergy, as allergy becomes a larger part of your overall business.","Joseph C. Papa","Okay. So a lot of good questions there. Let me try to take them all in sequence. First of all, our confidence in the business from the Consumer Healthcare, I think, is driven by 2 factors, the first one being that if you -- there was clearly a weak cough, cold, flu season. We've absolutely recognized that, and it's been a historically weak or mild cough, cold, flu season. So that wasn't really a surprise. That amount of dollars that we had determined is somewhere around $25 million of sales that we would have realized, were it to be a normal cough, cold, flu season. In the U.S. numbers, we believe that the U.S. numbers grew 8%. However, when I added back that -- a normal cough, cold, flu season, the U.S. would be running at somewhere around a 15% growth rate. I think that's an important driver for how things are going relative to the business. The other point I would focus your attention on, to this question in terms of confidence, is that if you look at our Page 6 in the handout, you can see from the all category update 2 things. Number one, if you look at the total OTC market where we are playing, although the market is flat, up 0.6%, you see the store brand continuing to gain market share, up at 6.8%. So a majority of the growth in the category is being driven by store brand, and we continue to gain share in the overall OTC market. And we expect that to continue based on everything we're seeing with our patients. So that part is clearly one other important reason for our confidence. The final point I would mention that gives reason for being confident is that, as I mentioned in my comments, we also look not only at the growth in the 52 Week Data, but we also looked at the latest quarterly data. And the latest quarterly data was up even more than the 6%. So those reasons is why we felt the opportunity was bigger than just -- actually, store brands were up 6.8%. If you look at the quarterly data, it was up 7.6%. So it's an accelerating quarterly number there. On the questions of margin, as we look at margins, we've been very pleased with the results we've seen. As you -- we talked about a 22% operating margin. The team has just done an absolute fabulous job, 22.1%, in growing our operating margin, up 250 basis points versus last year, up 70 basis points just versus the last quarter, quarter 2. So it's been a great operating margin story in terms of leverage, and we're continuing to look to that. Obviously, as we look at any quarter though, we don't want to -- we're also thinking about next year, so we want to make sure we're balancing all of our levers and -- as we push and pull levers. So we felt that we had a great quarter at $1.41, and that's really the way we looked at it. The final question you had was...","Louise A. Chen - Auriga USA LLC, Research Division","On the CHC sales, the breakout between cough and cold versus...","Joseph C. Papa","Oh, allergies. Yes. Yes, we don't give out that specific breakdown, Louise. Obviously, though, in the allergy season, we feel very good about what we have relative to the launch of the fexofenadine, the Loratadine, the Claritin-D or Loratadine-D 12. So all of those being -- obviously and the Cetirizine. So all of those are clearly driving our total gestalt of what we've got in our business in terms of allergy. But we really just don't break out the individual allergy versus cough, cold, flu.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a few, Joe and Judy. First question is, Joe, you were very helpful in quantifying the $25 million hit from the weak cold and flu season. Can you also quantify the upside from J&J not being on the market? Novartis, you did address, but they certainly weren't shipping in the -- what we thought was a strong and early allergy season. Secondly, if you can provide some color around where -- what we can expect for Delsym? My understanding is that you got tentative approval in April 2011, followed by summary judgment in December, and we just -- we're surprised that we haven't yet seen final approval, and what you think the holdup is. And then finally, Joe, what is the next milestone in the FDA's considering a new Rx-OTC paradigm? And where are we with PDUFA legislation?","Joseph C. Papa","Okay. You have great questions, Jami. Let me try to make sure I get them all. Certainly, in the quantification of the weak cough, cold, flu season, somewhere around $25 million is our best number, as you stated. J&J, as we said last year, we were at the run rate of about $50 million of the analgesic liquids. At this point, we built up our capacity to go to the $75 million or an additional 50% improvement in our capacity. I will say though, that we did not get anywhere close to that $75 million because of the weak cough, cold, flu season. So it is -- in fact, I would guess the total cough, cold -- I don't have the exact number in front of me, but it's probably stable to down versus last year in terms of our analgesic liquids total for the J&J side. So it's really once again a big impact of what's going on with the weak cough, cold, flu season. Novartis, I think I mentioned sufficiently. It's $15 million to $25 million, but we have just not seen it yet, really because it's not a recall. It is just a -- they stopped shipping, and what we're doing is gearing up our manufacturing to get ready for that. Final -- the final part of your question was Delsym, at least on this section. All of the data you stated was correct. There was a tentative approval. The part -- this is a partnered product in that I do not control this. This is my partner controlling it. While I don't want to speculate exactly on the issue, I will say that we believe the issue -- the situation now is really dealing with one of the DMF suppliers of the raw material inspection that was required, and we expect to get that approval any day. But that is one of the things that -- we just don't control that one directly as this is a...","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So it's not a manufacturing -- it's not a manufacturing challenge or a batch challenge?","Joseph C. Papa","No. I don't believe it's a manufacturing. I think it's a DMF inspection from the FDA that was just -- is lagging. It's an overseas inspection that needs to happen. And that really is what the issue is for that one. The last comment was FDA and the Rx-to-OTC paradigm switch. That's a tough call. We have had meetings with Fred Upton, who's the chair of the committee that oversees the PDUFA legislation. I don't know exactly what's going to happen with that. I would say though, that as we look at this, I do think it's going to take a couple of years for the FDA to sort this out in terms of what's happening. But I think the good news is that the FDA recognizes that there's opportunities here to make more products available over-the-counter. The good news is that some of these categories like migraine products, like statins are very large, sizable products -- allergy products. And if some of those products move from prescription to OTC, we obviously think that would be good for consumers. They'd make greater availability of product available, or greater accessibility of products. So I think that would be good. And obviously, I think the other part that's driving the commissioner of the FDA is the desire to lower health care cost. And I think that's the other part of the paradigm. So I can't say exactly what's going to happen. I think it's at least a couple of years off. But if it does happen, obviously, we think that's great news for consumers in terms of availability and access. But obviously, good news for Perrigo.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Joe, can I just ask a quick follow-up? And I'm sorry, because I know there are a lot of other people on the phone. But you had said with J&J and Novartis, you didn't see a benefit this quarter because of the still weak allergy season. But you had really only focused on the liquid analgesics. What about the benefit from everything else, from J&J not getting their act together and getting back on the market?","Joseph C. Papa","Yes. Well, J&J -- first of all, J&J has some products back in the market. Where they had the problem in the recent quarter was they relaunched the liquid analgesic product, starting at the end of the -- let me think -- the end of the fourth quarter calendar 2011. They relaunched it, and then they had to recall that out of the market. That's the real area where we have focused on our upside. The rest of the product that J&J has had really did not make a significant contribution to our numbers, simply because we're not really focused on some of those lower-margin opportunities. They tend to be the older products and therefore, they haven't been material in our opportunity upside as we looked at the business. Just one quick clarification. On Novartis, we did see some incremental demand for products like Excedrin Migraine, the store brand version of that. But that hasn't been -- once again, it really wasn't -- because it wasn't a recall. We're really just filling the new orders for the retailers. It hasn't been something that we had to fill an entire pipeline. The real opportunity for Novartis, we think, will be in our fourth quarter and our fiscal 2013 as those products are just emptying off the shelf. That's where we will refill the demand at that point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have a couple of questions. First, Judy, could you please just talk a little bit more about other income this quarter and what we should expect for the fourth quarter?","Judy L. Brown","Sure. On the Other Income Other Expense line, there was an item as we have completed the exit of our German facility. If you remember, we had an API facility that had been functioning there for years. And we closed it down, sold the assets approximately 1.5 years ago, and the remaining component of that was finally selling the service rights that we had at that facility. And hence, you see a onetime -- a good guy of approximately $5 million on the Other Income line as we sold those rights, which were a previous income stream on that same line but just smaller. So on a go-forward basis, if you were to remove the onetime $5 million good guy there, that would be a more reasonable run rate below the line, before earnings, before tax. Back to just basically the interest expense that you see booked.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then changing gears to the prescription segment, Glenmark got imiquimod approved, and Medicis is obviously promoting the new ZYCLARA Pump. Could you just talk about whether that will impact your business in any noticeable way?","Joseph C. Papa","Yes. This is Joe. I do think that there will be some contribution or some loss of some market share for the imiquimod product on the new competitors. Some pricing but it's not -- obviously we still feel very -- that we've got very strong growth in our Rx business and why we've been able to increase our revenue guidance for the Rx from the, let's call it, the 70% range to the 80% -- over 80% range. So we still feel very strong about the growth. It's just really -- we're going to see a product have some challenges, but we're going to see, clearly, launches of new products. The other thing, though, that is probably more important than that is that on some of the older products, what we're really seeing is a favorable pricing environment in our Rx business. We've been able to look at pricing on some of the products that -- where we're first, but also where we're last with our products, and that's really been probably the more important aspect, rather than any individual product. ZYCLARA is making inroads into the imiquimod product sales. So that's why I don't want to believe [ph] that one out. They are gaining some share there.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just sort of bigger picture. Obviously, consumer was weaker than expected. Generics was above. Could you talk about how that's going to transition over the course of the next year? Meaning, could you provide a framework for how much you think the consumer business can accelerate and start to grow as a percentage of the business?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Well, I don't want to talk about our fiscal year '13. We'll really talk more about that -- specifics on that for our August meeting. That's when we'll talk about the upcoming year. But just in general comments, what do we think is going to happen? I think the key drivers in our Consumer Healthcare business are still the same. Number one, it's still the movement from national brands to store brands. That's the clear big driver in terms of the absolute movement in unit volume. And you're seeing that from the IRI data that we presented and, importantly, even seeing it accelerate in the quarterly data, which we've seen as well. Number two for us in the Consumer Healthcare business is really going to be all about the launch of these new products. As we said, for the total business, we've got over $190 million of product launches, 45 new products. What we clearly are seeing though, that the majority of the big products are our second half-weighted products, now that we've launched the Rogaine Foam, the Claritin-D, the Mucinex. As we get ready for Prevacid, which is a May 19 event, those will be important drivers for the growth of our next year, as well as putting in the Fexofenadine D12 [indiscernible] some products. So that is really what we expect to be the bigger driver for our business, which -- we've always talked about our Consumer Healthcare business absent -- just looking at it from an organic point of view, we've always talked about it being in the 5% to 10% high-single-digit rate. As I think about that, we put these new products in, you get some bolus from the new products. But that's got to be high-single digits to low-double digit for our -- for the Consumer Healthcare. The Rx team, they've continued to perform. And they've just done, I think, a fabulous job with the integration of the Paddock. And what I talked about, and I just want to make sure the subtlety is clear, not only did they do well with the integration effort, but they are actually gaining market share with what they've done with the Paddock product. So we got the Paddock product, but they also gained incremental customers with those products, as well as gaining share with our own business as we become more important to the retailers. I think Judy said it very well in the presentation. The Rx business clearly is under the synergy of 1 plus 1 equals 3, is really what we've seen in our Rx business. So I do expect continued strong growth in that business. I don't know we'll be able to talk about 80% growth next year, but we certainly expect strong growth, certainly organically and above the double-digits rate for the Rx business. But I probably don't want to make many more comments beyond that.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And one final question. Could you just talk in a little bit more detail and maybe quantify the J&J liquid versus tablet benefit, since you mentioned that you're not really focused on the lower-margin tablet opportunity?","Joseph C. Papa","Yes, I don't know if I can say much more to it. I think the real upside that we experienced over the last several years because of the J&J issue was on the pediatric suspensions. We've stated that previously, last year, we did about $50 million, but we were constrained by our ability to supply product. We did ramp up this year to go up to about $75 million of product. We have the additional capacity to do that for suspensions, and this is very special technology. So that's why it took us the better part of a year to do it. We have that capacity. Unfortunately, the very weak or mild cough, cold, flu season has resulted in less demand than even last year. So we're there. We're ready with the capacity. We'll just have to wait and see if next year's season is sufficient to be able to come back into this with the full $75 million opportunity. The tablets for us were really almost meaningless. I mean, they didn't really drive -- we didn't go after them. They weren't that big of items for us. Remember, many of these products are Tylenol tablets that have been around for, I don't know the exact year, but 50 years. And as a result, they're not -- they're monograph products without significant margin opportunities. Therefore, for -- as you know, we focus on return on invested capital. They weren't big opportunities for us. We -- did we pick up some? Yes. But it wasn't a major opportunity for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky with Canaccord Genuity.","Randall Stanicky - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I'll just keep it to one 2-part question. You're coming up on the anniversary of your last sizable acquisition. So can you just, Joe and Judy, maybe talk about deal appetite and then the attractiveness of vet care as a tangential opportunity?","Joseph C. Papa","Okay. So good question. And you're absolutely correct there. Our last deal we did -- large major deal was Paddock. It closed in July. But we did a small deal, CanAm, but that was in the $40 million range. So the last big deal was -- for M&A was Paddock. Relative to where we -- what we think about M&A? Clearly, we still believe there are opportunities to leverage our strategy and drive operating margins for our business with M&A. I would say the good news is that we don't feel we need to do M&A. We think we've got a good organic growth rate. However, if we can find M&A activities that hit our strategy, which would be continuing to grow our store brand private label business, as well as add critical mass in Rx, or going after geographic expansion -- if they can hit those strategic advances and they also passed our return on invested capital hurdle, we're going to keep looking at them. I do think there's more out there. And you happened to pick one specific category that we believe makes sense, pet care. And that's -- think of the item for dogs and cats. Companion animals is what we're thinking about there. But we're also interested in a number of other ones. We also think -- continuing to look at diabetes, looking at the growth of what's happening in diabetes. Really, it is -- obesity and diabetes is really becoming an epidemic, and that's something we are going to continue to look at, diabetes and also the effects of obesity on what it could mean for the store brand private label. We also really strongly believe in what we're looking at for adult nutrition. Think of things like Special K diet, think of Muscle Milk [indiscernible] Ensure, Ensure plus. Those kind of store brand opportunities, we think, make a lot of sense as well. We also think wound care is an important item. This really spins off of that diabetic comment as well. But those, I think, would be most of the areas. Judy, do you want to touch on that as well?","Judy L. Brown","And I was just going to add to that, that the funnel of opportunities that we're looking at is fairly robust right now. The amount of flexibility we have in our balance sheet. Now fortunately, with the performance we've seen and with the strength of the balance sheet, we have a lot of depth to do a variety of activities. But patience is a virtue in this process. And as we've talked about before in our other transactions, you have to have a lot of shots on goal and a lot of patience in this process. So as you know, we focus on ROIC. So to Joe's point, a lot of things we're looking at. But if there's an expectation that there's a deal announced every x months, you might be disappointed. We go through the process and are diligent in that.","Randall Stanicky - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Well, Judy, are these deals in the size perhaps of PBM Holdings-type of a deal? I mean, are you seeing private opportunities of that magnitude out there?","Judy L. Brown","There are opportunities of that magnitude, yes.","Joseph C. Papa","Yes, I would agree.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Buck with Buckingham Research.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I'll try to keep it to a couple of quick questions. First, on consumer health, Joe, can you give a little bit more detail in terms of what the dollar value was in GI, and whether that was just omeprazole or whether it was other products? Just on type of magnitude there. Secondly, on consumer health, to make the 9% revenue growth, it looks like you need to do about 18% growth in the June quarter, which is obviously a big step up from 6%. So can you talk about maybe a little bit more of your confidence in getting there? And then if we look at the Rx business, unfortunately, you had a death of an executive in the past quarter. Can you talk about what the plans are for replacement and of the management team there? And then Duac, what are the gating factors in terms of the launching?","Joseph C. Papa","What part? Okay. You've got...","Judy L. Brown","Good job.","Joseph C. Papa","I'll try to get every one of them, David, but if I leave any out, I'll [indiscernible]. On the first comment though, it's really Consumer Healthcare, what's happening with omeprazole. Really, it is omeprazole that was impacting the GI category for us, but there's nothing unexpected there. We had anticipated giving up some share. And indeed, we talked about that, going back now for about -- it's about 6 months ago that it happened. And then we also talked about it -- it would have -- it would contribute to gross margin, and that's happened. That is behind us. What I would say positively about GI though, is the volume continues to expand and we're growing the product, notwithstanding the pricing hit that we took going back -- like I said, it was about 6 months ago. Over the last 6 months, the GI category has been very stable. The good news, we think, is that what we're seeing is more and more patients transferring from the older therapy of antacid tablets, H2 antagonists, moving over proton pumps. And that's only going to accelerate, we believe, with the Lansoprazole or Prevacid launch on May 19. So in general, we think our GI category is very robust. We await the outcome -- or the launch of the Lansoprazole or the Prevacid product on or about May 19 is obviously the next important milestone. Your numbers are correct, David, on the CHC side in terms of growth. We are expecting significant growth. And once again, what's the drivers? The drivers are these new products we've talked about, continuing to see the good, strong growth for Rogaine Foam, Claritin-D, the Mucinex, but then also adding to that the Prevacid, the fexofenadine and potentially Delsym, although that's a little uncertain because it's outside of our control. It's not -- it's a partnered product. So it's going to be the new products that's going to drive the real -- the growth in that in terms of the second half effect. I also do think that we will pick up some international sales. We didn't talk as much about international, but international was a little bit of a lagger this quarter. We will expect to see some additional growth internationally for our business and also in what we call our contract segment of our Consumer Healthcare business. On the next question you asked, we did experience a very unfortunate passing of our dear friend, Rafi Lebel. He was not directly responsible for the Rx business though, just to correct one comment. He was responsible for our API business as well as many of our activities in Israel, which includes some of the Rx R&D that occurs in Israel. The only thing I would say about our dear friend Rafi, who's passed away, is he has built a great team and really, the team is just doing an outstanding job of stepping up in Rafi's absence or Rafi's dying during the quarter. Final comment, Duac, I can't say. This is just hung up at the FDA. It's a first product approval for the category. We expect it any day. But to be clear, it is hung up. There was an inspection of a raw material supplier that has had to occur with this product as well. And I know that has occurred. And then there's been a reinspection of that raw material supplier, so I do expect to see this product approved in the near future, David. But you know, I don't want to make a comment to say that it's going to occur this month or next month. I do expect it though -- if you ask me, the expectation, it is that we will see it in the current fiscal year. However, I have to put the caution that, that's -- it's in the FDA's hands right now. But the important part, it is a first approval for this category. So we do think we will get the expedited look and review by the FDA. But we -- we're ready when it happens.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ami Fadia with UBS.","Ami Fadia - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. I'll stick with 2 questions. Firstly, for Consumer Healthcare, do you think it's reasonable to expect the operating margins to trend towards 20%, something which you've talked about before, once we have some of these new products launched? That's one. And the second one, for the nutritions business, how should we think about growth going forward? Should we think about it as tied directly just to the birth rates? Or do you still anticipate that there could be some share gains that could sort of accelerate the growth rate?","Joseph C. Papa","Yes. Good questions. On the Consumer Healthcare, the operating margin, do I think in the longer term it will trend up? The answer is yes. Do I -- I think what we've looked at is it -- clearly, at this point, is not. We've talked about a forecast between a 17% to 19% for our future. I do think there's an opportunity to get to the 20% range, but it's not going to be this year. It'll be some point into the future as we launch our new products. To me, the real message on the adjusted operating margin for Consumer Healthcare is really the story about the new products, because that's really where -- when we launch those new products, we don't drive expenses from the SG&A side. It really is an opportunity to leverage the P&L. And that's, when we launch these new products, when we expect to see the higher operating margin for Consumer Healthcare. Remember though, in the first couple of quarters that we launch, there is some incremental display expense, other expenses as we get out there with the new products. But after that, that's when we'll really see the returns from the Consumer Healthcare new products. On the question of Nutritionals, it's 2 functions. Number one, it's the birth rate. That clearly is part of it. The other part of it though, in terms of growth for us beyond the birth rate, is what we do to gain store brand share here in the United States and then, number two, what we do outside of the United States. It is both those factors that we think will help us to drive our business. If we took away the onetime effect of what happened with one of our branded -- the branded recall of infant formula last year, we're seeing very good growth. I think the number was 12%, if I'm not mistaken. So we feel very good about the infant formula business. And I certainly would say, just based on what -- it appears [indiscernible] for the Pfizer infant formula business, you see it's a very valuable business, and we're delighted to have that -- our infant formula version of that business.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just 2 quick ones. First on the Novartis opportunity, how sustainable do you see that if in fact we see Novartis back in the market, let's say, in calendar '13 and there's not this prolonged period of national brand absence? I think you mentioned that $15 million to $20 million opportunity. Is that something you can hold over time? Or just how do you think about that? Second is on Nutritional gross margins, this 28% to 30% range. How should we kind of think about that evolving over time? I know there's a number of initiatives you have in place here. But as we think out to like maybe 2013, 2014, is that a number you think you can significantly improve from here? Or should we think about just maybe incremental improvements from this new gross margin target?","Joseph C. Papa","Okay. First on Novartis, I mean, I think you'd have to go with the Novartis guidance they gave relative to when they will be back in the market. We're going to take Novartis a quarter at a time, is really the way we always take it with any company that we see has run into problems from an FDA issue, because I can't give you better guidance than they give you. Right now, we heard that they will be -- it will take them longer than the midyear calendar 2012 to get back in the market. So we do expect it to be slightly longer than where they were at the first announcement of this issue. On the question though, we do think there's about a $15 million to $25 million per quarter issue out there in the marketplace for store brand, our opportunity. We're not going to get all of it, but we do think we'll get a certain share of it, especially on some of the flu products and also the products that are the Excedrin Migraine-type products. Those are the ones we'll pick up. We'll pick up some other liquid-type products, et cetera, just simply because we're in there, but they're not higher-margin opportunities for us. So do I think we can be somewhere in the $10 million to $15 million range once this market stabilized? I do think that, that's the kind of opportunity we're talking about in terms of Perrigo achieving somewhere in that $10-plus million range of opportunities on a quarterly basis. But I want to be really cautious on the duration. I don't want to overstate the duration. Really, it's one -- I can't say how long it'll be. It's up to Novartis to determine when they'll get back in. I think they've got 2 problems. One of them is a relatively quick fix. The other one's a longer fix. And it just depends on how the FDA views that item that has a longer fix in terms of duration. On the question of Nutritional gross margin, we clearly are taking steps to improve Nutritional gross margin. As you can see, we've taken some steps. The operating margin improved dramatically as a result of some of the things we've done here quarter-versus-quarter, last -- second quarter versus third quarter. So those are steps that we are going to take. Do I believe that one of the things we did was lower the cost of one of our more expensive raw materials? Did I -- did we get that done? Yes. Will we look at pricing going into the future for our products? The answer to that, we told you previously, is yes. We will get better pricing out in the marketplace. That's occurring now as we speak, not though -- it hasn't shown up in the last quarter that we're reporting. It's showing up now in our fiscal fourth quarter. So those things are going to help me to drive the operating margin. The other part, though, of operating margin will be back to the comments Judy made about capacity utilization as we drive demand for our 2 facilities, both the one in Vermont and our one in Ohio. That utilization of our facility will drive the rest of our operating margin. The final comment I would offer in nutrition is VMS. VMS is a -- it's a rocky road here relative to what's happening with our Vitamin\/Mineral Supplements. We believe that when the FDA truly enforces some of the requirements for products made in the U.S. as they look at some of the overseas manufacturers, we think that could help us. But the bigger opportunity that's going to help us in the near term right now from a gross margin point of view is what we're doing with new business with new customers right here in the United States. So I think that's going to be the shorter-term improvement that we expect to see in our Nutritional gross margin.","Judy L. Brown","So empirically, Chris, is there opportunity to get gross margins back up? Yes. And we're working on actions to get them to where they were in previous quarters.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair.","Jon Andersen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I guess I'll make it a 2-parter. Just taking omeprazole out of the equation, I know focusing on maintaining price in OTC has been important to you over the past several years. So again, taking omeprazole out, have you been able to maintain your pricing on your other product lines? And is that your expectation going forward? And then second, just an update on temozolomide in the U.S.","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Good question. If you remove omeprazole from the Consumer Healthcare business, the pricing environment in our Consumer Healthcare business is essentially flat. I will say, we planned for that. We -- all of our plans were that we would face some challenges in omeprazole. And indeed, those did come to fruition and -- but take that out of the equation, our pricing is flat. The good news is that while our pricing is flat, we're continuing to drive efficiencies in our raw material supplies, and that's where we think we can continue to drive that and help us to get continued improvements in our operating margins, as well as just the important point I was talking about before, is launching these new products. I'm sorry, the second part of that was?","Judy L. Brown","Temo.","Jon Andersen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Temo U.S....","Joseph C. Papa","Temo. Yes, temo U.S. is very straightforward. We will launch that, August 2013. That product will be launched in August 2013. We have a partner with that, but that -- nothing will happen until -- that will be our fiscal year '14, just as a reminder to everybody. So that product launch -- I will say though, just -- you didn't ask about the x U.S., but x U.S. continues to do well. There's always going to be some ups and downs with an API supplier in terms of how you recognize the value. But there's not a lot of competition out with temozolomide, so we do think it's a good foreshadowing of opportunities here in the United States.","Well, thank you, everyone, for your interest in Perrigo today.

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Art Shannon, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Arthur J. Shannon","Thank you very much, Vernell.

A copy of the press release is available on our website at www.perrigo.com.

Joe?","Joseph C. Papa","Thank you, Art, and welcome, everyone, to Perrigo's third quarter fiscal 2013 earnings conference call. Joining me today is Judy Brown, Perrigo's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","For our agenda today, I will provide a few comments on the quarter and the continued strength in store-brand market share growth. Next, Judy will go through the details of the quarter and our fiscal 2013 earnings guidance. Then I will provide an update on each business, including the transition to plastic containers in our infant formula business, our plans for new product launches, plus an overview of our expectations for the rest of the fiscal year. Finally, this will be followed by an opportunity for Q&A. First, let's discuss the quarter.","This was another great quarter for Perrigo. On Slide 4, you can see we had all-time record quarterly net sales of $920 million, with 18% net sales growth and 13% organic net sales growth, leading to all-time high third quarter adjusted gross and operating margins. Adjusted operating income grew 21% year-over-year, and the adjusted margin expanded to 22.6%.","Turning to Slide 5, you can see the business segment breakdown. First, our Consumer Healthcare segment had all-time record quarterly sales, up 20% versus last year. The performance was driven by ongoing execution of our Consumer Healthcare strategies including: one, to expand store-brand market share at retail; two, to innovate and launch new products; and three, to further expand into adjacent categories.","This quarter, we had new product sales of $17 million, led by the launch of our Mucinex store-brand tablet on March 18. Admittedly, that's a little later than we would have liked, but we're still great -- it's great to have it out there in the marketplace. The nicotine mini lozenges were also launched on January 22, and the contribution of our Dextromethorphan suspension launched in our fiscal first quarter. It was a much more pervasive cough\/cold\/flu season than last year, which was historically a mild season last year. However, this is offset by a later start to this year's allergy seasons versus last year.","Sales in our Nutritionals segment were up 13% from last year, with growth at all product categories. The launch of the plastic containers in the infant formula category continues on schedule and is being heavily promoted by many of our retailers. The vitamin and mineral supplement business also improved its sales as a result of additional retail orders for our store brands.","Our Rx business had another strong quarter, with sales increasing 22% compared to a record third quarter last year. Adjusted operating income was up 14%, primarily the result of new product sales of $18 million. Our API segment had a good quarter, with net sales growing over $4 million and with improving margins.","Looking at Slide 6, the recent trend of conversion from national brands to store brand continues. The overall OTC consumer market was up nearly 3% versus last year with national brands, flat, but with store brands gaining 8.7% on the strength of new product launches, national brand recalls and increased consumer acceptance of store brands. In nearly every category, store brands drove the market growth.","The diabetes category experienced tremendous store brand growth of nearly 13%, while the overall category was up less than 3%. Gastrointestinal category was relatively flat, while store brands grew 11.3%. Store brands continue to deliver more value to our consumers and retailers in the marketplace.","Now let me turn the call over to Judy.","Judy L. Brown","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. As you just heard, it was yet another solid quarter. On a consolidated basis, the team continues its strong performance, delivering record quarterly revenue and adjusted earnings. I'll provide consolidated and segment earnings guidance for the remainder of the year in a few minutes but first, I'll give a brief review of our fiscal 2013 third quarter results.","On Slide 7, you can see net sales in the Consumer Healthcare segment grew 20% year-over-year due to an increase in sales of existing products of $54 million, primarily in the contract cough\/cold and analgesic categories; new product sales of approximately $17 million, primarily in the cough\/cold and smoking cessation categories; and $31 million attributable to our entering into the new animal health category through the acquisition of Sergeant's.","According to IMS FAN data, the percent of the population affected by cough, cold and flu in the quarter ended March 30 was up 13.9% versus the same time last year. This increase, in conjunction with our March 18 launch of Guaifenesin ER 600 milligrams, added to the robust CHC performance to the quarter. These combined increases were partially offset by a decline of $9 million in sales of existing products across a variety of smaller categories and the discontinuance of some smaller products totaling $4 million. The increase in adjusted CHC gross margin was due to a few factors: first, favorable dynamics of the strong cough, cold and flu season versus last year's historically mild season led to favorable absorption of fixed production costs on higher volume output in our manufacturing facilities; second, the contribution of new products; and third, the inclusion of a full quarter of Sergeant's Pet Care, which, as mentioned previously, produces a higher corporate average gross margin.","The adjusted operating margin increased by a lesser amount than the adjusted gross margin as dollar spending on DSG&A was higher year-over-year. The majority of the increase in operating expenses arose from the acquisition of Sergeant's. Please remember that at the time of our acquisition of Sergeant's, we noted that this company, which was primarily a value-brand business, spends a relatively higher percent to net sales on advertising and promotion activities than legacy Perrigo.","On Slide 8, you can see that net sales within the Nutritionals segment increased 13% year-over-year. As Joe noted, all product categories within the segment grew, and net new product sales contributed an additional $5 million. It was a positive story on the top line for the segment. One item we continue to watch closely, though, is our product sales to our Chinese distribution partners, which, unfortunately, were less than expected for the quarter and which are now tracking below our internal expectations on a year-to-date basis. Even though there's adequate demand, testing and regulation requirements continue to fluctuate, making it difficult for non-Chinese-based providers of infant formula to get product on the shelves. We are working through these issues diligently and are optimistic that a conclusion could be reached soon.","Adjusted gross margin in the segment decreased 290 basis points due to a combination of 2 main factors. First, on a relative basis, VMS, which is a lower margin category, grew at a faster rate than infant formula in the quarter. And second, compared to last year, there were relatively higher production inefficiencies as the infant formula manufacturing facilities continue to work through the conversion from metal cans to the new plastic tubs, which was launched in December. Throughout the fiscal third quarter, the primary operational focus was to convert as many retailers to our new tub as possible. However, this came at a cost to our margins as our operational throughput was not near our optimal run rate. As of today, though, our manufacturing facilities are back in line to pre-conversion run rates. The adjusted Nutritionals operating margin was lower year-over-year due to the investment in promotional and merchandising aids for the new SmarTub conversion and other new product launches during the quarter.","On Slide 9, you can see that our Rx business continues along the positive growth trajectory we have seen over the last several quarters. Net sales growth was led by new product sales of $18 million, which included 2 new foams, betamethasone and clobetasol emulsion, followed by $8 million in additional net sales contribution from our Rosemont acquisition, which closed on February 11, and an increase in existing product sales of $7 million. I'm pleased to note that our organic Rx business continues to perform well, with year-over-year revenue growth of 16% even before the inclusion of Rosemont.","Rx's adjusted gross margin of 57.9% was again something to be proud of. Although, as you can see, it did decrease slightly from last year due to relative product mix, partially offset by the positive impact of the acquisition of Cobrek. The adjusted operating margin was impacted by higher distribution, selling, general and administrative costs due both to the inclusion of Rosemont and the non-recurrence of some administrative benefit received last year.","Next, on Slide 10, you will see that the API segment grew net sales 11%, primarily on the continued success of our customers' products, which was launched in our fourth quarter fiscal 2012. Both adjusted gross and operating profit increased 12% on this top line growth. This quarter, the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 29.9%, within the 29% to 31% guidance range we provided for this fiscal year.","Now some quick highlights on the balance sheet. Excluding cash and cash equivalents, working capital was $723 million at the end of the quarter, up from $607 million at this time last year. Approximately half of this increase was due to the additional working capital from the Sergeant's and Rosemont acquisitions, with the remainder from our existing businesses where working capital grew at a rate slightly below our top line organic growth rate. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $380 million as compared to $312 million in the prior year, primarily on the growth of net income.","As of March 30, 2013, total current and long-term debt on the face of the balance sheet was $1.4 billion, flat sequentially from last quarter. Excluding cash and cash equivalents, our net debt to total capital at the end of the third quarter fiscal 2013 was 32.6%. As you know, we've always maintained the philosophy of having a very strong balance sheet and maintaining an investment grade credit profile. Some of you may have noted that this morning, Perrigo filed a Form S-3 registration statement with the SEC. As you've seen from past actions in both the private placement market and with our bank group, we are continually refining our capital structure to improve our access to markets, to enhance flexibility and provide liquidity to execute our strategies and to target efficient, low-cost financing options, all while retaining our financial discipline. The filing of this debt shelf registration statement today is just another positive step in support of our stated long-standing capital structure objectives and corporate strategies.","Our business development team has been busy this fiscal year-to-date, closing 4 acquisitions worth greater than $770 million, which, I'm happy to report, we were able to fund entirely with cash on hand. As you certainly noticed, we've had a rhythmic cadence of strategic acquisitions over the past few quarters and as such, we have also been working systematically to integrate these new organizations into the Perrigo infrastructure. As we noted in 2012, we're actively building an internal integration core competence with a dedicated cross-functional team focused exclusively on integrating these new businesses quickly, efficiently and in a way that retains key talent while finding synergies where possible.","Now I'd like to discuss our earnings guidance for the fiscal 2013. On Slides 11 and 12, you'll notice that we are not making any adjustments to our segment or consolidated P&L guidance for the full fiscal year at this time. While we're not changing our total top line expectations from the February 11 guidance, we are lowering expectations of the contribution which will come from new products. Specifically, we are lowering our probability waits on the launches of certain new products, particularly within the Rx segment, as it is becoming increasingly difficult to precisely forecast exact approval dates due to what we believe is a slowdown in regulatory processes. Incorporating this factor into our risk-adjusted model, we now expect fiscal 2013 consolidated new product revenue to be approximately $130 million. Please note that these guidance ranges do include the acquisitions of Rosemont and Velcera, both of which closed subsequent to our last earnings release date. The only other adjustment you'll note on Slide 12 is the slight adjustment downward to our CapEx spending, which is now expected to be in a range of between $110 million and $140 million for the full year. With the very late arrival of spring in Michigan, some of our plant expansion work is only now kicking off and as such, has moved our timeline back slightly from our last forecast.","Once again, the team delivered on strong operational performance as evidenced by another record quarter for revenue and adjusted earnings per share. While we're disappointed to have to adjust our new product expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are pleased that the rest of our business performance should compensate for this change. As always, we remain committed to investing over the long term internally and through external investments while we continue to focus on solid execution as the basis for continued growth.","And let me turn it back to Joe.","Joseph C. Papa","Thank you, Judy. Now I want to focus on the future. Let me turn your attention to Slide #13. The Mucinex store-brand launch went very well, and we are now positioned for the current allergy season and, of course, will gear up for next year's cough\/cold\/flu season. In January, we launched the store-band version of Nicorette Mini Lozenges, with approximately $30 million in branded sales, continuing our leadership position in the smoking cessation category.","Just last week, we launched our second ophthalmic product, the store-brand version of Refresh Plus, with brand sales of approximately $12 million. It's great work by the team. To be clear, our updated new product guidance reflect delays in new product approvals. It is important to note that we do continue to expect these products to launch in the future, which should give us a strong tailwind into next fiscal year and beyond.","Our pet care business is very well positioned to grow in the future as we recently closed on the Velcera acquisition. This adds retailers and a strong new product pipeline to our offering. The high-cost market of pet care fits perfectly into our model of making quality pet care more affordable. This category is expected to have $200 million sales, in annual sales for us in fiscal year 2014, and we expect to grow this business, continuing beyond that.","I'm pleased to announce that recently, PetSmart, North America's largest pet care specialty retailer, has awarded Sergeant's Pet Care with their coveted Vendor of the Year award. We're delighted to receive this award. In our Nutritionals business, highlighted on Slide 14, we are very excited about the upgrade to what we believe is better than national brand style packaging. As mentioned earlier, store brands are growing faster than the national brands. During the quarter, Perrigo received clearance to manufacture 3 CODEX-compliant infant formulas for international markets, which underscores the high-quality standards of Perrigo, opening up more international opportunities.","Turning to Slide #15. The generic Rx business is positioned very well for growth. We've executed strong new product launches in the quarter with recently announced launches of the generic versions of Acetadote, Olux-E and Luxiq Foam and look forward to launching additional undisclosed products. We expect to close the year with strong tailwinds heading into fiscal year '14 for our Rx team.","As Judy noted, we executed 4 deals this year using cash while maintaining our strong balance sheet. Our entry into pet care is going very well as we closed Velcera this past month. In Rx, we signed and closed the acquisition of Rosemont Pharmaceuticals, which manufactures and markets oral, liquid pharmaceutical dosages in the U.K. All of these deals are financially attractive and provide a strong basis for growth in fiscal year '14 and beyond. Even with 4 deals behind us, the team continues to evaluate additional opportunities in ophthalmics, adult nutrition, diabetes and international markets.","In summary, on Slide 16, Perrigo is poised for continued growth. The market continues to shift to store-brand offerings from national brands. Rx OTC switches are expected to continue with $10 billion in branded Rx sales likely to switch in the next 5 years, with over $5 billion of what is expected in the next 3 years. Our Nutritional business's conversion to the new plastic tubs is being received positively, and our Rx business continues to perform well. Perrigo is poised to grow adjusted earnings 11% to 15% this year and 16% to 20% without discrete tax items over last year's record performance as we continue to execute on our mission of making quality health care more affordable for consumers.","Operator, let's now open up the call for questions. Operator, can you open up the call for questions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky from Canaccord Genuity.","Randall Stanicky - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","[indiscernible] on the consumer business?","Joseph C. Papa","Randall, I'm sorry. You just broke. We didn't hear the first part.","Randall Stanicky - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Just a question, Joe, on the consumer business?","Joseph C. Papa","Yes.","Randall Stanicky - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Is it tracking in the quarter? Did it track, and is the result in line with what you were thinking or looking for? And I'm just trying to get a sense if there were any timing issues. It sounded like allergy was a moving piece. Cough and cold, obviously, had some impact and then Mucinex. If there's any way that you could give us some color and perhaps quantify that, that would be helpful.","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Well, I'd say, Randall, on balance, we were very pleased with the quarter. Well, there obviously has always been some ups and downs in any quarter that you have, just in terms of a normal distribution. On the positive, January and February was a very strong cough\/cold\/flu season. It moderated in March, to be clear. So that was one part. January, February very strong, up 15% to 20% versus last year's season. On the second part of it, the Guaifenesin launch was a very important launch to us. We're glad to have it behind us. Admittedly, as I stated, would I have liked to have gotten it out there a little earlier than March 18? The answer to that is absolutely clear. That would have been preferred. However, importantly, we went through all the appropriate due diligence that we needed to do to ensure that the product was well validated. We were confident of that, and we now have the product out in the marketplace. And we're delighted with what we're seeing so far in terms of the response by the retailers. The only other comment I would make on the quarter, along the lines of what you said, it was clear that this year's allergy season is starting later than last year, albeit last year was a very early start to the allergy season. I think on balance, we're absolutely where we want to be with the overall Consumer Healthcare sales growing very significantly, both organically and through the acquisition side.","Randall Stanicky - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And if we look at the midpoint of, Judy, if I've done my math right, $616 million or so for next quarter, the midpoint of the consumer guidance, the implied 4Q, fiscal 4Q number, would you say that your visibility and stat, that range or that midpoint, given that we know several of these moving parts now with respect to allergy and cough and cold, would you say your visibility there is high right now? Or is there other new launches that are dependent upon hitting that number?","Judy L. Brown","There are not big launches depending on hitting that number in the fourth quarter. There are a variety of smaller products that are flowing through in Q4. We talked about allergy season and just how dynamic it is or is not in the quarter. But of course, as we're in the last several weeks now of the fiscal year, the confidence level is better at this stage in the game. Do not forget, though, that the other moving piece in Q4 for us, of course, is the flea and tick season. Now we have a new seasonality to deal with. And if you look at our expectations on Q3 to Q4, a part of that is the expected uptick, no pun intended, of the animal health business in Q4. And we're seeing that starting right now.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Shibani Malhotra with RBC Capital Markets.","Florence C. Tsang - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is Florence for Shibani. You guys have clearly been busy on the business development front over the last several months. Can you talk about your priorities for use of cash going forward and what we should expect for both the pace and the focus for your potential future business development activity?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. I'll start and then I'll turn it to Judy for more comments on this. But I would say that really, there's -- our focus on what we're -- so the cash is really continuing more of the same. As we've stated in the call, we've done now 4 different M&A transactions over the last -- this fiscal year. We continue to look for other ways to extend our portfolio. Obviously, the first thing for us always is to look at the organic growth of our business. We feel very fortunate that we've got good organic growth but where we can find additional ROIC-accretive opportunities to extend the portfolio. We want to do that and continue to leverage our leading position in the area of quality, affordable health care products. So we'll continue to look at new categories. So for example, and I think we've stated these publicly before, the areas of major interest on the M&A side are ophthalmics, adult nutrition, diabetes and looking to expand in international markets to bring our concept of quality, affordable health care internationally. So those are really the primary M&A comments. Judy, you may want to say more about other uses of cash.","Judy L. Brown","Just general uses of cash. I made the comment -- just wanted to highlight for everyone, you'll notice that our CapEx spending has been higher in the last 2 years as we have been making more investments in our future with planning for future new product launches, getting our own sites up and ready, long-term investments in technologies, hence the increase in spending and CapEx even though we're going to be probably about $10 million lower than our original expectation at the beginning of the year as I commented earlier. So continuing to make important investments this year into fiscal '14 and probably into the beginning of fiscal '15 is also an important use of cash, but clearly well below the amount that we're generating in operating cash flow. So -- and we continue with our dividend policy, although, as you can see, the dividend yield is a smaller number than a large consumer products company but one where we want to continue to return some value to shareholders at a rate equal to the bottom line growth of the P&L annually.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with B. Riley.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","I wanted to clarify. I know you don't want to get into giving specific quarterly guidance and everything, but would it be fair to say, I guess, in my mind, I'm thinking that your Consumer Healthcare guidance for the year of 16% to 20% sales growth, I'm seeing that it's most likely at the bottom end of that range. Would that be a fair statement, number one? And then number two, I had a question in your Rx segment. In terms of the remaining new product launches for the fourth quarter, I'm just reviewing what I have in my model and I have Aplenzin, generic Rx Aplenzin, and then something Sanctura. And then I'm wondering about Cutivate, if you're thinking that could launch in the fourth quarter or if that's pushed out further?","Joseph C. Papa","Okay. Let me start with your first part of your question, Linda, clarifying the fourth quarter. As you know, we don't give any quarterly guidance. Obviously, this is a little unique in the sense that this quarter is the last quarter of our fiscal year. So in essence, we stick with the growth that we've talked about really for the full part of this year. I think Judy that said it well. I mean, what's unique about this coming quarter, though, for us is that this is one of the major seasons for pet care in that this is relatively new to us. It's a little bit hard for us to get too advanced in saying it's going to be at the higher end of the expectation or at the lower end of expectation. I do think the core Consumer Healthcare business is doing well as evidenced by the growth, but I do feel that we're going to be in that range at this time, and that's really why we stayed with the range. I really don't want to make too many more comments about being at the low end of that range or the high end of the range. I really do feel, from a revenue point of view, we're just really very happy to get these products out, get them launched into the marketplace and to continue to look at that strong growth that we expect in the Consumer Healthcare side of our business. On the Rx side, it is clear that we have a number of additional product launches that we expect, as we've stated. What we're simply at this point, though, finding is that some of these products are going through a slightly longer regulatory review cycle. That is something that we're continuing to work very closely with our R&D organization to continue to improve on our filings, get them out there into the marketplace, but we are seeing an uptick in the length of time for our regulatory review cycle for our products. We're working very closely with our internal organization to continue to try and improve that process, but that is something we see, a delay in the time period of getting the products approved. The good news is that we are still expecting these products, we are still expecting them. They're just slightly delayed from where we had previously expected based on this process. I think -- I don't think I really want to make any other comments on the specifics of those products that you mentioned, Linda.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just had a question on Nutritionals. There's obviously been a lot of moving pieces in this division. When I think about longer-term gross margins here, is this a division that can get back into the low- to mid-30s that I think we were seeing a few years ago? And maybe the second part of my question on Nutritionals is I appreciate the comments on the relaunch, Joe, but can you just elaborate a little bit more? Is there anything you can share with us in terms of how much uptake we're seeing or any changes in uptake with the new packaging that you can share? Or is it just too early to get real feedback on that?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. So let me just try to address separately your 2 questions on Nutritionals. We do see a continuing opportunity to improve the gross profit margins of our Nutritionals business that we do see is opportunity. I don't want you to get to the 30% next quarter, next year. I mean, that's not going to happen that quickly, but there is an opportunity to improve the overall gross profit margins of our Nutritional business. And I think the number 30% is a great target for us. Not next year or maybe the year after or some point in the future, but it is something that we certainly think we can strive for in terms of a target for improving our gross margins. On the second part of your question, I do think it is too early to make a definitive comment. The only comments I can offer on our uptake of our plastic container are ones that I've talked about. Number one, it's been very well received by the retailers, and that's always very important. Number two, they are giving us very good promotional opportunities within the category. So whenever I get that promotional opportunity, that's a very nice place to be. Admittedly, as we've stated, it's costing us a little more to get some of these promotional displays put together, et cetera, but that's always an important part of how we look to the future for growth opportunities. But going beyond that, the only other point I can say is that store brand is up more than the national brand at this time. It's something, though, that -- it is probably too early for me to get more descriptive in saying that the plastic container has added x percent of value to us at this point. I think it's -- we're still very favorable on it in terms of what it means, but I don't really want to get into the data. I think it's a little bit too early for us. I look to have more to say about that, though, in the August time frame after we'll have about 6 months of data at that point.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was hoping, Joe, that you could just sort of paint a picture for us so that we understand the new infant formula product rollout and uptake. So I've talked to some investors who have gone to retailers, and they still see the brands in metal cans. And if the brand is still in a metal can, then obviously, Perrigo needs to still make the metal cans to copy or mimic the look and feel of the brand. In other cases, the brands have shifted to plastic containers, and Perrigo is now catching up. But could you just frame the transition and help us understand, for example, in 6 months where Perrigo will be? Will the vast majority of your infant formula revenue be plastic containers? Or will half of it? And how far are we along during the process of transition so that we can better understand how we should think about your products when we see them at retail?","Joseph C. Papa","Okay. Well, a lot of good questions there, David. Let me just start with the difference in why you're getting that feedback from some of your investors and\/or concerned shoppers, I guess, out there. There is a -- the brands have switched from the metal cans to the plastic containers for the dry powder. They do obviously, though, still have metal containers for the liquid products. Liquid products are predominantly East Coast-based products, but the majority of the products have switched from the metal or composite can to a plastic container. So there is no question that we expect to see the majority of products in the plastic containers from the brand, and that's from the Abbotts of the world, from the Mead Johnsons of the world and from the Nestl\u00e9s of the world. Now there are some specialty smaller products that are not in plastic containers, but those I put into kind of a separate specialty care business. And the other one that's in the metal can is the liquid formulation. So put those aside, though, because the majority of infant formula is in a dry powder. That's where the brands have switched, and that is where we are obviously following with our plastic container. Relative to our rollout, as I stated with the earlier call, we are very pleased with what we see so far in terms of number of promotions, the retailer reception to what we're doing. It's still a little early to talk about it, but we're very pleased. I believe that in our products, we are somewhere around 90% of our volume is out in plastic containers today. So you still may see some residual metal containers on the shelves for Perrigo products, but the majority of our products, in the base formulations, the most popular formulations are out in a plastic container today at about 90% of our volume. So around that level today.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. Joe, you had mentioned that there are still a large number of Rx-to-OTC switch opportunities that are still important to drive your Consumer Healthcare business. Can you talk about what specific categories you're referring to over the next couple of years? Obviously, there's the can switch. I still think it's in the sort of uncertain category, but if you could talk about in terms of what you see for your business over the next couple of years? And then just a question for Judy. The guidance for the year is still pretty wide, a $0.20 spread, and here we are, the last quarter of the year. What are the key variables that you see driving the top end versus the bottom end?","Joseph C. Papa","Okay. I'll start and I'll turn it over to Judy. Let me start with the categories. The Rx OTC switch. I think you said it well. I mean, the -- obviously, the next products that we think are very important to us are the remaining proton pump inhibitors led by Nexium. We think that's obviously a very important product to get out into the marketplace and one which Pfizer has spent $250 million-plus to get out there with the Nexium opportunities. And in that Nexium opportunity, Pfizer also picked up some additional product categories that they were interested in beyond just the Nexium products. They deal with some of the respiratory products. Moving though from there, I think the other important product, albeit not a large product, is Oxytrol. Oxytrol is important, we believe, because number one, the FDA has found that, that disease category of overactive bladder can move from prescription to OTC. When Oxytrol was approved, that was an important product opportunity. But more importantly, I think it opens up the category of overactive bladder as the FDA has deemed that category one in which consumers can make the decision to self diagnose and treat the overactive bladder indication. So I do think overactive bladder is an important one. Oxytrol is important. And then with it -- with Oxytrol comes obviously a number of potential other future products, can't comment about whether they will switch or not, but obviously the Detrol, the Detrol LA, the Ditropan are all other products that fall into overactive bladder. It's too early to make any judgment as to whether that product -- any of those products will switch. Beyond that, we clearly view some of the pain products, the products that are specifically the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory gel products, the Voltaren specifically, gel product is one that we expect a switch opportunity in the future. And then I really -- probably don't want to make any more comments on statins, I think you know I still believe that's kind of a toss-up, probably a 60-40 probability, 60% probability it could switch but 40% probability it will not switch, and I think that's still one that is -- it's undecided at this point. Let me -- and then finally, of course, I forgot the Omega-3 fish oil-type products we believe are also candidates for switches in the near future. Judy, I think you want to take the second part of the...","Judy L. Brown","Sure. The question was on the range and why we're not narrowing the range more from a $0.20 that has basically been outstanding throughout the fiscal year. If you look at -- on Slide 12, where we started the fiscal year and how we've progressed across the course of the year, unfortunately, as we said earlier, we had to move our new product number, but we've also been able to grow the businesses organically. We've expanded margins organically. We've added acquisitions in there, and we've maintained the size of the range still at $0.20. But on a real basis, that's just slightly over a 3% range. So I still feel comfortable keeping a 3% wide range, if you will, for guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year, i.e. the fourth quarter, due to the fact that while we can get more precise in most places with expectations on sales and margins, the reality still is we have the new Flea & Tick businesses as part of our family, and that can move the numbers slightly. We have also in there a moving tax rate, and we've seen the benefits and the negative of the tax rate even moving slightly in any one quarter because of mix of income. And we don't want to be caught off guard by narrowing the range to accommodate only having one quarter left and then potentially having moved -- moving outside either up or down just because of the movement in the tax rate. So we just feel it's prudent to maintain the size of the range to be able to encompass those items I just noted.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Greg Gilbert the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is not about the quarter but as of now, are you seeing any signs at all of J&J's return on several products that we're not seeing in third-party data yet? And then for Joe, a generic question. We saw that generic Zovirax got approved, a bunch of topicals players have viewed that as a tough nut to crack. So I'm curious, do you see FDA's willingness to approve that the way they did as a relevant industry data point that could change the bar for other products?","Joseph C. Papa","Yes. I -- let me get the first question and then get to Zovirax. Yes, J&J is returning with products. We are going with their best reports. We actually follow each and every product they have in great detail, but we're going with their best commentary that we heard from the recent reports that suggested that they would be coming back and are coming back with products. That is clear. And we are seeing them come back and expect to see them fully back in during the calendar year 2013 time frame. So that is the numbers that we're using, Greg, for our forecast. Obviously, we take every quarter one at a time based on that since we don't have any visibility beyond what we hear from J&J as they speak to investors. We do expect them to return with their -- all of their products by the end of calendar 2013 as just a review of our numbers. On the question of Zovirax, I do think it's been an interesting one, and I do think it opens up some other products that are very challenging clinical trials to follow, and I do think that there's an opportunity there for the entire industry on other more challenging products. I will also say -- not exactly the same circumstances, but I think that our product that we filed and got first to file on Proair, as an example, was an example of where we worked really hard on Proair to get that product to an FDA submission. Once it was accepted to file, I think we've seen the FDA come out with some additional guidelines based on the filing that we have and based on their own internal discussions within the FDA. I think that model is something that we're seeing on many products that are, what I would call, the more challenging generic-equivalent products. And we're delighted to be, certainly in the case of Proair, at the leadership of the first-to-file opportunity with Proair. But I do think that's exactly what's happening out there, Greg, a comment your question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Annabel Samimy with Stifel.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I had a question on operating margins. Actually, you've been pretty good at consistent operating margin expansion historically. And going forward, I was just curious what some of the sources of that expansion would be. Longer term and even in the near term with regard to Nutritionals, if the operating efficiencies were going to continue into the next quarter as well as in pet care, if you launch a private label, is that one of the big sources of operating margin expansion?","Joseph C. Papa","Well, I think, first and foremost, our improvements in operating margin going back, not just for this year but for previous years, have been just -- it's  been great execution by the team in Allegan and around the world for Perrigo. I mean, I think the team has executed -- continues to execute very strong. And so I think it's -- first and foremost, goes there. But I do think, to be clear, the other part of the question, which is what you're talking about, is it goes to new products and it also goes to our M&A as we look to find other adjacent categories that have good opportunities for margin like pet care. So I do think it's been a couple of different things that have helped us to grow our operating margins. First and foremost, execution. Number two, it's been the new products. The new products classically have a higher gross margin within -- ultimately drops into our operating margin. And then the third point is really the M&A opportunity set we have found. And where that's really important is we find these adjacent categories, we can add products into our truck that's at Perrigo today, and it's going to one of our large retailers. And when we do that, it doesn't cost us incremental sales reps or it doesn't cost us incremental account receivable quirks so really the -- that allows us to bring more dollars from the gross margin right to the operating level for the business. And I think it's been an important part of our overall improvements in operating margins.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And some of the near-term sources in terms of Nutritionals and pet care?","Joseph C. Papa","Yes. Well, it's -- clearly, that is the -- the Nutritionals are going to be looking at what we do with our plastic container as we can get more product out of our facility. We take the fixed cost, and we divide over more tons or pounds of products that we make in our facility. I mean, that's really the way we can get some operating efficiency. To be clear, we -- Judy mentioned that the plastic container is not as efficient as it was our previous mechanism of operation, but it will get better as we get more experience with the plastic container over time. On the question of the pet care, there's no doubt that the pet care products, especially when we get additional store brand, pet care products will help us on our operating margin over time.","Judy L. Brown","And I just want to reiterate in case there's any confusion on the pet care product front, our pet care business today, the numbers you're going to see coming through for the next several quarters have a higher-than-average gross margins and in line with CHC average or slightly above on the operating margin line. But the dynamic today still is the underlying investment in A&P that's going on in those businesses. To Joe's point, as the transition is underway, as more of the revenue pie comes from -- more share of the pie is coming from store-brand contributions, you might see a slight easing down of gross margins in animal health, offset by lower A&P spend. And longer-term, we believe operating margin expansion from where it is today.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Buck with Buckingham Research.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just a couple of quick questions. For the pet care business, Joe, you talked about the $200 million fiscal 2014 run rate. Can you talk about what needs to happen to make that number and what the timing is of the Frontline Flea & Tick store brand launch? Secondly, for Judy, can you just recap what the accretion is for sort of the full year or 2014 accretion from the acquisitions you've made? And then finally, for Joe, can you talk about -- you said that March quarter was impacted by the weak start to the allergy season. We're now obviously in May. What's the trend now? And are we at normal season, a slow season still? How would you characterize allergy in the second quarter?","Joseph C. Papa","Okay. So let me try to answer your \"one question\" here, David. So pet care, $200 million business. We view that as having a high-single-digit growth rate, but we think we can accelerate that into a double-digit growth rate as we launch the store-brand versions of all the Flea & Tick-type products. So that part concerns the pet care high-single-digit rates but growing to double digits as we get the store-brand products out there. And importantly, store-brand Frontline is one that we are working on very hard. We've got some customers already signed up for that. We simply are working on what I would call the regulatory labeling requirements because each of those are statewide regulatory and labeling requirements that we have to work on, which is -- it takes time, to be fair, but we already got customers signed up for it, and we're working hard to get those products to the marketplace. On the question of the additional products, we now have opportunities not only for Frontline but other Frontline line extensions that -- as you may know, there's Frontline out there as Frontline Plus, Frontline Tritak. There are other products in the longer term future that we're excited about in our portfolio as we bring together both the Sergeant's acquisition, as well as the Velcera acquisition. So I think I answered that part. Judy, can you answer the next part, accretion?","Judy L. Brown","Sure. Let me just walk you through the press releases that have been done over the last several months related to the 4 deals that we have closed in this fiscal year. Going in order, Cobrek was first of all, and we expected that to contribute $0.04 in this fiscal year 2013, but we did not quote any additional accretion in fiscal '14. This is all on an adjusted basis. Please note, all adjusted non-GAAP numbers. The Rosemont acquisition, we expect it to contribute approximately $0.24, 2014. The Sergeant's transaction, we expect it to contribute approximately $0.20 in fiscal '14. And last but not least, Velcera, $0.10, $0.11 to fiscal '14. We will -- as we go into fiscal 14, we'll talk about that contribution more precisely, if it changes at all with seasonality, et cetera. And we will also obviously comment and provide a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP contributions coming from them in our usual table that we put with our press release.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ami Fadia with UBS.","Ami Fadia - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of just questions and then maybe just a 2 part question. Judy, you commented that some of the delays in the Rx new product launches gets offset by other strength within the business. So if you could please elaborate that. And related to that, with the delay, do you see a diminished commercial opportunity from these products? And then the second question is just on the pet care side. Could you give us kind of an order of magnitude of how sales have performed in the June quarter versus the March quarter for the pet care business as the tick and flea season kicks up. Maybe is it 1.5x, 2x? That would be helpful.","Judy L. Brown","Sure. Let me comment on the first part.","Joseph C. Papa","The first part was -- are Rx side and the continued strength in the Rx side.","Judy L. Brown","The continued strength of the rest of the business. So there is not one specific thing that you can point to and say aha. This one thing suddenly is significantly better in our expectations to offset, but it was across the whole portfolio. So as the team rolled up their end-of-year forecast and looked at category by category, retailer by retailer, how other new products are doing, how VMS is doing with its new retailer, it's across the portfolio. And as a team, we came back and said even though the new product number realistically has to be adjusted downwards, the rest of the business is still standing firm and, therefore, we're able to go ahead and confirm the overall top line numbers that you've seen in the guidance rather than having to make any adjustments relative to just the change in new products. So it's not -- I would not say it's one specific thing to point to.","Joseph C. Papa","And maybe if I just add to what Judy said on the question on the pet care side, there is no doubt that the time period of April through October is significantly higher amount of pet care business. Really, those fixed months -- if I compare the time period from April through October versus October -- I'm sorry, let's call it November through March, the April through October time frame is closer to 70%, 75% of the sales, whereas the time period of November through March is somewhere in the 25% to 30% of the sales. So that -- I mean, it's really -- by that factor, it's more than a 2:1 type of comparison, I guess, if you're...","Judy L. Brown","I was just going to say think about it in terms of doubling Q3 to Q4.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Louise Chen from Guggenheim.","Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","My question is on basically your Sergeant's business and Velcera and your thoughts on selling generic animal health drugs. We've got a lot of questions on that. I know it's not an immediate opportunity for you, but when do you think you'd become interested in it? And how potentially large is that opportunity to Perrigo?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Well, let's say, first and foremost, we are very excited about flea and tick, and we think that's a very important OTC opportunity today and one in which we are moving very quickly to get into that business, as evidenced by the 2 acquisitions, both in what we did with Sergeant's, as well as Velcera. That is our primary focus. I will say, though, to be clear, that we expect the market for pet care to evolve over time where it's very similar to the contact lens business where 10 years ago, you got your prescription from an optometrist, he filled the prescription or she filled the prescription, and then you went on with your glasses or contacts. We view that -- that model, which has now changed to a model where you can get a prescription from an optometrist and you can get it filled in a retail setting, whether it be any of the large mass merchandisers and\/or a specialty ophthalmic players, that's going to change exactly for pet care in that the vet will write a prescription for products, and you will take that prescription and fill it at a local large retailer like a Walmart, a CVS, a Walgreens, et cetera. That market, we do believe, will change very similar to what happened with the ophthalmics market. It'll take time, but we do believe that we will be positioned for that in the future. I mean, the very simple product categories that we think about today are things like we make glucose [indiscernible] today. We make it for humans. Obviously, we need to make that product a little different for a dog or cat or companion animal, but that's something we certainly have capabilities on and certainly know how to do formulations. And we need to add a little beef flavor to the formulation but otherwise, it's very simple for us to enter into those products. And obviously, the entire pet care business that we've identified as being one that we're really excited about for the future, especially as it goes -- evolves from only a vet distribution business into more of a retail business, that's really where we will get excited about if we see that continuing to develop.","Judy L. Brown","I would say it doesn't preclude us from looking at opportunities that -- when companies have products available that make sense within the type of distribution channel that Joe just highlighted. But the foray that we've just made into animal health does not in and of itself a state that we're moving off of our other adjacencies -- interest in other adjacencies to move exclusively into that category. It's really focused on where we can add value for our retailers, as Joe was mentioning, at the pharmacy counter at the retail space.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Steinberg with Deutsche Bank.","David M. Steinberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just to follow-up on your foray into animal health a little bit more, Joe, you'd indicated that you had $200 million run rate with Velcera and Sergeant's. Just curious, you did not mention animal health or pet care as one of your M&A -- one of the buckets you're looking at for M&A. But given it's such a large market, are there some opportunities out there? Or do you pretty much have everything you need in the future? And then just a related question on the strategic -- on the potential change in consumer behavior over time, is there a substantial group of Americans that just never go to the vet but would go to Walmart and CVS and hence, if it takes longer and you think the changed behavior -- is there a fairly sizable market that would be purchasing your products at the Walgreens, et cetera, et cetera who just never go to the vet?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Well, I -- you've asked a lot of good questions there. I will say on the pet care, we will still look for that on the M&A side. I would say that we've got 2 what we think are really important opportunities in the area of pet care in the flea and tick area and what products are going to be available or are available OTC today. So I think we feel very well positioned, but I don't want to rule out any other future opportunity in pet care if we find something that is ROIC accretive. We feel very good, though, about where we are with pet care in terms of our ability to grow it organically with what we now have, especially as we bring out these new store-brand offerings of the pet care products. On the question of consumer behavior, there is no doubt. I don't have the exact statistic, but I know that it's about 68% of American households have a companion animal in their households. So that is a very sizable percentage of American population that has a family pet. And at least, as measured by my household, that family pet gets treated very well and there's -- and it's all non-reimbursed business. So it's all cash. So cash payments out there for your pet. So I clearly think that -- we think this is a very nice market opportunity. It's perfect with quality, affordable health care. As to whether or not some consumers are going to use our product because they don't go to the vet, I don't know that as much as I think most people really realize that they know every flea and tick season, they go and get something from a vet and they pay $60, $100 -- $60 to $100 for that product, and now they can get it in a retail setting for far less. And I think that's -- it's the same store-brand product or same quality and effectiveness as the national brand but with the store-brand pricing. That's really the dynamic that we -- it's going to take some time to change that behavior, but we believe it will change very similar to where -- what we've done with OTC products. It takes time but it will evolve, and we'll be there with a great offering.","Judy L. Brown","I was just going to add one last thing. You made the comment that we -- Joe didn't specifically mention animal health anymore in his areas of strategic expansion. Maybe that's just semantics that we can be cognizant of going forward given the fact that it's now part of the Perrigo family. We consider it adjacency to expand into further animal health ideas. So as we've grown so quickly over the last years, anything that's adjacent to what we're doing is now part of the adjacency tuck-in opportunity.","Joseph C. Papa","Yes. And maybe -- the last point I would add is -- because it reminds me very much of what happened with Zyrtec prescription. Zyrtec prescription product, when it was a prescription-only product, it sold somewhere around 500 million tablets a year. Now that Zyrtec has moved over the counter, what we have seen that -- J&J did a fabulous job with launching that product over the counter, got great acceptance for the products. And today, as we sit there in terms of tablets consumed, the total number of tablets of Zyrtec plus store brand now exceed 1.5 billion. So you've seen a tripling of the product as it moves from prescription to OTC. That's the kind of data that we will again say. As you improve access of products for people, you can increase the demand for people because people are all searching for quality, affordable health care solutions for in this case with a human situation, but certainly, as we're thinking about pet care, we have that same dynamic as you improve access.","Operator","And your final question is from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair.","Jon Andersen - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I guess it's 2-parter on infant formula. First, just curious with the promotional activity you've kind of talked about in the U.S. should we be viewing that as more kind of opportunistic to support the plastic tub launch? Or is it maybe something more long-lasting based on competitive conditions? And the second, Joe, I think you mentioned that there are kind of 3 CODEX-complaint products have been approved for global distribution and I was hoping you could give out just a brief update on kind of the international business and how big it is today and what your plans are and expectations going forward?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Let me start with the first part of the infant formula. Did we have to spend and spend some additional funds in the area of promotions and getting ourselves prepared for the plastic container launch? The answer is yes, and that's clearly something we do as we launch any new product that we think has sizable upside for the long term. There was some incremental spend on that product at the launch to get ourselves prepared for the appropriate number of displays and other programs to get the product out into the marketplace. That will -- certainly, that's just associated with the new product launch. That will minimize over time, but it is something that we think is an important investment for our future to continue to drive the growth of our store-brand infant formula product, [indiscernible] formula product. On the question of the CODEX-compliant, what's important there is we get the FDA approval or FDA permission to go forward with these products, and that's an important marker for us that we get that so that we can then go out and ship these products to other countries around the world. And indeed, that is what happened. I would say, on balance, we're doing well in our international market with the exception of, as Judy mentioned, China. China has instituted some new, what I would call, regulatory\/labeling challenges. We have worked our way through those label challenges now and we're working through them as we speak. So we still view -- there's a lot of opportunities, certainly, demand in China, if you've read recent reports in the newspapers and journals, the demand for infant formula in China continues to go up dramatically, so that's something we're very excited about, demand. But there are some, what I would call, regulatory hurdles that we are working our way through. We expect to get through those labeling requirements and continue to get product out into the China market, and we think these types of product approvals just simply facilitates even more opportunities for the future. So we're excited about it but albeit, we have to say that we've had a little bit of challenge in the latest quarter just getting product to China. We think that's behind us, or a majority of that is behind us with the label requirements. We'll work our way through that for future quarters. The opportunity is still there, the demand is still there in China for us.","Operator, that concludes our call for today. I'd just like to say thank you to everyone for your interest in Perrigo, and we'll talk to you on -- I guess August will be our next quarterly call. Thank you.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Perrigo's Fiscal 2013 First Quarter Earnings Results. [Operator Instructions] And now, I would like to turn the call over to Art Shannon. You may begin.","Arthur J. Shannon","Thank you very much, Cassandra. Welcome to Perrigo's first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. I hope you all had a chance to review our press release which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the press release is available on our website at perrigo.com.

Papa","Thank you, Art, and welcome, everyone to Perrigo's first quarter fiscal 2013 earnings conference call. Also joining me today is Judy Brown, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","First, let me say on behalf of all of the approximately 9,000 employees of Perrigo that we wish everyone impacted by Hurricane Sandy well as you work through the recovery from the damage of the storm. We have numerous employees that were impacted by the storm so we do appreciate the difficulties of working through this challenging time. Our thoughts and prayers are with you.","For our agenda today, I will provide a brief perspective on the quarter and the continued strength in store brand market share growth. Next, Judy will go through the details of the quarter and our increased fiscal 2013 earnings guidance. Then I'll provide an update on the transition to plastic containers in our Infant Formula business and our plans for new product launches, plus an overview of expectations for the coming year. And I will present an update regarding the ongoing integration of Sergeant\u2019s Pet Care. Finally, this will be followed by an opportunity for Q&A.","Now let's discuss the quarter. On Slide 4, you can see we had record first quarter sales of $770 million with record adjusted net income up 16% from last year on a 6% net sales growth. We're off to a great start as we have all-time high first quarter adjusted gross and operating margins.","Consolidated adjusted operating margin was a 23% driven by adjusted gross margin expansion despite an 18% increase in our adjusted R&D investment compared to last year. To be candid, the top-line growth was not at the level we planned due to primarily, weakness in our Nutritionals segment, which I will explain further in a moment.","Turn to Slide 5. You can see the business segment breakdown. Judy will walk you through the details but I want to just touch a few items. First, our Consumer Healthcare segment had all-time record first quarter sales. The performance is driven by an increase of $36 million in existing sales as the base business continues to gain market share along with $13 million in new product sales due to Loratadine-D 12, Lansoprazole, Minoxidil Foam and the recent launch of Dextromethorphan Extended-Release Suspension.","Consumer Healthcare adjusted operating income was up 14% versus last year. Our Nutritionals segment was down from last year due to lower sales in VMS and the planned conversion to a plastic container in the infant formula business. Remember, we had increased retail shipments of infant formula placed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 in advance of the planned July 1 shutdown of the company's Vermont facility to perform SAP conversion and more importantly, to prepare for the installation of the new plastic container packaging line. This, along with unprecedented promotional spending from national infant formula brands, dampened sales during the quarter.","Our Rx business had another great quarter. Rx net sales increased 28% compared to record first quarter sales last year and adjusted operating income grew more than 31% as a result of the Paddock acquisition, new products and a favorable pricing environment. Furthermore, organic net sales grew 13% in the quarter. The Rx team continues to execute.","Our API segment faced some competitive pressures in its base business leading to lower sales for the quarter. Looking at Slide 6, the overall OTC consumer market was relatively flat versus last year. But with national brands down 3%, store brands gained 8.5% on the strength of new product launches, national brand recalls and increased market share. Noteworthy, the diabetes category experienced tremendous store brand growth of nearly 17% while the category was up 4%. Store brands continue to drive growth in the market. I'm sure you have plenty of questions about our updated fiscal 2013 guidance and our market share gains and I'll get into more of that detail shortly, but now, let me turn the call over to Judy.","Judy L. Brown","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. As you just heard from Joe, on a consolidated basis, we had a very solid start to the year. During the next few minutes, I'll provide some color commentary on our fiscal 2013 first quarter results by segment and then review our revised expectations for the fiscal year.","So let's move directly into the business segments. On Slide 7, you'll note that Consumer Healthcare's first quarter net sales increased 9% year-over-year due to a combination of: an increase in sales of existing products of $36 million in the contract, cough\/cold and smoking cessation category; new product sales of $13 million in the gastrointestinal, cough\/cold and dermatological category; and $9 million attributable to the acquisition of CanAm.","Specifically, sales in the GI category, which includes the store brand versions of Omeprazole and Lansoprazole among other products, were up 6% year-over-year. In total, this combined $58 million increase was partially offset by declines of $17 million in sales of existing products in the analgesics and fem hy categories and $4 million due to discontinued products versus last year.","The 90 basis point increase in adjusted gross margin was driven by new products, product mix across the broad CHC portfolio as pricing during the first fiscal quarter was slightly better year-over-year and good cost control in our manufacturing plants. We invested more in CHC R&D projects versus the first quarter last year and DSG&A spend was controlled to a lower percentage of sales, even with the inclusion of CanAm expenses versus this time last year. As a result, adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points year-over-year, slightly less than the adjusted gross margin expansion.","On Slide 8, you can see that net sales within the Nutritionals segment declined 14% year-over-year due to several factors. First, as we noted in August, we fulfilled retail shipments at the end of June in advance of our planned July 1 shutdown of our Vermont plant when we both executed an SAP conversion and commenced the installation of a new $29 million, state-of-the-art, consumer-friendly packaging line to allow our infant formula product to look and feel like the national brand. As we noted on our August 16 call, this shutdown shifted over $10 million of sales that would have taken place during the first fiscal quarter 2013 to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.","Second, regulatory changes in one of the company's main international markets caused a delay in fulfillment of international orders. We expect to resume fulfilling these international orders in the second half of fiscal 2013.","Third, VMS sales were lower year-over-year due to increased competition within the category and a decline in sales of approximately $1 million due to discontinued products. While new sales are still currently anticipated within this category during the fiscal year, the timing of these new sales is more heavily weighted to the second half of the fiscal year. Therefore, we are still anticipating sales will improve over the coming quarters.","The adjusted gross margin in the Nutritionals segment decreased 160 basis points due to several factors. First, we have been able to maintain the traction made in prior quarters with respect to infant formula pricing and have seen favorable year-over-year manufacturing progress even despite the plant shutdown in the first week of July, both of which were positives.","However, the relatively lower volume sales in this category negatively impacted margins, causing approximately 1\/3 of the overall margin decrease. Another 1\/3 of the decrease was a combination of sales declines and increased inventory cost within our VMS product category, with the remaining 1\/3 primarily due to product mix across the smaller product categories in the segment.","While our adjusted DSG&A spending was down over $1 million year-over-year due to good cost control, the adjusted operating margin decline was greater than that of the adjusted gross margin on weaker top-line leverage.","Now turning to Slide 9. You can see that the Rx business has started fiscal 2013 very well, continuing its strong performance. Net sales growth of 28% was due to a combination of an incremental month of sales from the acquisition of Paddock Labs included in this quarter versus a year ago, new product sales of $8 million and robust gains in our organic Rx business. In fact, Rx sales without the additional month of Paddock grew 13% year-over-year.","Adjusted gross profit for the quarter was strong compared to last year due to the same 3 reasons. In Rx, spending on adjusted R&D increased approximately $2 million from last year while DSG&A spend decreased as the team continued its focus on expense management. This allowed the team to translate a slight adjusted gross margin decline into further expansion at the adjusted operating margin level.","Next, on Slide 10, you'll see that API's first quarter net sales were impacted by approximately $17 million of lower demand for existing products in the portfolio as a result of increased competition. These decreases were partially offset by $7 million related to the launch of a customer's products with 180-day exclusivity status. As we frequently note, sales of API are highly dependent upon the level of competition in the marketplace for specific materials, as well as the variable ordering patterns of customers on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So we expect revenue choppiness to continue on a go-forward basis.","Now some quick highlights on our balance sheet. Excluding cash and current investment, working capital was $639 million at the end of the quarter, up from $560 million at this time last year, reflecting primarily, the impact of our acquisition of the Diabetes Care business, organic growth and investments in product growth initiatives for CHC and nutrition planned for later in the year.","As of September 29, 2012 our current and long-term debt on the face of the balance sheet was $1.4 billion, flat sequentially from last quarter. Excluding cash and cash equivalents, our net debt to total capital at the end of our first quarter fiscal 2013 was 27.3%. Net cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $45 million, down from first quarter fiscal 2012 due to growth in operating working capital levels to support the product growth initiatives I just noted, as well as higher payroll and tax payments in the fiscal first quarter versus this time last year.","Now I'd like to turn our attention for a moment to the fiscal 2013 plans and walk through a few updates for our global cause allocations on Slide 11. Over the last several years, we've grown rapidly and added more manufacturing sites to our global supply chain footprint. Our team has been actively optimizing activities across our whole integrated network, enabling better cost savings and sharing of operational resources across locations and segments. As mentioned last quarter, it's obviously important that costs are charged to the business segments where the benefits are received and accordingly, we've updated our allocations of these shared costs in this fiscal year to better reflect our more comprehensive global management of the Perrigo supply chain.","In order to ease your analysis, we've updated the past 4 quarters' adjusted margins reflect the new allocations. While the adjusted margins changed slightly for each segment, please note that there are no changes to the consolidated Perrigo P&L. The result is that Consumer Healthcare's margins are now slightly higher as the segment was incurring the bulk of the expenses that were used by all the other segments. Conversely, the margins for the other 3 segments have moved slightly lower due to the 3 allocations.","Now I'd like to discuss our updated earnings outlook for the full year fiscal '13. On Slide 12, you'll see that we are updating guidance for the Consumer Healthcare segment based upon our October 1 closing of the Sergeant\u2019s transaction. We expect Sergeant\u2019s to add more than $100 million in net sales during the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2013. Thus, we now expect the Consumer Healthcare segment revenue to grow 16% to 20% over fiscal 2012. Given the higher gross margins for Sergeants' products, we now expect adjusted gross margins for Consumer Healthcare to be in a range of 32% to 36%, and adjusted operating margin in a range of 17% to 21%. We are not making any adjustments to our guidance for the other segments at this time.","Summing these changes back to the consolidated P&L on Slide 13, we now expect revenue growth of 12% to 15% year-over-year, up from the previously stated 10% to 14%. Additionally, we are moving our adjusted operating margin guidance to be between 21% and 24%, tightening the bottom end of the range from last quarter.","We expect Sergeant\u2019s to add approximately $0.10 of EPS on an adjusted basis in the remaining 9 months of fiscal 2013, as sales from our Pet Healthcare business are more heavily weighted towards our fiscal first and fourth quarters. In total, we now expect fiscal 2013 adjusted earnings per diluted share to be between $5.45 to $5.65, or year-over-year growth of 9% to 13%.","We are increasing our capital expenditure guidance for the year to a range of $120 million to $150 million. This new guidance incorporates our Sergeant\u2019s acquisition, as well as investments in capacity to support updated product pipeline launch assumptions over the next several years. While we realized an $0.08 earnings per share tax benefit in this fiscal quarter due to the resolution of various tax audits and statute expiries, we're not adjusting or full year effective tax rate expectations due to the updated forecasted mix of earnings before tax plus the inclusion of the acquisition of Sergeant\u2019s, whose earnings are predominantly U.S.-based.","The Perrigo team is immersed in a very busy start to fiscal 2013. We're in the midst of integrating a new business, launching dozens of new product offerings and building out our capacity and platforms to the longer-term horizon, all while keeping our eye on the ball of servicing customers with the highest quality affordable healthcare products that exceed their expectations. This team is committed to driving continuous improvements to ensure solid execution for this fiscal year, while at the same time, seeking the right opportunities for inorganic investment that meet our stringent criteria. Now I'll turn the call back to Joe.","Joseph C. Papa","Thank you, Judy. As Judy just outlined for you, we had a strong quarter despite the weakness in our Nutrition segment, but now, I want to focus on the future. This year, we are planning on launching over 60 new products that we expect to translate into approximately $190 million in annual Perrigo sales, as you can see on Slide 14.","Essentially, we plan to launch more than 1 new product every week in fiscal 2013. In our Consumer Healthcare business, we are preparing for the launch of the store brand version of Mucinex 600 milligrams with annual branded sales of approximately $135 million. We are in the process of validating additional batches of Guaifenesin ER 600 milligrams and continue to expect the launch of this product during our current fiscal year. While it is too early in the cough\/cold\/flu season to make too many comments, it appears to be tracking along a normal trend.","In our Nutritionals business, highlighted on Slide 15, we are excited about the upgrade of our infant formula national brand equivalent packaging. As you have seen in our other products, when we closely match the packaging of the national brand, we gain market share. Look for this new packaging on retailers' shelves in December.","In the VMS Cap business, we've begun shipping to 1 of the 2 additional retailers, with the second retailer expected after the New Year. The Generic Rx business is growing. Our new product launches are performing well and we have fully integrated Paddock Laboratories into the Perrigo family. As highlighted on Slide 16, we are poised for a strong new product year with the launch of generic versions of Olux-E Foam and Luxiq Foam plus other undisclosed products with more than $500 million in branded sales. Add this to the continued growth of our Rx base business and we expect to have a great year for our Rx team.","Finally, at the beginning of October, we closed our acquisition of Sergeant\u2019s Pet Care. The integration of their broad attractive portfolio of pet care products adds a new category to our Consumer Healthcare segment, and that is all underway. Sergeant\u2019s is a leading manufacturer of pet care products with 2 FDA\/EPA-approved manufacturing facilities. We are pleased to add over 1,000 SKUs that Sergeant\u2019s has in its broad portfolio of products, bringing Perrigo's total number of SKUs to approximately 15,000 SKUs.","Early in the transition, we are focused on building a store brand version to the Frontline product family, a product category with branded global sales of $1 billion, of which over $500 million was generated in the U.S. These are expensive products that can truly benefit from the addition of a quality, affordable, store brand offering. The Perrigo team has a strong business development pipeline and continues to evaluate opportunities in new categories, technologies and geographies.","In summary, on Slide 17, the continued execution of our base business, the Sergeant\u2019s Pet Care acquisition and the tax benefit realized this quarter allows us to increase our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range. As we stated on our August call, the team is focused on our new product pipeline, efficiency gains in our production processes and integrating the Sergeant\u2019s acquisition. We are excited about our future based on the market continuing to shift to store brand, the transition of our Nutritionals business to the new plastic container and the additional sales to the VMS business for us and finally, the strength of our Rx business. Perrigo is poised to grow adjusted earnings 9% to 13% over last year's record performance as we continue to execute on our mission of making quality healthcare more affordable for consumers. Operator, let's now open up the call for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Louise Chen from Guggenheim.","Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have 3 questions. First one is could you please talk about the sustainability of your gross margin and operating margin expansion and what would drive this going forward? Secondly, what are your strategic objectives and growth expectations for your VMS business? And then lastly, with respect to store brand Nexium, are there any circumstances under which you may be able to launch earlier than the 2017 date?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. So let me just start with the first part of the question, the sustainability of our gross margin, operating margin. We are very pleased with the results that we achieved in both operating margin and gross margin in the total company relative to the 23% operating margin that is an all-time record. If I go back to when I joined Perrigo in fiscal year 2007, I think that number was -- operating margin number was somewhere around 9%. So we've made great progress, to be clear. I don't want to get too much ahead of ourselves though, at this time. I think we continue to suggest the operating margins for the consolidated company as we've stated in our earnings, would be somewhere in that 21% to 24%. So I think we stick to that number. I obviously will continue to try to strive to get to the best number for our shareholders possible. But importantly, I think as you see from our numbers, we got to that 23% operating margin and still made significant investments in research and development during the quarter, which that was an important investment for us being up, I think it was 14% for the R&D. So we still made significant investments, increasing research and development as we look to just a very positive future. On the VMS category, I think the second part of your question, we are continuing to develop new products in the category. We are continuing to develop new relationships with retailers in the category. So we still see opportunities for the future. I will say, as we've said over the last year plus timeframe, it is a competitive marketplace, primarily from -- we have some competition from companies that are shipping product from overseas. We believe that's something that the U.S. consumer today is not completely aware of and there's going to be some opportunities there for us to work on that further. But I think from a point of view of return on invested capital, we are still very pleased with the business but we will continue to look to assess where we go with the business for the future. The third part of your question was Nexium. Our expectation is that that's a wonderful opportunity for us as a company. We've stated that we believe there's over $10 billion of new product that will move from prescription to OTC over the next 5 years. Obviously, Nexium is one of the largest of those products. The fact that Pfizer has put an additional acquisition of the rights for that product, we think is obviously a very important step. As to whether or not they will get a 3-year exclusivity right now, I would say that the operating assumption is most proton pump inhibitors have received a 3-year exclusivity as they have switched from prescription to OTC status. However, in this case, that product, the Nexium product, already has a frequent heartburn indication. So as to whether or not they will get a 3-year exclusivity, I really can't comment. I think that would be up to the FDA to make that decision but they do already have that frequent heartburn indication. We'll have to wait and see what the FDA decides on that question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I have more than one question but I will try to limit it to -- I'll make it 1 question. It's really challenging because it really covers several -- we'll talk after this call but let me ask you just a sort of a broad question related the your Rx business, which did perform very well this quarter. At the same time though, we are seeing the competitive landscape change, become more competitive with some of your key brands such as Aldara and I'm just wondering if that competitive landscape has been reflected in your guidance for the year? And specifically, the 58.4% gross margin is still about 1,000 basis points higher than your competition in the generic industry. I'm just wondering where you see that going and if competition is accelerating with some of your key brands because some of the competitors are now back on the market, putting pressure on price, how are you offsetting that kind of pressure?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. It's a very good question, Jami. Let me start with really, is there some things happening in the competitive landscape for our Rx business? The answer is yes. We are seeing some players in the Aldara product that you mentioned, the generic Aldara, that is correct. However, I think one of the things that's very important about how we define our Rx business is we talk about it as being extended topical and by that definition, it is clearly the dermatology products that you are referencing. However, it is other products that our extended topicals, are absorbed topically such as the respiratory products, the nasal products, the ophthalmic products, the other categories we are going into. So as we do see more competition in dermatology, that is correct, no question, we are going to see some of the other extended topical areas with our business and I think that's the respiratory products with our products that we're looking at, the nasal products with Nasacort as an example, one the generics that we have. We've been out there with that product for, I think it's going on over 1 year, 1.5 years at this point and we still do not have any generic competition, nor are we aware of anyone who's even filed for a patent challenge on that product. There's other places that we are going into with the extended topical portfolio. So we do see some dermatology competition, yes, but we're going to some other areas. Judy, you may want to comment as well?","Judy L. Brown","Well I'd just like to add to that, and this is both Jami and Louise's question, referencing gross margin specifically is another point of -- to keep in mind in all of this. I would talk about the three-legged stool of our business model. The supply chain work, I referenced in my prepared remarks, the global supply chain footprint and how the team has been working across all of our locations in order to site optimize, lower cost, be more efficient. All of that plays into the question of gross margin sustainability. I have more detail than I'd like to admit about the evolution of our gross margins and I can see that a lot of the leverage we've gotten over the years has come from the work that's gone on within supply chain. So obviously, you have visibility to new product launches. As an analyst, you have the insight to what new product competition might look like and how we can model the future going forward. I can also see that we get a lot of value by optimizing the large footprint we have globally and being very, very efficient and having gotten much more efficient over the course of the years and the team, with continuous improvement, does not plan to stop where they are. They plan to continue that momentum going forward.","Joseph C. Papa","I think that's a great add, Judy, especially when you think about products like the imiquimod Aldara where we're vertically integrated. So that by itself is just a great example of what Judy is illustrating.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Buck from Buckingham Research.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I'll limit it to one question as well. If I look at the -- the question is really on revenue and it's a 2 parter. Just if you look at revenues for this quarter and the past few quarters, you're seeing some negative surprises versus consensus and you admit that you were surprised a little bit on some of the moving parts. So I guess first question is how -- what can you do to better improve your own revenue forecasting? Secondly, the change in revenue guidance was really due to Sergeant\u2019s but you kept the other ranges, particularly for Nutritionals, unchanged. So why the confidence, particularly with the downside in Nutritionals and keeping the revenue guidance at still 8% to 12% and some of the other ranges as well?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Well first of all, David, we feel very good about our annual revenue guidance, that's what we provide and we've made no changes. However, to be clear, the Nutritionals business for the quarter is below what we would have expected. A part of that simply was as we bring on this plastic container line, the packaging line, there's always a time period it takes for certain things to happen. You just never can exactly predict in any product, especially one where quality so important, like an infant formula product that you just want to make sure you get everything properly done to the highest quality standards. And that's just something that takes some time. While that equipment is being installed and with what was happening with SAP, I guess there was just some part of the process that is not completely -- you go through a process, you make the changes, you make the improvements but there's some things that you just -- are going to be a variable, that you cannot go forward with until you get that to the appropriate quality standard. So for the Nutritionals part, it was really about our plastic container line as well as some of the orders that occurred in the previous quarter as a result of the SAP conversion. I think it was those 2 big issues for us. But as we look to the future, what are we excited about? We're excited about the fact that our plastic container today, that when we launch that product in the December timeframe, will look just like the national brand or national brand equivalent. Every time we've had national brand equivalent and moved to national brand equivalent, our market share goes up, at least based on the Consumer Healthcare model. So therefore, that's what gives us the excitement about the future for the plastic container.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Maybe before you move on, can you talk a little bit about international? You did reference, I'm not sure whether it was China, but some import restrictions in the quarter?","Joseph C. Papa","Yes. China, it wasn't so much import restrictions. What it was is they made some changes in the labeling process for our products that we needed to comply with those labeling change requirements. We have complied with those labeling change requirements but as a result of that, we had some delays in getting the product shipped. The product was made, it's fine from a quality point of view. It just simply was to amend label claims and amend the labeling specifications for the product. So that is behind us. We clearly still do need to get the product shipped and get it to them but the actual changes in the labeling requirement is completed.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gilbert from Bank of America.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My one question is for Joe and Judy and that is, other than Nutritionals and putting aside acquisition, is everything tracking according to plan or better on the revenue front so far this year?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Greg, I'll start, Judy may want to add some comments. I would say that based on what we've done with our total consolidated Perrigo guidance, we are tracking on plan for our full year. Is there some ups and downs in that plan? The answer to that is clearly yes. Some products will be approved earlier than we expected, some products will be approved later than we expected but that's just a normal probability waiting process that we go through during our quarterly reviews of the business. There's going to be some things go forward faster, some things go slower but as we looked at our full-year guidance, continue to expect continued strong operational performance of the business. Judy, anything else you want to add to that?","Judy L. Brown","The only thing I'd add to that is we maintain the base guidance and then obviously, as you know, added Sergeant\u2019s into that within the Consumer Healthcare segment. And just to remind everyone and we said before and I'll reiterate it again, this is another year where we have a heavier weight to the second half of the year because of new product timing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ami Fadia from UBS.","Ami Fadia - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, since you've closed the pet care deal, has there been any shift in your thinking with respect to the growth potential or the margin for that business? And if you could give us any more detail around the Frontline opportunity, that'll be great.","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. I'll start and Judy, please feel free to join in. I think we believe everything that we've said when we acquired the Sergeant\u2019s business to be comparable to where we are today, the revenue base $140 million. We expect high single-digit growth rate of that business. We expect once we have the opportunity to launch a store brand equivalent of the Frontline product, the Flea & Tick type products, we expect to accelerate that growth rate into a double-digit growth rate, is really the expectation of what we said. Relative to Frontline, specifically, it's a great product. It is a product that we feel fits exactly with the desires of our retailers where you can offer a quality product, a fit for mill store brand product, the same quality as the national brand with a much better value equation, make it more affordable for the retailers and the consumers and that's really the excitement of what we see. As I stated during my comment, we look at that as being a $500 million store brand -- I'm sorry, national brand product with a store brand opportunity that we can go after. So we're really excited about that kind of opportunity. Judy, anything else you want to add?","Judy L. Brown","The only thing I'd add, I wouldn't say any of our estimations changed at all. I mean, the only thing I'd highlight as we now own the business and are rolling up our sleeves and get into the detail of the ebbs and flows of the season, as I commented, unlike cough\/cold\/flu for humans is a winter activity, this a business that's more heavily spring and summer. And I commented that it's a busier business in our fiscal first and fourth quarters. They came off a year that just ended September 30 with approximately $140 million in revenue and we plan to grow off of that base or in excess $140 million revenue for a full year. So making sure that you pick up the full season of both our fiscal first and fourth quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky from Canaccord Genuity.","Randall Stanicky - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I don't want to harp on Nutritionals but I'll ask another question here. If we just take the midpoint of your guidance and obviously, adjust that for what you reported this quarter, it implies something in the range of around $150 million a quarter or 15% to 20% growth and so, that looks like a really big number. Judy, can you just help us quantify specifically, what we should be looking for, for the remainder of the year that can get us comfortable there? And maybe quantify the amount of revenue that you got delayed internationally, that would be helpful.","Judy L. Brown","Sure. It's a great question because obviously, as we looked at the rollout for the quarter in Nutritionals, we realized it's a challenge, there's no question. You've got the dynamic of the fourth quarter to first quarter shift and then the VMS weakness without the flow of the new product to the new retailers, et cetera. So it's a challenge and it's a great question. So as we look forward, what are the biggest components? It's new products, it's getting the plastic container out and they are going to be moving in this fiscal second quarter. So that starts to trickle in now in Q2 with the volume going out the door really in Q3 and 4. You have the sales to new retailers in VMS with the expectation of stabilizing of the remaining base in VMS. You have additionally, the movement of the international product flow that Joe was talking about just a moment ago with respect to the regulatory question. And in answer to your question, when I roll forward sales quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year, the international blips cause about a percentage of that 14 percentage point decline year-over-year. So it wasn't a huge number but it was a percentage or 2 of the total decline, 14% year-over-year in this segment. And then getting that international flow back out the door are going to be the key drivers. So to your point, given the view in Q1 but given then, our full-year perspective on the full year, year-over-year growth, we have to execute on stabilize the base, move new products, resume shipment of international.","Randall Stanicky - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I mean, Judy, are those numbers right? I mean, should be we looking for that much of an uptick? I'm just trying to get comfortable with the guidance range. And so is $140 million to $150 million sort of a run rate in that business realistic?","Joseph C. Papa","Yes, I think the only other thing I was going to add to what Judy said, Randall, is that clearly, Judy outlined the commentaries on the infant formula and those are absolutely clear but it is also the incremental VMS opportunity. So really, what it comes down to -- comes back to restoring the growth into the international market. Most importantly, it is the plastic container as well and the acceptance that we expect of the plastic container when we get a national brand equivalent. And then it is that incremental VMS, Vitamin\/Mineral Supplements business into the additional retailers is really the 3 parts of the story that I would say are going to be the key.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur from Needham.","Elliot Wilbur - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Big picture question for you, Joe. Over the past couple of quarters, some of the drug majors and the PBMs and most recently, Express Scripts have talked about sort of unexpected declines in overall drug utilization which they're attributing to consumer hesitancy. I guess, blaming it on the certainty in the economy and you're certainly seeing it in the RX side. And if you look at volume growth trends in the store brand or the OTC market, seen pretty pronounced deceleration in national brands, of course, which is sort of an ongoing, I guess, secular dynamic. But even over the last 4 to 5 quarters, you've seen a fair degree of deceleration in terms of the overall rate of growth in store brand product as well, roughly a 300, 400 basis point decline. I'm just sort of wondering, obviously, you continue to gain share. I know you've been relatively conservative in your assumptions this year but are you starting to see sort of an unexpected deceleration in overall utilization rates?","Joseph C. Papa","I think the \u2013 it's a fair question on the category growth in the OTC market. It's absolutely -- it's a fair question there in terms of the total category growth, it was just up the 0.7% over the last 52 weeks. So that is slowing down. I think what we are seeing though, is the continued acceleration of store brand as being the reason why we're seeing the growth in our OTC category. For us to have a 9.4% growth in our OTC category, we think is a strong indication. I do think though, that if I go back to the branded prescription segment of the business, I think part of that is just generally related to the economy. I can't predict what's going to happen in the economy but we still believe we are in the favorable spot in the environment relative to the movement of store brand as a general comment on the marketplace. Longer term, every data point I've seen is that the utilization of pharmaceuticals goes up the older you are. So as people -- the baby boomers get older, as the people live longer, I still believe pharmaceutical utilization will continue to go up. I do accept, though, that there's going to be some variation in any given year. But I think over the long term, we still expect pharmaceutical, both prescription and OTC utilization to go up over the long term just based on the demographics which people are living longer and the older you are, the more pharmaceuticals you consume. So in general, I guess in kind of a review of what my comments would be, we still see the market growing, albeit only 0.7% over the last 52 weeks. The important growth is really being driven by store brand, being up 8.5%. But over the long term, our expectation is we'll still see increased demand for pharmaceuticals based on the demographics of people living longer and knowing that people -- older people take more pharmaceuticals and just based on all the data we've seen.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So with respect to my question, it's on Mucinex. Could you just offer some more clarity on the timing of Mucinex 600 milligrams? And can you also update us on the timing of launches of the D and DM formulations for which Watson may have exclusivity?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. So I guess I'd go back to the statements we made in the comments at the beginning. We are continuing to work on the Mucinex 600 milligram single-entity product. We are in the process of validating additional batches of the Mucinex 600 milligram or Guaifenesin 600 milligram Extended-Release product. Our expectations are we will launch that during our current fiscal year and really, that's probably as much as I can say on that. I will say in addition, in the question about the additional members of the family, as we stated last quarter, we do expect to launch additional members of the family. We just have not gone into the specific products additionally that we will launch of those products. But we do expect to launch additional members of the Mucinex family of products during our fiscal year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser from Caris.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","So in the Consumer Healthcare segment, I guess the new product sales that you said, I guess was $13 million. That was quite a bit lower than my estimate of $24 million. And I'm just wondering how the new store brand Prevacid is doing because we saw price declines at the shelves at Walmart in the range of 11% to 16% on the various SKUs. And in the store we look at, it's actually supplied by Dr. Reddy's in that store. So it seems to me that if Dr. Reddy's wants to gain more share and get more of Walmart on Prevacid, that they would cut price. And we saw that price decrease at the shelves and we see lower-than-expected new product sales. I mean store brand Prevacid and Delsym, I believe, would be the 2 main things in your new product sales, correct me if I'm wrong. So just kind of wondering what's going on and what you think the competitive stance of Dr. Reddy's will be going forward. And it just seems to me that if they want to continue to gain share in your area, in your industry, they're just going to keep cutting price and trying to get more -- it just seems to me there's going to be more examples of the products being shared, supplying part of Walmart for one of you and part for the other. So can you just kind of comment on the general competitive landscape there?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Well, I think the comment that you make, let me just start with the first -- each part. The other -- there are products that we have launched, Loratadine-D 12, is another example, Minoxidil Foam are other examples that are in addition to the ones that you've stated. So are there some other new products that are still new in our categorization, that just to add to that. But otherwise, Lansoprazole is clearly an important one and Delsym or the Dextromethorphan Extended-Release Suspension is very important to us, yes. On the question of competition, we do have competition on the Lansoprazole, that is clear. We do not have competition on Minoxidil Foam. We do not do have competition on the Dextromethorphan Suspension and we have limited competition on the Loratadine-D 12. So you happen to pick one that there is competition on, that is correct. Relative to the environment that we face on the marketplace of our store brand products, I would say that there's really been no major change in the market environment. Dr. Reddy's has a product, that is correct. However, it hasn't really been a major change and it's not a marketplace where we expect 10 or 20 players to show up and I think that's what really differentiates it from -- the over-the-counter product categories from the generic Rx where you may have 10 or 20 players. So really, it's a limited number of players. So I think, for the most part, I can never predict what any of my competitors will do but I think that they have business, they have something at risk if they go ahead and have a significant pricing decline in the business. They will, obviously, have an impact on their own sales. So I think the normal capitalism effects of supply and demand work here and our expectation is the market will be relatively stable for the Lansoprazole product very much for the future. I can't say that in any individual customer, there won't be some ups and downs but the marketplace is really relatively stable at this time. The only other comment I'd add, Linda, just to give you a sense of the total perspective on pricing at the company. Our pricing environment as a company from a total perspective, the pricing environment is, at this point, flat to up slightly as a company across our total portfolio, which is very consistent with where it's been over the, at least the last 4, 5 years, the pricing environment is relatively similar for us as a company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Annabel Samimy from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Didn't really want to really harp too much on the growth rates this quarter relative to the guidance but it's clear that the growth rates for each of the different segments are a little bit inconsistent with the average that you've laid out for the fiscal year. So can you help us understand where the big pushes are going to be? So I mean, I guess for consumer health, we can kind of understand that cough and cold is going to help the growth rates come back up into the range and obviously, you have the Pet Care added on. And then with generics, should we assume that growth attenuates for the rest of the year? I mean, is there -- is it just 20% this quarter and then it just attenuates? So can you just help us understand how we should think about the rest of the year and what some of the pushes and pulls might be?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Well, first and foremost, I think if you think about what we talked about when we gave original guidance in August, one of the things we said was we're making an assumption of a normal cough\/cold\/flu season. That obviously, would be an assumption that last year certainly, was a lower cough\/cold\/flu season. So that means, by definition, you would expect a bigger increase in our -- effectively, Perrigo's fiscal quarter 2 and fiscal quarter 3 versus last year. So that certainly is part of the kind of the assumptions we laid out at the beginning of the year. And at this point, that's certainly something we continue to expect a normal cough\/cold\/flu season. But that would have an influence on the projections for the remaining part of the year. I think the only other thing, comment I'd say, as I stated before, we don't give out quarterly guidance, we give out annual guidance. And as we looked at the roll up of our opportunities, we can feel that we have the opportunity to, as we stated before, to grow the guidance of 12% to 16% when you add the effects of putting in Sergeant's products into our portfolio. I think the other question you asked was Rx, if I recall that?","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, the Rx businesses, yes.","Joseph C. Papa","Yes. Rx business, strong, continue to expect strong growth in that business. I would say that one of the factors for the growth in the current quarter for RX was we did pick up one incremental month of Paddock that was not in the previous year. So in other words, there was that 1 month effect of Paddock that we got this year that was not in last year for the quarter. So that this one part of it. But on balance, we still are expecting, as we look at our Rx business, we're still expecting that 15% to 19% growth year-over-year growth for our Rx business and we haven't made any changes in that. But that obviously, we outperformed that during the first quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Steinberg from Deutsche Bank","David M. Steinberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","My question relates to your Consumer Healthcare business. You've noted that it grew 9% year-over-year. But in the press release, it mentions that this is partially offset by a decline in existing products, namely analgesics and feminine hygiene. So with respect analgesics, I was just curious whether this decline had anything to do with Johnson & Johnson's re-entry into the market? And secondly, speaking of that, any update -- I may have missed it, but any updated thoughts on how much business you may retain and how much you may lose when J&J fully gets back into the market with Tylenol and related products?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. David, couple comments. I guess first, let me start with the last part, the J&J. We have not made any changes in our J&J assumption. Our J&J assumption still expects that they would be returning to the market early 2013, so calendar year 2013. So our expectation is that's when they will return. We feel the right way for us to look at J&J is we'll take it a quarter by a quarter relative to their return to the marketplace. They've had some challenges, to be clear. So for us, we think the right way to do it is look at it one quarter at a time. Relative to the assumption, the operating assumption that we have in our business, it is continue to expect that as they return to the business, that instead of our normal 90%, 91% retention rate, when the customer or consumer makes a decision to move from national brand to store brand, we were operating that we would not retain 91%, that we would retain approximately 50% of the consumers that have moved from the national brand to the store brand because they could not -- there was no access to a national brand product. And the other part of his question...","Judy L. Brown","The existing product. Maybe I'll grab that, David. In our \u00fcber-granularity of our description of the ups and downs business unit by business unit, we always go through and help give color. Here are the categories where sales net went up, here the categories where they net went down and then new products and FX on top of that. It just so happened that relative to this point in time last year, the analgesic category as a whole and fem hy as a whole were down. Fem hy volume changed because of supply flow. But that's just a relative point in time that last year versus this year. Any relative analgesic change was not specifically driven by branded competition dynamics.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of David Buck.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just wanted to just talk a little bit about the timing of the product launches and revenues. I think, Judy, you mentioned more weighting to the third and fourth quarters. How does that jive I guess with the cough\/cold season and what looks like pretty easy comps for cough\/cold relative to last year? Are you seeing any changes in ordering patterns or are you seeing any changes in terms of what inventories are being kept on the shelves in Consumer Health in particular?","Judy L. Brown","There's no anomaly, I'd say, at this point in the year where we are in the season. Right now, where we sit here at the beginning of November it's, I'll call it, normal order flow. As we've said every year since I've been here at least, you don't start to see order patterns shifting until you get deep into the season, more Christmastime, January timeframe is when you start getting an indication of where the reorder patters may be. The only exception to that, at least in my tenure was the year we had the H1N1. But as we all know, that was an extraordinary year with an extraordinary health event. So right now, no unusual order patterns. My comment on new products of course, being heavily or more heavily-weighted to the second half of the year is not exclusive to the Consumer Healthcare business; that's across entire portfolio. When we talk about new product expectations in any year, we talk about a number for the whole Perrigo portfolio and that stands as such. But the Consumer Healthcare new products expectations for the year are also more second half of the year, also because you're counting products that launch each quarter, \"piling up\" over the course of the year. So you get the volume effect of as those products launches, that you get the volume in the second half of the year.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the allotted time for questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Joe Papa.","Joseph C. Papa","Thank you, operator. Thank you, everyone, for your interest in Perrigo. I think we have a good start to the year.

Mr. Brad Joseph, you may begin your conference.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you and good morning everybody, and welcome to Perrigo's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Hope you all had a chance to review the press release we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the release is available on our website as is the slide presentation for this call. Joining today's call are Perrigo, President and CEO Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff; and Perrigo CFO, Ron Winowiecki.","I'd like to remind everybody that during this call, participants will make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for investors and shareholders and safe harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued this morning. In addition to the appendix for today's presentation we provided reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures presented.","Turning to the agenda on slide three. First, Uwe will briefly discuss the appointment of Perrigo's new Chairman of the Board of Directors, followed by highlights of our first quarter financial results. Next Ron will discuss the financial results in detail, the strength of our balance sheet, and our calendar year 2018 guidance. Finally Uwe will close out the call by highlighting his 2018 priorities after, which we will open the line for questions.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Uwe.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone. Before discussing our quarterly results, I would first like to congratulate Rolf Classon on his appointment as Chairman of the Perrigo Board of Directors. Rolf's appointment illustrates Perrigo's commitment to good corporate governance by establishing a healthy rotation of right perspective at the board leadership level. I have served with Rolf on the Board of Directors at Catalent and observe firsthand his extensive leadership experience and broad industry knowledge.","The Board and the management look forward to leveraging Rolf's leadership, operating experience, and industry knowledge as we continue to position Perrigo's unique portfolio of businesses to drive long-term shareholder value. Finally, the Board joins me in thanking Laurie for her leadership as Chairman over the past two years and we look forward to her continued contribution both as an independent director and member of the board audit committee.","Now, let us turn to our quarterly results on slide five. I continue to be excited by our ability to provide quality affordable health care solutions around the world. I am very pleased with the progress the team has made on executing against our 2018 priorities I outlined last quarter. As a reminder these priorities are: one, delivering on our plan for the year; two, maintaining focus on operational execution; three, driving growth; and four, progressing on our value creation roadmap.","In challenging end markets, our unique business model delivered consolidated net growth of approximately 2% on an organic constant currency basis with adjusted EPS growth of 21% on a segment level.","In Consumer Healthcare America, I'm pleased that the team delivered net sales growth of 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. As a testament of our durable model, the team delivered net sales growth in every major OTC category versus last year. We saw strong performance in our infant nutrition category and the positive impact of relatively strong quality. These benefits were partially offset by a decline in the animal health category. In line with our focus on operational excellence, the team expanded adjusted operating margin 120 basis points versus last year illustrating the continued durability of this unique business.","Turning to our Consumer Healthcare International segment. Net sales growth of 1.4% was in line with our expectations versus the prior year on an organic constant currency basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by the execution of our focused brand strategy where we are continuing to prioritize regional brands that have the greatest opportunity to drive long term value. Growth was led by $20 million of new product sales in the quarter offsetting a relatively soft cough\/cold season in Europe.","As a result of continuing actions to drive profitability of this business, the team delivered a strong adjusted operating margin of 17%. In the challenging end markets RX segment net sales were slightly lower than the prior year and adjusted operating margin was 40% which included increased R&D investment over the prior year. Results in the RX segment were below our expectation which Ron will discuss in more detail.","Finally, our durable platform once again delivered excellent cash flow. Cash flow conversion to adjusted net income was nearly 100%. Utilizing our strong free cash flow generation and balance sheet flexibility, we repurchased approximately $108 million of shares in the quarter. Overall, I'm very pleased with the consolidated results delivered by the team in the first quarter.","Our durable consumer facing businesses remain well positioned while the RX team continues to manage more challenging end markets. The updated segment guidance that Ron will provide is grounded in these current business dynamics. We remain focused on delivering our previously stated consolidated net sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance ranges.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Ron.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Uwe. Let me start by saying that our durable business model continues to perform in dynamic end markets as illustrated by our first quarter financial results. Key performance highlights include: one, store brand continuing to gain share; two, our focused brand strategy and margin improvement program in Europe continuing to deliver improved financial results; and three, our business model continuing to generate strong operating cash flow conversion to adjusted net income. In a few minutes I will discuss the actions the team is taking to deliver our consolidated plan for 2018. But first let's walk through the first quarter results.","Turning to slide seven. You can see our reported results for the first quarter. Reported net sales were $1.2 million and reported net income was $81 million. The primary adjustments to GAAP results are driven by the exclusion of $89 million of non-cash amortization expense, $10 million of change in our financial assets, $4 million from losses on investments and $4 million in acquisition and contingent consideration adjustments.","GAAP tax expense as a percent of pre-tax income was 26.9% in the quarter compared to a non GAAP tax rate of 19.5%. The difference is primarily due to the tax effect of the pre-tax adjustments consistent with the non GAAP pre-tax income.","Turning to CHC Americas result on slide eight. Net sales in the quarter were $602 million compared to $583 million in the prior year or a growth of 3% on a constant currency basis. As highlighted in the appendix of this presentation, store brand continues to gain share. This quarter, we experienced strong factory sales to our customers, driven by increased net sales in the infant nutrition category and strong cough\/cold and analgesic category net sales due to a strong cough\/cold season. These positive drivers and new product sales of $11 million were partially offset by lower net sales in the animal health category due primarily to a soft start to the flea and tick season.","Adjusted gross margin of 35.1% was 60 basis points higher than the prior year, due primarily to strong production volumes in the quarter. The durability of this segment is illustrated by the adjusted operating margin of 21.4%, which was 120 basis points higher than the prior year driven by greater gross margin flow through and lower operating expenses as a percent to net sales.","Turning to slide nine. You can see that net sales grew 1.4%, primarily by new product sales of $20 million in our Consumer Healthcare International segment. As a reminder, this growth measure excludes both favorable foreign currency movements of $43 million and $22 million in net sales from the exited Russian and unprofitable distribution businesses in 2017.","Partially offsetting these favorable effects were lower net sales in the cough\/cold and analgesics categories, due primarily to a relatively soft cough\/cold season in Europe, in addition to discontinued products of $6 million.","Adjusted gross margin was a record 54.2%, an increase of 350 basis points over the prior year driven by improved product mix, new product launches and the continued benefit of insourcing initiatives. We are pleased to see the benefits of the actions the team has taken to improve the margin profile of this segment.","Adjusted operating margin was 17%, an increase of 320 basis points over the prior year, due primarily to the gross margin flow through. The adjusted operating margin performance was higher than our expectations in the quarter due to the timing of growth investments that are forecasted to occur later in 2018.","Turning to RX on slide 10. Net sales in the first quarter were $214 million compared to $217 million last year. New product sales of $10 million were offset by lower net sales of existing products of $12 million, due primarily to price erosion which was in line with our expectations. New product net sales were lower than expected due to a supply disruption of a key new product, which I will further discuss in a few minutes.","Adjusted gross margin was 55.3%, an increase of 90 basis points over the prior year due primarily to product mix. Adjusted operating margin for the segment was 39.9%. R&D investments as a percentage to net sales increased compared to the prior year as we continued to invest in our pipeline.","Turning now to slide 11. Our balance sheet and cash flow generation remain strong. As of March 31, 2018, total cash on the balance sheet was $687 million. Total outstanding debt was approximately $3.3 billion.","During the first three months of 2018, we generated $172 million in cash from operations leading to cash flow conversion as a percentage of adjusted net income of nearly 100%. We believe our strong cash flow conversion combined with the strength of our balance sheet differentiates us in the marketplace. Our capital allocation decisions are focused on total shareholder returns within this context of our longstanding commitment to an investment grade financial policy. As part of our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy, we completed approximately $108 million of share repurchases and paid $27 million in dividends in the first quarter.","Now let's discuss our segment guidance on slide 12. In CHC Americas, we continue to expect net sales to be approximately $2.44 billion or growth of approximately 1% on a constant currency basis in a soft consumer market. As a quick reminder, our guidance includes growth versus last year in our market leading OTC and infant formula categories. Partially offsetting this growth are lower than expected net sales in our animal health business due primarily to a slower start to the flea and tick season versus last year and the upcoming loss of a partnered product in the second half of 2018.","In addition, our team is proactively addressing recent cost increases in certain commodities. And despite this headwind, we continue to expect CHC Americas adjusted operating margin to be approximately in line with the prior year remaining at record levels. At CHC International, we now expect 2018 net sales of approximately $1.59 billion, an increase from our previous guidance of approximately $1.56 billion due primarily to favorable foreign currency movements.","As a reminder, our 2018 net sales growth is expected to be approximately 2% on organic constant currency basis which excludes $33 million from businesses we exited in 2017. As previously discussed, we're continuing to take action to improve the cost structure of this business including improvements to the gross margin profile as evidenced by the record gross margins in Q1. In line with the actions to improve the margin profile of this business, we are now increasing our adjusted operating margin guidance to approximately mid 15%.","In RX, we're updating our 2018 guidance. Let me discuss these changes. First, during the quarter, we experienced a supply disruption in scopolamine, a key new product which launched in the third quarter of 2017. As a reminder, this is a complex patch product. The team has identified a stability deviation and is working with our partner to remediate the issue. Our updated RX guidance includes a fourth quarter relaunch of this product.","Second, our updated guidance now includes less favorable product mix with our price erosion assumption in line with our expectations. Based on these assumptions, we're updating our net sales growth to approximately 6% for this segment which translates to a net sales guidance of approximately $1.03 billion. Adjusted operating margin guidance for the full year is approximately 40% which includes a low to mid teen percentage increase in R&D investments versus last year.","Now let me discuss how these updated RX guidance assumptions impact our expected phasing for 2018. On our March earnings call, we discussed the expected launch of a generic version of ProAir in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result of the updates provided today, we now anticipate approximately 35% of 2018 RX net sales will be realized in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, we expect the second and third quarter adjusted operating margin to be in the mid to high 30% range.","On slide 13, you can see that we are reconfirming our 2018 consolidated guidance ranges. We continue to expect consolidated net sales of $5 billion to $5.1 billion led by new product sales of over $300 million and growth across all of our segments as our durable consumer businesses are growing in a soft consumer environment.","Adjusted operating income guidance remains unchanged in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.09 billion. In line with our updated segment guidance, we expect to realize approximately one-third of our adjusted operating income for the year in the fourth quarter.","Our adjusted EPS guidance range for 2018 remains at $5.05 to $5.45 per share. Our 2018 guidance for operational cash flow remains approximately $775 million or greater than 100% conversion at the midpoint of our earnings guidance range. As a reminder, included in this guidance is the working capital to support our strong new product launch forecast, notably the expected fourth quarter launch of generic ProAir.","In summary, our durable business model continues to deliver results as highlighted by our strong consumer performance in the first quarter and our updated CHC International segment guidance for the year. The benefits of our diversified portfolio are evidenced by, one, our new product launch guidance of over $300 million which is driving growth in each of our segments; two, reconfirming our consolidated net sales and adjusted EPS guidance ranges; and three, our free cash flow generation and balance sheet flexibility which we believe differentiates Perrigo.","I will now turn the call back to Uwe.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Ron. In closing, on slide 15, I would like to reiterate our top priorities for this year, first delivering on our plan. Our consumer facing businesses are on track to meet their goals and we are focused on delivering on our 2018 operating plan.","Second, maintaining focus on operational execution. The core pillar of Perrigo is to focus on operational efficiency and to deliver quality products to our customers. The operational focus in our CHCI segment has led to our improved margin expectations. We continue to execute on our operational priorities across all businesses.","Third, driving growth. We are investing in our businesses to innovate and compete in the market and the products where we have the right to win. The launch of Omeprazole ODT last month is a prime example of how Perrigo can capitalize on opportunities where we see white spaces in the market. We are continuing to increase growth investments for these type of projects and others in all of our segments.","And four, we are working on our value creation road map which is a comprehensive process focused on strategy, growth and capital return. We are taking a holistic look at organic growth opportunities, increasing portfolio efficiencies and prioritizing inorganic opportunities and total shareholder return.","Our mission of providing quality affordable healthcare products is a true benefit to society. Our durable and unique business model enables our global team to deliver affordable healthcare solutions for patients, consumers and families.","I will now turn the call back over to Brad.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Uwe. Operator, Justin, we'd like to open the call for questions now and ask that all participants please just ask one question. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much for the question. My question was really around the operating margins on the consumer business, particularly the international side. I know you touched on this in the script. But could you elaborate a little bit more what's driving that fairly dramatic step up to I think about 17% for CHC International this quarter?","And then the second part of this question, help us just bridge between that number and it's a raised range with that 15.5% range in the guidance. Why is there kind of a step down we should think about from here going forward? Thanks so much.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Hey, Chris. Sorry I interrupted your second question. Thanks for the question. If you step back and think about the strategy of the segment, we've clearly outlined since about the last year and half focusing on a core strategy of focused brands and that initiative is focused around ensuring that our capital expenditures are around regional brands where we have the right to win, where we have strong market share and we have strong pull through from a sales and commercial standpoint. So number one.","Number two is we've outlined a margin improvement program that has a number of facets to it. In-sourcing initiative is a key attribute affecting gross margins, improved sales infrastructure and the like. And what we are seeing this quarter, it's interesting, is in the gross margin profile, 54% is a record and so you're seeing a trend from a gross margin standpoint that we've been articulating and discussing. We're going to see some benefits and we are seeing benefits in the gross margin profile this quarter.","From an operating margin standpoint, we highlighted on the call, and to be very clear, is there is always timing of operating expenses in this business. We talked about we're going to see growth in operating expenses from a growth initiative, i.e. R&D and A&P to support the portfolio and again to support our focused brand strategy.","So there's some timing in Q1. It's a little bit lower than our own expectations. Svend and his team are doing a very good job. They have some lower spending on cough\/cold season. They're looking at product pull throughs and the seasonal Q2 lifestyle products, weight loss in particular are stronger. So you're going to see a higher spending in Q2, which normalizes out the portfolio.","So if you think of the guidance we gave to you at the mid 15%, actually you should assume that we're going to be on that run rate for the first half of the year. So therefore you're going to have a little stronger pull through in Q1 for the timing and a little offset in Q2, purely due to timing. Again, what we're pleased about and I'll go back to the P&L structure is the pull through of gross margins you're seeing in this particular quarter.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks, guys. Can you just comment on the CHCA business? Are you seeing any changing dynamics in the pricing trend there, particularly as you think about your retail customers versus e-commerce? That would be helpful. And the new launch contribution, what can pick that up? And then the part B of the question, Uwe, can you just talk about, is RX actively part of the strategic review, that business being potentially divested or are you now committed to it? Thanks.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you. Let me start with the RX question. We are the leader in delivery of diversified extended topical healthcare solutions and leveraging our extensive product development, manufacturing and our regulatory capabilities. So going through the exercise, we are going through to actually look at all of our businesses, at all of our segments and we are focusing on exactly on what I said, what organic growth opportunities do we have, what inorganic opportunities we need to prioritize, what portfolio efficiencies we need to generate and how that all can contribute to increased shareholder return. So from that perspective, clearly any part of our business is part of the review process. And we will keep you updated once we have completed that.","On the second part on the CHCA business, we are the store brand market leader here with an unmatched product breadth combined with fast moving consumer goods and supply chain capabilities. And we serve our consumers through all channels they want to purchase from. So from the perspective of pricing, we have actually seen no changes. The business is extremely durable and we operate obviously in a dynamic environment. But from that perspective, we have seen nothing that's a surprise because it's all in line with past performance.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Randall. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Esther Rajavelu from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Esther Rajavelu - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. This is Esther Rajavelu on for Gregg Gilbert. Can you please help us think about how the new product sales of $300 million are split among the three segments?","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. I'll take that one. Thanks for the question, Esther. From a new product standpoint, we're very pleased to confirm our guidance, $300 million for the year. As you know we look at this from a portfolio standpoint. On a guidance basis, we don't distribute this within the CHCA, CHCI and RX business. We try to just keep it at a portfolio level.","However we have said the following is, there are key product launches in Q4, most notably in the RX segment. ProAir is a key product that's in our guidance. Our goal is to launch it in Q4. We've given a clear articulation of EPS contribution of $0.09 a share in the period. So you can assume that it's weighted towards RX from a weighting standpoint. But again we don't give the pro rata \u2013 a specific pro rata (25:25) for each of our segments. But again because of those strong pull through of (25:27) launches in RX, there is a weighting towards the RX business.","Esther Rajavelu - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Operator, we're getting a little bit of background noise. Just saying we're getting a little bit of background noise, and see if you can find out what that is. Sorry Jamie. Go ahead.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's okay. Just, Uwe, a question for you, if you take a step back and you look at the long-term growth drivers of the CHC business in the Americas. This is a business that obviously benefited from tremendous tailwinds a decade ago or five years ago, much of which have diminished. And when you think about the business going forward, clearly the whole industry is facing some headwinds. And I think one of the biggest headwinds for you is just absence of Rx to OTC switches.","So can you talk about what are \u2013 you are still conveying optimism in the 2% to 4% of this business going forward. What are the key growth drivers? And to what extent are Rx to OTC switch brands necessary to drive that growth? I know you talked about new line extensions including Omeprazole OTC. That's kind of a new opportunity for you. Maybe you could talk about that. But just really what are going to be the key growth drivers of that business going forward?","And secondly, just on the RX margins which have trended lower. They are still high relative to the industry. What is a reasonable long-term outlook for the generic operating margins? Thanks very much.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yes, from the CHC Americas business, I have to reiterate that we are the market leader here in the store brand business. We have significant market share in all of the categories we provide products on. And store brands provide a significant contribution to retailer, all of our channels earnings from that perspective.","So I think we are very comfortable with where we are from that perspective, because this is more than producing a pill. This is a value proposition we present to those channels. It goes all the way from R&D to the medicine cabinet of a consumer and you have to do a lot of things very, very well to play in this business. So from a growth perspective, to make that connection, obviously in the past, Rx to OTC switches have been a driver. We have seen less recently. But there are opportunities in that business to grow. We are actually, as part of our value creation process, we are looking at the broader opportunities in that business from an organic and from an inorganic perspective that are fairly broad.","And right now, we are pursuing mainly opportunities around the products we have with innovations as we have outlined as the example of Omeprazole ODT which is innovative in a dose form for the consumer. We have I think a very good pipeline of products and we will definitely keep you updated once we finish our value creation road map on an updated long-term perspective on the business. But I feel very comfortable with that business.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Then the other part on the RX margin.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah thanks, RX margins. I'll take that question. Thanks, Brad. We remain really steadfast and we said this continuously, to the strength of the diversified extended topical platform that our RX business is focused on. That's a core strategy. We've discussed many times, this business is about new products, new products, new products. And you can see from our guidance, we continue to invest in our pipeline. We are increasing R&D investments this year, as we've discussed, low to mid teens on a percentage basis in the RX business. And we feel comfortable relative to our pipeline going forward to offset the pricing dynamics.","Now listen, there's always quarter-by-quarter dynamics in this business. That's something we don't, as you know, get hung up on. There may be some variations based on the timing of new product launch and the like. However, in a long-term basis we like our pipeline. We like the business strategy. We're coming at the business from a position of strength and we like the forward-looking pipeline profile this business has.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Great. Thanks, Jami. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen from (30:14). Your line is open. Please ask your questions.","Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So wanted to ask on some of the tailwinds in the sector. So do you have any updated views with respect to the Monographs Modernization Act and when that could be passed? And also initiatives that Gottlieb has laid out to increase Rx OTC switches? Thank you.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","We certainly like the tone at the FDA, so you're highlighting an area that at one level we can say that validates our business model. Perrigo's focus on quality affordable healthcare is wave of the future. And Gottlieb, to your commentary, has been directly focused on expanding access to OTC. That's been a core part of what he's been discussing.","And then you highlighted an interesting new development that we like to highlight as well, is where does the tone become reality. That's always the question. And the Monographs Modernization Act is a good example of regulatory movement you're seeing today which has been sponsored by the CHPA, the Consumer Healthcare Association that Jeff Needham was a President of the last couple of years. And that bill has now passed the Senate committees. So you're starting to see momentum in the Senate.","And remind ourselves, why is that important. Why is the Monograph Modernization Act important from an example point of view? It motivates innovation. So what it's designed to do is take a class of trade in the OTC space and motivate where innovation can take place to get protection. There is still some debates on what that protection window will look like, but assume it's 1.5 to 2 years in duration. And now we have more targets to shoot at for growth.","So we're excited about the regulatory tone. You're seeing some of the tone become reality. I can't comment specifically when certain things will be ratified. It's not fair to do that. But we certainly look at, again our business model on quality affordable healthcare sitting right in the tone that you're seeing from a regulatory standpoint at this time.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks for the question, Louise. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Maris from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. As it stands now for capital deployment, where do you think the best opportunities are? And to the extent that it's CHCA, do point of care diagnostics seem to make sense? Or is it more a focused on adding brands? Thank you.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yes. Thank you for your question. We are in the middle of the process looking at our portfolio and growth opportunities as I have laid out, organically and inorganically comprehensively. And it's a little early to comment on individual developments in certain business units. But it is fair to say that CHCA at the core of our company has an extremely high focus and we are looking here definitely as part of our project on all organic opportunities we have, and that also includes white spaces where store brand plays a role and we are not playing a significant role at this point.","The process again, it's going to take a little while. We are moving forward here and we will keep you updated once we have a comprehensive conclusion of all of our business segments and the corporate portfolio strategy and we'll share that information later this fall with you.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, David. Appreciate the question. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Trucchio from Berenberg Capital. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Patrick Trucchio - Berenberg Capital Markets","Thanks. Good morning. My question is in regard to evolving customer experience at brick-and-mortar stores in your U.S. business. With the potential vertical integration we're seeing in your important retailers, what we're hearing is that these combined entities may seek to bend the healthcare utilization curve by encouraging members to visit clinics in their stores with the additional benefit being that foot traffic to the stores could increase. So can you comment on this potential specifically? And what if anything you've heard regarding the vertical entities perhaps looking to OTC to bend the cost curve on drug utilization.","And finally, what from a technological perspective, either with the use of apps or kiosks that Perrigo can offer to help your retail customers improve both foot traffic and the in-store experience of customers once they are there? Thanks very much.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yes. Thank you for the question. I will try to keep the answer short because I think that is something we can talk about for a long time. Number one is we obviously service all kinds, all channels and the particular channel you mentioned actually has seen a smaller decline compared to the other channels. So we're cautiously watching what everybody is doing to increase foot traffic into those channels. And obviously as we said, our strategy is to meet consumers at their point of purchase and that means any point of purchase, whether it is brick-and-mortar store, whether it is e-commerce or any other type of retailers that we serve in the United States.","In Europe, the situation is a little bit different. And I make here the connection to your e-health (35:52). We for example service in Europe certain countries that have a higher, much higher chain development compared to the U.S. like the UK, so where you have certain channels through which we reach the consumers. And we have for example, like in Germany or France, a lot of independent pharmacies through which we sell our products.","So what we try to do here, particularly to our lifestyle brands actually, we are developing an e-commerce strategy with those type of applications where we increase or where we want to increase the experience of our consumers and help them to stay with those type of products as a true benefit to join them on their way to a healthy life. That is going to be actually one of the avenues we are exploring in our strategy. So hopefully that clears that a little bit up.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Pat. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Congrats on the results. I have two questions. First, at a high level, I just wanted to better understand the drivers in both the U.S. consumer healthcare and international consumer healthcare. So with respect to the U.S., could you talk about new product launch opportunities over the next year or two, what some of the key product launches are that we should be thinking about? And then in the international segment, could you just explain why the operating margin is only targeted to be about 15% for [technical difficulty] (37:48). Sorry about that.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Dave, you're trying to get a third question in in the backdoor.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I guess we're juggling five calls this morning. Anyway, with respect to the consumer healthcare international, so to repeat, could you just talk about why the operating margin target is only 15% for the remainder of 2018 and how we should think about prospects for margin expansion beyond 2018? Thank you.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","All right. So on the CHCA business, we obviously have an extensive record on bringing new products to the market. We do that in close conclusion with consumer expectations and the experience on innovations around products that are already in the market with different finished dose forms like again Omeprazole ODT. We have a number of other products in the pipeline that we launch frequently. And generally, our new product launches in this business are around 2% to 3% of revenue.","So there is, as we said, there is not one big product coming this year as a huge Rx to OTC switch. Consider this a by plan of, I would like to say it's like a string of pearls coming to the market and increasing our already large portfolio. We are not that dependent on one product. You remember we have more than 10,000 of SKUs in the market and our strength is really the breadth of our products.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, I'll take your second question, David, on the CHC International margins. I'll start by saying we're very pleased with the margin pull through that you've been seeing kind of consistently now. You kind of look at the sequential and quarterly trends, the operating margin profile of this business continues to remain strong.","In this quarter, again I'm highlighting the gross margin profile because we've had a couple of core strategies. I'm not sure investors have understood the value of those strategies. And we call it the focused brand initiative, which is really focusing on those core brands where we have the right to win. And Svend and his team continue to do a great job improving the portfolio and growing those brands that have a higher gross margin contribution. So number one at the GP level.","The second initiative is in-sourcing, and we've talked about that. We're a little over halfway of our journey at this point, so there's further expansion in the in-sourcing initiative going forward, but we clearly have seen the benefits pull through the last couple quarters and this quarter in particular at the gross margin level for the in-sourcing initiative.","And then there's the OpEx area. So we talk about improved infrastructure. We've talked about from a sales standpoint in particular and we've talked about how we're starting the journey from a back office standpoint. So you asked the question, first of all to correct a data point, we've updated guidance to mid 15% from the old 15%. So we've actually increased the guidance metric for the year at the adjusted operating margin level.","And the reason it's not trending, I'll call it, higher in the short term has been very clear we're reinvesting back in this business. We're putting in infrastructure programs, integrated sales and operational planning systems, a key example. We're investing in the R&D infrastructure in this business. And that's why we're taking the margin expansion. We're reinvesting back in for the longer-term margin growth, which we've given a long-term view that we should be in the upper teens adjusted operating margin profile.","So we're very excited about the trends to be frankly honest. The initiatives we've had in place are gaining traction. We like the plan going forward and we see the high teens adjusted operating margins in the future of this business.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Dave. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Annabel Samimy from Stifel. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Andrew Abriol Santos Ang - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, guys. This is Andrew for in Annabel. So my question is with the changes going on in the overall OTC consumer market such as with Proctor, Merck, Teva, how are you thinking about Perrigo's place or overall consumer strategy given your exposure in both private label in the U.S., branded OTC in Europe? And with that, how do you plan on growing from here? Thank you.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. I think that is a question that we have to answer from our position and from our position of strength. We are the market leader on store brands in the United States by far. And we continue to help our customers to generate significantly, significant margins with the products we provide. And that again includes a value chain that is rather complex and where we have to be excellent in all of the segment of the value chain all the way from product development up to the supply chain management and mass customization for those customers.","So it's, as we know, it's a pretty regional business related to North America. I think that nothing here has significantly changed. In that business, we are the dominant player. And I think our performance is a testament to how well we actually manage the value chain that we control.","From the standpoint of our international business, our international business other than some of those operate in Europe very much with local brands that are market leaders or one of the top three brands in their respective areas. And the way we manage our business is absolutely different from what you see from other companies. We actually try to focus on regional value proposition within European market and we leverage our access to more than 200,000 pharmacies with our sales network and we use brand extensions, product extension and regional extensions of our brands into markets as a growth platform. And I think the numbers prove that we are on a very promising way to make this business fairly successful.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dewey Steadman from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Syed Kareem - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, guys. This is Syed Kareem in for Dewey this morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just had a couple quick ones for you. First on your Amazon e-commerce initiatives, I know in the past you've said it's a small portion of your business. But I'm curious to know or I'm curious if you could talk about any updates on your strategies there and if the size of that piece today has changed versus where it was 90 days ago. And also my second one, if you could provide a little bit more color on your generic launch flow in the second half of the year outside of ProAir, that would be really great. Thank you.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yes. Let me start with the consumer e-commerce question. Again, our strategy is to meet our consumers wherever they want to purchase products. And obviously e-commerce here is an increasing important channel. That is not actually limited to Amazon, but Amazon is obviously here the player that dominates that market and has a commitment to grow this category. So we continue to work with any of those players levering our unmatched breadth of in our portfolio, of our turnkey solutions and of our ability to mass customize. And that is actually a strategy where all of our e commerce customers benefit from. And yes, it is true that this business model for us is growing but it's still growing from a small scale.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, I'll take your second question regarding the product launch profile for RX. When we gave our original guidance back in March, we talked about key launches in Q4, clearly highlighting the contribution with ProAir, again $0.09 a share is in our guidance model in Q4. And we remain on track for our new products number. We have a $300 million portfolio for the year. Again, we talked about in this call, we clarified a little more detail for your models as for those of you kind of work through the P&L architecture that with those strong product launches in RX and with the scopolamine planned relaunch in Q4, you should be modeling around 35% of your net sales contribution from RX in Q4. So no new major updates and we're continuing on our pathway to achieve our overall new products plan for the year.","Syed Kareem - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks for the question. Operator, I think we have time for one more please.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of David Steinberg from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","David Michael Steinberg - Jefferies LLC","My question revolves around store brand market share. In the last 12 months, what's been your basis point gain in share versus national brands? And I know in the past years, you talked about 100% basis point gain on average depending on the economy. So what's your current, what's the current share of all units in terms of store brands? And then finally, what's your aspirational share that you think you can get to over time?","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. This is Ron. Thanks for the question. If you think of the store brand share, and we continue to talk about this quarter-by-quarter. In the appendix, you will see the MULO data, which we think is one of the best data points to kind of point at. Store brand continues to gain share. So unlike perhaps some of the other dialogues that previous teams talked about, it is 100 basis point improvement year-over-year, was the target going forward.","The way we look at this is we are just, our business model is designed to meet consumers at their point of purchase, number one. Number two, our goal is to increase store brand share for all our business partners. And so what we do is continue to work with entire channel networks ensuring that we provide our business model the unmatched breadth of our product portfolio, our turnkey fast moving good solutions, our supply chain with for mass customization of our broad portfolio and are continuing to work with them to expand store brand share. So we're not pointed at a share point, but what we're pointed at is making our partners successful to improve their profitability and provide quality affordable healthcare solutions to consumers. That's the way we think about this business.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks for the question, Dave, really appreciate it. And thanks everybody for your time today.

All participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Joseph, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Bradley Joseph","Thank you. Good morning and welcome, everyone, to Perrigo's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. I hope you all had a chance to review the press release we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the release is available on the perrigo.com website.","Joining today's call are President and CEO, Murray Kessler, and CFO, Ray Silcock.","I'd like to remind everyone that, during this call, participants will make forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for shareholders and investors and safe harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued earlier this morning. ","When discussing the business, Murray will reference only non-GAAP adjusted numbers for the quarter. Comparisons to prior year will also exclude exited businesses and currency changes. Ray's discussion of financial results during this call will address both GAAP and non-GAAP results and, where noted, comparisons to prior year will exclude exited businesses and currency changes.","Located on our website is the appendix for today's call which provides reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures discussed.","A couple of other housekeeping notes to mention before we get started. Excluding exited businesses excludes contributions from the exited animal health and infant foods businesses from both 2018 and 2019. Organic growth excludes Ranir, the exited animal health and infant food businesses and currency.","And as a reminder, worldwide consumer includes the Consumer Self-Care Americas and Consumer Self-Care International segments as well as corporate unallocated.","One final note, given Ranir's global reach, the company has finalized operational reporting lines where the US operations of Ranir are included in the Consumer Self-Care Americas market segment and its non-US operations are included in the Consumer Self-Care International segment.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Murray.","Murray Kessler ","Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with the company's third quarter results. And it's worth noting that this is the first time I've said that about a quarter even though this is the fourth quarter in a row that our results have met or exceeded expectations.","What differentiates this quarter is that our top line is growing again as many of the initiatives we implemented as part of our strategic plan are beginning to take effect. And while a meaningful portion of this quarter's double-digit growth is due to the bolt-on acquisition of Ranir, the organic growth results were also solid.","Really, the company hit on almost all cylinders from a revenue perspective with one exception \u2013 infant nutrition, which was explained last quarter and which will be further detailed in a moment.","Cost control also benefited the company's results as we enjoyed overhead savings from project momentum. ","All in all, I like the direction we are headed. We are executing well and I believe we are on track to achieve our stated 3\/5\/7 long-term consumer growth objective.","Let me go into a bit more detail. Total Perrigo consolidated net sales grew just over 10% versus year ago. All segments contributed to this growth, including a 9% increase in Consumer Self-Care Americas, a 10% increase in Consumer Self-Care International and a 13% increase in generic Rx.","CSCA net sales growth of 9% was led by the incremental addition of US ruxolitinib sales of $54 million and an increase of 3% or $13 million of organic net sales growth on our OTC business.","From a consumption basis, OTC category growth remained strong, growing 2% in revenue during the third quarter versus year ago, according to IRI.","For the same period, store brand retail dollars grew 2.8%, outpacing national brand growth of 1.6%, which was a 30 basis point share gain for store brand. OTC share gains were driven by solid growth in our allergy and smoking cessation categories.","What most excites me here, beyond the growth, is the renewed purpose with which Perrigo teams are attacking and winning in our core categories.","Solid organic OTC growth was partially offset by an 11% decline versus year-ago in our infant nutrition business. The infant nutrition performance during the quarter was as expected and as explained in last quarter's conference call.","Remember, the second quarter infant nutrition results were hurt by a contract packing inventory issue and retail disruption from a product recall.","Importantly, the retail issue is behind us as the US store brand infant formula business returned to growth in the third quarter, increasing 4% versus year ago. And while the contract pack sales inventory issue continued in Q3, it was expected.","The good news is we're almost through that issue as well. And looking forward, we have a strong pipeline of new infant formula products, many of which are launching as we speak and we have gained distribution at a major new customer. Said another way, we see infant nutrition in total growing again versus year ago in the fourth quarter.","Turning to Consumer Self-Care International, net sales increased 10% versus year ago. While the CSCI results benefited from over $23 million in incremental sales from Ranir, we saw solid organic growth of over 3%. The 3% organic growth in CSCI was driven by $28 million in new product launches and good selling activities for the cough\/cold season in Europe.","I'd also note that France, which I highlighted last quarter, is well on its way to being corrected as we now have our sales force back up to full strength and we have a solid pipeline of new products ready to launch early next year.","Finally, our Rx segment continued to perform well and outperformed most generic Rx companies, growing 13% versus year ago in the quarter. It's worth noting we did have service issues related to interruption from several of our key suppliers not meeting their production goals and timeline.","So, in summary, I repeat, it was a solid quarter. Good quality. We still have a lot to do to be able to consistently report this type of growth, but we're heading in the right direction. ","Perrigo teams across the world are starting to win again and the teams are energized. And, of course, we all believe we are recapturing the Perrigo advantage and are certain that we will make lives better by bringing quality, affordable self-care products that consumers trust everywhere they're sold. ","I'll now turn the call over to Ray.","Raymond Silcock ","Thank you, Murray. And good morning, everyone. Now that Murray has gone through the sales highlights for the quarter, I'd like to walk you through the rest of the Q3 P&L, briefly focus on the balance sheet and provide some color and commentary on our outlook for the rest of 2019.","Consolidated reported net income for Q3 was $92 million and reported diluted EPS was $0.67 per share, which included an $18 million or $0.11 charge for our voluntary retail market recall of ranitidine, the cost of which was removed from our adjusted net income for the quarter.","Consolidated adjusted net income for the quarter was $142 million and adjusted EPS was a $1.04 per share, up $0.11 from Wall Street consensus, our third sequential quarterly earnings beat and our fourth sequential quarter of meeting or exceeding market expectations.","Adjusted net income includes $50 million of non-GAAP adjustments. We're adding back $81 million of amortization, $18 million related to the acquisition of Ranir, $18 million from the ranitidine recall, an $11 million impairment of Evamist, an Rx brand, and $17 million of restructuring, business separation and unusual litigation. And then, we're subtracting the $72 million gain from the sale of the animal health business together with $31 million in tax impacts from all of these adjustments.","Our reported consolidated effective tax rate for the quarter was 5.2%, much lower than in recent quarters, primarily as a result of the tax loss that arose from the sale of the animal health business despite the fact that we have a $72 million book gain.","Since we excluded that gain from our adjusted results, we have eliminated the associated tax impact as well. This increased Q3 effective tax rate from a GAAP rate of 5.2% to a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20.1%. Details of all these adjustments can be found in the non-GAAP reconciliation table attached to this morning's press release.","From this point forward, all my comments and numbers are on a non-GAAP basis. ","Moving now to segment reporting, I'm going to start by reviewing the results of our worldwide consumer business, which is comprised of the Consumer Self-Care Americas segment, the Consumer Self-Care International segment and corporate unallocated, followed by the results of the two segments individually. I'll discuss the RX segment afterwards.","Worldwide consumer adjusted gross profit as compared to last year was up $12 million to $392 million, which amounted to an increase of 9% on a constant currency basis when exited businesses are excluded from the 2018 comp.","In the Americas segment, adjusted gross profit versus last year increased by $10 million to $210 million. Strong performances within the US OTC business and the addition of Ranir were partially offset by lower infant formula contract business and higher direct labor costs.","Adjusted gross margin improved 40 basis points to 34% as favorable OTC product mix in the quarter was partially offset by the impact of the exited animal health business and higher cost of goods sold.","In the international segment, adjusted gross profit increased by $1 million to $181 million for the quarter. Measured in constant currency, adjusted gross profit increased by 6.3%, primarily due to new products and to the addition of Ranir's non-US business, partially offset by volume declines including in France.","Third quarter adjusted gross margin was 51.9%, 190 basis points lower than last year primarily due to the addition of Ranir which has a lower gross margin than our overall international portfolio. It should be noted, however, that this gross margin impact does not fall through to operating margin since Ranir has lower operating expenses as a percent of sales than the rest of international.","Moving on to adjusted operating income, worldwide consumer business adjusted operating income was up $2 million to $153 million as the benefit of adding Ranir was mainly offset by the cost of restoring employee bonuses as compared to last year's Q3. Further adjusting for the impacts of currency and exited businesses, it was up 4.3% in the quarter.","In the Americas segment, adjusted operating income was up $5 million to $123 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 19.8%, the same as in Q3 last year, up 4.8% when exited businesses are excluded. Increased gross margin and lower admin costs were partially offset by higher R&D spending to drive innovation.","In the international segment, adjusted operating income was flat to prior year at $64 million. Further adjusted for currency, it was 4.4% better than last year.","The adjusted operating margin was down 100 basis points to 18.2% due primarily to higher SG&A.","Turning out to the Rx segment, adjusted gross profit decreased by $3 million to $94 million and adjusted gross margin of 40.9% was down from 48.1% in Q3 last year due to adverse pricing, higher cost of goods primarily as a result of our third-party suppliers' inability to meet our demand and less favorable product mix.","Adjusted operating income was lower by $2 million to $55 million, principally due to the gross profit decline and higher SG&A, somewhat offset by lower R&D expenses.","In summary then, consolidated adjusted earnings per share in Q3 was $1.04, up $0.11 from Wall Street expectations, our fourth consecutive quarter of meeting or beating consensus.","Consolidated adjusted operating income was flat to Q3 last year as the benefits from the Ranir acquisition and savings from project momentum, our SG&A cost-reduction initiative were offset by the restoration of full employee bonus payout that we expect this year and temporary headwinds in our infant nutrition business.","With respect to the balance sheet, as of September 28, 2019, total cash on the balance sheet was $399 million and total outstanding debt was $3.4 billion. ","This quarter, we successfully refinanced our 2020 term loan, extending its maturity to 2022 and lowering the interest rate by 65 basis points.","Q3's cash flow from operations was $140 million, a cash flow conversion of almost 100%. We expect to maintain that cash conversion in the 100% range in the fourth quarter.","And now, turning to our third quarter Q. As you'll see when you read it, we received a draft notice of proposed adjustment, a draft NOPA from the IRS covering fiscal tax years ending June 28, 2014 and June 27, 2015. ","The draft NOPA relates to the deductibility of interest on debts owed by \u2013 owed to Perrigo Company plc by Perrigo Company, a US sub. The debts were incurred in connection with the merger with \u00c9lan in 2013.","The draft NOPA proposes a reduction in gross interest expense for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, details of which you may read in the Q. Were the IRS to prevail in this proposed adjustment, which we intend to contest strongly, we estimate an increase in tax expense of approximately $170 million excluding interest and penalties.","In addition, we would expect the IRS to seek similar adjustments for the periods from June 28, 2015 through December 31, 2019. We estimate that those further adjustments based on our preliminary calculations will not likely exceed an additional $200 million excluding potential interest and penalties.","We would not usually disclose a draft NOPA at this stage, but would wait for the final, which for this specific NOPA we expect later this month. However, since the IRS has recently made it clear to us that they plan to issue the NOPA without taking into account our submission to them in which we requested they make changes prior to issuing the final NOPA, we decided to include the disclosure of it in this quarter's Q. ","No payment of any amount related to the proposed adjustments is required to be made if at all until all applicable proceedings have been completed.","Turning now to our outlook for 2019. Some of the assumptions incorporated into our guidance include, within the Americas segment, our new oral self-care category will continue to drive topline growth; our infant nutrition business is expected to return to growth in the fourth quarter, mainly due to a large new customer; our OTC business remains strong and is already shipping cough\/cold product to retailers and we're assuming a normal season.","For international, we remain excited about the new product pipeline which we anticipate will continue to drive topline growth in Q4. ","For Rx, while we don't expect to see the trend change, we remind you that we are comparing to a very strong Q4 last year, which included a high margin exclusive product launch.","In summary, based on these assumptions, we are raising our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $3.85 to $4.05 a share.","And with that, I would like to turn the call back to Murray.","Murray Kessler","Thanks, Ray. So, to sum up my thoughts on the quarter and the outlook for the rest of the year. Our worldwide consumer businesses continue to gain momentum and I'm excited about the future. We've raised our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance, which reflects the strength of worldwide consumer businesses expected to continue in the fourth quarter and earlier-than-anticipated project momentum savings, offsetting mix and supply issues in Rx.","Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital Markets.","Murray Kessler","Hey, Randall.","Ashley Ryu","Hi, good morning. This is actually Ashley Ryu on for Randall. Murray, can you talk a little bit about the organic growth rate that you saw in CSCA in the quarter and what your expectation is for the balance of the year? New launches were again fairly light in the quarter. So, if you could just talk about your expectations there as well. I know, for Ranir, it will take some time to ramp up, but I'm talking kind of outside of that and when we should expect that pickup.","Murray Kessler","You don't need to expect to see a pickup. It's already strong. As I went through in the detail of my comments, your OTC business, which is the lion's share of our business, was up over 3% in the quarter. And I believe that was the same in the last quarter and I shared that consumer takeaway was strong with that. And likewise, that our retail infant formula business in the US, which is the biggest, most important part of that nutrition business, was up 4%. ","The only issue that makes it look like, organic growth isn't as strong as the infant formula contract business that I highlighted. From a new product standpoint, you should feel very encouraged that with a light quarter and new product sales in CSCA that we got those kind of growth rates which means that we're obviously building our business and doing a better job with consumer and partnering and getting distribution gains, et cetera.","For the fourth quarter, as I said, I expect the total infant nutrition business to be up and be a driver of the total growth for the quarter. So, we won't be looking at anymore declines on infant nutrition as they have a very strong new products quarter starting out, launches that are in place and that are imminently shipping. So, those are not like promises to happen. That's about to really happen. So, I feel very, very good about the organic growth across the whole company.","Ashley Ryu","Okay. Sorry, just to clarify, when should we expect to see new launches pick up, not the business. And then also, I know there's a lot of moving pieces, but just on a more housekeeping note, can you just touch on the recall which I know you've adjusted out of revenue and gross profit? Can you just kind of talk about that gross profit adjustment? Thanks.","Murray Kessler","Well, I believe \u2013 what was the number, Ray, for the total\u2026","Raymond Silcock","$18 million in covering the US and Europe.","Murray Kessler","Right. And that $18 million was a combination of bringing back inventory from wholesalers. It wasn't a consumer recall and any inventory that we had on hand and any raw ingredients or materials that were there. So, that's everything involved with the recall. We didn't adjust for any loss of sales. In fact, I'm not sure in the US we'll see any loss of sales because consumers will gravitate to other products. But this was not something unique to Perrigo. It was worldwide and industry-wide and there's been a lot of clarity provided actually in the last couple of days on that by the FDA.","Ashley Ryu","Great.","Murray Kessler","As far as new products go, I'm not going to speak to future new product launch. That's competitive. It's my job to get to the 3\/5\/7 numbers I have promised everywhere and I have many tools in my toolbox to do that.","New products is a key component of it. As a company, we actually had a good quarter new product wise. So, it was more driven by CSCI, but I'm really not going to dissect it down by division, by brand. That's what you're paying me for.","Ashley Ryu","Got it. Thanks.","Raymond Silcock","Thanks, Ashley. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ami Fadia with SVB Leerink.","Raymond Silcock","Good morning. Ami?","Operator","Ami, your line is open.","Ami Fadia ","Hi, good morning. Can you hear me okay?","Raymond Silcock","Yes.","Ami Fadia ","Okay. Sorry about that. Can you talk to \u2013 just on Zantac, are there expectations for additional recalls into second quarter? And can you talk about any additional impact that you might have baked in in your sort of guidance update into fourth quarter for this year? And then, I have another question.","Murray Kessler","We don't expect it to \u2013 the FDA already tested all the other products in the GI category, and said they were clear. And this wasn't \u2013 we built a reserve for it. So, it's an estimate. The only way it would vary, Ray, if it was \u2013 so it came in a little more or little less, but\u2026","Raymond Silcock","There'll be some sort of true-up, but we estimated we think pretty accurately ","Murray Kessler","What the total impact.","Raymond Silcock","Yeah, the total impact.","Ami Fadia ","Got it. Now, with regards to the infant formula, you talked about some of the moving parts this quarter, but as we think about the contractual win earlier this year, and once we sort of stabilize, how should we think about the run rate for this business as we maybe exit 2019 and think about 2020?","Murray Kessler","Infant nutrition has been a winner for Perrigo for years. It had a pickup this summer. A couple of things all went wrong on it at the same time. But I expect it to return back to good solid growth this year and next year. It has \u2013 while I don't want to be real specific, I guess I can on these because they're already launched to customers. We have two major new product launches that have already hit the marketplace, one of which begins shipping imminently, like within days, that have been worked on for 10 years. They are major new products for that segment. So, I'm not going to give you specifics on what growth rate I expect for infant formula next year. We'll do that along with all of our sort of estimates of how we see the next year shaping up when I get to the major conferences in January. I'll give you a score card review of how I think we do across the board on all of our businesses and all of our initiatives and where I see the direction going and guidance for the coming year like normal. But I'm bullish on infant formula. It was a hiccup. I think it's corrected.","Ami Fadia ","Thank you.","Raymond Silcock","Thanks Ami.","Operator","Our next comes from Gregg Gilbert with SunTrust.","Gregg Gilbert","Thanks. Good morning.","Murray Kessler","Good morning.","Gregg Gilbert","Good morning. What can you say about the timeline and process to separate the Rx business? And then I have another question.","Murray Kessler","No update from last quarter. As I told you, we continue to prepare for it and we continue to evaluate it, but we'll do it when we can maximize value for shareholders. I'm not going to be dumb about it. And it's still a pretty volatile market with what's been going on externally and in the environment in that whole industry.","So, right now, I'm thrilled with the way they've stabilized the business, the leadership's super and still we're focused on our consumer mission and we're trying to be very transparent with the consumer numbers and giving you worldwide consumer numbers that allocate all the overhead, all those things to that, so you can sort of model underneath it, but the answer is we continue to prepare and I'll do it when it's the right time.","Gregg Gilbert","Okay. And on the tax front, Ray, can you talk about that the new issue you just raised? You framed the maximum potential, I guess, financial outlay should you not prevail. But can you talk about the implications for the tax rate longer term? And on the Irish front, gentlemen, have you have interacted with the authorities over there at all to better understand their side of the story? Or are we just waiting for the actual process just to move forward with no interaction before then?","Raymond Silcock","Yeah. I don't think there's any \u2013 based on what we see right now, there's no implication for the longer term tax right from the new NOPA principally because we plan to change the structure because of tax changes in Ireland and the US that have taken place in the last 12 months which render that particular structure inefficient, which is 267A if you're familiar with the tax code in the US.","So, from the most recent NOPA which we do intend to contest very strongly as a technical difference that has been raised by the IRS. We think we have strong grounds on which to win that and we feel that the IRS is in a less strong position than we are. So, I don't see this having an impact on our tax rate going forward.","Murray Kessler","As far as the Irish case goes, the update I told you was before, there is briefs that are submitted by both sides going back and forth. But April 29, it holds, is when the judicial review goes. And just to reinforce for everybody on the call, the judicial review is about whether Ireland violated our legitimate expectations based on history to \u2013 a company we were buying in \u00c9lan was doing things properly, which we believe they did and every adviser that I've had look at this tells me that they did. We're not having debate yet on the merits of the tax assessment at all. That's what happen afterwards.","As it relates to the briefs and all that, I don't think there's any surprises that we've seen so far. So, we're steady as you go as we head towards April.","Gregg Gilbert","Sorry, one last one, Murray. You sounded pleased with the organic growth of the business and how things are going operationally. So, on the M&A front, what's your appetite and flexibility to do another Ranir-like deal in the near to intermediate term or should we think smaller? Thanks.","Murray Kessler","Well, I think Ranir is probably, based on sort of the cash flow of the company and the debt leverage we're trying to get to, would be sort of the high side of where we're going. But I do have an appetite for continued bolt-on M&A. There were two slides I presented on May 9. As I've gone to investor meetings around the country, everybody seems to get. What it looked like when we're winning, what it looked like when we stop winning. And when it looks like when we were winning, there was a certain level of bolt-on M&A that was \u2013 I don't have the number right in front of me and there was a certain level of innovation that offset downward pricing pressure. And we are now, in the current quarter, exceeding that. That's why the total growth is you're seeing double-digit growth on an apples-to-apples basis and I expect that to continue as we roll in Ranir. But on the longer term, I'm still holding true to the growth rates that I've said of the 3\/5\/7. to supplement above and beyond that, I'm going to go after bolt-on opportunities that give us repeatable growth platforms.","Gregg Gilbert","Thank you.","Raymond Silcock","Thanks Gregg.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","Zhu Shen Ng","Hi there. It's Zhu Shen Ng here for David Risinger. I have a couple of questions. First, could you please comment on the updated guidance, specifically implications for 4Q consensus modeling? And the second is, what is the outlook for Rx pipeline launches? Thank you","Murray Kessler","The consensus is the new midpoint is\u2026","Bradley Joseph","The new midpoint of our adjusted EPS range is basically in line with where consensus is.","Murray Kessler","Okay. So, there you go. You heard it from Brad. The new midpoint that we've raised and that goes in line with consensus as we speak. And you saw where the \u2013 Ray detailed where that was coming from.","As it relates to Rx new products, other than to tell you that I think we have a robust new product pipeline excluding ProAir for next year, I'm not going to tell you when and what products we have coming. It obviously would be sort of competitive disadvantage to share that. But we have a robust product pipeline coming.","Raymond Silcock","Thank you, Shen. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Trucchio with Berenberg Capital Markets.","Q \u2013 IrisZhilin Long","Hi, good morning. This is Iris Long on for Patrick. Just a question regarding the consolidation of R&D and the impact on new product development. So, we know that the focus is on driving new products and we do see the strong growth in international as well as the progress in the Americas business. Can you briefly discuss how the consolidation of R&D is aiding in the development of new products? And to the extent that you can tell us, which new product or which category should we look for contributions of new products over the next year? Thanks.","Murray Kessler","Well, the first half of the question, I really like because I do believe that the consolidation of R&D is really helping to ramp up our program faster than I thought. When I go to do investor \u2013 like when I started in early following May 9, everyone \u2013 or before May 9, everybody sort of questioned whether we \u2013 what was self-care and could you do bolt-ons. And then, after May 9, when they saw Ranir and then [indiscernible] a few months later. As I've done further investor calls, everybody said, okay, I believe you now on bolt-ons, but how will innovation ramp up. And innovation is ramping up significantly. And a large part of that is that team is working together and sharing ideas and work that's been accomplished and completed across the world, not only from Europe CSCI back to CSCA, but also from region to region in Europe. As an example, taking winning skin care products in the Nordic regions and launching them under existing brand names and in other parts of Western Europe as another example.","So you're really seeing like hundreds of ideas. I quoted the number of a half a billion plus in new products, that number is growing. And when I go out in my January call going forward, I'm going to spend a lot of time on innovation to share how we see that growing because I think that's the next question. I know you can do bolt-ons, can you innovate?0 And it's already starting to happen. So, which is great news, A lot of it faster than I thought. Some of it still will take a couple years. Am I going to give you specific categories? No. It's almost going to be a mindset across the business. You should expect innovation across all of our businesses in the coming year.","What was the second part of your question?","Raymond Silcock","Any kind of specific categories where the contribution from new products might come from?","Murray Kessler","Yeah, I'm not going to go specific other than the one I already told you. I will expect infant formula which has two major launches that they've been working on, which is the result of 10 years' worth of work, to have a significant contribution \u2013 outsized contribution from new products in the coming year.","And the other thing that I would like to do, which most good consumer products companies do, is start communicating once I have a little bit more data about what I'll describe and is commonly known in the consumer world as a freshness index, which will not just talk about what kind of new products we launched in the year, but will talk about the percentage of our volume coming from either new products or some form of significant innovation or product improvement within the last three years, which as a company, great companies tend to operate in the 15% to 20% rate. That will take us little time to get there, but that's a really good measure of stickiness of new products and whether the company is innovating at the right amount or too much and there is a lot of statistical work by some really good consultants doing industry benchmark and to say that's the right number to target. I'll share that more in January when I get there as well, but we're gathering all that data as we speak. And again, I like where the company is going organically. I like where we're going on bolt-on. I like the energy I see in the team.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Murray Kessler for any closing remarks.","Murray Kessler","Well, I think I just kind of gave you my closing remark on my last little speech there, but I think \u2013 listen, I've been here for a year now. We've delivered. We're getting more consistent which was the goal for \u2013 that most of us were pushing on. But this is the first quarter I could stand up here and be proud that the growth numbers were starting to come as we were working towards. So, this was our best quality quarter since I have been here so far.","And I know we have those other issues and overhang issues and we will work through those and we'll manage those to the best interest of shareholders. And I appreciate your interest in Perrigo.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"16636":["Perrigo Co.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask question. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Joseph, VP, Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Perrigo's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Hope you all had a chance to review the press releases we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the release is available on our website, as is the slide presentation for this call. Joining today's call are Perrigo President and CEO, Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff; and Perrigo's CFO, Ron Winowiecki.","I'd like to remind everyone that during this call, participants will make forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for investors and shareholders and Safe Harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued earlier this morning. In addition, in the appendix for today's presentation, we've provided reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures presented.","Turning to the agenda on slide 3. First, Uwe will discuss this morning's announcement of a planned separation of the Prescription Pharmaceuticals or RX business, and provide additional details on milestones related to our value-creation roadmap, including commentary on this morning's licensing agreement for the exclusive U. S. rights to pursue regulatory approval for the non-prescription version of Nasonex.","Uwe will then go on to share performance highlights for the first half of the year. Next, Ron will discuss second quarter performance results by segment, the strength of our balance sheet, and our updated 2018 guidance. Finally, we will then open up the call for questions.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Uwe.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you, Brad. I will start my comments today on the announcement to separate the RX Pharmaceutical business. As I've commented many times during my first seven months at Perrigo, each of our segments are well-established and are starting from a position of strength in their respective markets. The Perrigo's consumer and RX platforms are both well-positioned within their respective spaces. They are navigating divergent industry dynamics with unique, strategic, financial, and operational opportunities and requirements.","As part of our value-creation roadmap, which I will discuss in more detail in a minute, we performed intense bottoms-up market analysis of each of our respective segments, including outside and customer surveys, competitor analysis and market diagnostics.","At the risk of oversimplifying, the RX business model operates in an innovative product-driven marketplace that requires intense agility and focused portfolio management, servicing a limited number of distributor. This business model is distinctly different from our durable consumer businesses, which creates customized solutions, combining the capabilities of fast-moving consumer goods and self-care solution by leveraging a complex supply chain designed to meet customers at their point of purchase.","During the final phase of our value-creation roadmap, which include an extensive portfolio review, we have concluded that a separation of the RX business creates value for Perrigo shareholders and better enables the RX business to capitalize on its platform of differentiated generic pharmaceutical products.","Importantly, today's announcement enables management to focus on expanding our leading consumer businesses, while unlocking potential value for shareholder. By committing all our energy and capital to meet the healthcare needs of consumers and customers, Perrigo is better positioned to execute on our growth initiatives.","In summary, the value-creation potential of our respective consumer and RX businesses is greater as two separate companies. The Perrigo leadership team is committed to driving the most effective operating and financial structure for each respective business. We have engaged external advisors to assist in the separation process and management is working closely with these advisors and the board.","The board will consider all value-enhancing options including a sale, merger, or tax-efficient separation to shareholder. The separation is expected to be completed in the second half of 2019. Throughout this process, our top priority remains driving individual growth strategies for both the RX and consumer businesses and delivering on our commitments for innovative high-quality solutions to our customers.","Going forward, we will not disclose any further developments about the separation process until the board has approved a specific action that the company deems appropriate.","Turning to slide 6. I will briefly discuss the framework used for our value-creation roadmap. As previously discussed in March, we initiated the comprehensive review of our businesses to develop the roadmap designed to drive top-line growth, increase operating income and strengthen our position as a market leader.","The output of this exercise represents intense efforts by more than 60 members of the Perrigo team to review our competitive positioning, better understand our customers and develop our long-term strategic roadmap. I am encouraged by the exciting opportunities presented throughout this process and believe we can drive both organic and inorganic growth, enhance our capabilities and increase operational efficiencies with a focus on driving total shareholder return.","I look forward to providing a comprehensive update on the specific initiatives identified in our consumer businesses during a conference call and webcast scheduled for September 25, 2018.","Turning to slide 7. As an outcome of the value-creation roadmap, this morning we announced an exciting new pathway for growth within our OTC franchise. This growth pathway illustrates our commitment to: one, execute select RX to OTC switches; two, expand categories with new brand offerings; and three, provide opportunities for future store brand alternatives.","This announcement exemplifies one of the organic opportunities identified from the value-creation roadmap to drive long-term growth; in-licensing opportunities, expand our Consumer Healthcare Americas growth strategy and leverage our existing infrastructure; and efficient supply chain, enhancing our durable OTC portfolio and establishing a framework for selected future switch opportunities.","Given our competitive differentiation, we are the only OTC manufacturer who's vested in and committed to driving holistic economics for our retail partners by providing a brand and store brand version of a self-health solution.","Turning to slide 8. The Nasonex product acquisition is a first of its kind for Perrigo, and provides us the opportunity to expand and strengthen the allergy category. As other products in the intranasal allergy category have previously switched from prescription to OTC status, we are working diligently to bring this important product to consumers and customers more quickly than the average five-year OTC switch timeframe. This is a perfect example of the type of opportunity we are seeking to capitalize on as we execute our strategic roadmap.","Now, turning to our operational highlights on slide 9. For the first half of the calendar year 2018, our adjusted EPS met our operating goals. In our CHCA Americas business, store brand continues to gain share, as evidenced by our market-leading OTC and infant nutrition franchises, which grew approximately 2.5% combined versus prior year.","The adjusted operating margin for this business continues to be durable, achieving 20.9% in the first half of the year, a 30-basis-point improvement compared to prior year. The performance of this business remains strong, despite challenges we are experiencing in our animal health business, which Ron will discuss shortly.","Turning to our Consumer Healthcare International segment. For the first half of 2018, on an organic constant currency basis, net sales were relatively flat versus prior year, excluding exited businesses. Benefits from our focused brand strategy and insourcing initiatives drove improvements in the adjusted gross and operating margin.","Adjusted gross margin improved 260 basis points and the adjusted operating margin increased 190 basis points to greater than 16%, as we continue to fund increased investments for growth with gross profit expansion.","In the first half of the year, we experienced weakness in the RX business due to a shortfall in new product launches, coupled with challenging market dynamics, which resulted in price erosion higher than our expectation.","Despite these challenges, the business realized an adjusted operating margin of approximately 40% in the first half of the year, while making higher investments in R&D, demonstrating our commitment to drive our pipeline. The underperformance in the segment has been disappointing and is the primary reason for changes to guidance.","Finally, our durable platform once again delivered consistent cash flow. Adjusted cash flow conversion to adjusted net income was nearly 90% for the first half of 2018. Utilizing our strong free cash flow generation and balance sheet flexibility, we repurchased approximately $265 million worth of our shares during the first half of the year.","To-date we announced two important decisions that illustrate our commitment to shareholder value creation. First was a separation of the RX business that will enable us to enhance the value-creation potential of our respective consumer and RX businesses. Second, we announced an innovative pathway in our OTC franchise to expand our growth strategy with the Nasonex RX-to-OTC switch.","We look forward to sharing strategies identified from our value-creation roadmap on September 25, 2018. Now I will turn the call over to Ron.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Uwe. Let me start by saying our durable consumer businesses continue to deliver consistent performance results as both of our consumer segments grew over the last 12 months on an organic constant currency basis, as store brand continued to gain market share and our CHC International team continued to execute on our focused brand strategy. Each of these businesses are well-positioned heading into the second half of the year.","Next, I will discuss our performance results for the second quarter, followed by our updated guidance for 2018.","Turning to slide 11, you can see our reported results for the second quarter. Net sales were $1.2 billion and reported net income was $36 million. The primary adjustments to GAAP results are driven by the exclusion of $87 million of non-cash amortization expense and $53 million in acquisition-related charges and contingent consideration adjustments.","GAAP tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax income was 34.5% in the quarter, compared to a non-GAAP tax rate of 18.1%. The difference is primarily due to the tax effect of the pre-tax adjustments.","Turning to CHC Americas results on slide 12. Net sales in the quarter were $597 million, compared to $605 million in the prior year, or a decline of 1% on a constant currency basis. The lower net sales were driven by a decline in the animal health business. Sales in this business were approximately 23% lower than the prior year, due primarily to channel dynamics and a late start to the flea and tick season.","Our market-leading OTC and infant nutrition franchises grew approximately 1% combined compared to the prior year as we continued to drive growth. Sales in the infant nutrition were strong as we continued to expand our product offerings to customers. OTC net sales performance was driven by strong net sales in the cough\/cold\/allergy category, partially offset by price erosion consistent with historical levels, coupled with the lower net sales in the smoking cessation category. New product sales for the quarter were $15 million.","Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 34.5%, 120 basis points below the prior year, due primarily to lower sales of higher margin product in the animal health business, in addition to higher input costs. The team continued to drive profit improvement initiatives to offset these higher costs. However, timing and amount of the improvement may vary from the actual cost increase.","The adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 20.4%, 60 basis points lower than the prior year, as the team proactively reduced selling and administrative expenses compared to the prior year, partially offsetting the lower gross margin in the quarter. For the first half of 2018, adjusted operating margin was 20.9%, a 30-basis-point improvement over the prior year, illustrating the durability of this business.","Turning now to CHC International on slide 13. Net sales in the quarter were $381 million, compared to $377 million in the prior year. Net sales declined by approximately 2% compared to the prior year on an organic constant currency basis. Net sales were lower in the anti-parasite, lifestyle and analgesic categories, in addition to discontinued products of $8 million. Sales were slightly lower in the quarter due to orders that will now ship in the second half of the year.","Partially offsetting these effects were new product sales of $19 million.","Adjusted gross margin was 53.3%, an increase of 160 basis points over the prior year, driven by the improved product mix, new product launches and the continued benefit of insourcing initiatives.","Adjusted operating margin was 15.2%, an increase of 60 basis points over the prior year, as the team continues to fund increased investments in growth. For the first half of 2018, adjusted operating margin was 16.1%, an increase of nearly 190 basis points over the prior year, as the team continued to deliver on our profit improvement initiatives.","In the first half of this year, our commercial teams continued to improve product mix, including the launch of new products with higher margins, and prioritized growth investments, providing the baseline for future growth in this business.","Turning to RX on slide 14. Reported net sales in the quarter were $209 million, compared to $240 million last year. New product sales of $8 million were more than offset by lower net sales of existing products of $35 million, due primarily to price erosion.","Compared to the same quarter last year, price erosion was approximately 11%, which was greater than expected, primarily driven by partnership products. Due to the pass-through of price changes to the affected partners, the impact on gross margin was at a lesser effect than net sales.","Adjusted gross margin was 55.1% in the second quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year, adjusted gross margin was lower by 370 basis points due to a strong product mix in 2017 and the effects of year-over-year pricing. Sequentially, adjusted gross margin was relatively consistent in the first and second quarters of 2018.","Adjusted operating margin was 39.4% compared to 46.5% in the prior year, due primarily to gross margin flow-through and higher R&D investments as a percentage of net sales. For the first half of 2018, adjusted operating margin was approximately 40%, while investing approximately 13% more in R&D compared to the prior year.","Turning now to slide 15. Our balance sheet and cash flow generation remained strong, underscoring the strength of our businesses. As of June 30, 2018, total cash on the balance sheet was $527 million and total outstanding debt was approximately $3.3 billion.","During the first six months of 2018, we generated $255 million in cash from operations. Excluding $50 million related to the Merck Nasonex licensing investment, which is included in GAAP cash flow from operations, year-to-date adjusted cash from operations would total $305 million.","This results in a cash flow conversion as a percentage of adjusted net income of nearly 90% for the first half of the year. We believe our strong cash flow, combined with the strength of our balance sheet, differentiates us in the marketplace.","Our capital allocation decisions are focused on total shareholder returns within the context of our long-standing commitment to investment-grade financial policy. As part of our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy, we completed approximately $157 million of share repurchases and paid $26 million in dividends in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we completed approximately $265 million of share repurchases and paid $53 million in dividends.","Now let's discuss our updated guidance beginning with each segment on slide 16. In CHC Americas, our durable platform continues to gain share in a soft consumer market. We continue to expect net sales of approximately $2.44 billion.","As a quick reminder, excluding the impact of the animal health business, the net sales guidance includes approximately 2% growth versus last year, driven by our market-leading OTC and infant nutrition businesses. As discussed during earnings call in May, this guidance includes the loss of partnered product in the animal health business, which impacts the second half of 2018.","Adjusted operating margin in the CHC Americas business has been operating at or near record levels, driven by continuous improvement initiatives and supply chain efficiencies. Due to the lower performance in the high-margin animal health business, coupled with higher input costs, we now anticipate the adjusted operating margin to be approximately 21%.","In CHC International, due primarily to unfavorable foreign currency movements, we are adjusting calendar 2018 net sales guidance to approximately $1.52 billion. Second half growth in this business is expected to be approximately 2% to 3% on an organic constant currency basis, as the team continues to drive our focused brand strategy.","The actions we have taken to expand the adjusted gross margin profile in this segment enable us to fund investments to drive organic growth, while still improving adjusted operating margin to approximately 15.5%. In RX, we're updating our 2018 net sales guidance for the year to $880 million, with adjusted operating margin guidance remaining unchanged at approximately 40%.","Turning to slide 17, let me provide more specific details into the changes in the RX segment guidance. Number one, generic ProAir. As a reminder, on May 11, 2018, we issued a press release stating we expected to receive a complete response letter from the FDA for a generic version of ProAir, and no longer expect to achieve our goal of a fourth quarter 2018 launch and the approximate $0.09 adjusted earnings per share benefit. Subsequently, we have received the complete response letter and remain committed to bring this important product to market.","Number two, other new product delays, including authorized generics. The RX team has had a keen focus on maximizing its business development program through in-licensing and creating partnerships on specific products. The team was opportunistic and signed partnership agreements for a number of authorized generic products, which were expected to launch in 2018. However, those launches have now been delayed.","Number three, scopolamine. As discussed last quarter, the RX business experienced a supply disruption in scopolamine, a key product launched in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a reminder, this is a partnered complex patch product. The team has identified its stability, deviation, and continues to work with our partner to remediate the issue. That said, we no longer anticipate a re-launch of this product in 2018.","And finally, challenging market dynamics, including greater pricing headwinds than anticipated. Consistent with our practice of updating guidance grounded in the current fundamentals of the business, our updated guidance for the second half of 2018 includes a price erosion assumption, consistent with our experience in the second quarter.","Now let me discuss how these updated guidance assumptions impact our expected phasing during the second half of the year, particularly in the RX segment. We expect approximately 35% of 2018 RX adjusted operating income to be realized in the fourth quarter due to timing of new product launches.","Slide 18 depicts the adjustments to our 2018 consolidated guidance. We now expect consolidated net sales of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion due to the changes on the RX net sales guidance, as well as $65 million of unfavorable foreign currency movements. In addition, we now expect new products to be greater than $200 million, lower than previous expectations due to the RX dynamics I have just outlined.","Adjusted operating income guidance is now expected to be in the range of $960 million to $990 million. After taking into account minor adjustments in interest, other and adjusted effective tax rate, our adjusted EPS guidance range for 2018 is now at $4.75 to $4.95 per share.","Consistent with the change in our adjusted operating income guidance, our 2018 guidance for adjusted cash flow from operations is now approximately $675 million, which is approximately 100% conversion at the midpoint of our earnings guidance range.","In summary, we continue to drive growth in durable operating margins in our consumer businesses despite a soft consumer marketplace. In addition, the team is moving forward with executing our plan to create two separate companies with independent strategic, operating, and financial platforms to enhance the value-creation potential of each respective business. And finally, we look forward to discussing our value-creation roadmap in September.","I will now turn the call over to Brad.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Ron. Carrie, can we please now open the call for questions? Given, how many people are on the line looking to ask a question, it'd be great if we can keep to one question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question will come from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Z. Neyor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Morning. This is Chris Neyor on for Chris Schott. On the RX and consumer franchise separation, are there any meaningful ties or potential dis-synergies that we should be thinking about as you move to split these two business units? Thanks.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. Thank you for the question. We, obviously, during our value-creation roadmap exercise have done that analysis and we believe there are no meaningful impacts from the separation. However, we have a detailed process on minimizing the separation impact for each individual business, and we believe that the advantages of the separation far outweigh those marginal separation issues.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. Chris, I would add too. I mean, Uwe is 100% correct. We've carefully studied it. And if you think of the businesses themselves, within each respective segment, they're already integrated on the sales, marketing, distribution, regulatory, R&D functionality. It's really been kind of a natural evolution. We've been migrating those functions into our businesses to continue driving agility. And as we look at the businesses, the integrated back-office work and those types of things, really we're now at a dispositive consideration.","And the choice really was about the separation strategically to create independent operating platforms. So, if you think of the core functions in the value-creation process, the value chain in the business, they're already kind of \u2013 these are architectures already existing in those respective businesses.","Chris Z. Neyor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for the question.","Operator","And the next question will come from Patrick Trucchio of Berenberg Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Patrick R. Trucchio - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. My question is in regards to the recent draft guidance provided by FDA regarding the RX-to-OTC switches. There have been two categories that Perrigo recently removed from its list of potential switches, including statins and BPH.","So, first, based on what you've seen and heard in this guidance and from the agency and from CHPA, do you think the FDA's flexibility on product labeling and its consideration of technology-enabled approvals for OTC products will make it more likely the innovators will attempt switching studies in these categories?","And secondly, do you think innovators will wait for final guidance? And if so, when should we anticipate the final guidance? And finally, are there any other additional categories we should be thinking about as being more likely to switch, given a more accommodating FDA and executive push to expand OTC in the U.S.? Thanks very much.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Hi, Patrick. This is Ron. Thanks for the question. I'll start and Uwe certainly can provide additional commentary. So, listen, the FDA movements are favorable for our business model, I almost call it validating our business model, right?","Gottlieb in 2017 clearly stated that getting more products to over-the-counter is one of the core initiatives under his agenda to save consumers' value in the healthcare space in the U.S. So the trend is very positive.","And you've seen, whether it's legislative or regulatory movement, you have the monograph Modernization Act. You have the recent indications about reinstituting where consumers can use their flex dollars, health spending dollars, for buying OTC products not quantified yet but in draft form. You're seeing things around smoking cessation products, which really fits in the sweet spot of our portfolio.","So I'm answering broader than just your one question because I think it's important to understand the indicative trend in the policy framework of the FDA is clearly favorable to our business model, and I almost call it validating our business model as a quality affordable self-care provider.","Now, having said that, you asked about specifics, you asked about specific categories and class of trade. And the saying I use, and I think it's one I want to make sure we use in the sense, let's not get ahead of our skis. We like the trends. We certainly have seen what they're talking about relative to certain class of trades. We've talked quite openly in the past that we think it's interesting to discuss a third class of trade where there's a pharmacy intervention.","Some of the class of trades you talked about are that way in the UK, where it's a very natural market structure to have an over-the-counter application with a pharmacy intervention framework. And that would fit, again, right into our business model.","So, again, I don't want to say what class of trade specifically and I don't want to speak on behalf of the innovators. That's not what our role should be. But I will say, think of our business model, our business model is designed to meet consumers at their point of purchase and our business model is designed to point at all the RX-to-OTC switches. And Perrigo will be there when we see those class of trades move in that direction. I mean, that's the way I would ask you to think about the answer to that question.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yes. And to add on to that, the Nasonex in-licensing activity demonstrates clearly our commitment to take a more active role in this type of environment, however, only in selected criteria where we have a clear right to win and where we have identified that we can leverage our capabilities and expand categories where we are already present with significant store brand products.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Pat. Next question, please.","Operator","The next question will come from Louise Chen of Cantor. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a question on the generic business. So, given your announcement today, how did you think about the valuation for your generics business in light of the environment today in generics? What is the timing behind doing something strategic and how much leverage could you put on this business if you separate it out?","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Well, from a strategic perspective, I think this is a very, very attractive business because of its differentiated product portfolio in extended topical, its sustainable margin profile and excellent cash flow generation. So, if you take a look at this business and compare it into other business, I think it is of prime quality in the market.","And we have identified here a pathway with multiple options, which includes a sale, includes a merger to create a more valuable company that addresses the market needs, or the separation as a stand-alone company to better capitalize on the market dynamics that we see here in a company that is lean, that has significant agility to answer to the market needs.","And I think, with that, we have a unique leverage to get the best shareholder value-creation option executed that we can find here in the near future. And we are not on a time constraint here.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. You asked about timing, we talked openly in our press release, Louise, you'll see that. Because of regulatory considerations, there are things that we'll consider in all the three options Uwe talked about. And we're saying the separation will likely be over the course of 2018, likely in the later half of the year.","And to Uwe's point, to be clear, we're coming at this from a position of strength, great asset, great cash flow characteristics. We're going to set up the best operating platform. But the timing is going to take a duration of time to do it right and do it well.","Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","And what about the leverage on the business for RX, if you decide to separate it?","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. I mean, it's not proper for us to comment on capital structure of that business, Louise, that's just not \u2013 and again, remember, there's multiple forms of execution here. So we're talking about maybe one form versus two or three we can consider. So it's just not fair for us to comment on that.","Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks for the question, Louise.","Operator","The next question will come from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Just a couple if I may. Do you think that the negative growth in the CHC business this quarter is a one-time, or would it have been negative the last couple of quarters if you back out flu? And how should we think about CHC growth going forward, especially in the fourth quarter and the first quarter when you will face hard flu comps? Will they continue to be negative is the question?","And my second question on the generic business is that your 40% operating margin is still about 1,000 basis points higher than your peers. Yes, you do have a differentiated product portfolio. But just was wondering, given the environment that we're in, if that 40% operating margin is still durable and how long do you think that can last? Or is that a margin that you think can continue to grow?","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yes. Thanks, Jami. So listen, I'll take the first and then I'll let Uwe comment on the first as appropriate and\/or take the second one as well if that's fair. So we'll tag-team the response.","For the consumer businesses, think about these a little bit on an LTM basis. CHC International has been growing circa 2%, CHC Americas growing circa just short of 2%. Pet health is the dynamic. We've been very open about that. It's a business that has been challenged in its marketplace. So it's an asset we're looking very closely at.","If pet health were excluded, you'd find CHC Americas growth north of 2% on an LTM basis. So I think that's the way to answer that question is, we don't look quarter-by-quarter, we talked about that. Before we were a little soft in CHC International this quarter, partially by design.","Again, we're improving our product mix. So part of that product mix improvement is you're launching new products, but then you're phasing out some additional IDs (35:00) or cannibalization. But you're taking some old products off the market, while you're launching better products to improve the margin and growth profile of that business. So those are some of the dynamics that were softer in CHC International as an example in this quarter.","On a go-forward basis, we expect both businesses to grow. Relative to the market, CHC Americas store brand continues to gain share. If you look at our operating guidance \u2013 and again, I hate to say pull out pet health, because we own pet health to be clear. But our market-leading OTC nutrition businesses are growing in a positive way the second half of the year, directly answer your question. And you heard in my commentary that CHC International is expected to grow 2% to 3% the second half of the year as well.","So we think they're in great positions. Again, if you look on an LTM basis, or when we're thinking on a go-forward basis, we feel good as the market grows within those respective businesses.","And I'll let Uwe comment on the second RX question if that's fair.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. Maybe to add to Ron's comment, the driver for this growth, the 2.5%, has not been the cough and cold. We have a very diversified product portfolio that is doing very well, with the exception of the disappointing performance on the animal health business, and we will deal with that.","On the RX side, yes, if you take a look at our performance, given the significant price concessions that we have seen and still maintaining a 40% operating margin, speaks definitely for our ability to manage this business.","Nevertheless, it is extremely important in this business to launch new products consistently. And in our case, for the first half of the year, this was more a question of when to launch rather than if we launch it. So actually, we expect those products to come to market later.","But I think the underlying message for the first half of the year, if you look at something positive, is that our ability to manage the margin is pretty strong in that environment. And I think that indicates how good the asset is.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So just can I follow-up on the CHCA business? Would you expect then, even with difficult comps, there was a huge flu season last year, that that business will continue to show growth even with difficult comparisons in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year?","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yes. If you recall the flu season was really more of a Q1 this year dynamic. It really was not a Q4 dynamic. We did have good growth last year and so good observation and we appreciate that. Remember, we were launching certain products last year that drove that growth.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","It was not a seasonal effect. So the callout is really the seasonal effect was in Q1 of this year.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yes. And don't forget that we tried to expand here the allergy category. That's a very attractive category for us. It has seen good growth. We had the ODT Omeprazole launch in the GI business. I think we have a fairly good analgesics performance. So this is more than a cough-and-cold company.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Jami. Next question, please.","Operator","The next question will come from Elliot Wilbur of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Question, I guess, probably best directed to Ron. As we sort of do the back of the envelope calculus here around the generics business, one question I had was in just sort of thinking about potential G&A allocation.","How much of the unallocated G&A expenses do you think could actually be offloaded to that business on more of a permanent basis, such that the consumer business isn't fully burdened with that, outside of some temporary transition services agreement?","And then just a follow up to that from kind of a high level, without that income stream in the Perrigo business, what could we be thinking about in terms of impact on the marginal tax rate? Thanks.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Elliot. It's dangerous when you get the calculator out, right? So understand the question for sure. So if you think about the overarching business structures, you have two businesses that have very strong margin profile. RX, 40%, as called out earlier, certainly strong against its peer group.","And then you take a look at our consumer businesses, you have CHC Americas running at 21%, 22%. You have great margin expansion in CHC International, call it circa run rate 16%, while we're investing for growth. So the momentum in the margin expansion continues to remain very strong. And in the consumer businesses, you also have great free cash flow characteristic, as you well know.","The other part that I just want to call out, because it goes a little bit to structure and a little bit on the enterprise framework, is that company is a very strong, diversified global enterprise. You're going to have 40% of your revenue base in that enterprise in non-U.S. jurisdictions.","So having said that, from a structural standpoint, we're very confident looking at the margin profile, that as we set up a separate strategic and operational and financial framework, both companies will be positioned in a very competitive way relative to their respective peer groups.","So we're carefully working through that process. But I don't want to get into is there $1 of overhead between company A and company B. You can rest assured we've carefully studied our structures with the needs of the respective businesses, the competitive, I'll call it, P&L profile of each of the respective businesses. And we're very confident we'll set up an operating and financial model in those businesses that'll be competitive to their relative peer groups.","Now, having said that, the tax rate \u2013 I don't want to comment specifically on taxes. I'll say this, I think you'll find that the tax rate of both companies \u2013 and I can't speak about RX as a stand-alone at this point because it's not spun yet, or it could be sold, or it could be merged. So there is no way to articulate the tax rate. But I think you'll find the remaining tax rate within our consumer enterprise will be competitive, is the best way to think about it. Certainly can't \u2013 what rate (40:53) to you at this point, Elliot, for sure.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Elliot. Appreciate the question.","Operator","The next question will come from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. So I was hoping that you could just discuss the outlook for CHCA margins longer-term? So, if we just sort of separate this issue of dis-synergies, are there real cost-efficiency opportunities ahead for this business or not?","And then, with respect to CHCI, I'd love to get a better sense for your visions for that business to compete as the number five player in Europe. Thank you.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Well, I'll take the first comment on the margin profile. We've talked about this before. And I'll let Uwe comment about the CHC International business because I know we're excited to talk in September, so he can kind of give a little color to what we'll discuss from a value-creation roadmap.","But from a margin profile, when we talk about CHC Americas, listen, the business is well-positioned as a market leader. The business has been running at adjusted operating margins at record levels. And we talked about longer-term modeling guidance. What we kind of say to everybody is, listen, model the top-line growth, and again we'll talk more about that as we get to September, but model top-line growth consistent with, I'll call it, your expectations. Already now we're growing above market index is the best way to think about it. Store brand continues to gain share.","When you about operating margin profile, we say, in the Americas business, run your models pretty consistent. In other words, we've expended margins substantially in that business over the last five years. But since we're running at record levels, we're not saying don't expand that every year by 50 to 100 bps. Running at a pretty consistent, so the value creation will be more at the operating dollar level on the revenue line growth versus the margin expansion from a modeling perspective.","Now, I do want to comment, because I think it's important to call out, we are continuing to see great margin expansion at CHC International. As you know, we commented earlier our adjusted operating margins were up 190 bps, almost 200 bps year-over-year in the first half of the year. This year we have great momentum in the business. Svend and his team have done a fantastic job.","And we have talked about margins in that business being in the high-teens over the next few years, call it, three to four years, and we have a very industrialized plan to get there. So we do see good expansion in the operating margin profile of the CHC International business, given the good work and platform that's been set by Svend and also Ron Janish in the supply chain team. Just want to make sure I call that out, we see some good expansion in that business.","I'll let Uwe talk a little bit about the competitive positioning at CHCI and ultimately some of the conversations we'll have later, so.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. And I encourage you to participate in our call on the 25 of September when we disclose more of our ideas and strategies to drive the consumer business. It's pretty much all about committing again all of our energy and capital to meet the healthcare needs of consumer in that business, and that includes a multitude of activity.","Of course, cost efficiency is one of the key elements of such strategy because we operate in an environment of providing quality affordable healthcare products. So, that is always at the center of our activities. This, of course, includes all dimensions. Of course, that includes overhead costs, the best set up of a lean company, and it includes operating costs. And you always can do something in those elements. And we will share that with you, what our ideas are and our strategies are here in September.","Specifically on the CHCI business, we have purchased a very diverse business with a certain complexity. And I think our management has done a wonderful job so far on reducing complexity, focusing and executing on our focused brand strategy by reducing the number of brands and promoting the right brand.","We have actually in parallel worked on insourcing activities and leveraging our production network, and we will continue to do that. The margin steps we have achieved are just milestones on our pathway to have much higher margin targets that we aim to achieve in this business. But this will be achieved again in a step-by-step approach by doing exactly as much as we think we can do and what is healthy for the business. And we will share that strategy with you on September 25 as well.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Dave.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Gregg Gilbert of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Uwe, at our conference in May, I thought you suggested that branded OTC in the U.S. was not something you were very interested in. So, should I take the Merck arrangement on Nasonex as a sign that you are in fact interested in branded OTC in the U.S., or is this more of a one-off situation?","And the second part of my call may be for you and for Ron. On the separation and the rationale to separate, it's not clear to me that removing RX from Perrigo would necessarily help Perrigo's remaining valuation. It's not clear to me that there would be overwhelming interest from buyers in what would be a pretty big generic acquisition in a challenging generic environment where you're delaying launches and not delivering on the current products, at least per recent forecast.","So, perhaps you have some non-public info and expressions of interest. But maybe you can help us with the rationale of separating those at least at a 30,000-foot view, knowing that we have a lot of wood to chop in the coming quarters in terms of actually executing on the separation. Thanks, guys.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. I'll start with the first question. And as part of our value-creation roadmap, we basically analyzed all of our businesses and, again, we had 60 people here internally involved, just internal people that were involved on developing growth strategies.","The growth strategy development was grounded in the strong analysis of our capabilities. And where we have the right to win and what competition here in the RX-to-OTC switch category, we have identified that there are selective areas where we have the right to win. And Nasonex is a perfect example for that. We have a strong presence in the allergy sector. We actually have a significant store brand presence with similar products.","We have the regulatory knowhow, we have the production knowhow, we have the technical knowhow to do such, which we have acquired the license from somebody who does not have an OTC presence. And we really believe that in those selective cases, we can actually drive category growth by switching those type of products in a fairly short switching time and adding value with the store brand later on to our retail partners.","We believe that this is an attractive opportunity to help innovate the category together with our retail partners and our channels, and significantly improve our market position with such interval (48:56). I would say it's still a selective strategy. I would not say it is a global branded strategy for the U.S. and it is mainly rooted in our right to win in certain categories with certain knowhow.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. I can start on your second question, Gregg, understanding the \u2013 if I'm framing it correctly, it's kind of what is the ultimate valuation you said remaining. I guess, I would say, what is the valuation of the two independent companies relative to today's valuation is probably the better way to explain or for me to think about it at least.","And you go back to the strategy, Uwe was very open in his comments, we have two business models well-positioned and we've described those on this call, so I don't need to repeat those comments. However, they're very unique businesses. You look at the unique business of RX, it's in a product-driven marketplace. It requires intense agility and a portfolio management kind of architecture. It distributes to a few customers. And so, kind of a distribution model, right? We're really not selling through to the consumers or innovating to the consumer level. It's really at a distribution level.","So, if you think of that business model and how that is a dichotomy of Consumer Healthcare, Consumer Healthcare is really integrating solutions, a fast-moving consumer goods relative to self-care marketplace and integrating a complex supply chain. So the value-creation exercise is really about two clear investment theses. A very clear investment theses relative to RX.","And you talked about will somebody want to buy an RX company. That's not the only value-creation opportunity here. There's great optionality for how we can pursue the RX separation strategy. As you know, we've talked before, Gregg, about we were constrained for some time to do a spin due to the constraints we had to the original launch transaction.","Those constraints are now behind us in December this year. So you start thinking about spin, merge, valuation creation on a sale process, we think there's a great optionality. And listen, we're in no rush. So we're preparing. We'll have the asset in a great position to separate relative to its legal operating structure and we'll make sure we execute at the right time of value creation is a way to think about that component. While at the same time then you have a great consumer company relative to its market position as well.","At the end of the day, what \u2013 and you said it and I'm glad you brought it up, our commitment is to continue investing in these businesses, continuing driving the growth platforms. And again, we believe RX has a great pipeline, we owned this year. This year we did not launch the products we expected, we own that.","But, however, I'll go to Uwe's comment, I thought it was a very good one. It's a matter of when, not if. We have a great pipeline. Those products that are coming to market are driving that portfolio very hard. So we look at the investment thesis of RX as a very good strong investment thesis on a stand-alone basis.","But we're going to continue focusing on our business plan and our great employee base is going to continue driving value for customers as we stand here today. And that's what's most important right now is to make sure we execute on our business plan. So, that's the way I want to make sure we think about it in the short-term from a business point of view.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Gregg.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Randall Stanicky of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks guys for the question. Uwe, Ron, why announce this RX separation today on a day where you're cutting guidance on the back of this business, as opposed to waiting till the September 25 strategic update events?","And then, secondly, I didn't hear an answer to the dis-synergy question, which I think is going to be really important as investors try to understand the underlying earnings value of both of these businesses over the next 12 to 18 months. And can you at least provide some buckets of where the overlap is? Where we should think about maybe needing some separate services?","And given the integration of these two businesses, maybe just comment on how integrated they are and how easily it will be to pull these businesses apart? Thanks.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. Thanks for your question. It became clear during our value-creation roadmap process at RX and consumer business, would each benefit from a dedicated focus of individual management teams which can anticipate market dynamics and invest behind the business appropriately.","So we always said it is our goal to get an alignment between management and the board to make the necessary decisions on the strategic roadmap. And then it is the policy that once the decisions are made that we communicate those. We made decisions here on a couple of value-creation roadmap examples.","One is the portfolio review with RX and the other one is actually the RX-to-OTC switch, which was Nasonex. And since we have executed that, we wanted to share that. There is certainly always an alternative, not to say something when you have made the decision, but that is not the policy of this management team and the board.","So from that perspective, it is not driven by, as somebody could say, disappointing performance based on the guidance with RX, that is just a driver. That actually has not driven this, because it is a result of a systematic evaluation process that has identified what do we need to do to better run the RX business going forward? And how to drive growth there? What's the best organizational setup for this business? And it included and addressed (54:36) how integrated is the business really with the consumer business from a fresh look standpoint?","And what we have identified is that the benefit of managing this business separately with a focused team that can address the needs of an agile market environment with a strong focus on product development and a clear integration between R&D, technology management and operation, will benefit the growth of this business.","That has of course a couple of, you call it dis-synergies, I actually say separation work, because I don't think they are dis-synergies because they can be managed. That includes that we have a number of, I would say, fairly clean plans that service mostly the RX business. We have disintegration work on the supply chain side that is integrated, but more from a purchasing and from a planning perspective than from a distribution perspective that runs that.","We have already separate sales, marketing functions. We have a separate R&D function. So we are fairly confident that the more on the administrative side work that needs to be done can be completed in due time and can actually result in a setup of a very lean and very efficient RX company and a very, very competitive consumer company. And so we are not concerned about dis-synergies.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Randall.","Operator","The next question comes from David Maris of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. I was wondering if you could address how \u2013 everything that you said about the RX business and the rationale for that being separated doesn't fit for animal health. It seems like that would fit the same thesis that there aren't a lot of synergies and there's not a lot of overlap in the R&D in the sale process.","But maybe if you can tell us where you are on your thinking on the animal health business? And why it's not part of the same spin-out or sale strategy? Thank you.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Well, today we made an announcement on RX. Animal health is obviously not an RX business. So that is why it is not part of this announcement.","However, as part of our value-creation roadmap, we have analyzed all of our businesses and we have identified what right to win they have. Is the business a fit with our core capability? Do we have the right to win in the marketplace? And is our return on capital compared to our cost of capital in the target range. That applies to all businesses.","There is no disagreement that the performance of this business is disappointing. And therefore, this is one of the businesses that is part of our ongoing analysis. And if we make a decision to separate this business or sell it, we would inform you. But as I said before, the policy is that we inform you once we have made a decision. On this business, we have not made a decision.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you very much.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Next question.","Operator","The next question comes from Ami Fadia of Leerink. Please go ahead.","Ami Fadia - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I guess, we've talked a lot about sort of the potential benefit of separating out RX sort of from the rest of the company and then what benefit that could have.","But could you also sort of focus on what areas you've identified that could help drive faster growth in the CHCA or CHCI businesses? Does the separation of RX allow you to reallocate capital or focus to be able to drive faster growth? And how actively would you go after acquiring new or other branded products that could potentially switch? Could you sort of elaborate on that a little bit in terms of criteria? And how you would potentially be able to drive that RX-to-OTC switch? Thank you.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. Thank you for your question. And I must say that most of the answers I have to defer to our December (sic) [September] (59:38) 25 meeting. But I want to give you a little bit of how we think about it.","As part of the value-creation roadmap, we clearly have identified how can we accelerate growth for our consumer business. We have looked at organic opportunities. We have looked at inorganic opportunities. We have looked at capital allocation to drive operational profits and operational efficiencies. And again, we have looked at inorganic opportunities with respect to RX-to-OTC switches.","As I said before, with respect to this one that we have announced today, that is a very selective strategy that is designed around our core capabilities. It has to do with categories we play in and it has to do with assets available to switch that we believe have enough equity and that we can switch within our core capabilities in a fairly fast-track time.","So I would still caution everybody to say this is a very selective area where we are playing. And then this is our first product that we execute on. So this is one element of many which will drive our growth initiatives in the consumer business. And there are many of those elements we would like to discuss with you in September 25. So I have to ask for a little bit of patience until we are ready to share that with you.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks for the question, Ami. Next question, please.","Operator","The next question will come from David Steinberg of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Michael Steinberg - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Further discussion on capital deployment. So, in the last couple of quarters, you bought back a significant amount of stock that you refrained from any external strategies. And prior to that, obviously, you were right-sizing Europe, you were deleveraging and selling off your Tysabri royaltiy.","So my questions revolve around sort of the timing and nature of future acquisitions. And I assume you would continue as part of your lineages in making a lot of tuck-ins on the consumer side. So you've refrained from making acquisitions during this period of not looking at the businesses. Will you still refrain from acquisitions during the period of time in which you're going to either sell-off or spinoff your generics business?","And then looking down the road, will you go back to your historical sort of small tuck-ins on the consumer side, or are you still potentially looking at larger sized acquisitions, PG (1:02:43), Omega, Mylan?","And then, finally, with this split-off of the businesses, is the nature of the type of acquisitions be looking a little bit different? Thanks.","Uwe R\u00f6hrhoff - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. On the inorganic side, again, we are ready to share more detailed information about our inorganic strategy on the consumer side with you on September 25. But it is clearly part of our growth strategy.","And from a timing perspective, you can see that on the acquisition of the in-licensing rights for Nasonex that we are willing to take and capitalize on opportunities when they present themselves to us and when they fit our strategy that we have identified in our strategic value-creation roadmap.","So, from that perspective, we are completely committed to execute on opportunities that we have identified to be in our sweet spot. But the details, where that is and how we see that, we are going to share with you again on September 25.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. David, I would only just say as you, remember, sit back and look at the cash flow characteristics of the company, our strong balance sheet, and in the context of total shareholder returns and our commitment to an investment-grade credit profile, we have great liquidity, we have great cash flow to invest in, to Uwe's point, a very progressive inorganic strategy relative to the criteria tuck-on acquisitions.","And you think about it, and we've talked about this before, just to remind ourselves, in the balance sheet side, we only have $525 million of maturities from today until 2020. So, next two-and-a-half years, the cash available \u2013 and by the way, almost all of that is the term loan, which obviously a term loan is kind of a variable refinancing kind of structure.","So, having said that, we're in a great position from a cash flow standpoint, we're in a great position from a balance sheet point of view to execute the strategy that Uwe just outlined. So let's not forget that baseline we're starting from is very strong.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Great. And with that, Carrie, I think that's all the time we have. And so we want to thank everybody for all your time and attention and thank you for your interest in Perrigo. Hope to talk to you soon.","Operator","The conference is now concluded.

(Operator Instructions) Thank you Mr, Art Shannon, Vice President of Investor Relations & Corporate Communication, you may begin your conference sir.","Arthur Shannon","Thank you very much, Don. Welcome to Perrigo's second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. I hope you all had a chance to review our press release which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the press release is available on our website at perrigo.com. Also on our website is a slide presentation for this call. Before we proceed with the call, I'd like to remind everyone that the Safe Harbor language contained in today's press release also pertains to this conference call.

Please see the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements on Page 1 of the company's Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2012.","I would now like to turn the call over to Perrigo's Chairman and CEO, Joe Papa. Joe?","Joe Papa","Thank you, Art and welcome everyone to Perrigo\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2013 earnings conference call. Also joining me today is Judy Brown, Perrigo\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","For our agenda today, I will discuss the discussion we announced earlier this morning. Then I will provide a brief perspective on the quarter and the continued stress in our store brand market share growth. Next, Judy will go through the details of the quarter and our fiscal 2013 earnings guidance. Then I will provide an update on the transition to plastic containers in our instant formula business and our plans for new product launches plus an overview of our expectations for the rest of the year. Finally, this will be followed by an opportunity for Q&A.","First, earlier today we announced the acquisition of Velcera for $160 million in all-cash transaction as you can see on slide number three. This acquisition follows our move into pet care with the Sergeant's acquisition in last October. Velcera is best known for PetArmor. It is a (inaudible) based flea and tick treatment comparable to Frontline top spot. The complete Frontline franchise has annual branded sales of $1 billion.","In calendar 2012, Velcera had annual sales of approximately $60 million. Velcera is expected to add a great new product pipeline and be $0.11 accretive to adjusted earnings in its first full year and ROIC accretive in our fiscal 2015. This transaction combines an existing store brand player with our manufacturing capabilities enabling us to deliver the strongest flea and tick market offering. These are expensive products that can truly benefit from the addition of quality affordable store brand.","Now let\u2019s discuss the quarter. On slide five, you can see we had all-time record quarterly net sales of $883 million with record adjusted net income of 14% from last year on a 5% net sales growth. We had all-time high second quarter adjusted gross and operating margin. Consolidated adjusted operating margin was 22% driven by strong operational performance.","Our operations in the consumer healthcare business are producing higher volumes and are operating more efficiently than at any time in our history. The lean sigma process changes that we began to embed a few years ago are now really paying dividend for us. The Perrigo quality and supply chain teams are doing great work. Along these record earnings and earnings per share, cash flow from operations was a fiscal second quarter record $185 million.","Turning to slide six, you can see the business segment breakdown. Judy will walk you through the details but I wanted to touch on a few of the items. First, our consumer healthcare segment has all-time record second quarter sales up 14% versus last year. If we normalize the days versus last year, CHC growth would have been 23%. The performance was driven by continued execution of our CHC strategies, operational excellence, store brand market share growth and innovative new product international growth and continued expansion in adjacent categories.","Sales in our nutrition segment were down from last year as we spent the majority of the quarter ramping up our retailers by the retailer launch of the plastic containers in the instant formula business. This launch is underway and retailers have begun to heavily promote store brand instant formula. Both gross and operating margins in the segment improved as a result of the increased pricing and improved product mix. Judy will discuss our guidance for this segment shortly.","With the record adjusted second quarter gross and operating margin, our Rx business had a good quarter. Although net sales decreased 8% compared to a record second quarter last year and adjusted operating income was down 6% as a result of increased competition of certain based products, on a normalized basis, considering the extra week last year, net sales were relatively flat to last year. The Rx business has our best pipeline in Perrigo\u2019s history.","Looking at slide seven, the mega trend shift from national brand to store brand continues. The overall OTC consumer market was up more than 2% versus last year. National brands were down almost 2% but store brand gained 9.7% on the strength of new product launches, national brand recalls and increased store brand acceptance and nearly every category store brands drove the growth.","The diabetes category experienced tremendous store brand\u2019s growth of more than 14%. In the gastrointestinal market, the category was flat while store brands grew 12.2%. Store brands continued to drive growth in the marketplace.","Now let me turn the call over to Judy.","Judy Brown","Thank you. Good morning everyone. As you just heard, we delivered another high-quality quarter with record second-quarter revenue, adjusted earnings and cash flow. We\u2019re already busy working in what should (ph) be a strong second half of fiscal 2013 which I will discuss in a few minutes.","But first let me review the fiscal second quarter results by business segment. As you may recall in this time last year the second quarter of fiscal 2012 included 14 weeks of activity versus the 13 weeks in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 which we\u2019re reviewing today.","So on slide eight, you can see net sales in consumer healthcare grew 14% year-over-year driven by an increase in sales of existing products of $38 million in the contracts, analgesics and smoking cessation category, $34 million attributable to the Sergeant and CanAm acquisitions and new product sales of $12 million primarily in the cough\/cold, dermatologic and gastrointestinal categories.","Specifically sales in the analgesics category were up more than 8% year-over-year led by sales in children and infants liquid analgesic products in a period where a specific branded competitor has not fully returned to the market. Additionally, sales of our OTC products outside the U.S. increased 9% as the team continues its concerted effort to grow store brand market share internationally. These increases were partially offset by a year-over-year decline of $13 million in sales of various existing allergy and gastrointestinal products and approximately $5 million dollars of discontinued products.","The increase in adjusted gross margin was due primarily to product mix and increased production efficiencies. Our operating expenses remained flat as a percent of net sales as R&D spend was down slightly due to project timing while the SG&A expenses increased with the expansion into our new animal health and diabetes care categories.","On slide nine, you can see that net sales within the nutritional segment declined 5% year-over-year. The 14-week impact previously discussed accounted for even more than this amount but was offset by $3 million of new product sales. Growth rates in the U.S. are still down 2% year-over-year and national brands continue to coupon (ph) as part of their marketing strategy to gain market share in instant formula.","We began shipping the new SmarTub plastic container in mid-December. As of today, February 1, we\u2019ve launched the customer to represent a little more than 60% of our U.S. volume. Feedback on the plastic containers has been favourable and notably Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club have featured this new packaging directly next to the national brand in a number of nationwide circulars.","Adjusted gross margin in the nutritionals segment increased 280 basis points to 27.2% as price increases which we initiated following the continued rise in raw material prices were fully visible this quarter, and product mix was favorable as a greater percentage of sales were from infant formula versus relatively lower margin toddler foods. The adjusted operating margin increased 320 basis points due to lower employee related expenses as a result of our back office consolidation activity along with the absence of operating expenses related to the company\u2019s Florida location, which was closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.","On slide 10, net sales in our Rx business decreased 8% as existing product sales were lower year-over-year by $11 million due to the expected competition on certain products. These decreases were partially offset by new product sales of $9 million. Most of the decline in second-quarter net sales was attributable to the extra week of operations. Adjusted gross and operating margin increased due to favorable product mix versus last year, as well as higher margins on new product sales.","Next on slide 11, net sales in the API segment decreased 4% due to a decrease in existing product sales of approximately $5 million as a result of increased competition, partially offset by $4 million related to the continued strong performance of a customer\u2019s product. Growth in operating margins was positively impacted by the product launch I just referred to along with favorable mix of existing product sales within our API segment.","Now some quick highlights on our balance sheet. Excluding cash and current investments, working capital was $680 million at the end of the quarter, up from $536 million at this time last year, reflecting primarily the impact of our acquisition of Sergeant\u2019s Pet Care and CanAm Care, organic growth and timing of tax related liabilities compared to the previous year.","As of December 29, 2012 total current and long-term debt on the face of the balance sheet was $1.4 billion, flat sequentially from last quarter. Excluding cash and cash equivalents, our net debt to total capital at the end of our second quarter fiscal 2013 was 30.2%. Cash flow from operations of $185 million was a second quarter record due to strong earnings and the positive impact from improvements in the company\u2019s working capital during the quarter. Year-to-date net cash flow from operations was $230 million, $10 million more than last year based on strong earnings growth offset by timing of certain tax payments as compared to the prior year.","Now, I\u2019d like to discuss our earnings outlook for the full year fiscal 2013. On slide 12, you will see that we are upgrading guidance for the nutritional segment based upon lower than expected results during the first half of the year. As we stated previously, retailers have been in the process of phasing out the older package metal cans in anticipation of their recently launched new plastic containers. Although this process has been going a bit slower than we had initially planned, we continue to expect store brand penetration to increase as the new plastic containers gain consumer acceptance. Given the timing on this phase-out phase-in, the highly competitive sales environment among national brands in the infant formula category, and a larger than expected revenue shortfall in the first half of the fiscal year from our original plan in VMS, we now estimate nutritionals revenue to grow between 1% and 5% year-over-year with adjusted gross margin of between 26% and 30% and adjusted operating margin of between 10% and 14%.","On slide 13, you will notice that we are not making any adjustments to our consolidated guidance for the fiscal year at this time. However we are lowering our probability wait on the launches of certain new partner products, including the broader (inaudible) family of products and Loratadine-D 12 (ph). Due to the limited visibility we have on the launches of these partner products, it is more difficult to precisely forecast their exact launch date. Incorporating this factor into our risk adjusted model we now expect fiscal 2013 consolidated new products revenue to be approximately $150 million. Please note that these numbers still include our 600 milligram extended release Guaifenesin version, we are still currently expecting to launch within the fiscal year.","The cough\/cold flu season is off to a solid start and sales within our overall base consumer healthcare and Rx businesses are strong. We assume these factors will mitigate a portion of the updated nutritional guidance and new product revenue impact I just spoke about and therefore we now expect consolidated fiscal year 2013 revenue near the mid to lower end of the stated guidance range.","Once again, the team demonstrated its commitments in manufacturing and operating excellence this quarter as evidenced by producing the largest volumes in our 125 year history. Lean sigma continuous improvement initiatives implemented since 2010 helped to facilitate the strong operational performance which translated into consistent margin expansion. While he believe there is always more to do we remain focused on solid execution as the basis for continued growth, both internally and as we further cultivate our business development pipeline.","Now let me turn it back to Joe.","Joe Papa","Thank you, Judy. We had a solid quarter but now I want to focus on the future. Let\u2019s start with consumer healthcare. This year the cough\/cold flu season has become an epidemic in some regions of the country starting in mid-December. We are realizing strong sales in our cough\/cold and analgesic categories. The key for our sales in the cough\/cold flu area is the duration of the season and so far it is above our expectation but we will have to continue to monitor the season.","Now let me turn your attention to slide number 14. In January we launched the store brand version of Nicorette Mini Lozenges with approximately $30 million in branded sales continuing our leadership position in the smoking cessation category. Additionally we are preparing for the launch of the store brand version of Mucinex 600 milligram with annual branded sales of approximately $135 million. As of today we currently expect to launch this product in our fiscal year 2013 and specifically March 2013. As previously stated before we will issue a press release the date launches.","In our nutritionals business highlighted on slide 15 we are excited about the upgrade to what we believe is a better than the national brand style packaging. As you have seen in other products when we closely match the packaging to the national brand, we gain market share. Last month Perrigo received clearance to manufacture three Codex compliant infant formulas for international market which underscores high-quality standard of Perrigho\u2019s opening up more international opportunities.","Turning to slide 16, first I would like to welcome Doug Boothe, our executive vice president of our Rx pharmaceutical groups to the team. Dough brings a wealth of experience and knowledge about the pharmaceutical industry from his many years working at companies such as at (inaudible). Welcome to the Perrigo family, Doug.","The generic Rx is well-positioned for growth. In fact, this morning we launched clobetasol emulsion form, the generic version of Olux\u00ae -E Foam, with branded prescription sales of approximately $38 million. This is our second launch from the Cobrek family of products since the recent acquisition in December 2012. To date we have launched six new foam based products into the market and all these products Perrigo is the sole generic player in the market.","As highlighted on slide 17 we are poised for strong new product launches in the second half of the year with the recently announced launch of generic versions of Acetadote, (inaudible) form plus other undisclosed products of more than $500 million in branded sales. We expect to have a strong second half of the year ahead for Rx team. The Perrigo team has done a great business development pipeline and continues to evaluate opportunities in new categories, technology and geographies.","In summary, on slide 18 Perrigo is poised for continued growth. The market continues to shift to store brand offerings, and our OTC switches are expected to continue with $10 billion in branded Rx sales likely to switch in the next five years with $5 billion of that expected in the next three years. Our nutritionals business conversion to the new plastic tub is being received positively, and our Rx business continues to perform well. We expect to grow adjusted earnings 9% to 13% over the last year\u2019s record performance as we continue to execute on our mission of making quality healthcare more affordable for our customers.","Operator, let\u2019s open up the call for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley","I have a bunch of questions but I don\u2019t want to take too much time. I guess I will just start with a few things. First of all, with respect to Mucinex, can you provide some more detailed comments on exactly where things stand, level of confidence et cetera, obviously it\u2019s taken longer than expected and it\u2019s a matter of timing but just wanted to better understand exactly what we should know about Mucinex? And then second, with respect to the flu benefit, could you talk about the benefit in the December quarter and what we should expect for the March quarter, is there any way to quantify that? And then I guess a final question is with respect to competitors could you just talk about competitor manufacturing resolutions, what\u2019s happening at J&J, what\u2019s happening at Novartis, what\u2019s happening Novartis\u2019 flea and tick recall et cetera, just so that we understand what's happening in the competitive landscape?","Joe Papa","Okay, I will be happy to answer your one question, Dave but \u2013 going to Mucinex, first of all, as everyone knows we've originally launched Mucinex to our customers starting in April 2012, that was a select number of customers, limited amount of quantity as we are getting ready for the full scale launch to our OTC customers. We noticed a change in the characteristics of one of the excipients in our products that force us to go back into revalidate our product with this new excipient characteristics, we have done that. As I sit here today, we expect to be able to launch our Mucinex 600 milligram in March of 2013, and as I've noted that \u2013 the day we launch it we will send out a press release to everybody to alert them the fact that we have launched it.","The only other thing I will say about Mucinex is that we all launch practices that are necessary for this product launch have either been completed or in process as we speak today. So March 2013 is our best estimate at this time. On the second question on the flu benefit in the March quarter, I would say that at this point the majority of the increase in incidents of flu really happened in about mid December, so it wasn\u2019t a major contributor to our second-quarter. But certainly there was some come contribution in the second quarter. I think the only other thing I want to say on the third quarter, fourth quarter is really the comments that Judy said is we are really \u2013 we put that into our guidance, the real question though is we cannot predict exactly the duration of the cough\/cold flu season. At this time we really try to track what I'd call is the area under the curve of the incidents of cough cold flue. And right now as I sit here today it\u2019s up about 20% from last year, that\u2019s the specific number as we sit here today. Don\u2019t know that duration will continue at this rate and that's really what we try to put into our probability waiting for the remainder of the year which Judy highlighted.","On the question of the competitors and where they are, J&J continues to resolve their questions, the latest information that I\u2019ve heard have been that they will continue to bring product to back into 2013 and expect to have the majority their products back at the end of \u2013 by the end of 2013, and we\u2019ve attempted to factor that into our guidance really \u2013 as we said we always try to bring that in one quarter at a time, not try to get ahead of ourselves on that guidance question. On the other individual company you mentioned Novartis -- Novartis has reentered the product categories the calendar fourth quarter. They began reentering products into the categories and that is our expectation is that they will continue to reenter products as we speak.","Judy Brown","Dave, I think you mentioned also the flea and tick category, that\u2019s a channel products. So it\u2019s not overlapping with our focus on the retail consumption of flea and tick.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley","Sorry, I jumped on late, so I didn\u2019t follow the rule. My apologies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dulie Sammin (ph) with JP Morgan.","Unidentified Analyst","Just a follow on the Mucinex franchise, what\u2019s really \u2013 for timing we understand March of 2013 for the 600 milligram dose, does the excipient issue crossover to the other potential formulations of Mucinex and can you comment on the timing of the launches of those other formulations as well?","Joe Papa","Sure. First on the question the Mucinex 600 milligram products and our expected March 2013 question, and the excipient does not relate to the other products. So the excipient issue that we have experienced with our 600 milligram product does not relate to the other Mucinex family of products is the answer of that question.","Relative to the other products, as Judy stated very well what we simply we did is because of the difficulty in seeing complete visibility of those products, we simply at this time decided to lower the probability of those products launching in the current fiscal year which as Judy mentioned caused some of the decrease in our new product \u2013 for some of the partner products that we have identified in our new product launches.","Unidentified Analyst","So those other formulations, so do you think that could potentially be a 2014 event?","Joe Papa","Really don\u2019t want to make any comments specific to 2014 but be clear as we've delayed or we reduced the probability and then by definition delayed the product probability of coming into this year it does not suggest that they will not come to the market, simply delayed the timing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Ariel Herman - Goldman Sachs","Hi this is Ariel Herman in for Jami. Just a question on the guidance, just maybe if you guys could give us some of the swing factor to year being that we are about halfway through the year and the guidance trend is tough. So why \u2013 just maybe a little bit of the swing factors and why the guidance hasn\u2019t maybe been increased with the Cobrek acquisition and the flu season being so strong?","Joe Papa","Sure. Well, let me be clear, there is \u2013 so as you stated \u2013 there is a wide range in our EPS guidance to be clear. So I don't know I\u2019d say that the actual percentage of cents of guidance doesn\u2019t include a Cobrek number. So let\u2019s \u2013 there is a wide range there, we\u2019re still in that range. However as we stated \u2013 and I think Judy may want to make some comments to this as well, we feel very strongly that right now we\u2019re continuing to monitor the cough cold flu season. If that duration continues there will be upside but we do not want to bake in the upside at this time until we actually see it because we believe in being cautious in that sense there.","Number two, the Rx business continues to perform very well, we\u2019ve got a number of new product launches as evidenced by the product Olux-E we launched today, Lux-E product that we launch in mid January and then we have about half a dozen additional launches that we have planned for the rest of the year. Assuming those products go well because we probability waited our launches, there may be some upside but I think we want to take them one day at a time as we go out with these products. And clearly the comment on Cobrek is we are delighted with that. We\u2019ve already got these two launched with Cobrek and so we think it\u2019s a great opportunity for us relative to our Rx business and we are going to continue to monitor it. But we would rather take one day at a time rather than -- in one quarter at a time rather than build everything into the guidance at this time. So I think those are probably the first \u2013 Judy, want to make any other comments?","Judy Brown","I would say Ariel just to give you \u2013 the overview our guidance range of $0.20 is about 3%, if you look at kind of the midpoint of the range, in cent terms $0.20 but in percentage terms quite very small. When we moved guidance in the past, we moved the range, usually with a specific finite item and acquisition that moves us outside of the range, a tax settlement again that moves us out of the range. In this quarter there are a lot of moving pieces at Joe\u2019s just comment just now and I think we\u2019ve stuck with our consistent philosophy of managing moving parts decreasing new products offset by other things, and without any specific items that move us out of the range, we were going to adjust at this one (ph). That is consistency in the approach.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser with B. Riley Caris.","Linda Bolton Weiser - B. Riley Caris","So I know you don't want to get into like a big long-range projections right now. But maybe now that we have some additional things contributing to growth for FY 2014 in terms of the acquisition, can you give us some just really broad brush strokes on -- it seems to me that EPS growth rate next year FY 2014 could be quite high, assuming base business growth of 10% to 12% and then accretion from the deal, and then the generic Temodar API, which was like a spurt of earnings in FY 2014. So it comes to a pretty high EPS growth rate. So is the offset that it's not such a robust year for new products because there's nothing big? Or can you just, without giving the guidance, can you just give us a way of have to think about it for FY 2014?","Joe Papa","Linda, you mentioned a couple of important items for us to be clear. The temozolomide is a big product launch for us, it\u2019s a launch for us in August 12, 2013 at least we believe a six month exclusivity as to whether it will be a longer exclusivity I can\u2019t comment on that right now. But certainly at least for the first six months and as you know Temodar U.S. sales are very significant, I think Merck reported somewhere in the $960 million global sales number for Temodar. So it\u2019s a big product. You\u2019re absolutely correct.","I think though on the question of 2014, I don\u2019t think I could really comment any further on that other than just what we speak about what we've talked about in our long-term guidance and that\u2019s really that we say we expect to see somewhere between 5% to 10% revenue growth for our business on any three-year term and then the corresponding earnings per share growth would be approximately double that or 10% to 20%. And really that\u2019s all I think I can  say about will 2014 at this time based on the fact that we\u2019ll have more to say about 2014 I guess.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ami Fadia with UBS.","Ami Fadia - UBS","I've got one or two quick questions and then maybe it's like a three-part question. Maybe just on nutritionals, could you tell us what would be the drivers to get you to your new guidance range over the next two quarters? And on the Rx side, what should we know about any new competitors or any change in the competitive landscape there? And then, just thirdly, on the acquisition in pet care announced this morning, maybe if you could give us a sense of growth expectations, margins for the business and a little bit about the pipeline. I know it's going to be a long question.","Joe Papa","Okay, I will try to get to all of them and Judy, please help. On the nutritional side, really the growth expectations for our nutritionals are going to be two areas. Number one is infant formula and number two is the VMS. Clearly because it\u2019s easier, one, really the growth in the VMS is really related to upticking of two additional customers, one of which we\u2019ve already shipped, the other one is starting to ship soon. But that\u2019s going to drive some of the growth in our nutritional business from the VMS side.","But really the important part of the growth is going to be \u2013 and certainly the operating margin growth is going to be driven by what we can do with getting the new package product out to the marketplace, which we are underway right now. We started shipping in December and that is happening as we speak. More products will be shipped as we go into the next weeks ahead. That\u2019s going to be the big driver. Beyond that the actual shipping of the package, more importantly is the incremental promotions we are getting from our retailers. Those incremental promotions we think will help us to drive the business and help -- importantly drive store brand share. As I mentioned in my commentary when we moved our packaging to be more closely aligned with the national brand packaging, we do better. We gain conditional market share as it invites the consumer to compare our product with be the national brand and that's why we're really excited about our new package design, because now our package looks much more closely to the leading national brands, the Similac, the Enfamil and the Nestle Gerber product. So that\u2019s really the excitement we see in the nutritional side.","On the Rx part of the business, in terms of changing landscape really \u2013 there are individual companies and individual product competition that we face but no major shift in the change in our Rx business. In fact, I would say we\u2019re sitting today as I mentioned with the best pipeline opportunities we\u2019ve ever had in the history of Perrigo\u2019s Rx business. We\u2019ve got a great pipeline of products, we\u2019ve already launched two products, both the Luxiq foam, the Olux-E foam and then we have about a half-dozen of additional products that we expect to launch in the next six-months or by the end of the current fiscal year, I should probably say the next five months. So we feel like we are in a great position relative to the Rx business. There is clearly going to be some competition on the product A or product B but the wealth and breadth of our portfolio of new product launches is really what\u2019s going to drive the success in our Rx business. And we are excited that most of these products are products with limited number of competitors.","Final comment was on the acquisition today, when you take our Velcera business, you add it to the Seargent's acquisition we essentially required approximately $200 million of business and I think I would say our expectations for growth are in that high single digit growth rate, so relative to where we expect it to grow. Obviously as we launch products with this category that\u2019s when we\u2019ll see acceleration of growth in any given year and we look to have more to say about that in the future in terms of our ability to launch new product as a result of taking the Velcera team and putting it with the Seargent\u2019s acquisition and then driving our operating and gross margin.","Only other comment I would say is when we made the first acquisition in Seargent\u2019s one of the comments I made is we picked up manufacturing capabilities as we add to develop better product range, we think we will also drive the gross margin and operating margin of that business to allow us to have certainly better than our average corporate margin in both of those cases.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur with Needham.","Elliot Wilbur - Needham & Company","Thanks. Good morning and offer my graduations to Judy and Art for their placement in the Aye-Aye All-America executive team. Joe, I just congratulate you on being an all-around great guy. How's that?","So my question is with respect to the generic segment. You hit on this a couple of times, but again, just thinking about even the low end of guidance. I mean, that would basically imply that you are going to kind of be at a $190 million run rate per quarter for the second half of the year. And obviously, if you're going to have some contributions from some new products, I'm assuming Cobrek is more of a margin impact. But I'm just wondering now, have you gained more confidence in some pipeline assets that maybe you had heavily probability-adjusted previously? And now you -- maybe you've adjusted those probabilities upward? Just difficult, I guess, sort of given what we know about the pipeline to see how you are going to get to those sorts of levels.","Joe Papa","As we look at it, or are just simply looking at the pipeline opportunities, for example, getting the launch of the Luxiq and the Olux-E form behind us, having those launches January 15 and then again today that really improves our probability waiting on products just as they happen. So it\u2019s an important part of how we look at forecasting. In addition to that, the clear other important factors I mentioned just a minute ago as we have six plus product launches in our Rx business over the next five months. That\u2019s really going to help drive our performance in the Rx segment of our business. So that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s really our \u2013 as we look at the number of product launch opportunities we have, as we look at what the new products do for driving both the gross margin and operating margin, that's really what is going to be a critical element for us for the next five-months, and that\u2019s really why we have the confidence.","Many of these products are what I would call either a date certain launch or an end of expiration period. So we have a good cool as to when they are launched to be fair, a couple of them are not. A couple of them we have to wait for approval and then we can go but as we balance out the probability waiting those products that\u2019s the reason why we have the confidence for the remaining half of the year for our Rx businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Guggenheim.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities","So as we look at your business now, it looks like you've got several meaningful growth opportunities. You've got the animal health, international expansion, Rx to OTC switch environment, improving at the FDA, you've got the infant formula and diabetes care. So just curious, of these opportunities, which one are you most excited about and why?","Joe Papa","Well, I think I\u2019d say in general Perrigo will continue to focus our business on our consumer healthcare and nutritional business. We are a store brand private label player and as we look at what\u2019s happening there, there is couple big drivers and those are the ones that you mentioned. We continue to see acceleration of the store brand usage and the movement from national brand to store brand. I think that\u2019s got to be -- probably one of the most important drivers in that we see every quarter of store brand growing about 9% where national brands are flat to up slightly. That's really going to be one of the imported drivers and one of the things we continue to track for our future.","The second comment is just take the example of what happened in the past week, the fact that Oxytrol has moved from prescription to OTC, that\u2019s an important product not just for that individual product but it\u2019s a brand new category with overactive bladder. There are some big products in that category, Detrol, Detrol LA, Ditropan are all examples of products that are in that category, and when you move another category like overactive bladder specifically like Oxytrol, it puts up the overactive bladder question. I am not suggesting today all those will move but certainly it is another potential example of what we are expecting. Animal health brand-new but Judy may want to make some more comments there.","Judy Brown","We never want to pick between your children, but animal health space for us is incredibly exciting because if you think about \u2013 Joe just talked about all the opportunities of products that are going from behind the counter to over the counter. Animal health creates an entire new opportunity to save consumers\u2019 money by being able to procure products in the retail space. The retailers are excited about being able to have products available, having store brand offering available. These two acquisitions are going to create an entire new aisle of value for consumers and I think that\u2019s really exciting, it\u2019s basically OTC in the 1980s as there is a whole new quality affordable healthcare offering. So that\u2019s pretty exciting for us just because we\u2019re going to be at the forefront of creating a whole new space for consumers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Annabel Samimy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus","I think all of them have been answered, but I can ask you a variation on all of them. So maybe we can go to Rx Pharma for a bit. I mean, you've talked a lot about how you are set up for the year. This quarter, I guess, you had the one less week and you had some increased competition. How much can the new product launches that you have offset some of the competition that you've seen this quarter? And maybe can you talk about how you are set up for the medium term? Are most of these products in new foam launches or are these product categories that you potentially see competition in the future?","Joe Papa","Well, in general I think we are looking at our Rx portfolio, we clearly as Judy said see some significant growth opportunities with our Rx business. That\u2019s why we continue to look at our guidance, we think revenue growth can grow 15% to 19% for our Rx business and that's why we are \u2013 but most of all we\u2019re excited about the new product potential for the Rx business.","On the question of our pipeline as I stated before, it\u2019s the best platform we\u2019ve ever had in the history of our company in the Rx business. So we are really excited about what that could mean for the growth aspect. Importantly that as you know new products tend to drive not only the sales line but they also drive the operating margin and the gross margin of our business. So for those reasons I think that\u2019s going to offset any of the potential question we have on any competitive challenges and allow us to continue to demonstrate a very significant both gross margin and operating margin of the business.","As it relates to new products, majority of these new products fall in what we call extended topical. My extended topic, if I remind you, we think certainly dermatology products absorbed topically through skin, respiratory products absorbed topically through the lungs, nasal products and absorbed topically through the nasal mucosa. Those are the things that we talked about and that\u2019s where we continue to stay focused on our portfolio of products and that\u2019s really what we would continue to look at for the Rx business. Obviously we\u2019ve got some other examples, the metered dose inhalers and other places we go with the business such as the -- we've got the first to file on ProAir. And I think, many of you may have seen, we got our first testosterone product approved yesterday and hopefully more to come but we will have more to say about that for the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gilbert with BofA Merrill Lynch.","Greg Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch","I have two. First, for Judy, I think your EPS year to date is tracking a little better than cash flow from ops relative to the full year goals. Is that just the typical rhythm of cash flow realization or are there other factors to consider in the second half? And, for Joe, is there a way for the Nexium-like store brand opportunity to form before Pfizer has its three years on the real Nexium product? Thanks.","Judy Brown","Greg, I will take your cash flow question first. I think you just like to listen to me say that cash flow is never linear. The strong second-quarter and the drivers in cash flow of course starts with net income and based on the guidance we provided and the color we\u2019ve given around concerning the consolidated projections for the full year, you can probably model fairly well the cash flow on net income and then the moving pieces on working capital, lot of inventory movement around this time of year as we\u2019re in the midst of launches and of course cough cold flu season and as we gear them into the summer, we usually have a pull down in inventory and pull through on the working capital side. So usually although it\u2019s never linear Q2, Q4 the larger a cash flow quarter is, as we confirmed our full year cash flow guidance at the moment. So not linear but we\u2019re cost back up on where we thought we\u2019d be year-to-date and on track for the full year.","Joe Papa","On the question of Nexium Greg, at this time we think it\u2019d be unlikely that there'll be Nexium store brand or competitive opportunity in OTC space before Pfizer launches theirs. But I can never say never but I think it's unlikely I think we'll see the Pfizer product show up in approximately 2014 and with an expected three year exclusivity we obviously want to get ready for any situation but with an expected three year exclusivity that would bring us to about 2017.","Greg Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch","And could BenzaClin be one of your launches this year?","Joe Papa","You know that we don\u2019t ever comment about our products., of course unless there is litigation, Greg. So I apologize I can\u2019t answer that question. You also know that we know a lot about clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide but we can\u2019t really comment about any individual product.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Steinberg with Deutsche Bank.","David Steinberg - Deutsche Bank","Two quick questions. First on tax rate, Judy, I think at the beginning of the fiscal year you discussed 29% to 31% range for the year. But there could be some conservatism given some statute expirations and audits, and I think you said it could be a $40 million benefit. So in the first quarter, tax rate was 26%; 28.5% this quarter. Are you still guiding for 29% to 30% or should we think about a lower number?","Judy Brown","So a great question. Just to go back to your comments, you made a comment about 49 upside, I think it was closer to 15, or check in the Q it will be going out this afternoon. But specifically we confirmed the range for the full year. Obviously as you know we picked up Seargent\u2019s into the portfolio, will have nine-months of Seargent\u2019s operations in there, as a 98% U.S. company at a 37 plus percent tax rate. And that\u2019s a drain on the overall rate. A good guide though is our friends in Congress have renewed the R&D tax credit and the renewal of that will flow through the full year rate and be a good guide. So hence we kind of come out to a rate \u2013 still in that range maybe near the lower end of the stated range at the moment and that\u2019s excluding any additional tax audit settlements or any one-time items that may come through that are unforeseen at this moment but we\u2019ll obviously give color if any of those one timers come around. But the blended rate -- jurisdictional rate blend taking into consideration the renewals of the R&D tax credit I would expect it to be more the lower end of the stated range.","David Steinberg - Deutsche Bank","And then Joe, quick question. I think you mentioned the next five years it might be $10 billion worth of Rx to OTC switches. I know recently you've been incrementally more positive on the outlook for statins to go over-the-counter. Are statins in that $10 billion or are they not?","Joe Papa","Yes, I did mention 10 billion in the next five years. Statins are not in our numbers at this time. I do believe that statins are something like a 60:40 probability, that would be 60% positive, 40% negative, but because of the size of the stat category we do not include it in our numbers as we think about the future, just something we prepared ourselves for in the event that that occurs and we could not -- 60:40 probability that\u2019s something we\u2019ve built into the model at this time, it\u2019s just too uncertain at this time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Buck with Buckingham Research.","David Buck - Buckingham Research","Just a couple of quick questions. First, on the animal health business, Joe, you mentioned is about $200 million if you combine Sergeant's and the acquisition today of Velcera. I guess, why wouldn't it be growing more than high single digits given that you are expecting to actually launch some of the store brand versions of Frontline? Secondly, for OTC switches, the Oxytrol launch later in the year, are you expecting that to have three-year exclusivity? And can you confirm that you have some type of opportunity in that category as well? And then, just finally, for Joe, the flu season, better than expected so far, I think you mentioned 20% higher versus a year ago. When will you get a sense of whether you'll see the reorders that would push it well above what you've been modeling? I mean, at what point do we need to see the duration of the flu?","Joe Papa","David, you tracked pretty well with my comments, Velcera $200 million and equipped 140 million with the 60 million, basically that is the $200 million product category for us. We are excited about the growth opportunities as we bring out store brand products because once again we think it\u2019s going to be able to move markets from the vet only channel into the mass-market retailers such as Walmart, target, CBS, Walgreens, et cetera, so that\u2019s all important activity for us and ones that we are very excited about. However one of the things we have not even closed yet on Velcera, we closed in October for the Seargent\u2019s business. I think we just don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves in terms of the opportunity there. And if indeed, there is more upside for that we will have comments later but right now we look at it as a \u2013 as I mentioned high single digit growth rate for the category and we will continue to track it and if it gets better than that, we will be happy to share that.","On the Oxytrol, it is something that we have been tracking and certainly something that once again we\u2019re very excited to introduce a new category of overactive bladder products into this Rx OTC switch category. I do expect that Oxytrol will get an exclusivity, it has to do with very large trial that would allow the FDA to understand the ability of the consumer to make use this product. So therefore I do think there will be an exclusivity period granted to this product, otherwise don\u2019t have a definitive answer at this time. So we do think that there is a three year exclusivity, and I am not going to \u2013 I can\u2019t obviously comment about products we have specifically in our category.","On the question of cough cold flu starting in mid-December as I mentioned the season did take off significantly really in many parts of the country reaching epidemic proportions. It is about a 20% increase over a year ago, at its high it was in the mid-20s percent increase over year ago, so it\u2019s something we continue to track on a weekly basis. Thus the biggest question for us is going to be when does the season come to a conclusion. So for example I used the word area under the curve if you are mapping that and charting it out, think of the line being 20% above where it was last year, the question of does it stay above last year at the 20% rates or a month which you\u2019re seeing already. Is it two months, is it three months or does it drop down  precipitously and go below the line, I cannot predict that. So what we do is take one quarter at a time in terms of our expectations. I can simply say that the demand for our cough cold flu season during the month of January has been very strong and I will have to probably leave it at that at this time. Can\u2019t tell you if that\u2019s going to continue into February and March, it\u2019s too early for me to make that comment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shibani Malhotra with RBC Capital.","Shibani Malhotra - RBC Capital Markets","Just on your long-term growth, I guess the biggest -- the number one question we get from investors is whether Perrigo has grown too fast, too quickly, and how the company is going to be able to sustain the growth rate. So if you could just comment on that on a broad level. But then specifically, I think, Joe, you've talked about your -- and the OTC opportunity there as being something that you're very interested in. And there have been some recent dynamics in the market which are probably favorable to you, like the Celesio company getting a Lloyd's brand across Europe. So can you just talk about how that marketplace is evolving and whether you are seeing competitors trying to get in, like Watson, and how you're thinking about that?","Joe Papa","Really the long term growth starting with that part of the question first, I can simply say that the megatrends that we continue to follow support the continued long-term growth of this business and really when you go back to is as the consumer healthcare megatrend, the movement from national brand to store brand continues. As evidenced by what you're seeing in the weekly data that we \u2013 or the monthly data \u2013quarterly data that we sent out. And the second megatrend is movement from Rx to OTC, that\u2019s a trend that we continue to see as evidenced by what you saw last week with Oxytrol, what you saw by the acquisition by Pfizer of the Nexium product portfolio, of the Nexium and extending their portfolio and bring it out estimate from that result. I think that megatrend continues. Other than the commentary I already made on talking about a long-term organic growth rate of high 5 to 10% and double that on the bottom line, I really can\u2019t make any additional comments on that. I will remind everybody that we'll have more to say about 2014 in our August call and then on October 1, we expect to have an analyst day where we will go through all the major drivers of the business on October 1 to share more.","But really if you get through the basics of what makes Perrrigo successful we really believe it\u2019s making sure we have a quality product, make sure we have good customer service, make sure we get out with the new product innovation, being in that first wave and making sure we keep a low cost structure, and continue to develop the people of the organization to allow us to continue to grow. Those are really the five things that I keep my hand on all the time, and I think that\u2019s a critical thing that will make us successful.","On the question on Europe, as you know we\u2019ve got more than 15 products that we have submitted, or are in various stages of regulatory approval some of them are approved, some are approved by country. Those are the things that we continue to look for growth in Europe but to be absolutely clear for continental Europe, the market in continental Europe is more consistent with what I would call in the United States our independent pharmacist model, there is no large retailers like Walgreens, CVS, or Walmart in continental Europe. So we have taken a approach similar to what we do in the United States with independent pharmacists where we work with large distributors like the Cardinal Health, the McKessons, the AmerisourceBergen. And that's really where we are sitting today. There may be opportunities for other acquisitions in Europe or other partnerships in Europe but right now I think we\u2019re looking at this more similar to the way we look at independent pharmacists in the United States and how we go to market there by working with distributors, you mentioned Celesio, you didn\u2019t mention Alliance Foods but I think those are some of the examples of opportunities for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky with Canaccord Genuity.","Randall Stanicky - Canaccord Genuity","Judy, on Temodar, it's obviously a big opportunity. Can you just remind us of the economics relative to your split with Teva and any tax benefits that we should be thinking about with respect to that profit wash? And then, Joe, just at what point does Mucinex miss the cough and cold window for this year?","Judy Brown","I will jump in on the first question, as you know we are expecting to launch that product in August of this calendar year. That will fall into fiscal \u201914, the profit sharing arrangement that we have we don\u2019t disclose the specific terms  of it. So suffice it to say in your modeling it\u2019s probably easy to just go, assume a profit split for these calculations. We won\u2019t specify any more details than that.","The last piece, additionally sometimes in these arrangements there is a delay in the revenue recognition because of the timing on visibility to final third-party sales, it happened to us in the past, if you remember a few years ago it was a different launch. I can\u2019t say yes, I think that is going to be the case, we will have better visibility as we get right on top of the launch date and I will probably be able to provide specific color to that when the first sale will be realized, it will be Q1 fiscal quarter or Q2 but the date of the launch is still going to have in order.","Last point on the tax front, I would expect that this launch will have a lower than average tax rate applied to a \u2013 I am not giving specific yet at this point but I think it would be a benefit overall to the effective tax rate for the full fiscal year rather than address it.","Joe Papa","And then on the question Randall, of the Mucinex launch, as we said our expectation is that we will launch that in the March 2-13 timeframe and as I said most of the batches are ready to complete at this time for the launch, or in process, so we feel very good about our capabilities there, all the product has been validated or the processes have been validated for Mucinex.","Relative to the question of whether we miss the season or not, we look at Mucinex as being certainly important for cough cold flu season but also obviously for the allergy season, so we will certainly feel the time for that. But before the bottom line is as we look at our revenue guidance for consumer healthcare for a 16 to 20% growth for the full year, we did that with the knowledge of how we will probably realize the launch of all of our products and certainly the Mucinex 600 milligram was front and center in what we were looking for that, 16 to 20% growth rate for consumer healthcare.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of John Anderson with William Blair.","John Anderson - William Blair","I'll keep it brief. I just wanted to ask about the international business. I think you mentioned early that OTC outside the U.S. was up 9% in the quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics there, where you're seeing strengths, in which markets, and what your expectations and efforts there are going forward?","Joe Papa","Well, I will just make a general comment. Relative to our international business, they had a good quarter, both in terms of foreign exchange but also in terms of real revenue growth. So they were both positive from foreign exchange but also on revenue growth. The businesses did well for us, we are certainly \u2013 our Mexico business, our UK business did very well for us and importantly we look at Australia as a being a big driver for us for the future as really Australia is very much in its infancy of store brand growth. So as we build more capabilities in Australia we think that\u2019s going to really pay important dividends for us for growth for the future, but to be clear UK and Mexico really exceeded our expectations during the quarter and helped us to drive our OTC business.","Judy Brown","Just highlighting what you said, the store brand is maintaining and growing store brand share, the UK store brand penetration has always been quite high, it was in excess of the US for many years but the US has been able to catch up with the penetration rates than have been historically seen in the UK. But that team is able to bring new products out, so the strength is there. Mexico still has runway, Australia still has runway and we have seen some uptick in the last few quarters.","Joe Papa","Maybe operator, if I just close quickly, first of all thank you very much for your interest in Perrigo, I would say special thanks to everyone on the Perrigo team. They just did another outstanding quarter, it was just a great quarter, of collaboration and working, a lot of hard work went into the quarter into the M&A activities to announce, that\u2019s out there this morning and everyone just did an outstanding job within the Perrigo team.","I think if you're looking at some of the important milestones for Perrigo over the near future clearly in the consumer healthcare that will be the continued cough cold flu season, what\u2019s happening there as well as our Mucinex launch as stated before, we will make sure we get a press release out on Mucinex on the day it launches. On the Rx side, it really is going to be continued acceleration of the new launches for us on the Rx side of the business and what\u2019s happening with those new product launches, we will have more to say about those as we launch this individual product and then finally really excited about what team\u2019s effort have been to bring Velcero\u2019s team to Perrigo and allow us to have approximately $200 million pet care business that we believe will have high single digit growth rate and importantly make a meaningful difference in the ability to provide a quality flea and tick product offering into the marketplace with an affordable price, that we think is very exciting and very core to what we do at Perrigo in our mission. So thank you very much for your interest in Perrigo and have a great day everyone. Have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Perrigo Fiscal 2013 Fourth Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Art Shannon, you may begin your conference.","Arthur J. Shannon","Thank you very much, Melinda. Welcome to Perrigo's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. I hope you all had a chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the release is available on our website, and also on our website is a slide presentation for this call.","Before we proceed with the call, I'd like to remind everyone that during the process of this call, management will make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for investors and shareholders and Safe Harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued this morning and on Slides 2, 3 and 4 in the accompanying investor presentation. Under Irish Takeover Rules, we are under increased scrutiny between now and the closing, and for those of you accustomed to our regular and open communication disclosure, there will be a change, so please bear with us during this period.","Following management's review of the presentation, we will open up the call for questions. I'd like to now turn the call over to the Perrigo's Chairman and CEO, Joe Papa. Joe?","Joseph C. Papa","Thank you, Art, and welcome, everyone, to Perrigo's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Call. Joining me today is Judy Brown, Perrigo's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today, we're going to spend the majority of our time focused on standalone Perrigo. I will provide a few comments on the quarter, including providing details on our continued sales growth and the strength in store-brand market. Next, Judy will go through the details of the fourth quarter and outline our standalone fiscal 2014 earnings guidance. Then, I will provide an update on each business area, plus an overview of our expectations for the coming fiscal year, and this will be followed by an opportunity for Q&A.","However, before I go into Perrigo's fourth quarter, I know many of you have several questions regarding our recently announced definitive agreement to acquire Elan. So let me just spend a few minutes going through some details. Under Irish Takeover Rules, we are limiting in our ability to discuss forward-looking information. Knowing that many of you are seeking a little more detail, this past week, we petitioned the panel to allow us to at least speak to the accretion in the transaction. So assuming the closing to be in the middle of our fiscal 2014, or by the end of the calendar year, in our fiscal 2014, we expect transaction to be at least $0.10 accretive to standalone Perrigo adjusted earnings per share. In our first full year of fiscal 2015, we expect the transaction to be $0.70 to $0.80 accretive to standalone Perrigo adjusted earnings per share. We will be issuing our S-4 in the next few weeks, which will include a pro forma summary which will provide additional details.","Since our announcement, we received many questions on why Elan. Turning to Slides 5 and 6, we will explain why. First, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Elan to provide us with a platform for growth, both internationally and in the U.S. We would be more competitive to buy assets and pursue other M&A opportunities to further enable future growth. Second, as I just mentioned, it is immediately accretive, with greater than $150 million in merger benefits and synergies. Third, the royalty stream is cash. Cash flow is our core to our business and improves our credit profile. We'll be in an even better position to execute on our strategies for adjacent category and international expansion that we have been laying out for the past 7 years. Adjacent categories will continue to include adult nutrition, diabetes care, pet care, ophthalmics and international growth. This deal does not change our strategy. In fact, it will further enable us to execute on our strategy.","Now let's get back to Perrigo's fourth quarter. On Slide 8, you can see that this was, once again, another great quarter for Perrigo, demonstrating the strength of our platform. Our quarterly performance is highlighted by all-time record net sales of $967 million, with a 16% net sales growth, leading to continued record-adjusted profit and more importantly, operating margin expansion.","Moving onto Slide 9, it was a historic year for Perrigo, with record top and bottom line results. We recorded a 12% year-over-year improvement in net sales for fiscal 2013 at $3.5 billion, including 6% organic growth despite a delay in several new product launches. The strong sales results correlated with impressive improvements in adjusted gross margin and operating margins, which saw 130 and 110-basis-point improvement, respectively. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $5.61. This performance was driven by great execution, especially within our Rx and Consumer Healthcare business segments.","Looking at Slide 10, we continue to generate double-digit sales growth across 3 larger segments, with Consumer Healthcare growing 16% to over $560 million in sales. As you can see on Slide 11, we continue to gain market share and store brands across all categories. Looking at the gastrointestinal market. This category was down 1.4%, and national brands were down 7.3%. But store brand grew 8.5%.","Now let's talk about the cough\/cold\/flu\/allergy category. This category has grown 8.2%, and national brands have outgrown store brands. This relatively strong national brand performance in this category is due to certain brands, most notably Mucinex, which is experiencing strong overall results in sales and market share from a combination of core product sales and a number of line extension new products. We are looking forward to our first cough\/cold\/flu season with our store-brand equivalent to Mucinex 600 milligrams extended release and importantly, the opportunity to launch additional national brand-equivalent cough\/cold\/flu store-brand products.","With that, let me turn the call over to Judy.","Judy L. Brown","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. As you just heard, we wrapped up fiscal 2013 with another record quarter and satisfied the vast majority of the financial metrics we set for ourselves at the beginning of the fiscal year. On a consolidated basis, the team continued its strong performance, delivering record quarterly revenue and adjusted earnings in line with our previously stated guidance for the year. Even without the full year dollar contribution from new product launches we had forecasted at the beginning of fiscal 2013, the team once again demonstrated its ability to execute, highlighted by meeting or exceeding many of the recent guidance ranges provided on our May earnings call. Over the last years, we are also pleased to have successfully delivered on our stated 3-year organic compound annual growth rate goals as well.","So as usual, I'll provide a brief overview of the adjusted results for the fiscal fourth quarter by business segment. Then I'll walk you through the consolidated and segment earnings guidance for fiscal 2014 for standalone Perrigo, providing the same level of transparency we do each August on our fiscal year-end calls.","So let's begin with the fiscal fourth quarter highlights in the individual business segments, starting on Slide 12 with Consumer Healthcare. The 16% net sales growth was driven by $67 million attributable to the acquisitions of Sergeant's and Velcera; an increase in sales of existing products of $37 million, mainly in contract and smoking cessation categories; and new product sales of approximately $11 million, mainly in the cough\/cold and smoking cessation categories. These combined increases were partially offset by a decline of $34 million in sales of existing products in the GI and analgesic categories and $1 million from normal product discontinuations. While we had a late start to the allergy season this calendar year, we saw a strong increase in sales of Loratidine-D, the store-brand version of Claritin-D, due to enhanced consumer awareness on the heels of increased brand advertising and marketing and distribution to certain retailers.","The smoking cessation category performed above our expectations, led by the successful launch of the store-brand version of Nicorette Mini Lozenges. Within the GI category, sales of Lansoprazole, the store-brand equivalent to Prevacid, were lower year-over-year as branded marketing and advertising dollars for this product had been more restrained than other competitive proton pump inhibitor products, coupled with the fact that last year's relatively higher sales had the benefit of the retail channel filling and inventory shelf stocking of the Lansoprazole launch.","Sales in the analgesics category were somewhat lower due to 3 main reasons. First, a large retailer switched its short-term advertising focus from store brands to national brands; second, a large analgesic manufacturer with a loyal customer base has resumed sales of its product after being absent from the market for a period of time; and third, another large manufacturer that had been absent from the market with numerous products has returned, but with limited availability and SKU volume.","Adjusted gross profit grew 31%, while adjusted gross margin increased 410 basis points from the positive contributions of the Sergeant's and Velcera acquisitions, increased manufacturing efficiencies and new product launches. These 3 positive forces were partially offset by lower sales in specific higher-margin products within the categories I just mentioned. The difference between adjusted gross an adjusted operating margin leverage year-over-year was due primarily to the inclusion of operating expenses from Sergeant's and Velcera. Organic or legacy Perrigo distribution, selling, general and administrative expenses were flat on a dollar basis year-over-year. We continued to increase our R&D expenditures though, consistent with our revenue growth, to build our long-term pipeline.","On Slide 13, you can see that net sales in the Nutritionals segment grew 11% over last year to $150 million, a new quarterly record. New products contributed approximately half of this dollar growth over last year with more than $2 million of new items brought to shelves in the fiscal fourth quarter.","In the U.S., store-brand infant formula's volume share is now 11.6%, with growth of 60 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points sequentially since fiscal Q3. We continue to gain share despite flat to declining birth rates and continue to receive positive feedback from retailers on our plastic SmarTub containers. We're now shipping approximately 80% of the SKUs of the product to 100% of our U.S. customers.","Infant formula sales to China were not in line with our expectations for the quarter, nor were we near our stated goal for the fiscal year as we have continued to work through an extremely dynamic regulatory environment. The team is working very hard though to keep apace of the requirements and maintain product flow. Volumes within the VMS category were strong this quarter as previously announced sales into 2 specific retailers continue to be productive.","Adjusted gross margin for the segment decreased 90 basis points year-over-year to 28.9% due to increased cost associated with manufacturing the plastic tub and weaker product mix between our higher-margin infant formula and relatively lower-margin toddler foods and VMS products. I'm pleased to note that steps previously outlined to increase margins have made an impact. The adjusted operating margins increased 150 basis points year-over-year to 16.4%, its highest level since the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and a 570-basis-point increase from last quarter. Again, great job by the Nutritionals team working on margin recovery in the segment.","On Slide 14, you can see that our Rx business continues its robust performance as net sales growth was driven by $16 million related to the Rosemont and Fera acquisitions, new product sales of $12 million and strong base business gains of $10 million. Adjusted gross and operating margin expansion continued, increasing 440 and 380 basis points respectively. While the margin contributions from Rosemont and Fera were higher than our Rx-based business, I'm pleased to note that even excluding the impacts from these acquisitions, adjusted gross and operating margins expanded, highlighting continued strength of our existing base business.","Now I'd like to focus on the operating results for the API segment and explain the changes you see on Slide 15. We've had a long-standing commercial agreement with a specific customer to supply API for a generic product which was launched in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2012. As expected, and as a result of the 180-day exclusivity period, adjusted gross and operating profit and margins in the fourth fiscal quarter were negatively impacted year-over-year. However, the team continues its expense management and, of course, we're excited about this Monday's U.S. launch of generic temozolomide, which will be part of the fiscal 2014 guidance I'll walk through in just a moment.","The consolidated effective adjusted tax rate for both this quarter and the full year was 28.3%, in line with our expectations. Were you to remove the tax benefits earned in the fiscal first quarter, our fiscal 2013 adjusted tax rate, which is derived primarily from jurisdictional blend of earnings before tax, would have been squarely within our initial guidance range of 29% to 31%.","Now I'd like to turn your attention to Slide 16 to discuss fiscal 2014 guidance for the company and by individual segment. While there will be many exciting things to talk about the next weeks and months with respect to our recently announced Elan transaction, I want to focus your attention this morning to our core Perrigo business and our continuing solid growth. So once again, I'll note that these are standalone Perrigo-only numbers without any impact from Elan.","So in Consumer Healthcare, we anticipate store brands will continue to be important contributors for growth of our retail customers and, as is our standard practice, our plan includes the assumption that store brand market share will grow approximately 100 basis points over last year. We expect to launch more than 25 new products in CHC, led by the full year contribution of our launched 600-milligram extended release Guaifenesin product, plus the expected launches of the broader family of Mucinex-equivalent products in the back half of the fiscal year. Our guidance also includes the expected launch of store-brand versions of Frontline Top Spot before the next flea and tick season as we are actively selling the store-brand animal health program concept and receiving very positive feedback from our customers. So we expect the animal health category to generate sales of approximately $200 million in fiscal 2014.","Balanced against these presumptions, the CHC segment's year-over-year revenue growth range also reflects the impact of the continued return to market of a large, branded analgesics competitor and our assumption that this should continue going forward, in line with the competitor's recent public statements. A reduction in our contract manufacturing business is also built into fiscal 2014 guidance. And as always, I'd like to remind you that our annual planning this year follows the same assumptions we have used in the past with respect to the cough\/cold\/flu and allergy seasons.","In our Nutritionals segment, our revenue guidance includes the assumption that by the end of fiscal 2014, we will grow infant formula store-brand market share and will increase our international presence. This revenue guidance also includes growth greater than 10% in our VMS category, as we continue to expand distribution and launch several new products. For Rx, we anticipate top-line growth driven by new products and recent acquisitions, combined with net price stability in the overall portfolio of existing products. Adjusted margin improvements are expected to be derived from these same factors.","Next, API. As we have already noted a few times on this call, on Monday, our partner, Teva, launched the U.S. generic of temozolomide, a brain cancer compound, using our API. This brand today has U.S. sales of approximately $400 million. We anticipate in our fiscal 2014 plan that sales from this product will be recognized starting in our fiscal fourth quarter -- first quarter, that we will have 180-day exclusivity through mid-February, but that we will be competing with an AG in the market on day one.","While we're very excited about the launch of this important product, our net sales guidance range also reflects the headwind impact pricing pressure in our existing product portfolio that has affected this segment in the fourth quarter. So this guidance reflects the expectation of only limited new product launches beyond temozolomide and natural competitive dynamics on the rest of our existing product portfolio. Over the longer term, you should expect third-party API revenues to begin to decrease while, at the same time, we will be ramping up intercompany sales to Consumer Healthcare and Rx.","Now looking to our consolidated projections on Slide 17. For fiscal 2014, we estimate adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $6.35 and $6.60, an increase of 13% to 18% compared to fiscal 2013's $5.61. The improvement reflected in the earnings guidance includes an $0.08 benefit of a discrete tax audit resolution in fiscal 2013. Were you to remove these $0.08 of tax benefits earned in fiscal 2013, the 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share would be projected to increase 15% to 19% year-over-year.","Summing everything back up at the standalone consolidated Perrigo P&L, we estimate net sales growth will be between 12% and 16% compared to fiscal 2013 and assume new product sales of greater than $190 million, as well as continued growth in our base business. After you roll up the individual business units, you should also include in your model corporate unallocated expenses of approximately $70 million and interest expense of approximately $85 million. Please note that this interest number reflects the full year impact of our $600 million bond offering from May 2013.","Also, please note that we're estimating an adjusted worldwide effective tax rate of approximately 30% to 32% for fiscal 2014, excluding any impacts from the resolution of tax examinations and other statute expirations. This rate takes into consideration the recently announced increase of the Israeli statutory tax rate to 26.5% from 25%, as well as an increase in the rate applicable at so-called privileged enterprise zones from 7% up to 9%. Both of these changes will be effective for the entirety of fiscal 2014. Again, I remind you that this guidance does not take into consideration any tax or interest impacts anticipated by changes in our capital structure following the expected closing of the Elan transaction.","As you model the year, please note that our earnings are anticipated to be heavily weighted to the second half of the fiscal year, with many of our new products expected to launch after January. Also, the seasonality in the flea and tick products add to the weight in the fiscal fourth quarter as we plan to launch our broader store-brand offering time for next season.","So in summary, we've concluded another record year, which not only saw continued operational excellence progress, but also forward momentum on our stated strategic plans. We made a number of exciting acquisitions in fiscal 2013, launched more than 60 new products, introduced improved SmarTubs in infant formula and broke ground on several important new manufacturing capacity expansion projects. The recently announced planned acquisition of Elan provides us with a great platform to continue growing both domestically, as well as internationally. While we certainly have a very full to-do list at the moment, the buzz of energy in our office is palpable. Very few companies can boast the kind of history as well as future that Perrigo can. With so many avenues of opportunity in front of us, these are certainly exciting times for us all.","And let me turn it back to Joe","Joseph C. Papa","Thank you, Judy. Now I want to just talk about some of the highlights in our standalone business going forward, beginning with Slide #18. First, let's look at the big picture. We expect the same 3-key growth drivers. Number one, the market continues to shift to store-brand offerings from national brand. Number two, Rx-to-OTC switches are expected to continue, with $10 billion in branded Rx sales likely to switch in the next 5 years, with over $5 billion of that expected in the next 3 years, emphasizing the attractive growth opportunities. We have all seen new categories making the switch, like overactive bladder or the projected-to-switch like nasal inhalers, which recently received a favorable ruling at the FDA advisory meeting. And number three, we expect continued strength in new product launches.","The store-brand version of Mucinex launch went very well, and we look forward to the upcoming cough\/cold season over the coming months. Additionally, the new product pipeline for fiscal 2014 looks robust. It's highlighted by the expected launches of store-brand versions of children's Delsym, Claritin products, with $135 million in combined branded sales. We anticipate launching over 75 new products across all segments, contributing greater than $190 million in revenue for the coming fiscal year.","In our Animal Health business, we are pleased to announce that we have begun shipping our store-brand version of Frontline to a limited number of customers. We expect additional launches in time for the flea and tick season next spring.","Turning to Slide #19, you can see that our Nutritionals business has numerous growth drivers in the coming years. A key highlight here is the introduction of the upgraded national brand-style packaging to SmarTub, or the plastic container, which has been very well received by both the retailers and consumers. In fact, the most recent market IRI data demonstrates the impact the new plastic container is having on our U.S. retail business just in the past 12 weeks. Our dollar volume share is up 5.5% versus the fourth quarter last year, and all signs are showing continuing growing momentum as the 4-week data is even stronger.","Moving on to our growth opportunities in the Rx segment. On Slide 20, you can see that we continue to be very well positioned. In late July, we launched the generic version of Cutivate, which is approximately $19 million in annual branded sales, and just this week, we received final approval from the FDA for the generic equivalents to Derma-Smoothe Scalp and Derma-Smoothe Body Oil with combined brand sales of $25 million. We expect to begin shipments of both of those products in the next month.","We have a robust pipeline of 34 ANDAs pending FDA approval, representing approximately $5 billion in branded sales. This includes 7 confirmed first-to-file ANDAs. Additionally, we have 5 ongoing Paragraph IV challenges. There are more than 8 products that we expect to launch in the coming fiscal year with an anticipated branded sales opportunity of more than $600 million.","Additionally, on Slide 21, we have a healthy leadership position across multiple technologies. We have the only FDA-approved generic topical foams, and we will have a full year of contributions from our acquisitions in fiscal year '13, including Rosemont with oral liquid and Fera adding ophthalmic technology to our portfolio.","In our API business segment, we are very excited about this week's recent U.S. launch of generic temozolomide, which is a meaningful product to our portfolio with a first-to-file exclusivity. Happily, the launch is going well, and I want to offer my congratulations to the team for bringing this very valuable and essential product to the market.","In conclusion, as you can see on Slide #22, Perrigo is poised for continued strong growth. Standalone Perrigo is expected to grow adjusted earnings per share by 13% to 18% this coming year over last year's record performance. The business remains strong, and as we look forward to closing the acquisition of Elan by the end of the calendar year, we will have an even stronger platform for future growth as we continue to execute on our mission of making quality, affordable healthcare, more valuable for consumers and for our customers.","Operator, let's now open up the call for questions.","Arthur J. Shannon","I'd like to remind everyone too to please try to keep it to one question. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Elliot Wilbur with Needham & Company.","Elliot Wilbur - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I know you guys have gone to great lengths to highlight or talk about the organic growth opportunities and potential of the business. But I guess what I'm having a little bit of difficulty with, and I think others as well, is if we think about the string of acquisitions over the past year and just sort of simplistically take what you've talked about in terms of either the fiscal '14 EPS accretion or the first year accretive benefit of these deals and think about products like temozolomide, and add that up and add it to what you reported for fiscal '13, we seem to come up with a lot higher number than even the top end of your current year guidance. So I don't know if that's just an inappropriate exercise to undertake or there's just some things in terms of -- some maybe short-term adjustments in the underlying business such as the return of J&J in the OTC market and stuff that maybe are putting a little bit more short-term pressure on those segments to offset all the acquisition effects and just the underlying organic growth here. So maybe, once again, just kind of hit on what should we be thinking about in terms of core underlying organic growth on -- especially on the operating income line.","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Well, let me start, but I'm going to turn it quickly over to Judy for the commentary on that question. I think first and foremost, you're right. All the same key drivers exist in terms of the movement from national brand to store brand, the Rx-to-OTC and then clearly, new products are all still part of what we think is core to our organic growth driver strategy. So all those components still exists. However, there are some things that we've tried to build into the numbers. And Judy, why don't you kind of go through that in more detail, specific to the other part of Elliot's questions in terms of some of the specifics?","Judy L. Brown","Let me -- Elliott, maybe the way to do this is just to break it down very simply in how we think about rolling forward year-over-year. Obviously, we just said we finished up fiscal '13 adjusted EPS of $5.61. This is all on a standalone basis, of course. When you just think about the midpoint of the guidance range that we just provided, you're looking at 16% year-over-year growth. So right off the bat, I talked about the effective tax rate goes up because the Israeli rates went up, there's movement in the jurisdictional rates that we always report on in a heavily U.S. business, and increased interest expense just picking up 11 additional months year-over-year on a $600 million bond. So if you just take those 2 components right off the bat, you got a 7% headwind. So if you think about it, 16% total growth, there's a negative 7% right in there, so you're now looking at 23% year-over-year growth, right? That can be broken down more or less, half-and-half, to think about acquisition contribution bottom line, giving all the numbers that we've already provided at the time of the various announcements over the course of the year last year. So you've got contribution from M&A and you still have -- even after that, you're looking at a number in excess of 10%, 11% of organic growth. So the businesses we have -- we had at the beginning of fiscal '13, still growing around 10% year-over-year. And if you were to break down, on Slide 16 in the materials, and you look at the guidance that we're providing in terms of operating margin expansion business unit by business unit, sales growth business unit by business unit, you know where the M&A happens. And we're still at or beyond the ranges that we've always given in the 3-year compound annual growth. So we feel really good that the guidance reflects the combination of organic growth, the strength of these new products coming through, but still taking in the fact that the reality of interest and tax is weighing against us as we begin the year. And we would be remiss if we didn't include those. So if you put that in your updated model, you may say, \"All right. Actually, they're much better in line than I had anticipated.\" Hope that helps.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to just ask for a little bit more color, please, on the new product launches that really matter over the next year. So I'm just hoping that you could really discuss 3 areas. First, on Mucinex, I understand that the 600-milligram dose represented about $150 million of a $600-million Mucinex-branded franchise. How much of the other $450 million are you targeting in this fiscal year? I think you had said you're going to be launching more lines within that franchise in the second half. The second part of the question relates to the de-formulations of allergy products. Where do those stand in terms of launches ahead? I know that some had been delayed previously, but which ones should we expect, and when this fiscal year? And then just finally, what are the other big OTC launches we should be thinking about and when in this fiscal year?","Joseph C. Papa","Okay. Maybe I'll just move back just a little bit, David, to kind of the starting place. So we expect to launch over 75 new products in our total portfolio for the business, and we specifically expect those products to contribute over $190 million of sales for the total portfolio. So a large number of products clearly are part of our projection for the future. As you get to, though, the specificity that you're asking me -- that you're absolutely on target, the Mucinex 600-milligram extended release, we'll get a full year effect of that. And more importantly, we get the cough\/cold\/flu season and being in that business during that important part of the season. So that will happen. In addition, we do our planning for additional members of the Mucinex family of products that we expect during the year, but we would caution -- or I caution you that -- Judy was talking about some of those being later in the fiscal year. So we don't have a specific date that we want to put forth at this time, in that, that is a partnered product. But I would be thinking later in the year for that particular product. On the fexo, I think you were -- you asked about the D products, but I believe you meant the fexo D 12-type product. That is a partnered product. And at this time, with our visibility not being complete on that product, I just want to put that product -- it's certainly an important product, but I do not want to put that product -- a specific date on the table for that product at this time. In addition, I think you asked about the other Consumer Healthcare products. There is a host of other products. As Judy mentioned, I think the number, Judy, you mentioned was 30-something, more than 30-something products. Many of them are smaller individual products, to be clear, but they all contribute to our -- putting one more item on the truck as we ship our products to all of our large retailers, and they clearly will continue to add to our operating margin for our business. The final other big product that I wanted to just mention to you in the Consumer Healthcare was the Claritin product that we talked about, a Claritin 24-hour liquigel-type product that we expect to launch. And also, we will launch a store-brand version of the Delsym liquid suspension for pediatrics. So those are the other ones that are probably the ones I could mention at this time. But the other important point is to clearly state that the magnitude of the products are significant numbers of products and will result in that large number of over $190 million of new product sales that we expect in the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Ariel Herman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This Ariel Herman in for Jami. I just wanted to dive a little bit deeper, I guess, into the Consumer Healthcare. If we strip out the animal health sales of Sergeant's and Velcera, we're getting about a 2.5% organic growth rate. So I guess our question is that's a little bit below your mid -- or high-single digit guidance for organic growth rate. So how are you kind of thinking about the organic growth rate? And then just separately, were there any surprises with the pet care business?","Judy L. Brown","Maybe I'll take the Consumer Healthcare growth rate. As I look -- obviously, I have more detail than you do in front of me, but if I think about our planning for next year and take out Animal Health, to the comment earlier to Elliott's question, I have the core existing OTC product categories growing squarely in our stated goal of compound annual growth in the 5% to 10% range annually. Obviously, that includes solid base, the normal cycling out, discontinuing of some smaller products, but offset by the reload of the new products that Joe was just talking about. So again, it's going to come down to how much weight you place in your Consumer Healthcare new products contribution, even excluding the Animal Health piece.","Joseph C. Papa","And the only thing I would add to the second part of your question on, I think it was specifically, the words were \"surprises on pet care,\" I would say there was no real surprises on pet care. We're delighted with our quarter 4 performance. Was there some delays in -- we did ship our first store-brand flea and tick product. There is more coming. So in that sense, we're delighted with that. Were some of the regulatory hurdles to get the new labeling confirmed there? The answer to that is yes. That is clear. But as we look to the future, we still see some very significant opportunities for our flea and tick products that have come out, both Sergeant's and Velcera acquisitions.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Buck with Buckingham Research.","James B. Dawson - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","It's Jim Dawson for David Buck. In fiscal '13, you talked about some deals you had done, Fera, Velcera, Rosemont, Sergeant's. And you had given an accretion number for fiscal '14, 12 for Fera, 11 for Velcera, 24 for Rosemont and about 20 for Sergeant's. Do those accretion numbers still apply for fiscal '14?","Judy L. Brown","Yes.","Joseph C. Papa","Yes, the only thing I want to -- yes is the answer. Absolutely correct. Realize that some of those also occurred during the numbers, which we had some Cobrek, Rosemont, Fera sales during the year, so I want to just be careful that it's not -- you got to look at the delta or the difference between years. But Judy's comment is absolutely correct.","Judy L. Brown","At the time of each transaction, we tried to give you color on what it was going to contribute to the fiscal year that just ended. And also, in most of those announcements, it was the contribution expected for the first 12 months, i.e., spilling in, in almost every case, spilling into fiscal '14. So those numbers, as stated in those releases with that forward projection, as well as the revenue expectations from those combined activities over the course of those announcements, also applies.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ami Fadia with UBS.","Ami Fadia - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I had 3 quick questions. Firstly, on pet care, I think I heard Judy mention that she's assumed $200 million for fiscal 2014? That seems -- is that correct?","Judy L. Brown","That's what we had said at the time of the announcement. Yes. And it just [indiscernible] exactly. Yes.","Ami Fadia - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is that what you assumed for the guidance? Because that seems to imply very little growth, considering you're launching a store brand.","Joseph C. Papa","Yes. I think -- let me just maybe try to put it in perspective. When we came out with it, we talked about the combination of the Sergeant's and the Velcera as being a $200-million business, which is, I think, exactly what Judy said. Is there an opportunity to grow that business? We said it would be high-single digits prior to the launch of our store brand. But as we launched the total store-brand offerings, it could shift to double digits. And I think that continues to be exactly what we're suggesting. Is there a little bit up and down on that particular one, the answer is yes, but that is -- the ballpark number that we expect is approximately that $200 million level that we talked about.","Judy L. Brown","And I made a specific comment, approximately $200 million as a starting point, because we are, as I commented also, rolling out our broader store-brand portfolio launch in that business for the next flea and tick season. While we do anticipate growth, we wanted to be appropriately conservative given that the timing of each of those launches is obviously in a weighted-average basket like we do with any other kind of new product launch.","Ami Fadia - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. So maybe just the 2 other quick questions. On Nutritionals, could you elaborate a little bit about -- around the growth assumptions in the business that gets you to that 8% to 12%? And then lastly, just if you could split the $190 million of new product launches across the segments?","Joseph C. Papa","Okay. I'm going to answer the last one first, but we're not going to break out the more than $190 million by specific segments. We do want to -- because there's no other -- there's no specific one large product that we would point out. It really is looking at the totality of our business. As I said, it's more than $190 million, and it's more than 75 products. But we're not going to -- we don't break it out specifically to segment 1 versus segment 2. On the question of nutrition and the growth factors, I'll just mention quickly that obviously, the important one is the plastic container and the growth from that. But, Judy, why don't you give a little more details on the totality of our Nutritionals?","Judy L. Brown","Yes. So Nutritionals as a segment and the guidance on Page 16 in in the slide, is less money than the other 2 big segments because there weren't any acquisitions there in the year. We've got the vitamins and minerals buckets and the infant formula and related products buckets as well. We guided to 8% to 12% top-line growth in total, and suffice it to say that both of those component categories within the segment are expected to grow right now around the midpoint of that range. So it's coming from both categories continuing to grow for the reasons outlined in the earlier comments.","Operator","Your next question comes from Annabel Samimy with Stifel.","Joshua Riegelhaupt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","This is Josh Riegelhaupt in for Annabel. I was hoping you could comment a little bit on your international expansion strategy? Just curious if it's more consumer related, generic related or any other related product segment, and how you kind of plan to drive this with acquisitions as well?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Well, obviously, the first and foremost comment I would make is that we've got a couple of noteworthy comments. First, number one, is our Elan acquisition we think helps set us up or enable us to even be more effective than our international growth strategy. It also, to be fair, enables us for any M&A opportunity will enable us for. So -- whether it be the adjacent categories or international. But the Elan acquisition probably would be first and form with our commentary in terms of being an enabler for our M&A strategy. As it gets back to the specifics of the international strategy, that becomes very similar to what we've been stating for the past 4, 5 years now. What we simply are seeking to do is take some of the products that we have today, the actual formulation we have today in the United States; bring those product formulations into Europe as an example; get them through the regulatory process, which we've been well underway with that; and then to bring those formulations into -- mostly through partners and other activities that we have to bring those products into Europe. In addition, in the Asia situation, we believe there's a wonderful opportunity for us with our infant formula and our nutritional products in Asia. Clearly, that's where we see the growth in the world's occurring is in Asia in terms of new -- the birthrate in Asia. So we think there's good opportunity in our Nutritionals business in Asia with what we are seeking to do to gain incremental distribution throughout Asia.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Gilbert with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question is about the accretion comments you made. And if you can't answer that, I have a backup. So the -- hoping you can offer preliminary amortization, tax rate and operating expense assumptions that are embedded in those comments for '14 and '15?","Judy L. Brown","With respect to the transaction?","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. Yes. Specific to the accretion comments that you got approval to make.","Judy L. Brown","Oh, Greg. So I'm going to give you the answer, which is at this stage, on this call this morning, I am not, in fact, at liberty to provide that. While I would love to because you can be sure I have a yellow page where I could talk about it, it is -- as part of the process under the Irish Takeover Rules, we won't be able to walk that through. But suffice it to say that the modeling that gives you the components of our expectations as we went through the process will be available to everyone at the same time when the S-4 is published. We expect that to be end of this month, very beginning of September. And then you'll be able to see the analyses that were done in the process of the acquisition by the bank. So that will allow everyone to have that at the same time, and you'll see our presumptions in that process.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So my backup question then is can you quantify how much you benefited this past year from the J&J and Novartis disruptions? Because that's -- there was a lot of time spent discussing that in the past. How much did you actually benefit? And then how much did you dial in, in terms of a reversal of that amount for fiscal '14?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Well, Greg, I don't know if we're going to give you exactly the detail you want, but we'll -- I'll certainly give you my best shot here relative to what it is. And I think as we stated in the past in terms of J&J, it was a $100-million opportunity relative to the store-brand private label opportunity for J&J as a result of their absence from the market. The first year, we did in that $50-million range, so we were somewhat constrained by our ability to make the pediatric liquids. In the second year, we added incremental capacity. However, the season was a very limited. In our third year, we've stated it's in that $50 million to $75 million range in terms of what we were picking up for pediatric analgesic sales, and that was really the primary growth driver for us in the world of what we were trying to do. As we are modeling our fiscal year '14, what we've assumed is that for the commentary of J&J, they would be back in -- they are back in now, and they would be back in with additional products by December of 2013 or are -- the end of calendar year. We have expectations that we will keep approximately 50% of the incremental value that we picked up. The data that we have in terms of talking to consumers to just -- the attitudinal data is a little higher than that, but we felt to be conservative, it would be best to assume that we'd only keep that 50%. As to relate to the second player that has had problems, I think you also asked about Novartis, if I recall the question, you -- they have returned. They started their return in October of 2012, and they certainly have accelerated their return starting in that February, March time frame. They accelerated the return of the Excedrin product. Our expectation is that they will be -- they are back and will be back at their normal levels. So there will be some -- to be candid, that's what we saw in the -- our fourth quarter of fiscal year '13, we saw some return to them, and that's what Judy had mentioned.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Steinberg with Deutsche Bank.","David M. Steinberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Three quick questions. First, on Proair, it seems like a pretty significant opportunity for you with sales over $400 million. Teva just put together its citizens' petition requiring a dose counter. And I was just curious whether you believe your ANDA will also need this dose counter. And if so, how comfortable are you with your current ANDA?","Joseph C. Papa","Okay. I'll take that one. Relative to Proair, I absolutely agree with you. We think it's a great opportunity. The product itself, the Albuterol in the metered dose inhaler, has been around for many tens of years. So it's not a raw material or specifically a chemical patent. There is a formulation, some formulation work that they have done. We feel very good, though, that our product that we have put forth to the FDA is an approvable product, and we also like our IP position. I clearly think Teva is a very smart company, and they'll make a lot of decisions along the way. But we like our position relative to both our formulation, as well as our intellectual property position, and that includes all the citizen petitions that they could potentially put forth. We like our position. There always is a question of timing on this issue because any intellectual property and getting through that process takes time, but we like our end position for Proair.","David M. Steinberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on operating margins. So in the last 4 or 5 years, you've shown significant improvement, well over 100 basis points on average. Just curious whether a reasonable proxy going forward is about 100 bps over the next couple years?","Joseph C. Papa","Well, first of all, David, thank you very much for noticing. We do think that's an important contribution that we've been able to do in terms of looking at our success in operating margin. I think -- we've been often asked this question in terms of 100 basis points a year, something like that. Is that a reasonable number? And I guess I go back to the fact that going back, if you look back 6, 7 years ago, the numbers had moved from high-single digits up to the latest number in terms of what we've accomplished being somewhere close to that 23% level. Do I think, though, as we look to the future and as outlined by Judy's guidance, that 100 basis points per year is a reasonable one? Certainly, I would say yes for next year, but I don't want anyone to get too far advanced in terms of driving that number, 100 basis points a year for every year for the next 5 years, because I do think as you get greater numbers, it goes more challenging. So as Judy talked about for next year, that's why we put our range in that 23% to 25% adjusted operating margin. As you go out numerous years, though, I'd be cautious on that until -- it is a very challenging prospect to do that. Judy, you want to make any more comments?","Judy L. Brown","David, frankly, with an S-4 coming out in a couple weeks, you'll have the ability to get a little bit of a perspective on how we modeled the next several years on a standalone basis anyway.","David M. Steinberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then one final quick question. So Elan brings you a number of benefits, some of which you can talk about, some you can't, but they also bring you a fiscal year ending December. And just curious whether you could consider changing to a December fiscal year, make it a lot easier for us. And most other companies in the sector of course report in December as well.","Joseph C. Papa","I think that's a great question, David. And I think Judy should answer that question because it's one that we've had some numerous discussions on.","Judy L. Brown","That's really mean to do to me at the end of this fiscal year when performance review is coming up, David. No, that's a great question because it is also challenging to always be in the fiscal versus the December year end. We are taking it under advisement. There are a lot of activities going on right now. Obviously, with the other required filings, preparing for a transaction close, doing our post -- our integration planning to get ready for day one of being a combined company. So we hear you loud and clear. I know the finance team would really like to have summers free. So with that said, I can't tell you that, that's going to happen in the next 6 months, but it is certainly being taken under advisement for the medium term.","Operator","Your next question comes from Louise Chen with Guggenheim.","Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So I basically was curious. Are you still thinking that mid-teens EPS growth or a range thereof on that factor is something that you're thinking about for the foreseeable future, I guess? Because if I take sort of the midpoint of the range of what you have given for guidance in 2014, and then you assume a mid-teens growth on top of that and then you add on the Elan accretion, obviously, it comes out meaningfully higher than what's in consensus for '15. So just kind of curious, your thinking on that. And then just more on Elan, I don't know if you can answer this but I'll ask anyhow. On the tax rate, I know there are some thoughts that it could go below mid-teens over time. Just curious how low that could go. Is 10% to 20% something that's reasonable -- 10% or so -- 10% to 12% something reasonable over the longer term? Or is that just too low?","Joseph C. Papa","Right. You've asked good questions, but very challenging for us to answer at this point in what we say. The only thing I think I could really go back to on the first part of the question, and then, Judy, maybe you could take the tax rate question. What I can go back to on the first part of the question is that what we have stated publicly in terms of our plan is to seek to, over any 3-year period, to grow our business in that 5% to 10% range from an organic point of view. So that -- I think you -- that's really where the basis for your comment came, growing to 5% to 10% on the revenue top line point of view and then seek to double that on the operating income line and on the EPS line, depending obviously on any individual tax changes, of course. But that really is what we've stated. That probably is the best I can do to answer that for future years because I can't obviously make any comments beyond what we're suggesting right now in our 2014 guidance. Judy, the second part of Louise's question was tax. [indiscernible] that?","Judy L. Brown","Yes. And just the last color on Joe's comment of that modeling that Joe just said, 5% to 10% top line, 10% to 20% bottom line growth is that compound annual growth that we strive for. We've been layering in acquisitions each year. Now coming to your Elan-specific comment, you did say in your question mid-teens? And I just want to correct that in the announcements related to the acquisition, we said high teens in the first 12 months after acquisition. So just clarifying the point there. And in terms of where the tax rate can go beyond the date of close, I'm really not at liberty to get into forward-looking profit forecast. But just again, going back to the time of the announcement, as with anything related to taxes, jurisdictional mix is always key, and it will be dependent on our ability to continue as a company to grow internationally and take advantage of jurisdictional spread between other countries where the tax rate relatively is low.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jason Gerberry with Leerink Swan.","Christopher W. Kuehnle - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","It's actually Chris Kuehnle in for Jason. Two quick ones. With respect to infant formula, could you maybe provide a little more color on some of the challenges that you're facing in China and when you might envision sales materially increasing beyond I think the previously disclosed figure of tens of millions? And then just a follow-up on the $34-million decline in GI and analgesic, could you give me a sense of the weighting? How much of that is accounted for by the return of a competitor to market maybe versus some of the other factors?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. I'll start with the China question. So first comment on China is there is significant demand for infant formula, product made in the United States or outside of China by the consumers in China. There's been some issues of product that have been made in New Zealand or some active ingredient from New Zealand, other things that have come up. So the demand for our product, which is made in the U.S. of U.S.-sourced raw materials, and specifically the whey protein that we use, is very significant. However, having said that, the regulatory challenges that have been instituted in China also are significant. And I'm very confident that my team will continue to work very hard to work through those regulatory challenges in the China marketplace. So and they deal with labeling questions. They don't deal with the product themselves. Our products are approved in China. It is simply they have amended some labeling claims and labeling information, and the team is working very diligently to get through that. We still think there is a tremendous growth there, to be clear, relative to the demand side, but we are working through the labeling and registration issues that are there. We have worked through the majority of them at this time. However, I can't say that there will not be any incremental labeling questions, and I think those are really specific in what some of the comments that you had. On the second part of your question, on GI, Judy?","Judy L. Brown","Yes. Chris, why don't I grab the $34-million question? So earlier, I made that note that, that decline was, again, relative year-over-year, and it's primarily GI and analgesics. On the GI front, it's again a relative year-over-year driver of the Prevacid equivalent product. Remember, launching last time -- this time last year, you got your shelf stocking, your channel fill, et cetera, et cetera. So year-over-year, you see a decline there. On the analgesics side, I made the comment it's 3 pieces. You got one large retailer, switching advertising focus from store to national. You've got a large analgesic manufacturer competitor who had been less active, being now more active relatively year-over-year. And to your point, yet another competitor, more active at this time this year than they were last year. So you've got a couple moving parts there all combining, and that specifically defined GI and analgesics bucket as a decline.","Christopher W. Kuehnle - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Great. And would you -- of those factors, would you attribute more to that return of competition or maybe more to the focus on the national brand side?","Judy L. Brown","Again, when you've got so many variables, I wouldn't -- if you were trying to simplify, you'd probably weight them evenly. I couldn't say that one is supremely heavier than the other.","Operator","And your final question is from Linda Bolton-Weiser with B. Riley.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","So of the greater than $190 million of new product revenue for FY '14, I'm kind of thinking that the Temodar API is about 1\/4 of that. Would that be correct to think about it that way? And are you including that in Rx segment or API segment for the next year? And then secondly, on the over-the-counter business, Prestige Brands, which does branded over-the-counter, they do like PediaCare, they reported in their June quarter that they were already feeling the impact of J&J's return because the retailers are resetting the planogram and the shipments in as J&J gains back shelf space affected them already. So I'm just kind of wondering -- because I thought you said more of the impact would be in the second half of your fiscal year. So I'm just curious, the difference between you and them and that. And then also, I didn't hear you talk about an assumption of normal cough\/cold season versus a strong season last year, so I'm assuming you've taken that into guidance, but just wanted to double check on that?","Joseph C. Papa","All right. Go ahead, Judy. Why don't you take the...","Judy L. Brown","I'm dying to jump in. I'm going to go backwards. Number one, I didn't want to just keep talking and talking and talking on the prepared remarks, but suffice it to say, our planning for this year's cough\/cold\/flu and allergy season is in fact modeled in our plan precisely the way we've always done it. We take the last 10 years' seasons. We look at the timing and the incidence. We average them, and that's how we build our model. That has not changed, that is still how we go ahead and do our modeling. So that's consistent.","Joseph C. Papa","The next one was -- or the first one was about that Temodar, the sales number for that. We don't give out individual numbers, Linda. But to be clear, it is being reported in the API segment. That is the way we report it. I think your number is a little bit high in terms of the percentage, in terms of saying 25%. But I guess it's -- right now, the important comment I'd offer on Temodar that needs to be stated is that we're very excited about the opportunity, to be clear. However, it is -- we have 180-day exclusivity. However, there is an AG in the marketplace, and I think it's very early for us to get too excited about the opportunity for temozolomide. So I think, right now, we're just trying to put it in at a number that is a reasonable number, and then we'll look to see what happens for Temodar going into the future. And then the final part...","Judy L. Brown","J&J's return to market.","Joseph C. Papa","J&J's return, Judy.","Judy L. Brown","The last answer that I just gave to Chris was commenting that in the fiscal fourth quarter relative to the fiscal fourth quarter in the previous fiscal year, part of the dynamic we were seeing in the analgesic category was in fact due to the effect of 2 large branded competitors returning to the marketplace. We are already seeing that, and that was the answer to Q4. We have modeled in our numbers that, that continues and that they continue to return to the market apace of what they have said in their public statements, and that's why my comments earlier were that our model for FY -- fiscal '14 is built on them returning. And then they'll be, in theory, per their statements, \"fully back\" in the year starting January. So we are seeing that impact already.","Joseph C. Papa","Thank you. Let me just close the call. Thank you very much for your interest in Perrigo, and we look forward to providing additional information in November. And thank you for keeping -- and we'll try to keep you updated on our acquisition of Elan. Thank you all for joining us today.

Please refer to the important information for investors and shareholders and safe harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued this morning and on Slide 2 in the accompanying investor presentation.","Following management's review of the presentation, we will open up the call for questions from the audience. I'd like to now turn the call over to Perrigo's Chairman and CEO, Joe Papa. Joe?","Joseph C. Papa","Thank you, Art, and welcome, everyone, for Perrigo's conference call to discuss our quarter 1 fiscal year '15 results and, importantly, our announcement of the combination of 2 great companies, Perrigo and Omega, creating a top 5 global over-the-counter company. Joining me on the call today is Judy Brown, Perrigo's Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, I'd like to take the opportunity to provide you a brief overview of our exciting news, followed by comments regarding the first fiscal quarter. Then I'll turn the call over to Judy to discuss the first quarter highlights. I will then provide the strategic details of the transaction as well as an introduction of Omega. Finally, Judy will walk through some of the financial details of the transaction before we open up the call for questions.","First, beyond the results we announced today, this is really a great day for both of our companies, our employees, patients, customers and shareholders. Today, we announced that Perrigo and Omega have entered into a definitive agreement under which Perrigo has agreed to acquire Omega for EUR 3.6 billion or USD 4.5 billion through a combination of cash and stock. This purchase price comprises of EUR 2.48 billion to acquire Omega's equity in addition to the assumption of EUR 1.1 billion of debt.","We welcome a great company that Marc Coucke and his team have built, an organization that is built by pharmacists and for pharmacists. One of the real keys to this transaction is the immediate scale and broadened footprint this combination provides. Omega instantly enhances our scale and broadens our footprint, providing us with immediate access to an established commercial network connected to 211,000 pharmacists, 105,000 retail stores and 3,900 parapharmacies. We will now be able to participate in the attractive $30 billion European OTC market, leveraging Omega\u2019s commercial infrastructure and leading OTC product portfolio to generate consistent growth, as Omega has done since its founding in 1987. We are excited to welcome this great company and all of its employees to the Perrigo family.","We will discuss the acquisition in much more detail, but let's review some of the highlights for the quarter.","On Slide 4, our quarterly performance, highlighted by all-time record first quarter net sales of $952 million, and continued adjusted net income and adjusted operating margin expansion.","Moving on to Slide 5. As we discussed in our August earnings call, our fiscal first quarter was, in fact, a challenging comparable versus this time last year. That being said, we still recorded an increase in adjusted net income of 30% to $188 million or $1.40 per diluted share, in line with our expectations. A record $952 million first quarter net sales performance reflected expected lower year-over-year seasonal sales volume and contract sales in our Consumer Healthcare segment and an 11% growth in the infant formula category, offset by disappointing sales in our VMS nutritional category. Our team remains focused on launching over 100 new products in fiscal year '15, the majority of which will be expected to be launched in the second half of the year.","In our Specialty Sciences segment, we have been very pleased with the performance of the Tysabri royalty stream. It's a great asset that's generating terrific cash flow. Also, importantly, I would like to announce that we have relaunched shipments of the store-brand version of generic Mucinex 600mg ER back to the market. This was a difficult task. But with a dedicated team determined to get the product back to the market, we were able to work through the production issues for this very hard-to-develop product. It's great work by the team to relaunch our generic Mucinex.","Now I'll hand the call over to Judy to discuss the quarter in-depth. Judy?","Judy I. Brown","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. As you just heard, the quarter wrapped up generally in line with the expectations that I had discussed on our conference call in August when I tried to provide some conceptual guidance for the first quarter.","Adjusted net income grew 30%, just below our full year guidance range of 31% to 37% growth. And we remain committed to our full year 2015 guidance expectations, given our long list of expected new product launches, particularly from January to June.","Now let's move directly into the business segments starting on Slide 6. The change in Consumer Healthcare net sales was the result of an increase in sales of existing products of $20 million, primarily in the smoking cessation category; $7 million in new product sales; and $6 million attributable to the acquisition of OTC products from Aspen. These combined increases were more than offset by a decline of $78 million in sales of existing products, primarily in the cough\/cold, contract manufacturing and analgesics categories.","I'm sure you'll all like to understand why we saw year-over-year declines in CHC. So let me walk you through the key drivers.","First, as I previously stated, in the first quarter of 2014, we shipped a large amount of OTC product as retailers pushed for an early buy-in to the season. Due to the relatively milder severity of cough\/cold\/flu incidents and lower retail foot traffic levels seen last winter, many of our retail customers remain cautious about repeating that buying pattern this season.","Second. In the second fiscal quarter of 2014, we noticed that a large contract customer resumed production at its own facility, reducing the need for products sourced from Perrigo. While this headwind in our contract manufacturing sales will annualize after next quarter, it nonetheless was a year-over-year negative to CHC sales this fiscal quarter.","Third. While we are excited about the relaunch of the Guaifenesin 600-milligram ER product, the absence of sales last quarter from this specific product impacted revenue for the quarter. On a brighter note, and as discussed last quarter, the smoking cessation category continues to perform well, particularly due to sustained robust sales of the store brand versions of Nicorette mini lozenges with the continued absence of a national brand competitor from shelves at this time.","Adjusted gross margin contracted due to the sales mix dynamic I just mentioned, including relatively lower sales in our Animal Health category. We invested more in CHC R&D projects versus the first quarter last year, and DSG&A dollars spend was relatively lower due to continued cost discipline and relative timing on new product launches. As a result of these investments, adjusted operating margin decreased year-over-year.","On Slide 7, you can see that net sales within the Nutritionals segment were $125 million. Net product sales of $7 million were offset by $6 million in lower year-over-year sales, primarily in the VMS and infant\/toddler food categories. The greatest driver of net sales this quarter was the infant formula category, which grew more than 11%, driven by organic formula and the resumption of shipments to Asia versus this time last year. This positive product mix, along with greater efficiencies at both our infant formula and VMS manufacturing facilities, led to gross margin expansion of 290 basis points. Operating margin included increased investments in new products.","Now turning to Slide 8. You can see that the Rx net sales were $195 million as new product sales of $8 million and $4 million of net sales from the Fera product acquisition were offset by $11 million in discontinued products. As expected, net charges taken to meet contractual obligations associated with pricing programs also impacted net sales. The benefits of these programs are expected to commence in the second fiscal quarter.","Gross margin was impacted by the net charges I just described, while operating margin was impacted by higher clinical costs and continued investment to grow the specialty pharma sales force. We expect these investments to continue to grow due to the Lumara acquisition.","Next on Slide 9, you'll see that API's first quarter net sales were $25 million, due to a decrease in sales of existing products of $18 million as a result of increased competition on certain products. Margins were impacted primarily by the expected loss of U.S. exclusivity on the generic version of temozolomide and lower absorption rates versus this time last year.","Turning to Slide 10. Specialty Sciences revenue were $92 million comprised of Tysabri royalties at 18% for the entire quarter, in line with our internal expectations. I'd also like to note that our corporate administrative costs increased by approximately $10 million. This increase was due primarily to the Elan acquisition and approximately $4 million related to M&A activities.","Now some quick highlights on our balance sheet. Excluding cash and cash equivalents, working capital was $725 million at the end of the quarter, up from $677 million on June 28, 2014, due to timing on payments of accounts payables and accruals.","As of September 27, 2014, total current and long-term debt on the face of the balance sheet was $3.2 billion, essentially flat sequentially from last quarter. Excluding cash and cash equivalents, our net debt-to-total capital at the end of our first quarter fiscal 2014 was 20.9%.","Net cash flow from operations for the first quarter was a record $195 million, up almost $100 million from first quarter fiscal 2014.","On Slide 11, you'll see we're affirming our consolidated stand-alone guidance for fiscal 2015. Stating the obvious, we just signed our agreement with Omega a few hours ago, and it is unclear when the closing will be. So this guidance in no way reflects any impact of the transition. Stand-alone Perrigo numbers only.","So while we are not making any changes to the consolidated stand-alone guidance, as always there are multiple moving parts. The current guidance now takes into consideration the relaunch of Guaifenesin 60 milligram ER as well as improved expectations on certain Rx new product launches. Weighted against these positive factors are increased risk adjustments for the corticosteroid nasal products, approximately 10% lower year-over-year sales in the VMS category and lowered revenue expectations for our API segment. The fine-tuning of these risks and opportunities leads us to the updated segment guidance you see on this slide.","Summing all this information up and as you model our second fiscal quarter 2015, you should continue to assume new product sales of greater than $235 million with approximately 70% of these sales expected in the second half of the fiscal year, as well as continued growth in our base business. This dynamic is expected to produce second quarter fiscal '15 year-over-year adjusted net income growth towards the lower end of the full year fiscal year 31% to 37% guidance range you see here.","Now I'd like to turn the call back to Joe.","Joseph C. Papa","Thank you, Judy. Turning to Slide 12. As I mentioned at the beginning of today's call, today is a great day for both our companies, employees, patients, customers and shareholders. For many years, we have discussed the -- our interest in expanding our business model globally. Last year, we were excited to share with you our Elan transaction, established our Irish headquarters and the European gateway. Today, I'm very excited to say in one transaction, we acquire a comprehensive commercial European infrastructure, a leading portfolio of OTC brands, an extremely talented management team and country-by-country regulatory and consumer marketing expertise, which will -- all combined, will enable us to provide quality health care products to hundreds of millions additional consumers.","First, this transaction expands our leadership position in OTC through Omega\u2019s strong and established commercial infrastructure. Omega further enhances the breadth of our already sizable OTC product portfolio and accelerates the distribution of our combined companies' offerings. In fact, combined, we've become a top 5 global OTC company.","Second, this transaction advances our stated strategy to accelerate international growth, substantially diversify our business and establish a durable leadership position in the European OTC marketplace. Omega immediately enhances our scale and broadens our footprint, establishing the foundation for continued strategic bolt-on acquisitions.","Third, this transaction strengthens our financial profile. It provides us geographic diversification of our revenue and cash flow. As we execute this transaction, we will accelerate our attractive industry-leading growth rate and margin profile. Over the last 12 months ending September 30, the combined company would have generated pro forma revenues of $5.7 billion and adjusted operating income of $1.3 billion.","Turning to Slide 13. I'm going to dive a little deeper into our vision behind this transaction. Before we discuss many of the compelling aspects of the acquisition, let me first take a moment to explain the advantages of Omega\u2019s commercial infrastructure.","At a high level, the European OTC market is highly fragmented but very desirable, a $30 billion market opportunity. Pharmaceutical distribution across these countries collectively represent a very high barrier to entry as a result of the restrictions on pharmacy ownership that makes our Perrigo mass customization more difficult to replicate in Europe.","One of Omega\u2019s key advantages is the relationships that Marc and his team have developed over the years with individual pharmacists and retail locations. As a result, Omega will provide us with access to 211,000 pharmacists, 105,000 retail pharmacies and 3,900 parapharmacies. This platform can't easily be replicated with a piecemeal organic growth.","So this transaction aligned very closely with our strategic M&A priorities that we've discussed with you in the past, which are strategic fit, segment attractiveness, materiality and competitive fit.","You can see on this slide our acquisition of Omega comfortably aligns with all 4 of these priorities.","First, the transaction gives Perrigo access to a top OTC product portfolio and enhanced scale outside the U.S. though Omega's -- through Omega\u2019s significant commercial presence and distribution network across 35 markets internationally. This includes a leadership position in the durable European OTC cash pay market.","Second is the attractiveness of the European OTC market in general. It is a $30 billion market opportunity. With Omega's strong presence in both established and emerging growth economies, we anticipate leveraging their growth track record.","Third, Omega provides us with a strengthened financial profile through the geographically-diversified revenue and cash flow streams.","Finally, there's the competitive fit of Omega within Perrigo. Through the companies' combined geographic diversity and scale, there are opportunities to generate top line synergies by driving products from both companies through complementary U.S. and European commercial channels. Further, with the application of the supply chain excellence across Omega\u2019s footprint, we expect to drive additional efficiency and operational synergies through the combined organizations.","So turning to Slide 14. Here, you can see a brief overview of Omega. Headquartered in Belgium, Omega is a leading OTC company with a significant commercial infrastructure and regulatory capabilities across 35 markets internationally.","Omega is currently led by an experienced European management team with years of experience in the European OTC market and approximately 2,500 employees globally. We are excited to have these employees contribute to Perrigo's continued growth.","Within this employee base, we gained a talented sales team of approximately 1,100 people, a new necessary competence essential for success in Europe.","Turning to Slide 15. You can see the OTC brand leadership position Omega has established within this market. In particular, Omega's approximately $1.6 billion of trailing 12-month revenue as of September 30 positions it as one of the top 5 European OTC companies and the #1 or 2 player in 4 individual European markets. Additionally, the company owns many leading cough and cold, skin care, pain relief, weight management and gastrointestinal treatment brands among a portfolio of approximately 2,000 products.","Slide 16 lists Omega\u2019s top 20 brand portfolio. The important item to note here is the number of products that are #1 within their respective markets. For instance, Omega currently holds the #1 nasal decongestant, the #1 weight management supplement, the #1 head lice treatment and the #1 wart treatment, among others. All these products are just -- not just leading within a particular country but are leading across Europe with many of the market leaders in any individual countries.","When combined with the extensive Perrigo product portfolio, we'll be able to use a number of new line extensions all across Europe.","On Slide 17, you could see additional aspects of the diversification this transaction enables. Omega brings us immediate meaningful exposure to most of the developed and emerging European economies. This acquisition allows us to expand our health care products for over 500 million European OTC cash-pay consumers.","Turning to Slide 18. Here you can see the impact the complementary product and market portfolio has on our ability to drive top line synergies. Between our 2 companies, we will have a broad and compelling product portfolio that we will drive through the companies' global commercial channels.","On the operational side, we are excited by the many opportunities to deliver our world-class supply chain and operational expertise to Omega's existing operations. As you see, we are well on our way to identifying multiple opportunities to leverage our increased scale and drive more volume through our efficient manufacturing base.","I'd now like to turn the call back over to Judy, who's going to discuss some of the specifics about the transaction and finance.","Judy I. Brown","Thanks again. On Slide 19, you can see a high-level summary of the transaction. As we discussed, the purchase price of this transaction comprises EUR 2.48 billion in equity, in addition to the assumption of approximately EUR 1.1 billion in debt. The equity purchase price breaks out as: 25% funded by Perrigo stock placed directly to Omega Founder and CEO, Marc Coucke; and 75% funded through cash and debt. Marc's continued investment demonstrates his high level of confidence in the future success of our combined businesses.","In addition to our combined strong margin and cash flow profile, we expect this transaction to generate attractive returns for our shareholders. And of course, I have to comment on our ever-important ROIC metric. Recall, as I discussed at our Analyst Day on February 28, for certain transactions in new geographies, we have always anticipated it might take more than 3 years to achieve our stated goals. For this transaction, we expect to reach our weighted average cost of capital by year 2 and generate our target ROIC threshold by year 4 following close. And importantly, we anticipate that this acquisition will be immediately accretive to adjusted EPS and double-digit accretive in fiscal 2016.","From a financing perspective, we have a fully committed bridge facility in place. We expect to put permanent financing in place from a combination of existing cash on hand and through the issuance of new debt and equity. We expect that the financing structure will provide us with long-term financial flexibility while, importantly, maintaining our investment-grade ratings. And with $1.2 billion in pro forma operating cash flow, we expect we will have an attractive cash flow growth profile sufficient to delever quickly post-transaction.","Turning to Slide 20. Here you can see the pro forma financials for the combined company with the scale of the diversification we are talking about with this transaction. In particular, I'd like to highlight some more detail on the mix shift you can expect to see as a result of this acquisition. Not only do our LTM revenues on a combined pro forma basis increase by approximately $1.6 billion, but our diversification of revenue streams is significantly improved as well. As a stand-alone company, Perrigo generated approximately 81% of sales from within the U.S. as of the end of fiscal 2014. Through this transaction and the access to European and other global markets, our revenue diversification increases significantly. On a combined pro forma basis, we're very nearly at a 50-50 split between the U.S. and the rest of the world. Finally, Omega\u2019s organic growth profile fits nicely into Perrigo's stated 3-year organic compound annual revenue growth rate objectives of 5% to 10% and operating income of 10% to 20%.","On Slide 21, you can see that we have secured EUR 1.75 billion in fully-committed underwritten bridge financing from JPMorgan and Barclays. The permanent financing is expected to include a combination of debt and equity, provide ongoing liquidity and long-term financial flexibility.","In addition to the use of existing cash that I mentioned previously, we also expect to increase the revolving credit facility to $1 billion from $600 million and to extend the maturity to 5 years, while maintaining our $300 million December '15 payment.","On Slide 22, at close, you can expect to see debt on the balance sheet of approximately $5.8 billion. This would include $5.6 billion of debt and approximately $200 million of other items that are treated like debt at the rating agencies.","I'd highlight again the cash flow strength of the combined company will enable rapid deleveraging post-close. We anticipate that our capital structure will be consistent with an investment-grade rating, and the expanded EBITDA profile will put us on a path to return back to our current leverage ratio in approximately 18 to 24 months.","As mentioned, we expect to finance this acquisition in part through the issuance of equity. In particular, we expect to issue up to $1.1 billion in new equity and\/or equity-linked securities in relation to this acquisition. After the transaction, we would have approximately 147 million shares outstanding based on the market price of Perrigo stock as of the close of business yesterday, November 5, 2014. We will look to complete the financing at the earliest possible time after finalizing necessary regulatory filings.","Pending the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the completion of the financing and the satisfaction of European regulatory reviews and approvals, we expect this transaction to close in the first quarter of calendar year 2015.","In summary, the acquisition of Omega not only provides us a phenomenal business platform across Europe, but it is also a terrific, financially-compelling transaction that advances all of our strategic and financial objectives. That is, positive growth, strong margin and cash flow profile in a transaction that will be immediately accretive and achieve our ever-important ROIC objective.","Let me wrap by saying our financial profile and our commitment to maintaining investment-grade status remain as strong as ever.","And now I'd like to turn it back to Joe for some closing thoughts.","Joseph C. Papa","Thank you, Judy. In summary, turning to Slide #23, we believe this transaction will enhance our position as an industry-leading global health care company, now with a meaningful leadership position and commercial operations within the U.S. and Europe. We will now be able to participate in the attractive European OTC market, leveraging Omega\u2019s commercial infrastructure and OTC product portfolio to generate consistent growth. Where the acquisition of Elan provided our company with the operating structure for international expansion, this transaction now provides us with the commercial platform for further international growth. We strongly believe Omega will immediately enhance our scale, broaden our footprint, establishing the foundation for continued strategic bolt-on acquisitions.","In closing, we're extremely excited about this business combination for all the reasons I have outlined, and are looking forward to welcoming the Omega team into the Perrigo family.","And with that, I'd now like to open it, operator, for questions.","Arthur J. Shannon","And operator, can you ask everyone to keep it to one question each, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Louise Chen from Guggenheim.","Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Congratulations on the deal. So my question is with respect to the tax benefits for this deal. Are there any enhanced tax benefits given the fact that now a greater percentage of your revenues will come from outside the U.S.? And then also, just margin-wise, is this better than your corporate average? In line? How should we think about that?","Joseph C. Papa","Well, I'll just give a quick overview and then, Judy, you may want to add something to the comment. But let's just start quickly. First and foremost, this is not so much about the tax or anything like that. This is about building a commercial infrastructure to bring the company to a global platform and, as I said at the call, to create a top 5 global OTC company. That's really the primary purpose behind this. Judy, you may want to make some more specific comments about this for -- to Louise.","Judy I. Brown","Certainly. As you are all well aware, being an Irish company, and the intention of our Elan acquisition last year was to really provide us a platform to build upon, and that is exactly what this is providing us. We expect, pro forma looking forward, let's say, fiscal '16 you can start to think about the first full fiscal year, that our blended effective tax rate will be approximately 19%. So below 20% but slightly higher than our current run rate for this fiscal year as a stand-alone company. And that does come with the jurisdictional mix of income and the blend of where their earnings before tax are currently derived. On an ongoing basis, it's much too early to be able to talk about what that rate will look like beyond fiscal '16, but suffice it to say long-term mobility to be able to continue to reinvest globally around the world, utilizing the strong operating cash flow we'll have on a pro forma basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur from Needham & Company.","Elliot Wilbur - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Congratulations to the team on the transaction. My question -- I guess my question is maybe more directed to -- towards Judy than yourself, Joe, but if you want to weigh on this as well. Obviously, your input is always appreciated and valued. But just in looking at the reported numbers put out by Omega, I mean, it looks like they had reported in the 6-month period through June about EUR 250 million in operating profit. And obviously, I'm assuming EBITDA is somewhat higher than that and then -- excuse me, that was on an annualized basis. So, I mean, I'm guessing that EBITDA is somewhere north of EUR 300 million. But that number doesn't really seem to reconcile with sort of the adjusted operating income metrics that you provided in the slide deck. So I'm just trying to get a little bit of clarity around reconciling that potential differential. And then just to follow up to Judy, your comments on return on invested capital metrics. I mean, it seems like it's going to be quite some time before this transaction would be hitting double-digit rates of return. And maybe if you could just sort of remind us of what your internal hurdle rates are, roughly, then sort of maybe just some commentary on the ability to get to kind of double-digit rates of return.","Judy I. Brown","Thanks, Elliot. That was a 2-part question, but they were both good ones. So an A and a B. So I said -- I like to talk about both of them, so let's go. The ROIC metric, I'm going to work backwards. The stated objective that we always have, have had forever, is on an acquisition, an investment, that we strive for a return on invested capital with a threshold of 200 basis points over our WACC. As I stated a few moments ago, in this particular transaction, we expect our return on invested capital in the second year after acquisition to be above WACC and to be above that threshold of 200 bps above WACC by year 4. If you're focusing now on getting into double digit, it would be beyond year 5. But we do feel that there is a glide path to that given not only the strength of the combined businesses, and the strength of this asset in particular, but what we can do together to provide longer-term synergies as we bring more of our products into their portfolio. And I know for a fact that Joe is going to want to talk about some of the magic behind combining their portfolio, our portfolio and their commercial infrastructure. Rolling forward to the published numbers, and I'm glad you point that out so that everyone on the call can go and look for those, the company has been publishing their 1231 and semiannual reports even since they have gone private because of their public debt. And with that in mind, you can see published information. But it's important that you note that, that information is under IFRS. And under IFRS, there are accounting differences. So the numbers that you have seen reflected on Page 19 -- pardon me, 20 in the slide deck reflect numbers that are under U.S. GAAP. We've made adjustments for how they capitalize and do not capitalize other costs. So we have made it to look like it will look combined in the future with us. So given that, we expect the ongoing forward-looking -- you will see published LTM operating income under U.S. GAAP come out, with pro forma financial statements in the next days as we prepare for our financing process, in the over USD 200 million. And we've talked also about how they're expecting operating income to be growing at a rate of between 10% and 20% annually, similar to the Perrigo growth rates.","Joseph C. Papa","Yes, Elliot, the only other comment I'd add to what Judy said, because I absolutely agree with what she said, is that we really feel that the synergy of this is really an example of 1 plus 1 equaling 3 or more. What we -- if you -- if I remind you that we have 3,000 Perrigo products today, if we could bring that into Omega\u2019s commercial infrastructure, where Omega will select the best candidates to launch either a new brand and\/or, more importantly, line extensions off of the existing Omega brands, we think that offers tremendous synergistic opportunity. Obviously, additional to that, we think that the synergy is for -- to take the Omega product into some of the marketplaces where we do have significant infrastructure, such as the U.S, Mexico, Australia, just to name a few. So it is that synergistic view on the revenue side that we're really excited about, what it means and how that plays into the financial numbers for the synergies that Judy was talking about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Congratulations as well. Joe, just sort of a bigger-picture question, if you kind of step back. We've had a lot of, I don't know, I can't keep track, 4 out of 6 quarters of revenue misses. And there have been reasons for that, seasonality, et cetera. But if you could just take a step back, how do you see the organic growth of the story playing out going forward? And how dependent do you think you are on continuing to do deals in order to generate organic growth? I mean, clearly this quarter had issues. But even if you strip out Tysabri, sales would have been down 8%. So if you could kind of take a step back, high level, where you see organic growth to the business going. Clearly, that has been a reason for the premium valuation for the stock, and if you could just get a handle in terms of how you see that playing out. And then just as a corollary to that, Mucinex was clearly good news. But does that represent upside to guidance this year? Or is that just filling a hole?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Well, thank you, Jami, for the questions. I understand your commentary on previous quarters. I think we've had some great quarters and we've had some challenges, as we mentioned. This quarter, I'd say, though, it performed as expected. We knew there was going to be some -- a tough comparable versus the previous year. We had a very strong cough\/cold\/flu early start in fiscal first quarter of 2014. Having said that, we expected that. We do think this quarter performed as we expected. There was a challenge, admittedly, in our VMS business. It did perform a little bit softer than we certainly would like. We were disappointed with that. But beyond that, we do feel that it performed as expected. To your comment and questions about where we look at the growth, we continue to believe that the organic growth rate of the Perrigo Company will be somewhere in that 5% to 10% top line growth rate, and then opportunity to essentially double the -- that growth rate, so 10% to 20%, on the operating income and EPS line for the core business that we have at Perrigo. In addition to that, though, clearly we do -- we think, such as today's announcement about Omega, we can double or -- I'm sorry, we can add to it the inorganic side of the business to drive that top line. So we still believe the business will grow 5% to 10% top line, 10% to 20% bottom line for us as a company. The major drivers for that are clearly what we've said in the past. It's this concept of more and more products going from prescription to OTC. In the United States, certainly, and many of the countries, it's continued to see the movement of consumers from national brand to store brand all as important drivers to what we look at, at our base business. Now we believe we can certainly supplement what we have at Perrigo Company today by combining the assets of the Omega organization to really supplement our growth rates beyond what we're talking about here in terms of 5% to 10% organic growth rate.","Judy I. Brown","Jami, I think you had specifically asked about the Guaifenesin coming into the forecast and is it closing a hole. I guess I wouldn't put it in those terms because we are launching the product now in the season. So we are definitely adding the product back into the number. As we specifically told you in August, it was not included in the annual guidance provided in August, but we also just mentioned that there are some other moving pieces that go in the other direction. And in the vein of total transparency, we've given you color on what those are as well. And hence, we're maintaining the guidance range, which is fairly wide and encompasses both the pluses and minuses at this stage. And being that it's still early in the year, just giving you the ins and the outs and maintaining the total year for the moment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Joe, I know this is a revenue synergy story and then what it does for you strategically. But can you talk about the cost savings opportunity, whether it's R&D, SG&A? And then Omega had a lot of externally-sourced products. There's -- I have to think there's an opportunity for you guys, at least over time, to bring a lot of that sourcing internal. So I guess how big of an opportunity is that? Could you quantify it? And over what time period?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Great question, and I think that's another area of opportunity for us, to be absolutely clear. The business that Omega has is -- much of it or the majority of it is outsourced. So much of the business does come from outside manufacturers. We do believe that there are opportunities to take some of those products inside into the efficient Perrigo manufacturing network and supply chain and procurement savings. So I do think there is opportunities there that we are excited about, and that is another reason why we believe 1 plus 1 equals 3 or more. So no question about that. There is clear supply chain opportunities in bringing our operational excellence approach to the business. I will say, though, on one aspect that I want to be very clear on: we do not see this as an opportunity to reduce research and development. We do think research and development has been a big driver of the success at the Perrigo Company and the Omega company. So we do think we -- there's significant opportunity for additional research and development to extend and build out our product portfolio and, as I said before, the potential to launch some of the 3,000 products in the Perrigo portfolio and bring them into the Omega distribution network as line extension opportunities to build the Omega brands.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Are there cost savings that we could build in kind of out-of-the-box as you look at the cost structure of Omega and Perrigo? And obviously, I know you're not overlapping directly, but how do we think about some of that synergy opportunity in terms of costs?","Joseph C. Papa","Clearly, there are cost saving synergies, no doubt about it. On the order of magnitude that will start in the tens of millions, though. And obviously, we think there's opportunities to continue to increase the slope of that in terms of the future. But certainly in the tens of millions [indiscernible] there. That is an example of the type of cost savings we expect to realize.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.","Gregory B. Gilbert - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Simple business model question, Joe. The company has been primarily a store brand OTC company. And today, you're buying a branded OTC company. I realize there isn't a big store-brand company in Europe for you to buy. But as you purchase Omega, are you doing so more for the platform in Europe to take the historical strength of Perrigo, the store brand, into Europe? Or because you think it's important to add a branded OTC sort of demand generation capability to Perrigo in Europe that might be transported back to the U.S? Just a simple business model sort of evolution question. It feels like a generic company buying a branded company in some ways. So -- if I could use that analogy. So maybe just stepping back, how important do you think it is to become more branded? And how transportable is the U.S. store-brand model to Europe over time?","Joseph C. Papa","Yes. So one of the things that we have said on numerous calls, Gregg, to you is -- because it's a great question, is we thought about what do -- where can we go next with the Perrigo model. There is no ability to take and bring out a mass customization approach to a France or Germany. In the regulations, you -- the -- in France, for example, a pharmacist needs to own the facility for a pharmacy, and they can only own one pharmacy. Germany has a regulation that you can't own more than 4 pharmacies per pharmacist. So there clearly in Europe are different constraints for us to do our existing model. So we did feel that we had opportunity to look at Europe and say, where can we go? We felt that the branded opportunity that Omega offered us was clearly one of the best opportunities to have this global or certainly pan-European footprint and indeed to become a top 5 global OTC player, to be clear. Do I believe there are going to be branded opportunities for us not just in Europe? The answer is yes. I do believe that we will have some opportunities. But most importantly, the near term for us is really focused on saying we have 3,000 products at Perrigo. Which of these products can I bring to Europe and offer to the Omega team, have a product line extension of some of their great #1 leading brands and launch a product line extension into the European platform? I'm sure that, just from our discussions with Marc and his team, we think there's already a number of those that will be very exciting opportunities to align some brands -- some additional brands, do additional line extensions into Europe. So that's clearly an opportunity. Do I think some of the Omega brands can come to the U.S. in some way or into our Australia operation, into our Mexico operation? The answer is yes, there is clearly a synergy for that as well. So I think it's a little bit of both of what you said. There is a true opportunity to bring our Perrigo product family into Europe and bring some of those European Omega brands into some of the markets in which Perrigo already has operations like the U.S, Mexico, Australia, et cetera.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sumant Kulkarni from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","How quickly can you achieve revenue synergies in either direction? And is the 5% to 10% sales growth rate on the Omega side sustainable without revenue synergies kicking in?","Joseph C. Papa","I'll answer the second part of the question. We believe the answer is yes. We think that Omega has a very sustainable ability to grow in that 5% to 10% range. I mean, it was remarkable as we went through their product portfolio, their plans and the similarities that they have and how they've been growing their business and how that aligns with what we do at Perrigo. The revenue synergies that they will -- we will start the activities as soon as we're allowed in terms of the -- going through the regulatory process, but we are very excited about some of the products that we currently have. You may recall that Perrigo has been working for the past 4 or 5 years to get some products approved in the European market. I think our current rate is we have up to about -- somewhere around 15 products that are currently approved by various regulatory agencies in Europe. So some of those products can move relatively quickly within -- starting the first full year, year 2, year 3, year 4 as we think about it. And I think that was part of what Judy said in terms of our ability to hit our return on invested capital hurdle by year 4, as we are anticipating the revenue synergies that we think we can bring into the marketplace.","Judy I. Brown","And maybe, Sumant, just one quick thing as I know many of you are going to start pulling the publicly available data on Omega. Just to make it clear, as you know, whenever we talk about the future and we talk about our 5% to 10% growth rate, we always put them in the context of organic only. You'll see that the company has been phenomenally successful both on an organic basis but has also continued to acquire products and brands along the way. So all of our numbers are reflecting the organic only. And certainly, the business model and our management -- combined management teams are going to be keen to continue to tuck in products, tuck in brands, et cetera. But we are talking here today about an organic-only growth rate of that stand-alone business, and we expect them to continue to invest in the future certainly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger for Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Congrats, Joe and Judy. I had really one key question. Several questions have already been asked and answered. My question is, how long will it take to roll Perrigo-manufactured products into Europe? So how should we think about that time line? Is it very easy? I mean, obviously, for you to put new labels on bottles in your manufacturing plants is easy. But how easy is it to get regulatory approvals in Europe? And how easy it is it to create new brands -- new branded over-the-counter products in Europe?","Joseph C. Papa","David, I'll split that into 2 different groups. There are some products that we currently already have approved by -- Perrigo had approved within our European platform, and we had been working on that for the past 4 or 5 years. There's about -- more than a dozen products that are approved, and we already have the opportunity to look at that -- those products for future branding opportunities, future life cycle extensions of the existing brands of the Omega team. So that group can be done relatively quickly, albeit that's not the complete list by far. The further list is the 3,000 products that are part of the Perrigo family. Think of our U.S. portfolio of OTC products where we can take one of our cough\/cold products and bring it over and get it approved in the European setting. We already know how to make the product. We already know how to work on the formulation. We already know how to develop the methods. All that is part of our current product knowledge, bringing that, getting it approved through the regulatory expertise of the Omega team, we think it'll take some time. But importantly, we'll then be able to put it through the commercial infrastructure that is available to us with the Omega team. So those will take several years, 3 -- probably 3 to 4 years for those types of products. But I think it's important to say there are 2 ways. So the first 15 products, or 12 to 15 products, we already have under way. And then there's the additional products that Marc and the team will look through our portfolio, pick the best ones for life cycle and line extensions to bring out some additional brands into Marc's platform. So it will take more the 3- or 4-year time frame.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Harold Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","When you say that it's going to be -- the deal will be accretive -- double-digit accretion to fiscal 2016, I just want to make sure you're referring to -- is this your own internal projections? Or are you referring to consensus? And obviously, this is absorbing some extra shares and, obviously, a higher tax rate because tax is going from 16%, you're saying, to 19% for the -- so obviously, there's going to have to be some cost synergies. Obviously, it's cheap financing. I just want to make sure I understand that. And then maybe, Joe, could you just also just talk a little bit about Animal Health within Consumer? Just we haven't talked about that yet. Just give us a flavor for what happened in the quarter.","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. So Judy, why don't you the first part of it, the accretive, double digits, 2016 and the magnitude of it and comment on cost synergies and I'll deal with the Animal Health?","Judy I. Brown","Sure. You guys know how much I love to give forward-looking guidance on EPS. But let me give you a framework to think about, because there are a lot of moving parts, but as you start to think about how to model out how we get to a \"double-digit accretion\" in FY '16. I made the comment earlier that you'll shortly be seeing adjusted U.S. GAAP LTM September 30 operating income numbers published with pro forma shortly. And we talk there about a number of operating income well north of $200 million. So if you were to ballpark mid-200s, I mean, they talked about a growth rate, like we said, between 10% and 20% a year. So if you start to project forward what that would look like by the end of June 2016 and you start to think about the acquisition of new debt, so approximately $1.6 billion of new debt that will go onto the balance sheet at, if you use our current blended rate of our external debt, of 4.25%, or our public debt, and you take on acquired debt from the target, you have an approximate interest expense incremental of $100 million. I made the comment about the effective tax rate. So just, say, to be simple, use a 20% effective tax rate. And we say that we're going to take on incremental shares. So just using, in the material we provided, 147 million shares outstanding when the deal is all said and done, that's approximately 12 million, 13 million extra shares that are going to be taken on. I've just kind of given you the framework of how to think about their incremental net income, which takes into the effect the debt costs, the incremental shares we add. And if you do that math, you can see that double digit, by our standards, is significant. It's material. It's substantial. I don't know what kind of adjective you want to use. I'm always reticent about providing a precise number for the obvious reasons that we are not yet in the financing market. We've just announced the deal. And there is going to need to be a bounding box between the right combination of sources for this transaction, so that we are getting the optimal weighted average cost of capital on a go-forward basis while maintaining our investment-grade rating. So hopefully, you'll give us the flexibility to make the right judgments as we proceed in that process.","Marc Harold Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So all that is accretion relative to the consensus number?","Judy I. Brown","That is correct.","Joseph C. Papa","So the second part, Marc, of your question was the Animal Health business. I don't know the exact -- I don't have the exact number right and handy in front of me on the Animal Health. But clearly, the story of Animal Health for the full year is going to be a story about new products. It is the launch of our new product line extension for full year of 2015 that we really think is what's exciting. We've talked to you about some of the acquisitions we've done in the past in this business. It is the ability to launch those new products during this upcoming fiscal year that I think is really going to drive the growth in the Animal Health business that we've talked about in the past. That's where it's really -- this particular quarter wasn't a significant difference from last year. It is really the growth in the next quarters that's -- and the -- for the full fiscal year 2015 that really is exciting and that the most -- the majority of that growth is going to be driven by what we have as an opportunity for new products and line extensions of the products. That's really what the growth driver is going to be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just had 2 quick ones here. First, when I think about the Omega business model, does this ultimately have similar characteristics to your U.S. business, where incremental sales are associated with fairly limited incremental expenses as you leverage existing infrastructure? Or since these are more branded assets, do you need to think about a bit more investment as you launch these new products? I'm just trying to understand kind of the margin expansion potential as sales continue to grow. And second question was just coming back to that -- the business development strategy going forward. Should I read your comments today as BD post-Omega is very much x U.S. focused as you look to build out on this infrastructure you're acquiring here? And is that BD -- is it mostly bolt-on products? Is it geographies? Just give us a bit more flavor of what you're hoping to kind of build upon over time with this asset.","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. So the first comment, I was -- it was so remarkable, the first time we had a chance to talk with Marc and his team, how they've grown their business, and they've done a number of acquisitions, as Judy had mentioned before. One of the things that has been so remarkable is they've found a way to get existing growth in their business by going after line extensions, bringing out new products, especially line extensions, into their existing commercial network. So that's one of the things. So they've -- when they've shown their growth rate on the top line, they often been able to take that top line growth rate and get a synergistic growth rate on their bottom line as they've grown the business. So it's been -- it's that ability to have a leverage in the P&L that is what we have seen for -- historically for Omega. On the question of where do we go next, first and foremost we have to focus on getting this transaction closed. That is an important part of what we're trying to do right now and will be doing as we get off this call now. But the clear intent that I've mentioned in the call is absolutely true. We do think there's continued opportunity for strategic bolt-on acquisitions. That's something that Marc and his team have been very active and, of course, the activity we've had here in the United States for the Perrigo business. So bolt-on acquisitions and acquisitions are going to be part of our infrastructure. I have to add, though, that we have made a commitment, and as we've said in the past, to look at our leverage ratios and keep the investment grade. That is an important part of what Judy mentioned on the call and certainly what I had mentioned in the past. So yes, there are opportunities, but I don't want to lose sight of that investment-grade comment. Judy, anything you want add?","Judy I. Brown","Thank you for the investment-grade comment, Joe. I would like to just make -- just provide a teeny bit of color to the comments Joe made around these line extensions. And for those of you who aren't as familiar with our business model, it's a hybrid. So when you think about building brands, it may pop in your mind hundreds of millions of dollars that need to be spent to create consumer awareness. The genius of what they have accomplished is they have taken brands that have consumer top-of-mind awareness market-by-market and have done these line extensions. For example, taking a brand that's well known as sinus wash, sinus cleanse and have then tacked on allergy products. So take a name that's known, don't have to spend a ton to develop the brand, and then take a product like, for example, the Perrigo cetirizine hydrochloride 10 milligram, which they now package as an allergy product and sell under that well-known brand in Europe across markets. So they take a basket of available products. They allow their country to develop them as they see fit. So while there is more brand investment than we have in our store brand model, it is certainly much different than the kind of normal investment you would see if you were trying to launch brands across 35 markets customized to individual consumers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser from B. Riley.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","I think you've touched on this issue already. But just the idea that you're both doing private label store brand and branded products now, is there any at all risk of alienating relationships with the retailers? And also, can you talk if there's any retailers that overlap between the 2 companies? I would think probably not. But are there any kind of larger ones in Europe? I know you've said it's very fragmented. And then just a quick question on Specialty Sciences in the quarter. Was there any upfront payment included that was related to the sale of that one asset?","Joseph C. Papa","Okay, let me deal with the first part of the question. On the branded store, branded product opportunity, that predominantly -- as we said, there really isn't a store-brand opportunity in Europe with the exception of the U.K. market. So in U.K. -- is there potentially some overlap in the U.K.? The answer is absolutely yes. But the majority of the countries in Europe, there really is not a store-brand opportunity. However, there clearly was an opportunity to leverage our existing portfolio of 3,000 Perrigo products that we have today, to bring them into the European platform, to find those products that Marc and his team can then take and bring out some additional line extensions, very similar to the description that Judy just provided. So that part is very clear. I'm sorry, the second part of the question?","Judy I. Brown","The answer to your question is no, the revenue line that you see is 100% Tysabri. There's no impact by the sale of assets that came in the current quarter. It's de minimis.","Joseph C. Papa","So that's, I think, both part of the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Chiang from CRT Capital.","Timothy Chiang - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Well, Joe, looking at this deal strategically, long term, do you expect to bring a lot of the Omega products in-house? I mean, how long do you think that would take? It seems like, what is it like, 2,000 products at Omega. I mean -- or do you plan on actually keeping the products on the other side of the Atlantic and just continuing to have those products outsourced?","Joseph C. Papa","Yes. So indeed, you're absolutely right with your numbers. There are 2,000 products. I would say, though, to be clear, I want to make sure it's very clear that 20 of the brands account for the majority of the sales. So 2,000 products is correct, but the -- but there really is clearly a focus on the top brands and -- of which there are 20 brands that Marc and his team focus on. On the second part of the question now in terms of bringing that in-house, the way I look at this is that one of the strengths that the Perrigo organization brings to this transaction is a very efficient supply chain for procurement and manufacturing efficiency. We certainly will not attempt to bring every product inside, but there will be opportunities for us to lower cost of goods, lower the Omega cost of goods by putting those products into the Perrigo very efficient supply chain, knowing that we are the world's -- one of the world's largest OTC manufacturers. When it comes to actually procurement of raw materials, those raw materials that are appropriate for the U.S. market are also very appropriate for the European market. So there clearly will be procurement synergies that we will experience as a result of bringing some of those product inside. But to be clear, I do not expect us to try to bring every product inside. It's -- obviously it's one of those 80-20 rules. We'll focus on the significant opportunities first and then build from there.","Timothy Chiang - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. Judy, could I just ask one follow-up on the tax side? I think in the Omega filings, they basically say their tax rate is around 18%. Is that about right? And then I think you gave guidance that the pro forma it'd be around 19%. So I was just sort of trying to understand why would your rate be slightly higher or combine them to be?","Judy I. Brown","So important to note, you're looking at backward-looking effective tax rate, and we have been working, in the process of our diligence and discussions with management, on looking at forward looking. And the forward-looking blend of income -- earnings before tax by jurisdiction would imply a higher rate for them on a stand-alone basis. There are some tax planning attributes that will be expiring out. And therefore, for us to be appropriate on a go-forward basis, their blended rate standalone would be more in the mid-20s and, therefore, averaged in with us, is just about 20%. So around 19%. So again, it's making sure that you take into consideration forward looking versus backward looking.","Joseph C. Papa","I absolutely agree with what Judy said. I'd also say that Judy her team have been -- have done an excellent job with the tax rate of the Perrigo Company. And I think as we look at the combined tax rate, they'll continue to do a wonderful job with that in terms of doing the appropriate thing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao from Barclays.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So I think the first question that a lot of people have on their minds is, is the Omega Pharma cycling team going to be rebranded as the Perrigo cycling team?","Then the...","Joseph C. Papa","Well, no, go ahead. I'm sorry.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Then on a more serious note, how are you going to think about sort of the acquisition strategy that Omega has done? Obviously, they have been pretty active in terms of acquiring brands over the last couple of years sort of to put them into their portfolio. Do you expect to continue at that same pace? Or do you expect to sort of pause as you sort of integrate the business? Just because it seems like, from their perspective, a lot of assets have certainly become available over the last couple of years for them to sort of capitalize on.","Joseph C. Papa","Yes, I specifically would simply say that Marc and his team have done an outstanding job with M&A in terms of acquiring additional brands and bringing them to the marketplace, successfully commercializing them. Our expectation is that -- first and foremost, our priority is to complete this transaction, to get the integration done and accomplished and to move forward with that. Having said that, after we get that accomplished, we will look at -- we'd continue to look at bolt-on acquisitions. I want to remind you of my comment on the investment-grade rating. That is important to us. But nonetheless, we do think there are some opportunities for that now and going into the future. We really do think, though, that with what we're expecting in terms of the cash flow generation of the combined companies of the Perrigo and the Omega, there will be significant opportunities for strategic bolt-on acquisitions for the future without getting into the specific time and -- time point of that. And I don't think at this point we'll be rebranding that Omega cycling team. So Marc has done a great job with it. We'll leave it as is.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, and I would absolutely say that should not be viewed as a source for cost synergy.","Joseph C. Papa","Sounds like a cyclist to me.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Annabel Samimy from Stifel.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","You may have answered some of these in some form already. But when you think about moving into a brand business as opposed to the private label business that you do in the U.S., how should -- I mean, you talked about margins, but how should we think about that margin opportunity for a brand product as opposed to the private label product? And just really quickly on taxes. If I'm calculating this correctly, it was a 15% tax rate this quarter. So I guess I'm still surprised that you're guiding to 20% going forward. And...","Judy I. Brown","No, no, no. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I have to jump in. I can't take a breath on that one. 15% for this quarter, correct. We're guiding 16% for fiscal 2015. That's Perrigo standalone, unchanged guidance for the year. All of my early remarks were about stand-alone Perrigo. Close that door. Next, pro forma combined company with Omega, 19%. Please do not confuse the 2.","Joseph C. Papa","Okay. On the first part of the question, it deals with the question of brand versus private label. As I said on the call, the opportunity in Europe that we see is -- there are brands, there are no specific opportunities to do private label. Having said that, though, if you think about what I said about the business from Omega, it's a business built by a pharmacist for pharmacists. Marc and his team have done a great job making sure that the pharmacists receive appropriate margins for the products and to help build what Marc has done in terms of his capabilities for making sure the pharmacists are -- the European pharmacists are very rewarded for the use of their product. So I would say, though -- one other point that I want to make sure that I'm clear on is that when you think about the respective operating income margins for the Consumer Healthcare business of Perrigo, predominantly U.S. based, versus the Omega, it's very similar in terms of the operating income. Clearly, the Omega team has a higher gross margin, but then they have some additional operating expenses. When you get down to the actual operating margin, they are very similar across the businesses. So in the end, it's going to be very similar when you combine these 2 businesses in terms of what it will look like.","So with that, let me conclude the call today. I want to say thank you, everyone, for your interest in this call. I want to once again reinforce the excitement that we feel that we think it's a great day for Perrigo and Omega as we bring together 2 great organizations and indeed have a chance to really look at the synergistic opportunity between bringing them both together. We're truly, as I said earlier in the call, that 1 plus 1 equals 3 as we look at synergies for bringing together 2 great companies. Thank you very much for your attention today. Have a great day, everyone.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"16642":["Perrigo Co.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Perrigo Company Plc Second Quarter Calendar Year 2015 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session.","I will now hand today's call over to Mr. Art Shannon. Please go ahead, sir.","Arthur J. Shannon - Vice President, Investor Relations and Global Communications, Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you very much, Kayla. Welcome to Perrigo's Second Calendar Quarter Earnings Call. A copy of the earnings release we issued this morning is available on our website at perrigo.com. Also on our website is the slide presentation for this call. As you know Perrigo believes in being transparent and open to our investors. Following today's conference call we will be actively reaching out to investors over the next few weeks.","Before we proceed with the call I'd like to remind everyone that during the process of this call, management will make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for investors and shareholders and Safe Harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued this morning. Following management's review of the presentation we will open up the call for questions.","I'd like to now turn the call over to Perrigo's Chairman and CEO, Joe Papa.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Art, and welcome everyone to Perrigo's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Also joining me today is Judy Brown, Perrigo's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","For our agenda today first I will make a few comments on the quarter. Next Judy will go through the details of the second quarter results. Then I will give you an overview of our recent success in both store brand and prescription product approvals. And finally, reiterate our position on Mylan's unsolicited offer to acquire Perrigo. Finally, you will have an opportunity for question and answers.","Before we get into the agenda however, I'd like to start by thanking Perrigo employees for their diligent focus, which has led to adjusted net income growth of 37%. Even with all the noise you've been following over the past few months, our nearly 13,000 Perrigo employees have announced three M&A transactions, delivered on our Omega integration plans, achieved great operational efficiencies and productivity improvement, executed on our new product launches, and delivered on our Base Plus Plus Plus strategy. It's great work by the team.","Now let's discuss the quarter. On slide 4 you can see, despite some challenges, this is a very strong quarter. Our quarterly performance is highlighted by second quarter record net sales of more than $1.5 billion. We also achieved record adjusted gross margin, record adjusted net income, and record operating cash flow.","Our Consumer Healthcare segment grew adjusted operating income an impressive 18% compared to last year. In fact our consumer-facing revenues now represent 75% of the total Perrigo company revenues.","Moving on to slide 5 you can see consolidated Perrigo grew the top line by 34%. This is driven primarily by the addition of the Branded Consumer Healthcare, or BCH, segment sales and the record second quarter sales in the Rx business.","New products contributed $149 million, comprising $116 million in legacy Perrigo sales and $33 million in our Omega business. You also see that we continued to invest in our future this quarter. We invested over $44 million in R&D to continue to support our strongest new product pipeline ever. I'd like to highlight that even with strong R&D investments in our legacy Perrigo business, supply chain and manufacturing efficiencies and favorable product mix allowed us to achieve record second quarter organic adjusted operating income, which improved 11% over last year.","Judy will give you more details, but let me highlight a few items from the business segments. Our consumer-facing business segments, both Consumer Healthcare and our Branded Consumer Healthcare segments, had combined net sales of $1.15 billion this quarter with adjusted gross margins of nearly 42%. Their combined adjusted operating margins were nearly 21%. New products for the consumer-facing businesses were $110 million in the quarter.","In the quarter, we were able to realize positive gross profit margin improvement from new products net of discontinued products.","The globalization and the scale of our consumer-facing business platform provides exciting new opportunities for Perrigo, as evidenced by the three recently-announced acquisitions in our consumer business. First, we announce the acquisition of the Mexico Patheon softgel business, which closed in May. Perrigo has long desired to be a prime manufacturer of softgel products, and this acquisition gives us our entry point.","Second, we announced the acquisition of brand assets from GSK. This portfolio generated over $110 million in annual sales last year. And with the return in the nicotine lozenges, we expect to grow those sales.","Also we announced the acquisition of Germany's leading dietary supplement brand, Yokebe, which is marketed as a meal replacement product and is currently the second largest dietary brand by market share in Germany. We expect to close both the GSK and the Yokebe transactions in the third quarter.","With the record adjusted operating income in our Consumer Healthcare business, the strong performance of our recently acquired pan-European Omega business, and these recently announced transactions which bolt on very nicely to our existing infrastructure, I'm excited by the future prospects and our megatrends in this truly global consumer business platform.","As you can see on slide 6, new products will drive our future growth. Excluding the impact of Omega, we expect $1 billion in new product launches over the next 3 years, representing more than $3.6 billion in national brand sales, highlighted by the launches of Nasacort, Flonase, the Mucinex family, plus many more.","Also just in the last week, we received three ANDA's approvals. First, we just received FDA final approval for testosterone topical gel 1.62%. Second, we received FDA final approval for ibuprofen sodium tablet ANDA, the national brand equivalent to Advil fast relief. And finally, we received FDA approval for omeprazole magnesium tablet, the equivalent to Prilosec OTC. This is the first and only truly equivalent generic product to the national brand. Thank you to our R&D team for the excellent work.","Our Rx segment once again achieved record results, growing sales 10% with a record adjusted gross margin of 65%. New product sales in the quarter were driven by the generic versions of clobetasol spray and our AB rated AndroGel 1%, both of which are powerful launches in our Rx business. Adjusted operating margins were strong in this segment, even as we invested $20 million in research and development and continued making investments in our branded Rx sales team. Congratulations to the Rx team for another strong quarter.","In Specialty Sciences, we have been very pleased with the market performance of Tysabri. It is a great asset that is generating terrific cash flow, particularly with the current 18% royalty that it now provides.","As you can see on slide 7, over the last 52 weeks, U.S. store brands continue to gain share in smoking cessation. When you take out the impact of new national brand product launches and the effect of national brands' return to the market, store brand market share continues to grow.","Given the megatrends I've talked about for many years, including an aging population, increased use of medication as individuals get older, and rising healthcare costs, Perrigo is well-positioned to meet the future needs for the global healthcare community.","Now, let me turn the call over to Judy.","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first earnings conference call with the addition of our newly formed Branded Consumer Healthcare segment, or BCH as I'll refer to it, established after the March 30, 2015, closing of the Omega Pharma acquisition.","It has been an extremely busy quarter on multiple fronts. We continue to execute on the integration of Omega and broaden our customer and patient reach; further the process of shifting our fiscal year end from June to December to ameliorate your financial analyses going forward; updated the market on our strategies to achieve organic 3-year compound annual growth rates of 5% to 10%; announced three acquisitions since closing Omega; received two unsolicited offers from Mylan to acquire Perrigo; and continued to actually pursue new corporate development opportunities, all while achieving record results in the quarter, never a dull moment at Perrigo and seemingly never enough pages in our passports.","Before we dive into the quarter, I'd like to first remind you of our continued focus on providing highly transparent financial and operational results. With the addition of our new pan-European BCH segment and our focus on continued geographic expansion, we will now provide you with constant currency revenue information to enable easier analysis of the underlying performance of our business outside the U.S.","Consolidated results from our durable base business portfolio, bolstered by the newly-acquired Branded Consumer Healthcare segment, delivered 37% growth in adjusted net income. Consolidated adjusted gross margin expanded 460 basis points to 49.1%, with positive contributions from BCH, supply chain efficiencies, and overall positive product mix.","As Joe talks about frequently, the moat around Perrigo's margins via our supply chain prowess was clearly evident this quarter as year-over-year organic adjusted gross margin expanded over 300 basis points, driven by focused global sourcing and continued manufacturing efficiencies throughout our operations.","Now, I'd like to turn to our business segments, starting with a review of our results in Consumer Healthcare on slide 8. As a reminder, the CHC segment now include the legacy nutritionals as well as our PDI business, which had previously been reported in Other.","Sales within CHC were driven by positive contributions from our smoking cessation franchise, even after the return to market of a national brand competitor, inclusion of sales from store brand 600 mg Mucinex ER in the quarter versus last year, and overall higher sales within the cough\/cold category due to a relatively longer cough\/cold season in the U.S. versus last year.","Within the infant nutrition category, net sales of infant formula continue to perform well, led by increasing consumer appetite for organic formula, reflected in higher contract manufacturing sales in that category. Offsetting these positive dynamics were: one, relatively lower sales within the animal health category, led by the absence of contract manufacturing sales to a national brand as previously discussed last quarter; two, a relative decrease in OTC promotions this year by certain retailers of a major product in the GI category; three, continued price pressures from international competitors within the VMS category; and four, $12 million in foreign currency headwinds. In fact the impact of the animal health, VMS, and FX items I just mentioned were a 450 basis point year-over-year top line headwind to this segment's growth.","Adjusted gross margin expanded to its highest level in the 6 \u2013 last 6 years due to greater production efficiencies, greater seasonal volumes, and favorable commodity pricing. At the same time we continued our spending discipline in SG&A. And as a result adjusted operating margin increased 390 basis point year-over-year, which led to the impressive 18% growth in adjusted operating income compared to last year that Joe just mentioned.","On slide 9 you can see that net sales within Branded Consumer Healthcare were $401 million for the quarter, an all-time record quarter for Omega Pharma. This impressive result was driven by an 11% increase in sales of the top 20 brands on a constant currency basis versus last year and the launch of a number of exciting new products, including XLS Max Strength, a line extension to the brand SLX Medical for weight loss; new versions and flavors of Bronchostop, an herbal cough medicine; and strong distribution sales in the quarter.","Turning to slide 10 you can see that our Rx team continued to deliver, posting 10% net sales growth to a record $278 million in the quarter. New product launches and contribution from our women's health branded category led to record adjusted gross profit for the segment. We continue to invest in high margin potential R&D projects, highlighted by an approximate 38% increase in year-over-year R&D investments to a level of 7.2% of Rx net sales.","Turning to slide 11 Specialty Sciences net sales were $84 million, comprised of Tysabri royalties at 18% for the entire quarter, versus only 2 months at that 18% level a year ago. Year-over-year growth was limited by two dynamics, one, foreign-exchange negatively impacted net sales by approximately $7 million, and two, second calendar quarter 2014 net sales included approximately $10 million in net sales from Biogen's agreement with the Italian Medicines Agency.","Before I turn to the forecast a quick comment on the balance sheet. As of June 27, 2015, total cash on the face of the balance sheet was $786 million and current and long-term debt was $5.3 billion. Net cash flow from operations on a trailing 12-month basis was a record $1.2 billion.","Moving into the updated calendar 2015 guidance on slide 12. First, I'd like to start with noting that we are confirming our calendar year consolidated net sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance we provided you on April 21. To help you further refine your models I'd like to provide you with some added color on the segments for calendar 2015.","Due to previously-discussed seasonality in Consumer Healthcare, specifically in the animal health and cough\/cold categories, we expect the adjusted operating margin realized in this segment's past quarter to be the highest for the year. As is our historical trend in this segment, volumes in the second half of the calendar year are anticipated to be relatively lower over the next two quarters, thus producing relatively lower adjusted operating margin in the second half of the calendar year in line with past seasonal performance. Additionally we anticipate R&D spend to increase approximately 30% in the second half of the calendar year related to project timing.","We continue to expect Branded Consumer Healthcare to contribute approximately 20% of total Perrigo consolidated net sales for the full year with strong net sales over the remainder of calendar 2015. Note that though our forecast in this new business anticipates that the June quarter just ended will be the highest revenue quarter in the calendar year, due to new product launches such as XLS Max Strength and strong distribution sales we just realized in that particular period. Note also that the current BCH forecast now does include $25 million in net sales associated with recently announced acquisitions, which we expect will close in the September quarter.","Given the continued positive momentum in the Rx base business, coupled with strong recent product launches, we remain excited about this segment's growth prospects. Please note that for the remainder of the calendar year adjusted gross margins in Rx are also expected to be slightly softer than this past quarter, due to product mix and limited new product launches for the remainder of the calendar year.","Turning to slide 13. While the adjusted annual effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 17% for the full calendar year 2015, we anticipate both the third and fourth calendar quarter rates to increase to approximately 18.5% due to the inclusion of estimated earnings before tax from Omega Pharma. This jump in the rate is a function of the accounting rules surrounding annualizing effective tax rates.","Please realize that for accounting purposes the 6-month stub period, or second half of calendar 2015, is the first time Omega results will be included for a full U.S. GAAP reporting cycle. The first half of calendar 2015 was still technically part of our fiscal 2015 reporting year, which included Omega for only one quarter. This estimated 18.5% adjusted tax rate is in line with the expectations from our November 6 Omega acquisition announcement call.","So summing all this information up at the consolidated level, we expect third calendar quarter 2015 adjusted net income to grow between 30% and 35% over the comparable 2014 period. For your calculations of earnings per share please continue to model diluted shares outstanding of approximately 147 million shares in the quarter.","As I stated a few moments ago these are certainly very exciting times at Perrigo, both in terms of reaching new customers around the globe and executing our BP3 [Base Plus Plus Plus] strategy. Yet again we've delivered remarkable year-over-year adjusted net income performance, 37% this quarter, coming off 41% growth in the March quarter, with expected growth next quarter again north of 30%.","At the same time record cash flows will continue to provide meaningful returns to shareholders and as well as they create the dry powder to enable meaningful M&A and the multiplier effect these transactions can achieve.","Now I'd like to turn the call back to Joe.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Judy. Before we open it up to Q&A, I want to just provide a few thoughts.","First, I want to repeat the exciting news that we received three ANDA approvals within the last week. That is great news. And to my recollection is a record for Perrigo. And importantly it gives us increased confidence in our ability to execute on the Base Plus Plus (sic) [Base Plus Plus Plus] strategy.","Second, our manufacturing and supply chain teams have done a great job finding operational efficiencies with our continuous improvement program. And you're really seeing it in the bottom line results of our company.","Third, I want to take a moment to speak about the unsolicited offer by Mylan to offer 2.3 shares plus $75 in cash per share of Perrigo, which I know is on a lot of the shareholders' minds. As we've been saying since April we strongly believe that Mylan's offer substantially undervalues Perrigo; is not in the best interest of Perrigo shareholders. And both remain true today. We do not believe this is in the best interest of Perrigo shareholders.","Our board's rejection of Mylan's offer was unanimous. And made specifically that it had nothing to do with Teva. It has always been a strength of our standalone Perrigo business. You have seen this reflected time and time again as we return value to our shareholders by executing on our Base Plus Plus Plus strategy.","Our acquisition strategy continues to provide a multiplier effect to our already-strong organic growth, as we've shown with our acquisitions of leading European brands over the past few months. The market movements following Teva's announcement last week only reinforce our conviction about the Mylan offer.","Also Perrigo has a strong history of responsible corporate governance policies. We believe deeply in our responsibility to shareholders. For example in 2014 Perrigo received the best compliance and ethics program for a large-cap company and our General Counsel Todd Kingma won the Governance Professional of the Year. Great achievement for Todd and the entire Perrigo company.","But there is a lot of noise in the market. And I want to try to distill it down into really three comments on the unsolicited Mylan offer to acquire Perrigo. Specifically combining with Mylan, number one, would dilute the strength of our durable consumer business. It would risk the value that we continued to create for shareholders.","Number two, we believe it would result in a significant P\/E multiple contraction as we take our Perrigo durable business and combine it with the Mylan business.","Number three, I make no statement about the timing of EpiPen generic. However clearly it would expose Perrigo if we merged the two companies together to a product concentration risk of EpiPen. I'll let you all decide when and if a generic will show up of EpiPen.","I make no predictions on how Mylan shareholders will vote on August 28, but I also want to remind everyone including the Mylan shareholders that if they proceed with a tender offer for Perrigo, this will not be the easy path to completion that some are painting it to be. The bar for success in the tender offer process is a very high 80% of all outstanding Perrigo shares.","We've been on the road talking to our shareholders, and we are pleased to hear your confidence in Perrigo's management team and our standalone strategy. Each of you will need to make your own decision. But based on the current offer, if we ever get to a tender share process, I intend to vote no to the Mylan unsolicited offer to acquire Perrigo.","In closing we continue to believe that Mylan's offer substantially undervalues our business. And we are confident that by executing on our Base Plus Plus Plus strategy we can deliver far superior growth to what is represented by the Mylan offer.","I will now open up the call for any questions. Operator any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Please limit your time to one question. Please hold while we compile the Q&A roster. And our first question comes from Louise Chen.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So one question that we often get is how much growth is left for Perrigo over the longer term, especially in light of some of the news events that have happened recently? Are you just at the beginning, middle, or end of the company's growth? And how committed are you as a management team to see this through? Thanks.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Louise, thanks for your question. I mean I think the commentary that I will offer is that we see the growth opportunities as been very substantial for the Perrigo company. Number one, relative to where we sit as a company. We really think there's three mega trends that continue to drive the business, each of them contributing to the growth.","First one is just what I would call the demographics and the intensity of usage of pharmaceuticals. We expect to go up as we've just seen growth in the population, and more importantly growth of the over 65 population that uses 2.7x more pharmaceuticals.","Number two, we expect the continued movement form national brand to store brand. That's a trend that we continue to see even despite some of the new launches that have occurred. We continue to expect to see more products shift \u2013 more consumers shift from national brand to store brand.","And number three, it's the movement of new products that are today prescription moving over-the-counter. We expect that will continue to also contribute to our growth. So we still think there's a significant growth opportunity.","On top of that though what I think \u2013 the second part of your question \u2013 is that we see tremendous opportunities now that we've aligned and acquired the Omega organization, and what that means for us on the Branded Consumer business.","And importantly the same things that have helped Perrigo grow in the past, where we bolted on incremental assets. We think we can do that same thing. We think the GSK asset, the Yokebe asset are just the beginning of things that we can bolt on as we look to continue to grow that Omega asset.","So we're really excited about the future. And I think that's just a full review of how excited we feel about where we can go with this business.","Operator, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Randall Stanicky.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks guys. I just have a two part question. First, Joe, you have spent a lot of time highlighting your exposure to what I'll characterizes as a much more stable consumer and consumer-facing business. What's your appetite to add more generic exposure outside of a Mylan transaction? And how do you think about formulation technology, geography, and then possible size? Then I have one quick follow-up.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So on the question of what we've done, you're absolutely right. We've built our business. We've done some additional acquisitions, most notably the Omega acquisition. Now that we're sitting at approximately 75% of our revenues are very strong revenues in our consumer-facing business, we think that gives us a very durable platform for the future.","But as I've said in the past our \u2013 I cannot say it more strongly \u2013 that our Rx business is a very unique business. It is a business model with incredible, incredible margins. Most recent RX margins \u2013 let me just get the specific amount, I don't want to give you an inappropriate number \u2013 but the most recent gross margin was 64.8% with a 49.5% operating margin. That's a very unique Rx business.","If I can find additional assets that fit into that \u2013 and that means that there's some degree of difficulty in producing them. For us it has always been extended topicals, things absorbed topically, dermatology, respiratory, nasal, ophthalmic, et cetera, I'm going to continue to look for those types of assets. So I do think there are some out there, and we'll continue to look for them.","So I don't want to limit us only to consumer. I do think there are some Rx assets that would make sense to us as a company, notwithstanding, as you said, the Mylan situation for us.","Is that what you were looking for on the formulation comment?","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just the second, or part B of my one question would be just, you called out on slide 7 the smoking cessation and the store brand growth over national. And I just wanted to get a sense, has GSK come back? Have you seen that impact? And are you growing through that return? And how much of what I think is about a $250 million base for you, how much of that do you think you can hold onto if GSK does return?","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","GSK is back in the marketplace to be clear. And we are continuing to grow through this situation. And as I said in the part of the call it is a very good business, very large business for us. But one that we think has tremendous upside for us in the future, especially now as we've acquired the GSK branded assets, not U.S. assets, but ex U.S. assets, most notably in Europe. We think that gives us another opportunity to grow the product.","One of the unique items about Perrigo is now paired with Omega can do something that Omega couldn't do by itself, Perrigo couldn't do by itself. We could buy those GSK assets that were available in Europe.","So not only do we see it growing here in the United States, as evidenced by the IMS or the IRI data, but also we see the opportunity to grow our smoking cessation category in Europe and around the world. So we're really excited about it. We think we'll continue to grow that business very consistent what we've seen historically.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sumant Kulkarni from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. I'm going to ask my one question plus, plus, plus.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well done, Sumant.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","How much more leverage is there in your system on distribution selling and administrative expense? And where do you see the opportunities for cost reduction if there are any at Perrigo right now?","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I'll start. Judy, you might want to add to what I say. But I guess I'll say we think there's plus, plus, plus opportunity, Sumant.","Specifically what am I saying? First of all on the leverage we're seeing is that there is no doubt that as we do additional M&A, we think there's chances to just get more items on the truck, as we ship our truck from Perrigo to our large retailers. So that's both here in the United States, but also now as we're doing those acquisitions, bolt on acquisition in Europe. So we clearly think there's a chance to leverage additional margin or leverage the P&L.","Second comment I would say is that I don't want to miss the chance to say it one more time. The supply chain team from Perrigo and our entire operational and manufacturing group have just done an outstanding job of just running our facilities very efficiently and finding continuous improvement projects to lower our cost of goods sold. That has given us tremendous leverage in our P&L and especially in the margin structure as I talked about.","Our Consumer Healthcare operating margin this quarter at 21.4% is \u2013 it's certainly an all-time record. And I think really reflects the fact of the team just working very well to take cost out of the system and allow us to leverage what we've done and historically and just do more of it. Judy, anything you want to add?","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The only thing I would elaborate upon is as you're all witnessing dynamic changes in healthcare and life sciences, you're seeing different delivery processes and systems coming about. And our customers and retailers partnering with others to reach patients more efficiently and effectively and broaden the reach of healthcare.","Our supply chain team and distribution folks are already reaching all of those players. So as that dynamism continues we're able to continue to leverage our relationships and our distribution \u2013 physical distribution network to serve these newly-formed entities as well. So that dynamism continues to be served with the assets that we have and the competency that this team has built.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Probably one last comment I'll make before you go to your second part, Sumant, is that often people ask me about the question about, well the retailers are putting more pressure to get better pricing in the marketplace. And that is true.","But please make sure that everyone realizes that we are doing exactly that same thing with our API suppliers. We are putting pressure on them to get better pricing for our raw materials. And I think that's part of what you're seeing here is the \u2013 our ability to take advantage of what've always affectionately referred to as a moat and how we look at our business and how we can continue to seek out additional pricing improvements for our cost of goods sold.","So it's clearly we think an important part of what brought some of this success, and certainly on the legacy business record operating profits. Did you have a second part?","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just on how much cost could come out of the system. But I think you touched upon that.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Okay. Operator, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from David Maris from BMO Capital Markets.","David W. Maris - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. Joe, we agree with you that the offer significantly undervalues Perrigo. But one of the things the Allegan did when they had an unsolicited offer is that they drew a very bright line between the two different business management styles and business models.","Some of that \u2013 done a little bit so far. But today you mentioned a bit about how Perrigo has best in class compliance.","After the earnings being out on the road to talk a little bit about this unsolicited offer, is it your intention to do maybe a stronger job in explaining the differences? Do you see a difference in the corporate cultures?","And then separately if the (35:01) in their favor, do you intend to then reach out to other interested parties? And are there other interested parties? Thank you.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So you asked a lot, David. I'm going to try to get through all of them. So first of all, thank you for your commentary on supporting our position that this offer by Mylan substantially undervalues the Perrigo Company.","On the question of management style, there's no doubt there are differences in the management style of the two companies. I really don't want to go into any of the positives and negatives on this one. There will be a time and place for that should that get to the point.","I think what we've tried to focus on predominantly right now, though, is that we're very proud of what we've accomplished. We're very proud of winning the Corporate Governance large-cap company of the year. That's something that Todd and the entire team worked very hard at accomplishing. And we're very proud of things like that.","We're very proud of our corporate culture and what we've accomplished as a team. The Perrigo team has been together for the most part, this entire team, we've been together for going on nine years now. So it's a team that knows each other very well, knows how to get things done. And importantly delivers on the bottom line.","Yes, we have challenges like any other team. But we've done a great job working together as a team and achieving great results, both for making quality affordable healthcare more affordable for people all over the world.","So we're excited. And as we think about the future, there's even more we think we can do to make this a reality, especially knowing that we think we're in a winning spot in healthcare. We think we've got a durable position over the long term.","If, at some point, the Mylan team wins their shareholder vote, then we can talk more about it at that time. Right now, I think we want to stay focused on continuing to drive our Base Plus Plus Plus strategy for the future.","David W. Maris - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Well, thank you very much.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Operator next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Morning. So first in Consumer, the discontinued sales were unusually high. Can you just give us a little more color on that? Second, Omega, just remind us first of any seasonality in that business. And second, you mentioned distribution. How much are distribution sales relative to like just regular consumer direct product sales? Or maybe I didn't understand it.","And then third in the generics business, just remind us of where we are in this price increase dynamic and how sustainable you feel like those increases are? Thanks.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. I'll probably take the first question on the Consumer Healthcare and the third question. Judy, let me do them both and then you can talk about Omega and the distribution and then the Omega seasonality question.","So on Consumer Healthcare, yes, there are discontinued products. That's a normal part of what we do at Perrigo. Let me try to describe it, because it is a good question, Marc, that you're asking.","As always, we continue to refresh our portfolio to stay even with the national brand equivalent approach to our business. So that means there are changes that occur in the portfolio. So an easy example is in our pet healthcare business. This year, you know we launched our fipronil plus. That is obviously a new product, a very exciting new product for us. And we've done well with it.","Having said that, though, we had a fipronil with nobeloron (38:33) as part of our business, as the result of launching the fipronil plus, we decided that it was appropriate to discontinue the fipronil nobeloron (38:44). When we do that, though, we find ourselves promoting products that are having a national brand equivalent product, which is always good.","Also in that particular case, it's a national brand equivalent product that has a better margin. So that's part of what's driving our bottom line for this business as we shift from one product to the next generation of product. We discontinue the older generation. It's a natural part of what we do at our company. So that's probably the first part of it.","I'm going to go to your third part on generics and pricing, and I'll go back to Judy for the second one. On the generics and the pricing environment, our team has done a great job at looking at pricing, looking at both making money when we're first with our product, which is an example of the AndroGel 1%. And certainly, as I mentioned today, we'll do the same thing with the AndroGel 1.62% when we launch that. So we get good pricing there.","And finally, we get good pricing when we're the last ones with the product, or one of the last few with product. So across that portfolio, we think there's still opportunities to do pricing. We'll continue to look at it. We think there's something that we'll be talking about in the future for pricing.","But I think it really supports the strength of that operating profit line of 49.5% and what we achieved with our Rx business in the quarter. And importantly the gross profit line is 64.8%.","So for those reasons, we think we've got a strong Rx business. And we look to still find some additional pricing opportunities for the future. Judy, you want to talk about the Omega portion of the question?","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Sure. So just backing up, the question was on distribution. So the Omega business has historically had the leading distribution of generics and some branded products out of Belgium from their historical presence there. And on a pro forma go-forward basis, that would represent about 15% of their revenues.","So if you think about in previous calls we talked about a run rate, a full-year annualized run rate, of Omega of about $1.6 billion revenue run rate. About 20% was distribution. And on a go-forward, it would be about 15% go-forward.","And when you talk about seasonality, the June quarter was a very strong quarter, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. They had an important launch in the June quarter. And the distribution sales were also heavily seasonal.","Why? First of all, you have your cough\/cold allergy season coming off, just like in the United States. You have the focus also in the summer of having products available for stocking, because if you know the behavior in Europe, July, August, very, very heavily vacation-oriented. And many of the distribution systems move differently. So you have a little bit more focused seasonality in the June quarter. So it's not unusual for that quarter to be their strongest one in Europe.","So we'll be talking about that on a go-forward basis as well, just like we do for our primarily U.S. Consumer Healthcare business. But suffice it to say, the rest of the run rate for the remainder of the year, slightly lower, new product launch combined with what we expect to be a good, solid second half of the year.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Marc, for you question. Operator, next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you, guys. I'll stick to a two parter. First on CHC, what can you do organically to improve revenue growth trends for CHC? And inorganically do you see acquisitions of size potentially out there for CHC in the U.S.?","And the second part of the question, Joe, was touched on earlier but not addressed head on. Under what circumstances would the board officially explore all strategic options for the company? Or should we assume that's already underway? And I'm curious how that plays into your prediction that there would be a \u2013 quote \u2013 difficult path to completion between that 50% and the 80%? Thanks.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. On the question of organic growth for CHC, Gregg, always \u2013 it's \u2013 there's always going to be some amount of growth relative to just the demographics and population. Just some of growth, it's going to be from national brand switching to store brand.","But the biggest part of the growth and the biggest exciting part of the growth is when we launch those new product. When we have a chance to \u2013 which we hope in very, very near future, certainly over the next 12 months to 24 months \u2013 launch the equivalent of Flonase, launch the equivalent of a Nexium, a Mucinex D, a Mucinex family, Aratozine (43:26) softgel, just to name a few. Those are the big ones that we think will help propel our growth.","And it's why we said with confidence that we expect to launch over $1 billion of new products in the next 3 years, when you put these types of products into the marketplace. We think there's a significant return for our shareholders.","On the question of inorganic Consumer Healthcare growth, yes, we do believe there is some additional bolt-ons that are in categories that we've talked about in the past, adult nutrition, ophthalmics, pet care, diabetes, are the areas where we think we can still support some additional bolt-ons with our business. And as Judy said where we're generating records amount of cash, we think we can use that cash to do some additional bolt-ons and just make our business more valuable to the large retailers.","On the third comment \u2013 or a third part of your question, strategic options. We do believe we have strategic options. Right now we are focused on running our standalone business. We think that's the most important thing to do as a company. And as you can see we're doing it quite well with what we've shown, just a 34% revenue growth, a 48% gross margin growth, and a 35% operating income growth, a 25% EPS growth. We think that's an important part of our success in the standalone, and we're going to continue to focus on that.","If in fact that we get to a point where we think there is a \u2013 if Mylan does win their shareholder vote, and there's initiation of a tender process. At that point we'd make some strategic decisions as a board as to what's the right thing to do for the company. I do know there are other companies that have expressed some conversations to me. But I don't want to go too far too fast. I think we're going to continue to stay focused on what we're doing as a company on a standalone basis.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's helpful color. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Linda Bolton Weiser from B. Riley.","Linda Bolton Weiser - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you. So you gave quite a bit of color on the Omega and the good sales there and the new products and the seasonality. But I was curious about in terms of the new products, do you have a window into like how does 2016 look relative to new product sales? Would it be kind of higher or lower then what we're seeing in 2015?","And then secondly, Joe, if you could just give a little more explanation on the omeprazole magnesium approval? I mean to consumers it's known as Prilosec OTC, and it's kind of transparent to them I think what it's actually made of. So is that going to be a cannibalistic product? Or are you actually going to get more shelf space by putting another product on the shelf? Can you just explain that a little? Thanks.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So let me just start with \u2013 I'll start with some comments on our new product portfolio. And, Judy, if you want to add anything to that please free to do that.","First of all our \u2013 what I think the best thing I can say right now and what we have said out in the marketplace is that we expect $1 billion in new products over the next 3 years. The majority of those products will be on our consumer side as we've said that, just realizing that approximately 75% of our revenue is on the consumer side. Admittedly that's looking at both Omega and Perrigo together. But that majority of it will be on the consumer side.","The only final comment I would say is while we have not given individual year-by-year commentary, we do expect the new product flow to be approximately a third, a third, and a third. Now it may move from year to year just simply as FDA approvals come in. But it's approximately a third, a third, and a third is the way I would characterize it. Obviously a little bit more in the outer years, but the approximation a third, a third, and a third.","On the question of omeprazole magnesium we think it's important. It's not \u2013 it would be the very first omeprazole magnesium tablet product in the marketplace. As to how we launch that product and what we do with the product, I think we're going to continue to weigh our options on that. But to be clear it is the very first tablet formulation that is omeprazole magnesium equivalent to Prilosec OTC.","Our product continues to perform very well. So I don't want to overpromise for this product. But it is an optional alternative for us to think about as we think about the future marketplace for our equivalent of Prilosec. Judy, anything else you wanted to comment on on the new products? Or...","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Just wanted to make sure \u2013 a little color there, Linda. As Joe said we've hit $1 billion in new products, think a third, a third, a third. Talking greater than $300 million next year, but that is without Omega.","At this stage we're still in the process of scrubbing and making sure that as we defined the plan for new products that we're hitting the same definition. But suffice it to say that the team has quite a long list of new products opportunities both organically as well as their plans for putting in product that is currently in the I'll call it U.S. consumer portfolio and plugging that into their format. Which as we've talked about is a key driver of long-term future revenue growth within the Omega platform.","So we haven't called that number out yet. As we get better clarity we will. But suffice it to say that will be accretive to the $1 billion we've talked about.","Linda Bolton Weiser - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Elliot Wilbur from Raymond James.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. And you've touched on this subject matter I guess a couple times, but maybe we could explore it in a little bit more detail. Because I do think it's an important trend break and certainly we'll entertain questions about durability.","But specifically the gross margin performance in the Consumer Healthcare segment, obviously a record level and well above recent performance trends. And certainly Perrigo of nonbelievers I guess over the years have sort of pointed to absence of margin expansion even with growth. And this quarter obviously stands out as a dramatic exception just sort of that trend.","And just thinking about a couple of the push\/pull factors here, specifically the discontinued products. I would assume that those were relatively low margin. And also the continued shrinkage of the contract manufacturing business. Those had positive impacts on margin trends, but you also talked about operating efficiencies as well. So maybe just a little bit more granularity there so that we could perhaps understand the durability of the performance this quarter going forward?","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So, Elliot, you actually know our business very well. I congratulate you. You've touched on them. I mean I...","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I'm clearly \u2013 I come \u2013 I'm for sale, Joe, at the right price. Just throw that out there.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So getting back to the question, the gross profit, absolutely. I mean you hit on it. Very \u2013 product mix was important. We sold more of the higher margin, less of the lower margin items. That obviously has an impact on revenue as you appropriately point out. But we think that's important that we continue to stay equivalent to the national brands. So we follow those national brands very closely. As we get better products in the marketplace we discontinue some products that are just not as valuable.","Number two for us on this question of mix is as the brands switch from a standard tablet to a fast dissolve, we want to be there. We want to be there with \u2013 for example we just got the Advil quick dissolve or fast release product approved. That's another example of a brand going after a new formulation. We're following, we're following quickly. We'll have that product. And to our knowledge we're the only one with that product approval. That will be another example of an upside opportunity for us relative to margin.","So those are things that we do on the margin side for \u2013 yes, we discontinue products. But importantly we try to launch new products that are national brand equivalent that have better a margin structure.","On the other point of it clearly though is the operating efficiency of the team, both from just the continuous improvement projects. We have hundreds of continuous improvement projects that we run through the team. We've tried very hard to make that a part of our DNA at the company. And indeed I think we've had success doing that. And we'll continue to look to try to get operating leverage in our P&L.","As a final point you didn't mention, I do want to make point of it though is that very much as our customers have come to us for pricing discounts and rebates, et cetera, we've done the same thing with our supply chain. We've said to our raw materials suppliers, listen, we can get some incremental business by working with large customer X. If we do that and can do some things can we get some additional discounts on our cost of goods? And indeed we've had success doing that. And we think that's going to be an important part of our future, to your question on what we're thinking about in our future. Judy, anything I left out?","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So it was a tremendous margin quarter, there is no doubt. As I commented on earlier, we are still looking at having a very strong margin quarter for the consumer business as Joe pointed out.","This quarter was particularly good with the volumes and the amazing manufacturing efficiencies that we saw. It really translated into a bump in those margins. And we expect them to be strong through the year. But as I commented margin wise it would be the strongest quarter for the calendar year. But looking still overall a strong performance in gross profit for the year.","And then on an operating margin basis, again operating margin as well, second quarter strongest. It's just with timing of R&D spend that the SG&A cost savings and efficiencies that the team saw in this quarter we expect to continue throughout the rest of the calendar year as well.","So good lean operating efficiency of the overall team both on a sales and marketing side and on manufacturing have continued to contribute to the ability of the team, even with some dynamism on the top line that you saw to be able to execute well on the bottom line.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Operator next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gerberry from Leerink Partners.","Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So just curious on Omega I think you provided the growth of the top 20 brands year on year. Just kind of curious if you'd be willing to provide the year-on-year growth relative to the prior year quarter?","And then, Joe, just curious with Pfizer terminating the Lipitor OTC switch program, just curious your updated thoughts on whether there's life for the statins in the OTC channel? Thanks.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I don't know. We haven't given out specific numbers on Omega for its growth, but it is double digits I think is probably the way I'd refresh \u2013 rephrase the question.","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So on a constant currency basis the top 20 were 11% year-over-year. For the whole portfolio directionally mid-teens would have been the year-over-year growth. You've got some noise in there with foreign currency, et cetera, et cetera, but approximately 14%, 15%.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And the second part of the question was on statins and Pfizer's decision on Lipitor. I think as I've always said I never thought it was 100% chance of probability. I did say 60\/40.","It appears though that the results of the Pfizer clinical trial did not result in patients going on to see their healthcare providers. I think in that situation it's probably unlikely that statins will come to the marketplace. I can't rule out somebody else will try it with a new refreshment and view on it. But I think based on this last attempt by Pfizer, I think it's probably unlikely that we'll see statins in the near future come to the marketplace for OTC.","Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Annabel Samimy from Stifel.","Annabel E. Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just touch on CHC a bit more. You kind of answered this, but it was supposed to be a big animal health quarter, as you were selling into the channel for the season. And it seems like there was actually some declines. And you had mentioned that you had switched over product.","But as you look at animal health is there as big \u2013 is it as big an upside opportunity as you expected? And to what extent do you need to supplement Consumer Health in general with inorganic growth? And are you placing more priority on Omega right now and growing European consumer side as opposed to the U.S. consumer side?","And just a separate question on guidance clarification. It does or does not include the GSK products and the German nutritionals? Thanks.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So I think I got about five parts question in there. I think I'll try to get them all.","On the question of animal health. Animal health performed reasonable, but it did have a problem. The problem was that \u2013 it was Merial. Merial's influence on two parts of it. One part of it was clearly the introduction of that second store brand equivalent product that which we believed \u2013 continue to believe is a breach of our agreement. We'll find out. And play that out in the court system at some point into the future.","The second part of the animal health story, they also had some contract manufacturing business. That is part of what we saw. The base business, though, in terms of what we do every day, store brand, selling our fipronil plus product, continues to perform well. But we do have some things we have to offset.","On the question of the switchovers, we expect to see more products continue to go over-the-counter or be available for us in terms of those flea and tick products. And the team is doing a good job to get the equivalent of those products into the marketplace and to continue to refresh that pipeline of R&D efforts on the pet care side.","On the question of the doing additional \u2013 I think this part was additional bolt-ons for the U.S. business. We clearly think there was more opportunity there. And then the second part?","Annabel E. Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Are you prioritizing Omega over the bolt-ons in the U.S. I guess?","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The good news is I don't think we need to prioritize. Well, we have to clearly prioritize. I should say that. We have to prioritize.","But I think we have the resources now to do both. I think with what we can do in both in the European platform and the U.S. platform, we have the capabilities based on cash flow. But, Judy, why don't you comment on that part?","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then, on the Omega modeling question in the guidance. As I said, the June quarter is the largest quarter for the year, a slower September quarter with the summer months and summer holidays, people being away from home. But combined with the expectation that we would expect to be closing on our two recently-announced acquisitions in that September quarter, which then means that we have said we have put approximately $25 million of sales associated with the combination of those two transactions in the fourth quarter of the year.","So there is, in fact, an amount of $25 million included in the guidance and in our forecast for those two acquisitions and Omega.","Annabel E. Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks.","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Operator, next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","Emil Chen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. This is actually Emil on for Dave. Just a quick question, you mentioned priority in consumer. Can you discuss the prioritization in terms of inorganic versus organic? Do you guys view in these that you need to do something inorganically in the near term, especially against the stock out of $1 billion over the next three years organically? Thank you.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think probably the best way I answer that question is based on our history. I think we've always sought to have a balance of both the organic and inorganic in our growth. And I think we'll continue to look at that.","We think doing both is really the best answer for any company out there. So we'll seek to do the inorganic to be clear, looking at those bolt-on transactions. We think they're very valuable and very accretive to our shareholders. So we'll continue to look at those.","But the important comment about what we do every day here at Perrigo is try to find a quality product, make it more affordable, and use our research and development efforts to come out with the new product flow. I mean I think just my commentary on new products for us is really critical. As I said, to my recollection, this is an all-time record of having in one week three ANDA approvals from the FDA.","But look at what they are. They are products that \u2013 AndroGel 1.62%, first to file. Advil fast release, to our knowledge, also first to file, and certainly will be out there first approval for sure. Omeprazole magnesium, yes, we launched an omeprazole base product into the marketplace going back now almost seven years ago. But we are not content to just sit there. And we want to continue to go after the national brand equivalent.","We have those opportunities. We're going to continue to take them to make sure we make a quality product, make it more affordable for society, both here in the United States and around the world. And that's what we think is really exciting and motivating to us as a company.","Operator, I think I have time for maybe one more question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Judy, I have a question for you and then a follow-up for you, Joe. When you talked about the second half of the year with each of the businesses, you threw a little bit of cold water in terms of expecting higher expenses, lower margins, et cetera. Or that second quarter was sort of a peak. Are you blessing the lower end of the $7.50 to $8 guidance range? And what are the key variables to that $0.50 difference?","And then just, Joe, a follow-up and maybe this is not a fair question, but I think we're all trying to get at this. In the absence of a white knight investor for Perrigo, how do you drive upside to your share price as a standalone company? Just based on consensus estimates, the stock trades at a 24 multiple now on this year's earnings, a 22 multiple on next year's, which is comparable to Celgene.","And clearly, while you've done a great job with deal activity and top line growth, if you strip out Omega, there was no top line growth this quarter. So how do you think about driving upside from a multiple as high as it is, in the absence of consolidation, where Perrigo is involved? Thanks.","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I will take your first part first. So I never like to throw cold water on anything, that's such a downer. I just wanted to make sure...","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Well, this is your opportunity to clarify that. Thank you.","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","All right, all sunshine. So just wanted to make sure that everyone had a line of sight in helping you be able to model, because, as you know, we don't go out and give detailed quarterly guidance. We try to give you an idea of how to shape the arc of the year. And also we have this new vernacular as we're switching over and going into calendar year mode.","If you were to lay out, as I'm sure you have in your models, the overall margin dynamics for our component businesses, you see the seasonality really reflected more in consumer-facing businesses, just because of consumer-facing behavior. And we're certainly seeing this in Omega as well, is that the June quarter is historically the highest quarter. There's just a lot of volume movement through the plants, as we both are selling through as well as preparing for fall launches.","You see slower, typically slower, sales in the September quarter, because of the vacation season, which is even exacerbated and seen more in our new European business. And it's just important. Also, we have a lot of activities going on usually in ramping up with new lines and new production in the end of the December quarter typically. So there are many normal recurring behaviors that go on in the second six months of any calendar year.","And it was also very important, I had to call out, just because of the inclusion now of Omega in our pool of earnings before tax, that if your model had had 17% effective tax rate for every quarter, our model has 18.5% in the back half of the calendar year. Because of this dynamic as I said before about the requirement in doing the accounting \u2013 very boring accounting discussion here \u2013 of how one must book effective tax rate. You have to take the blended rate, forecasted for the reporting period. And as you know, because we're in this stub year transition, the U.S. GAAP \u2013 quote \u2013 full year reporting is the 6-month stub period ending December. So that stub period accounting will be more at an 18.5% range.","So that is why just to give you color on how to think about the shape of the full 12 months and the seasonality therein. That is why I wanted to \u2013 it sounded like cold water \u2013 but just making sure you had a crisp way of viewing. So that you weren't overstating or getting ahead of just the shape of the year and confirming the guidance that we've provided already.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","On your first part \u2013 or second part of your question, Jami, the issue for me really goes back to how do we continue \u2013 as a standalone company how do we continue to be successful? And I think really the best way to say it is it's that Base Plus Plus Plus approach.","Looking at what we're talking about there. Clearly new products. Just getting three new approvals this week I think just is a great illustrative example of what we \u2013 why we're excited about it, why we think \u2013 if I could add $1 billion of new products over the next 3 years into our portfolio, we think that's going to be an important part of driving both top line and our bottom line, because as you know our new products tend to be more profitable.","Number two, I know that clearly we always look at quarter versus a year ago. But if you think about what we've done sequentially, our Consumer Healthcare business is up $61 million or approximately 9% sequentially if you go from quarter one to quarter two. So I know that that's not always the way you look at it. But I do think sequential is another important part of the consideration as terms of the direction of what we're trying to accomplish.","Number three, for me this is the first quarter that we've had a chance to talk about Omega. Omega we think is tremendously important to our future and what we're looking to try to accomplish as we take those businesses and we get the revenue synergies and the cost of goods sold synergies in Omega. We think that's going to be an important part of it. And obviously as Judy talked about the business has done quite well in the quarter. And we expect to see great things from Omega.","Final comment I offer and it really is \u2013 it reflects on also on what Judy was talking about for our cash generation. We're generating a significant amount of cash. We intend to put that cash back to work in M&A. Expect to see more of the bolt-on transactions that we think are going to be very accretive to our shareholders. And we believe that's going to help us tremendously. Not just the GSK asset, the Yokebe asset, but the other assets that we think are out there and will fit very good with both our European businesses as well as our U.S. business.","So that's the excitement we see. That's why we're very passionate about our standalone business and what we think are great prospects for the future.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Operator thank you very much. And everyone thank you very much for your interest today. We appreciate it. If there's any other \u2013 we'll have a chance to follow-up over the next days and weeks ahead. If there's any questions, please get in touch with Art Shannon or Brad Joseph, who will be happy to try to answer anything further. Have a great day everyone.","Operator","This is the end of today's call. You may now disconnect."],"17032":["Perrigo (NYSE:PRGO) Q1 2014 Earnings Call October 31, 2013 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Arthur J.

Shannon","Go Sox.","Joseph C. Papa","I know some of you may have questions regarding our definitive agreement to acquire Elan. As you know, under Irish Takeover Rules, we are limited in our ability to discuss forward-looking information. On the expectation that the transaction will close by the end of calendar 2013, we expect the transaction to be at least $0.10 accretive to fiscal year '14 standalone Perrigo adjusted earnings per share. In our fiscal 2015, we expect the transaction to be between $0.70 and $0.80 accretive to standalone Perrigo adjusted earnings per share. I will be happy to take any additional questions regarding Elan transaction during the Q&A.","Today, we're going to spend the majority of the time focused on standalone Perrigo first quarter earnings. So in the next few minutes, I will provide a few comments on the quarter. Next, Judy will go through the details of the results from the fiscal first quarter, then I will provide an overview on each business area, plus expectations for the rest of the fiscal year. Following this, I will provide you an opportunity for a Q&A.","First, let's discuss the fiscal first quarter. On Slide 7, you can see that this was another great quarter for Perrigo, demonstrating the strength of our platform. Our quarterly performance is highlighted by all-time record net sales of $933 million, record adjusted gross profit, record operating margins and record first quarter adjusted diluted EPS.","Moving on to Slide 8, you can see the data for our first quarter by business segment. Consolidated Perrigo grew the top line 21%, with double-digit growth in every business unit. What you can't see here is that the consolidated organic revenue growth was 13%. The strong performance was driven by great execution across all business segments.","Moving to our individual business segments. Consumer Healthcare grew 20% to over $538 million in sales. More than half of this growth was led by base business growth and the $17 million of new products and, of course, sales from the animal health acquisitions. The strength of our core business continue to impress in what is traditionally a very light first quarter. Our Nutritionals segment grew 25%. That's the second straight quarter of double-digit growth. We believe consumer acceptance of the new SmarTub container continues to gain traction. Our Rx segment once again achieved record results, growing sales by 25% and adjusted operating income growth of 34%.","As you can see on Slide 9, store brand continues to gain market share versus the national brand across most categories, especially diabetes and infant formula. Looking at infant formula, this category was up 2.7%, with national brands up slightly, but store brands grew 7.7%.","On Slide 10, you can see the strength in store brand market share growth in the infant formula category. Just in the past quarter, store brand gained 45 basis points just in the last quarter.","With that, let me turn it over to Judy.","Judy L. Brown","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and happy Halloween. I'm very pleased to be able to share with you some more financial color on the terrific start to our fiscal 2014 this morning. I'll move directly into the business segment, starting on Slide 11.","Consumer Healthcare's fiscal first quarter net sales increased a very healthy 20% year-over-year due to a combination of: An increase in sales of existing products of $40 million, primarily in the analgesic and cough\/cold categories; new product sales of $17 million, primarily in the cough\/cold and smoking cessation categories; and $42 million attributable to the acquisitions of Sergeant's and Velcera. Specifically, sales in the cough\/cold category, which include the recently launched store brand version of Mucinex 600-milligram extended release tablets, were up an impressive 22% year-over-year.","Additionally, despite the return to market of a major national manufacturer, sales within our analgesics category were up almost 16% year-over-year due to strong end consumer demand. The combined sales increase of $99 million was partially offset by a year-over-year decline of $7 million in sales of existing products, mainly in the contract category and $3 million in discontinued products.","The 90-basis-point increase in adjusted gross margin was driven by acquisitions, new products, product mix, stable pricing and strong volumes across the broad CHC portfolio. We invested more in Consumer Healthcare R&D projects versus the first quarter last year and DSG&A spend was a slightly higher percentage of net sales after the inclusion of Sergeant's and Velcera expenses versus this time last year. As a result of these investments and the absence of a $3 million indemnification settlement payment the company received in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, adjusted operating margin decreased slightly year-over-year.","On Slide 12, you can see that net sales within the Nutritionals segment increased 25% year-over-year, as existing product sales rose $21 million and new product sales were $5 million. In the spirit of full transparency, I'd like to remind you that our first quarter of fiscal 2013 was negatively impacted by an incremental $10 million of retail shipments at the end of June 2012 in advance of our planned July 1, 2012 shutdown of our Vermont Plant. Even if you were to include the additional sales from the planned shift, the Nutritionals category still grew a very impressive 14% year-over-year, driven by strong consumer acceptance of our new SmarTubs in the U.S. and growth of retail sales in Canada.","The adjusted gross margin in the Nutritionals segment decreased 170 basis points due to a larger contribution of sales from the lower margin VMS and toddler foods category. The adjusted operating margin expanded due to DSG&A leverage on increased volume.","Now turning to Slide 13. You can see that the Rx team's streak continues, as this business had yet another phenomenal quarter. Net sales growth of 25% was due primarily to net sales of $23 million from the Rosemont and Fera acquisitions, new product sales of approximately $15 million and robust gains in our organic Rx business. In fact, net sales, excluding the contribution from the acquisitions, grew an impressive 11% year-over-year. In Rx, the team was able to once again dramatically expand margins as the overall strength of the base business continued to be evident this quarter. Adjusted operating margin grew less than the adjusted gross margin as we invested more this quarter in R&D versus last year.","Next, on Slide 14, you'll see that API's first quarter net sales increased by $7 million, driven by new product sales of $17 million, primarily from the recent U.S. launch of the generic version of Temodar, offset by the anticipated decrease in existing product sales of $11 million due to expected increased competition on select products. As noted previously, we plan only limited new product launches beyond temozolomide as we shift our investments more to projects which will allow further vertical integration in our portfolio and expect natural competitive dynamics to impact the rest of the existing portfolio. Over the long term, you should continue to expect third-party API revenues to begin to decrease while, at the same time, intercompany sales to Consumer Healthcare and Rx will be ramping up.","Now some quick highlights on the balance sheet. Excluding cash and cash equivalents, working capital was $807 million at the end of the quarter, up from $639 million at this time last year. The increase in working capital is primarily driven from working capital needs associated with seasonal sales, acquisitions and timing of certain accounts payable payments.","As of September 28, 2013, total current and long-term debt on the face of the balance sheet was $2 billion, essentially flat sequentially from last quarter. Excluding cash and cash equivalents, our net debt to total capital at the end of our first quarter fiscal 2014 was 32.1%.","Net cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $99 million, up $54 million from the first quarter fiscal 2013. We spent $40 million this quarter on capital expenditures, focused on continuing expansion in our Holland and Allegan, Michigan facilities to keep up with increased customer demand and to prepare for expected Rx-to-OTC switch products, as well as our expansion in Israel, related to future generic launches and increased volumes for Consumer Healthcare products we manufacture there.","On Slides 15 and 16, you'll see we're not making any changes to Perrigo's standalone guidance for fiscal 2014. Once again, the team performed extremely well, but we have no time to rest on our laurels. We are deep into a jampacked fiscal 2014. The normal cough\/cold\/flu season is just kicking off, multiple launches are awaiting greenlight, construction projects are getting the full advantage of a terrific Indian summer and the conclusion of several integration processes for our new businesses is at hand. A dedicated team is working hard to prepare fully for the close of our proposed acquisition of Elan by the end of the calendar year, readying our teams for the opportunities ahead. Our commitment to our core values and our humble roots will remain, all while we continue our mission of providing evermore quality health care products to an ever increasing number of patients worldwide, with an evermore substantive balance sheet and investment-grade profile.","Now I'd like to turn the call back to Joe.","Joseph C. Papa","Thank you, Judy. I'd now like to just provide some additional thoughts on the business and going forward. First, the same 3 mega trends continue to drive our business: It's the movement of consumers and retailers from national brand to store brand products; second, it is the continued switching of prescription products to over-the-counter status; and third, the continued introduction of new product launches.","As demonstrated on Slide 9, the market continues to move to store brand. In fact, store brands today represent 35% of the OTC market. In addition, Rx-to-OTC switches are expected to continue with $10 billion of branded Rx sales likely to switch in the next 5 years, with over $5 billion of that expected in the next 3 years, emphasizing some very significant attractive growth opportunity. We have all seen new categories making the switch, like overactive bladder and nasal steroids, with Nasacort OTC recently receiving FDA approval. Further, our company is poised to leverage new store brand offerings from our Animal Health business, upgraded better than national brand packaging for our infant formula and continued very strong Rx growth.","In regards to our third mega trend, new products, the pipeline for our fiscal 2014 looks very robust. We anticipate launching over 75 new products across all segments, contributing more than $190 million in revenue for the coming fiscal year.","Within any given quarter or year, there are a number of factors that affect our Consumer Healthcare business, and I'd like to discuss a couple of these with you right now. Within the liquid cough\/cold space, a major branded manufacturer recently limited their shipments of nighttime and daytime cough\/cold liquid products. Though it's too early to specifically assess any impact to us at this time, we will keep you posted on any further developments.","As Judy just mentioned, the launch of store brand Mucinex 600 mg ER is off to a great start. We continue to work with one of our vendors to maintain a sufficient supply of raw materials for this product. However, recent API batches received did not meet our rigorous, high quality, internal specifications. The team is working very diligently right now to resolve this supply disruption as quickly as possible. To be clear, we are still shipping store brand Mucinex, but we will experience a gap in our ability to manufacture guaifenesin until this is resolved.","Turning to Slide 18. You can see that our Nutritional business has numerous growth drivers in the coming year. A key highlight here is the introduction of the upgraded national brand style packaging, the SmarTub. As of July 2013, the company has successfully transitioned 100% of its core items at U.S. retail customers to the new plastic container.","Moving on to the growth opportunities in our Rx segment. On Slide 19, you can see that we continue to be very well positioned. Over the past few months, we have launched 4 new products with combined branded sales of nearly $360 million. We have a robust pipeline of 28 ANDAs pending FDA approval, representing approximately $4.2 billion in branded sales. This includes 7 confirmed first-to-file ANDAs.","Additionally, on Slide 20, we have a healthy leadership position across multiple technologies. We have the only FDA-approved generic topical foams.","In our API business segment, we are very excited about the U.S. launch of generic Temodar, which is a very meaningful product to our portfolio with a first-to-file exclusivity. As you can see from the results this quarter, the launch is going very well.","In summary, on Slide #21, Perrigo is poised for continued strong growth with a great start to our fiscal year '14. Standalone Perrigo is expected to grow adjusted earnings per share by 13% to 18% this coming year over last year's record performance. The business remains strong, and we look forward to closing the acquisition of Elan by the end of the calendar year. Once the company is combined, we will have a more enhanced platform for longer-term growth as we continue to execute on our mission of making quality health care more affordable to consumers.","Operator, let's now open the call for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Annabel Samimy with Stifel.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I had several, but maybe we can start with the guidance. You had some spectacular growth in each of your segments, and the guidance hasn't changed. So is some of that growth catch-up from last year, especially, I guess, in Nutritionals? Or is there just something that you're expecting later on in the year that's going to drag that down?","Joseph C. Papa","Well, first of all, thank you very much for the kind comments on the quarter. We are very excited. I think there was just great execution by the 9,000-plus Perrigo employees around the world. Relative to our guidance comment, for us right now, the big important factor for us is to get the Elan transaction closed, which, as we stated, we expect by the end of the calendar year. I think after that is closed, we expect to have more to say about -- after the Elan close, but I think right now, as we look at -- it's early in the year. We're excited by what the future holds, but I think we want to really focus right now on getting the Elan close at this time. And that was really the commentary on the guidance.","Judy L. Brown","I would echo the same thoughts as Joe did. We always said that the second half of the year has the effect of new products continuing throughout the year. And frankly, to Joe's point, given all of the things going on right now, we felt it prudent at this time to remain with the current guidance as they've been.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can you just tell us on some of your recent acquisitions, such as Rosemont, Fera or any of the pet care products? Are those tracking in line with your expectations? And particularly for pet care, are you now at a point with the regional approvals where you feel better about the growth rate going forward?","Joseph C. Papa","I'd say, in general, that we believe all the acquisitions in general are tracking close to our expectations, some ahead, some behind. But if you look at across the businesses, we feel very good about what they mean. We think the Pet Care business is still -- we still believe is a $200 million business. We believe it will grow at a high-single-digit growth rate. Until we introduce the store brand offering of our flea and tick products -- once we introduce store brand flea and tick, we think it has a chance to go into a double-digit growth rate. I will say, and I said publicly, we did have a little softer Animal Health business. And it was predominantly because of a lesser flea and tick season as a result of the weather. It wasn't as strong of a flea and tick season as perhaps the previous year, but that's just all normal seasonal variation that occurs within the business. The rest of the Rosemont and the Fera, the acquisition of ophthalmics, they're both contributing significantly to our business. There's going to be some ups and downs, but we're very pleased with the total performance of our M&A projects.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. If I can ask one more, just on Nasacort, we all saw the approval for Sanofi of the OTC version. Now we don't know if they have exclusivity yet or not, but how quickly could you launch that product if they indeed don't have exclusivity?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. It's a great question. And I have to say it right at the onset, right now, it's not entirely clear on the exclusivity position right now. However, having said that, I will say that I have looked at the Nasacort approval letter that was published on the FDA website. At this time, in the approval letter, there is no statement on exclusivity for the 3-year exclusivity, no 3-year market exclusivity. Can't say exactly if that will be the final disposition of this question. But at this point, we did not see it in the FDA approval letter. As you know, we received an approval for the Nasacort product with our partner and launched that product approximately 2 years ago in June. We've been out in the marketplace. We had previously fought the patent litigation on that product. Got the product approved. Got it to the marketplace approximately 2 years ago. So we do have the product available. It simply would be required for us to get a supplement approved to switch our product to OTC status. And depending on whether there's a 3-year exclusivity, we will be able to move very quickly or after that 3-year exclusivity. But at this time, we do not see any specific mention of a market exclusivity in the approval letter for the Nasacort OTC.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I don't know if you can comment, but Royalty Pharma issued a press release that they're holding a debt-raising call this afternoon. Is that something that you can comment on?","Joseph C. Papa","This is probably not something we can make a specific comment on what Royalty Pharma's plans are at this time. I think all I can say about the Elan transaction is that we continue to make progress on it. And we, I think, have a -- there is a vote for the Perrigo shareholders and the Elan shareholders both scheduled for November 18, and at that point we look forward to going forward, but having -- assuming a positive vote. But really, there's nothing that we can say specific to what Royalty Pharma's plans are at this time. And that the only other comment I'd mentioned is what we said in the call. Our expectation this will close at the end of our -- the current calendar year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Chiang with CRT Capital.","Timothy Chiang - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I sort of wanted to get your thoughts on just the overall story for Perrigo. I mean, heading into next year and assuming the Elan deal closes, could you talk a little bit about what your priorities are going to be? Do you think that more acquisitions are certainly something that you're thinking about? And how do you sort of roll that into your existing business?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. I'll start and then Judy, please fill in. I think, first and foremost, I would comment that I believe that the basic mega drivers, mega trends that drive Perrigo's business will continue to be the same. Those mega trends that I mentioned before, with the movement of national brand product to store brand, consumers continuing to move from national brand to store brand. The second mega trend is this movement of Rx to OTC, switching to OTC. We continue to see that happening. And we expect that to continue to happen, specifically with products like Oxytrol and the Nasacort OTC. And then additional products, of course, like the Nexium product and other products that we previously talked about. And the third part for us has been, we continue focusing on new products. We have over $190 million planned for this year. We continue to want to launch these new products. We think they're going to be the mega driver for us to continue to be successful, to grow both the top line, but also grow the operating margin for the business as demonstrated in this current quarter. I would simply say that, historically, our business has been -- we've been able to grow on a compound annual growth rate. Approximately half of the growth has come from organic and the other half has come from acquisitions. We continue to believe that will be an important part of our business going forward. I will say that -- and as Judy has said publicly, and I've said publicly, that until we get -- once we close the Elan transaction, we will increase our debt at that time, and then we will seek to bring that leverage down to a more normal level. But Judy, maybe you want to comment on that and other areas of it.","Judy L. Brown","Absolutely. After the close, of course, we'll talk more about long-term utilization of cash and, to Joe's point, our commitment to that investment-grade profile. And de-levering quickly after close in the next 12, 18, 24 months is going to be an imperative for us as we continue to look out in the field at opportunities, to Joe's point, to expand into adjacent categories, new geographies, et cetera. So same themes on a larger basis, and we'll be able to elaborate in more detail with some real data behind it in the coming calendar year.","Timothy Chiang - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Joe and Judy, just maybe one follow-up. It looked like your margins did quite well across the board. And can you just say -- I mean, is this all driven by new products? Or is there some seasonality with your business right here?","Joseph C. Papa","I think there's a couple of different areas. I'll start with -- as a general comment, the operating margin of the business have continued to go up. And it's really because we continue to bring out new products, as well as some of the acquisitions we've been able to do that essentially put more products on the trucks as we send those trucks to our large retail customers. And so, a little bit from the new products, both organically, as well as those that we've acquired through acquisition of things like the pet care, the infant formula business have been big drivers to it. Judy, anything you'd add to that?","Judy L. Brown","High level of execution across the business units, I think, to a tee. We saw increased productivity across our manufacturing sites. We were humming along from a productivity perspective. Pricing initiatives were well received this quarter. And so you really get into the dynamic of a combination of all those fronts. When I made make my prepared remarks, I said in most of the businesses, it was a combination of a lot of positive factors. So really, we've seen the margin expansion by doing what we say we're always going to do, which is go after critical operating execution, as well as, obviously, bringing new products to market.","Operator","Your next question comes from Elliot Wilbur with Needham & Company.","Elliot Wilbur - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a question for Joe, I suppose, and maybe going back to your earlier commentary around Nasacort. I understand it's very early in the game, and we're in a bit of uncharted territory here. But curious to your thoughts on sort of the market potential for a product like that. I guess sort of talking to folks, it seems like the expectation is, \"Well, this might be couple of hundred million dollar brand. And then, obviously, at some point it's a high value target opportunity for Perrigo.\" But I think if you look at the performance of generic fluticasone in the market over the past 5 years or so ever since that product went generic, I mean, it would suggest that there's potentially a massive market out there for a value brand in the OTC nasal steroid market. So I'm just wondering, you guys have really kind of had a chance to do sort of a deep dive at this point on what you think the overall market opportunity may be.","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. So a great question, Elliot. And it's been very much a topic for discussion within Perrigo. First of all, I'd say that you're seeing a couple of things. Number one, you're seeing the real benefit of us being both a generic Rx company, as well as an OTC company in that we brought out this product as a generic prescription product. Nasacort, before it went OTC, have the product in our portfolio and can now switch the product as this product becomes available. And I think that's really one of the great synergies that we have within the Perrigo story. And if you think about it, we started that product going back 6, 7, 8 years ago and, in fact, have had it in the marketplace for a couple of years before the product even went OTC. So I think that would be my first comment. I think the second comment I'd offer, though, is that it really, we think, gives us a chance to look at the entire class of product. Because one of the things that you rightly point out is that, this is important for Nasacort, absolutely correct, and this product going OTC. But we've looked at the nasal allergy opportunity. And while Nasacort is a couple of hundred -- $300 million-type product, the category is over $2.5 billion of branded sales. We think that what importantly here has happened is that the nasal steroid Nasacort has approved -- been approved for OTC status. It may open up the entire category for other nasal spheroid products to move from prescription to OTC. So we think that's an important characteristic. The second reason why we're very excited about Nasacort opportunity. It's really important for Nasacort, but importantly, it opens up the rest of the category. And I think the final thing I would say is that, we've done a very comprehensive review of what happens to products when they move from prescription to OTC. It was mostly led by our knowledge of what's happened with the non-sedating antihistamines. And as we looked at the non-sedating antihistamines and follow that category, to see even for a product like Cetirizine. We know that once the Cetirizine molecule went from prescription to OTC, the demand for the Cetirizine molecule rose dramatically by a factor of more than 2 to 3x what the usage was as a prescription. So those are the characteristics we're following and the ones that make us very excited about this Nasacort opportunity.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Judy, just a follow-up on the operating margins within the Consumer Healthcare business. You did provide a very good explanation, but I just wanted to follow-up. The margins came in a little bit below a year ago. And I'm actually kind of surprised just given the significant revenue beat, and the fact that the revenue beat came from your in-line products, not the animal health products, where it sounds to me like, including those acquisitions actually put a little bit of pressure on the margin. So if you can talk about that. What the pushes and pulls were? And why, just considering the significant revenue, the operating margins weren't better? And then, I see you're reiterating your operating margin guidance for the full year of 18% to 22%. Clearly, that suggests a back-end loaded contribution from operating margin. If you could talk to that as well. And just to confirm, are you still expecting a stronger back half here given the strong performance we saw in the first quarter?","Judy L. Brown","Sure. Wow, that was a -- hopefully, get that question.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry about that.","Judy L. Brown","Okay. I'll try and be methodical about it. So let's start with Consumer Healthcare margins. You saw that gross margins did in fact expand quarter-over-quarter. We saw some slight contraction sequentially. So the growth quarter-over-quarter, Q1 last year to Q1 this year, driven by base business expansion and acquisitions primarily. So you have the other -- the bucket of other initiatives I commented on. On a sequential basis, we did see a slight decrease because of the fact, frankly, as happens, timing on seasonality with animal health, animal health being more of a brand-type margin structure, you saw the impact in gross margins because of that. So just -- that was the explanation on the quarter-over-quarter. Dropping then down to operating margin. You are also spot on. It was a 30-basis-point decline year-over-year on Q1 operating margin. And that was entirely the effect of the fact that we chose to make a 20% increase, all-time record spend in R&D in the Consumer Healthcare segment. And without that increase, we actually would've seen operating margin expansion. But we had good projects on deck and didn't see the need to hold off on those just for the cosmetic of that particular quarter's operating margin. We do expect the operating margin, our forecasted operating margin expanding over the course of the year. And as my earlier comments for the entire company, when we talked about the full year, there is a back half weight that comes with, again, the pileup of new products compounding over the course of the year. So that is still part of our planning as we look at the full year. So looking at the strong margin performance, we feel very good about where we came out for this quarter across our businesses, and we maintained the guidance overall on our margins for each of the business segments. So I know that your model is sophisticated enough to be able to work that through and know that our operating margin this quarter was specifically impacted by the timing in R&D.","Operator","And your next question comes from Greg Gilbert with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a two-parter for Joe and Judy. For Joe, hopefully you can comment on this is as someone looking at Tysabri as someone that doesn't own it yet. But can you comment on your confidence in the growth of that royalty stream as it relates to your previous guidance comments in light of some near term growth headwinds on the product? And for Judy, does the new improved tax structure that you will hopefully secure change your long-term view on what appropriate leverage should be for Perrigo? Your leverage targets near term are very clear. I'm asking about a couple of years out and what the appropriate amount of leverage might be in light of the new structure.","Joseph C. Papa","Well, I'll start first, Greg. And relative to Tysabri, I think I can really just reiterate what we've said in the past. We're very excited about the Tysabri asset. We think it occupies a very important space in MS. And as a result of that, being in a highly efficacious space, we think that's an important place to be in order to help meet some of the unmet medical needs out there for MS patients. Beyond that, of course, the other part of what's important about that Tysabri asset is that it is an escalating royalty. The royalty will move from that 12% to the 18%, and for any sales above $2 billion will go to 25%. So I think it is a combination of being an important product for a very important category of MS, where there continues to be very significant unmet medical need that makes us very excited to be with this product. The other comment I would say is that we do feel very good that we're working with really, we think, the experts in MS. And working with Biogen as our partner, we think, is the other important part of why we're excited about Tysabri. Judy, I'll turn it to you.","Judy L. Brown","Sure. Greg, on your question regarding the combination or the way to view the world in the future in leverage ratios in combination, in concert with the tax rate, I guess I look at it very holistically, thinking conceptually going forward in that, of course, with a relatively lower tax rate, one is in a position to generate more optimal EBITDA and cash flows. And therefore, you can -- you're in a position to think about what we want to do and investing in the future differently. But very importantly, I guess the overarching theme here without getting into specific metrics is, we are committed to an investment-grade profile. If we continue to grow at the pace that we've outlined in our S-4 with our forward-looking financial information and forecast, which exclude future acquisitions, and we continue to de-lever to the rate that we've committed to in this process, we can prove to the debt -- the important debt markets that we are committed to this newly minted investment-grade profile. And that we perhaps deserve to have a slightly higher leverage profile and maintain the investment-grade status. But I would be getting way out over my skis if I said, start naming specific numbers today. It's critically important that we prove our ability to de-lever quickly and ramp back up. And we think that if we can perform in line with our forecast, we will certainly generate very attractive cash flows that will be satisfactory for the equity markets and our reinvestment strategy and the debt markets for being a very high-grade performing debt.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Buck with Buckingham Research.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","For Joe, a couple of quick questions on the OTC switches and then one for Judy maybe on the IRS interaction that you may have had ahead of the deal. For allergic rhinitis versus hay fever, is it clear whether or not there's a different indication between the OTC indication and the prescription indication? Or is it just a matter of more layman's language in terms of labeling for Nasacort? And secondly, what's the status for Oxytrol for women? Is that clear cut that, that gets the 3-year exclusivity? And then for Judy, can you remind us, what restrictions you would expect to have once you become a PLC in terms of divestitures and moving more flexibly after you become an Irish-domiciled PLC with use of cash, et cetera?","Joseph C. Papa","Okay. So David, I think, really what I can really refer to you is with the specific letter for the supplement approval for Nasacort OTC. The letter specifically talks about that the New Drug Application provides for over-the-counter use of Nasacort allergy 24-hour for the temporary relief of symptoms of hay fever and other respiratory allergies, nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing and itchy nose in adults and children ages 2 years and older. I think that gives you a pretty broad platform for Sanofi and Chattem to bringing it into the marketplace relative to exactly where they will promote and focus on it. Probably, I have to leave that up for them to make the judgment as to what they're specifically going to go after, but I think the statement for their approval is a very broad statement in the approval letter.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just to clarify, the question I guess is, is that broader indication, is that explicitly different to the FDA in terms of what would determine exclusivity? Or is it more of just using layman's language? I'm not...","Joseph C. Papa","I think it's very comparable to what the current prescription product is approved for to be clear. Very comparable to the prescription product, if that's what you're asking me.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And that would imply that they may not have the exclusivity?","Joseph C. Papa","Yes, but I don't have enough -- David, I understand your summation of the comment, but I think it's very early for me to make that comment. But I do think that from a historical precedent, your summary is correct.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then just to follow-up, so Oxytrol and then any limitations on the tax rate?","Joseph C. Papa","Yes. So on the Oxytrol question, Oxytrol's got a different question. Oxytrol has some patent, some intellectual property around the product that is different. And I think that's probably going to be the more significant question on Oxytrol, some of the transdermal patents specific to Oxytrol. I think it can be worked around. And my expectation is that they will have a 3-year exclusivity. But beyond that, it's really going to be a question of us working very diligently to go after that product and design around that 3-year -- work through the 3-year exclusivity, but more importantly, design around the intellectual property that's known to us for Oxytrol. Judy, there was an IRS question as well.","Judy L. Brown","Actually, I'm not quite sure what the IRS question was. If you could clarify?","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Sure. So the expectation is, you'll have a reduced tax rate in the neighborhood of, I believe, about 19%. But can you make significant divestitures freely once you close the transaction and once you become a PLC? In other words, if you wanted to change the ownership of certain assets, what restrictions do you have? That's the follow-up to my question.","Judy L. Brown","So once we close and complete the transaction, we will be an Irish company. And at that point, we are allowed to manage the business in a way that we see appropriate. We would look at any assets that are in our management. And like always, like we do today, consider the best uses of those assets. So there are no legal restrictions placed on us as to how to manage the business, look at the portfolio and review ROIC as we do today. I'm not sure if that's where you're thinking of going, but that's -- there are no rules that would prohibit our ability to manage the business.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Sure. So the question mark on Tysabri if you decided it's not part of the future, there shouldn't be any restriction in terms of divestiture if you thought that was the right determination?","Judy L. Brown","There are no legal handcuffs placed on us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Louise Chen with Guggenheim.","Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","The first question I had was on Sergeant's and Velcera, using that platform to sell generic animal health drugs, just wondering what your updated thoughts are on that opportunity? And then also on your lower tax platform once you close, along the 12.5% tax rate that you can leverage with new products, how far out is that in terms of you getting new products approved through that platform or putting new products through that and you beginning to leverage that tax rate? And then last question was just on -- and this may be getting a little further ahead, but on the adjacent store brand acquisitions or developing -- business development on that front, what are you thinking there in timing? After close of Elan, when would you resume looking at those kind of opportunities?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. I'll take your first question and then your third part. And then probably, Judy, you can talk about the Irish portion and the products and the timing for that. So on the first question, Sergeant's and Velcera, we think are -- we're very excited. We continue to be very excited about the opportunity with the generic flea and tick products, launching a store brand version. As a reminder, we launched a store brand version to limited number of customers, mostly regional chains this year. We are still working towards the more -- the larger national customers launch for, we believe, for next flea and tick season. So next April, May type of timeframe. So that's an exciting part. We have not gone -- we have a limited number of product offerings for, what I would call, more of the generic animal health products beyond the flea and tick. But we continue to look at this as a platform to look at further enhancement of animal health as an important part of Perrigo for the future. Probably don't want to make any more specific comments about this individual products. On the last question, or specifically where we are going in M&A? The point for us on M&A is that we continue to be very interested in going after adjacent categories. Those adjacent categories, as we have said previously, will continue to be: The areas of ophthalmic, both for the OTC and generic prescription opportunities; adult nutrition; diabetes and pet care as all-important areas for us that we are interested in. And as also, as we said previously, we believe that we've got a great model for interior of the United States, where 80% of our sales are. We think there's opportunity to expand this model globally, and that's something that we would clearly look to do for the future. But as I've said and Judy has said previously, in the near term, we've got to look for any major opportunity. We've got to first de-lever our P&L, the debt level before we go there. Judy, do you want to make additional comments on the products and...","Judy L. Brown","Sure. The question was about how fast could we begin to launch products within the domicile of Ireland. That is a question that's similar to any question you'd ask about our overall pipeline development process because we will start products from concept inception all the way through development and eventual approval. So it is a several-year process. We can start that right away. But it is not something that can happen in 3 months because we are not moving IP. We are developing IP. We'll be doing and owning the development process from our new location, and hence, it will take several years to bring products through development, through approval, to eventual launch.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just 2 of them. First, infant nutritional. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about price on this franchise moving forward? I believe this is still an area that's maybe priced at more of a discount to a national brand than your typical store brand offering. With the successful share trends, is price a lever we can maybe start thinking about over time here? The second one is following up on the tax issue. Assuming a product mix that's similar to what you'll have post the Elan transaction, just roughly speaking, how low do you think we could think about the tax rate getting if we look out, say, 5 or 7 years? Is something in the low-teens a possibility as you roll out these new products? It's always going to take time. But just as we think about longer term, how low can this rate go?","Joseph C. Papa","First of all, Chris, thank you for your comments on the quarter. I'll take the first point on the infant nutrition and Judy, you want to take the tax question. On the infant nutrition side of the business relative to price, I think you know that we are at a significant discount to the national brands. We are at approximately a 50% discount to the national brands. So there is an opportunity on pricing there. The other point I would make, though, is that's probably as important is that, when we switched to the plastic container, one of the comments that we made is that the plastic container is more expensive from a cost of goods point of view than the previous metal composite can. So as a result of that, we did expect some cost increase, as well as the point that it was less -- the plastic container was a new process for us. So there was going to be some learning curve. I'm delighted to say that we've gotten through the learning curve, and the team is doing a good job there with the plastic container at this point. We do think though there is some pricing that we need to go after as a result of the problems that the plastic container is a more expensive cost of goods sold. So that is something that we have done some work within the marketplace. And we'll have more to say about that in the future in terms of how that's progressing, but it really is looking at the incremental cost of the plastic container to be a national brand equivalent that we are going after. Judy, you want to take the second part of that question on the tax?","Judy L. Brown","I love to talk about taxes, you know that. So on the question of how low can it go? First of all, you know that I'm fairly prudent when it comes to such things. So committing to a long term tax rate at this stage with 1 million variables would be ill-advised. But what I can say is, if you -- imagine a world where our mix of business doesn't change at all. We all know, if you look at the S-4 and the type of projections we've put forward, you see growth there. But as the jurisdictional mix didn't change at all, we go from a rate around 30% to the high-teens with this transaction. If nothing else changed, when the Tysabri rate changes from 1% to something more like 12.5% in 2020, you'd see a lock-step change for that stream of income on that date. But suffice it to say, to the earlier question, Louise's question about bringing new products to market, we plan to put new products in Ireland and begin the development process there. So there will be, in a few years, a stream that's coming from Ireland at a rate that's in the low-teens. You should assume that at some point in the future, after we've completed our de-levering process, we're doing more M&A. And we have committed to not only doing adjacencies in the U.S., but also doing international expansion. And you'll get the benefit of doing M&A from Ireland with, again, the lower rate. And you have to assume that we'll be continuing to launch products and selling them around the world from some of our foreign jurisdictions as well. So it's hard to commit to a specific number because there are a lot of variables. But we do have things at hand that would allow us to take advantage of having this new corporate structure, continuing to launch new products, continuing to do M&A and all from an advantage base.","Operator","And your last question comes from Jason Gerberry with Leerink Swan.","Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Just on the new product launch guidance, could you confirm. My understanding is that it's largely Rx driven. And I guess, I wonder, do you guys see any risk to regulatory delays in new companies. In generic space, they're citing delays to regulatory approval as the agency overhauls its ANDA review process as it implements the user fee? And then, I guess, just second question, does Perrigo have a broader interest in dry powder inhaler in the MDI space beyond Albuterol? Given that the pathway -- the regulatory pathway seem more clear cut, but capital barriers are still high. It kind of seems like it's in Perrigo's sweet spot for development. So just kind of curious if you can comment there.","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Well, let me just talk -- the first part of your question was specifically in terms of our new products. As we stated publicly, we think we'll launch over 75 new products. That's more than 1 per week and over $190 million of product sales. We feel that, that's going to really be across our entire portfolio. The Rx team will have a good year to be clear, but we do expect also some nice products in the rest of our portfolios. Certainly is notable by temozolomide and what we're doing with our Consumer Healthcare business and also some the things we're doing in our Vitamin\/Mineral Supplements. So we really see it as being a very diversified portfolio of new products. So in terms of where we've done. And I think Judy said that the numbers for the first quarter were very, very strong for us. On the question of this regulatory risk, I will say that we have experienced some delays in our approvals for some of our products. The Rx products, the 4 products that we have approved this year, is great. Great start to the fiscal year. I've also said publicly that some of those products we would have expected to see last year. So I think we did experience some delays last year. And as a result of that, we really tried to look at our probability weighting on our portfolio to try to anticipate some delays in the process that normally happen. I don't think that right now, it's -- we've seen major changes in what's happening. We really expect to see some continued new product approvals during the year. On the final portion of your question, on the metered-dose inhalers, to be clear, we're delighted to be the first to file on the ProAir product. We think it's a great opportunity for us. And we're very excited to go forward with that particular product. We like our spot. There is litigation to be cleared on that product, but we like our position on that litigation. In terms of other metered-dose inhalers, I'd say that the concept we've put forth in terms of having a program to look at whether it be other metered-dose inhalers or other products in the category fit very well with our concept of extended topicals. And by that, I meant, dermatology, respiratory, nasal, ophthalmic products that are of very high interest to us in our product selection process. So yes, the answer is clear. That is true. I will say the one area that you mentioned that I'm a little bit reserved on is the dry powder inhalers. I think the characteristics and the requirements for that area are significant, and I think that's a little bit more of a challenge than the metered-dose inhalers. So just -- not to pick words, but you said -- but I do think metered-dose inhalers and dry powders are a little bit different animals, so to speak, in this world of trying to get products to the marketplace. But on balance, we're very excited about our Rx portfolio. But it's really, it's all of our new products.","Operator, I think that concludes our call for today. I'd like to say thank you to everyone, once again, for your interest in Perrigo. And we look forward to talking to you after the close of the Elan transaction, which, as I mentioned, that we expect it to be at the end of the calendar year. Thank you very much, everyone.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Joseph, Vice President of Global Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, welcome to Perrigo's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Hope you all had a chance to review the press release we issued earlier this morning. Copies of the release are available on our website, as is the slide presentation for this call. Joining today's call are Murray Kessler, Perrigo's new President and CEO; and Ron Winowiecki, Perrigo's CFO.","I'd like to remind everyone that during the call, participants may make certain forward-looking statement. Please refer to the important information for investors and shareholders and Safe Harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued earlier this morning. In addition, in the appendix for today's presentation, we've provided reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures presented.","Turning to the agenda on slide 3. First, Ron will share our third quarter performance results and discuss each of the segments in detail. Ron will then review our balance sheet highlights and the company's updated 2018 guidance. Our new President and CEO, Murray Kessler, with then share his initial thoughts on his first month at Perrigo and lay out his priorities before opening the call for questions.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ron.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Brad; and good morning, everyone. We are excited to have Murray Kessler, our recently appointed President and CEO, on the call this morning. Murray joins us with a wealth of experience, having run two public companies prior to Perrigo, as I will outline in more detail later in my remarks.","Before I discuss the financial results for the quarter, I'd like to open with a few remarks on the business. Even though our total adjusted EPS results were above our expectations, the quarter benefited from a onetime tax savings of approximately $0.06 per share. In total, our Consumer businesses adjusted operating income was in line with our expectation. However, the RX segment continued to underperform. The key driver behind the lower 2018 guidance provided today is due primarily to RX, as we continue to experience weakness within this business and anticipate lower new product sales for this segment.","To put this in perspective, when starting the year, our consolidated adjusted operating income guidance was approximately $1.06 billion at the midpoint. Our expectation today, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly, is approximately $905 million at the midpoint, or $155 million below our original guidance. This change in adjusted operating income can be attributed to RX underperforming against our original plan. This is obviously disappointing.","Now, turning to our third quarter operational highlight. I would like to begin by highlighting things that continue to gain momentum in the business. First, excluding animal health, our Consumer businesses grew on an organic constant currency basis by approximately 2%, led by CHC Americas, which grew approximately 3% in the quarter and year-to-date compared to the prior year.","Second, within the CHC International segment, adjusted operating margin increased 230 basis points compared to the prior year to approximately 19% and has achieved an adjusted operating margin of approximately 17% year-to-date. Third, RX team continued to drive our extended topicals strategy, with continued investment in our pipeline evidenced by higher R&D spend, representing approximately 11% of net sales in the quarter.","Finally, our platform, once again, delivered consistent cash flow. Cash flow conversion to adjusted net income was slightly under 100% for the quarter. And we utilized our free cash flow generation and balance sheet flexibility to repurchase approximately $135 million worth of our shares during the quarter.","Now, I will discuss areas that need immediate attention and what we are doing to correct them. First, as I said, the RX business was a primary driver of our shortfall in adjusted operating income for the quarter and the full-year projection. As you may have seen in our press release this morning, we have appointed new leadership. Sharon Kochan was appointed President of the RX business. Sharon is an experienced operator, who was instrumental in building the Perrigo RX segment from its infancy and is the right executive to lead the previously announced separation.","Second, our animal health business in the CHC Americas segment continues to underperform. We are taking a close look at the core capabilities of this business and its respective position in the animal health industry.","Third, we have identified various operating inefficiencies, which have impacted gross profit and our ability to achieve customer service expectations in both our U.S. Consumer and RX (Prescription) businesses. The factors leading to these inefficiencies include the culmination of: One, rising input cost; two, lower productivity due primarily to a tight labor market; and three, competing priorities.","Perrigo's operational model is designed to handle a broad complex portfolio of products to meet our customers' need. A top priority for our team is to ensure our supply chain remains a competitive advantage against others in the industry. We are not satisfied with our overall performance results, and corrective actions are under way. Perrigo has undergone an immense amount of organizational change over the last few years, and with the planned separation of the RX business, we continue to evolve as an organization.","At the same time, the pace of change in our business environment is arguably unprecedented. While the team has done a tremendous job responding to and embracing these shifts, we lost some focus, which impacted our performance and our ability to achieve our 2018 operating objectives.","The challenges in front of us can be resolved. We have proven that when we operate under a clear strategic direction and focus on critical priorities with alignment throughout the organization, we win. Perrigo has a highly engaged organization and a winning culture. Murray is quickly refocusing all parts of the organization and expanding our consumer strategies to return us to that winning path, which he will discuss shortly.","Turning to slide 6. You can see our reported results for the third quarter. Net sales were $1.1 billion, with a reported net loss of $68 million. I would like to provide a few details on four adjustments to the GAAP results for the quarter.","First, we realized a $213 million impairment of intangible assets and goodwill in our animal health business. During this past quarter, the animal health reporting unit continued to experience declines in its year-to-date financial results and had additional indications of impairment due to changes in channel dynamics, a strategic decision to reprioritize brands in this segment, and a decline in the forecasted outlook of the reporting unit.","Second, we recorded an $18 million restructuring charge for continued infrastructure improvements in Europe. Our international team continues to progressively implement their roadmap of improving the operating margin profile of the CHC International segment.","Third, consistent with our policy of transparency, we will highlight each quarter the amount of the adjustment to GAAP results for the activities related to the separation of RX. In the quarter, we spent $5.8 million associated with this strategic action. These expenses include a combination of technical accounting and tax work streams and operational actions to separate the business.","And fourth, you will see that there was a $75 million increase in the fair value of the Tysabri option payment this quarter. Tysabri continues to perform well as a leading therapy in the multiple sclerosis market, with global net sales of $1.86 billion in the last 12 months. As a reminder, we have two opportunities to receive milestone payments linked to our 2017 sale of Tysabri: One, a $250 million inflow, if 2018 global Tysabri sales exceed $1.85 billion; and two, a $400 million inflow if 2020 global Tysabri sales exceed $1.95 billion.","GAAP tax expense as a percent of pre-tax income was 14.5% in the quarter compared to a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.2%. The difference is primarily due to the tax effects of the pre-tax adjustments, notably, the intangible asset and goodwill impairments. Also, we experienced favorability in the adjusted tax rate relative to our expectations due to a discrete benefit realized in the third quarter.","Turning to CHC America results on slide 7. Net sales in the quarter were $596 million or relatively flat on a constant currency basis. Animal health net sales were approximately 50% lower compared to the prior year due to the anticipated loss of a partner product and channel dynamics. Excluding the animal health business, on a constant currency basis, CHC Americas grew 3% year-over-year.","Performance in CHC Americas was driven by strong net sales in the smoking cessation, infant formula, and dermatological categories, partially offset by lower net sales in the gastrointestinal category. Our infant formula business continues to perform well, with its multifaceted growth strategy of integrating our extensive product line with the broad customer base.","CHC Americas adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 32.7%, 370 basis points below the prior year, due primarily to the dynamics in animal health, increased input costs, and operating inefficiencies that I just discussed. The adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 19%, 420 basis points lower than the prior year, due primarily to the gross margin flow-through and increased selling investments to drive new product introductions, such as the omeprazole oral dissolving product, which was launched in April of this year.","Turning to CHC International on slide 8. Net sales grew 1% compared to the prior year on an organic constant currency basis. Higher net sales in the analgesic, anti-parasite, and personal care categories, coupled with new product sales of $19 million were partially offset by lower net sales in the lifestyle category, lower sales in our non-branded UK businesses, and discontinued products of $5 million.","Adjusted gross margin increased 120 basis points to 52.6%, driven by continued gross margin actions, including the launch of margin-enhancing new products, insourcing, and procurement initiatives. CHC International adjusted operating margin for the third quarter was higher than expected at nearly 19%, an increase of 230 basis points over the prior year, primarily due to gross margin flow-through and timing of advertising and promotion expenses. Our International leadership team continue to improve the cost structure of this segment with enhanced go-to-market strategies that have improved the overall operating margin profile in this segment.","Turning to the RX segment results on slide 9. Reported net sales in the third quarter were $179 million compared to $251 million last year. The net sales decline was largely due to the absence of new products, coupled with price erosion within our authorized generic portfolio. Specifically, our core extended topical products, which comprise approximately 85% of net sales in this segment, experienced price erosion in line with our expectations for the quarter. The business also underperformed as a result of the customer service challenges I previously discussed, resulting in lower sales than anticipated and higher customer service expenses, which are being addressed.","Adjusted gross margin was 52% in the third quarter or 260 basis points lower than the prior year, primarily due to less favorable product mix. Adjusted operating margin was 32% compared to 42.4% in the prior year, due primarily to an approximate 600 basis point increase in R&D investments compared to the prior year and gross margin flow-through. R&D investments for the quarter were approximately 60% higher, accounting for approximately 11% of net sales, as the team continues to invest in the pipeline, which is critical to the success in the RX business.","Turning now to slide 10. Our balance sheet and cash flow generation remain strong, underscoring the strength of our business. At the end of the quarter, total cash on the balance sheet was $444 million and total outstanding debt was approximately $3.3 billion. Excluding $50 million related to the Merck and NASONEX licensing investment, which is included in GAAP cash flow from operations, year-to-date adjusted cash flow from operations would total $449 million. This results in a cash flow conversion as a percentage of adjusted net income of 90% for the first three quarters of the year.","Our capital allocation decisions are focused on total shareholder returns within the context of our long-standing commitment to an investment-grade financial policy. As part of our capital allocation strategy, we completed approximately $135 million of share repurchases and paid $26 million in dividends in the third quarter.","With the expiration of the previous share repurchase authorization, today, we announce a new share repurchase authorization up to $1 billion of the company's outstanding common stock with no expiration date. The timing and amount of any share repurchases under the new authorization will be determined by management based on balancing our priority of expanding the EDITDA base with a focus on total shareholder returns.","Now, let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2018. Turning to slide 11. We now expect consolidated net sales of approximately $4.72 billion and adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $4.45 to $4.65 per share. As RX was the main reason for the change in our consolidated guidance, I would like to take a minute to outline the primary drivers of this change.","We now expect RX net sales to be approximately $800 million, with an adjusted operating margin in the mid to high-30s as a percent of net sales based upon three factors: Number one, our assumption for generic Androgel 1.62%. In mid-October, the RX team launched this important product to customers in the U.S. As we entered the market with our product, a third party aggressively launched an authorized generic version. Although this product launch will improve trends in the business, the impact from competition was greater than our original expectations, which has reduced our forecast for this product.","Number two, customer service. We delivered poor customer service in certain key products, which has resulted in lower net sales and lost margin opportunity. The poor customer service was due to a combination of operating efficiencies mentioned earlier and inconsistent supply from certain third-party partners, both of which are being addressed. However, we expect similar dynamics to continue in the fourth quarter, as we implement our improvement plan.","And number three, price erosion and authorized generics. Our price erosion assumptions within our core portfolio remain in line with our expectations. Higher price erosion was experienced in certain authorized generic products and is built into our forecast for the remainder of the year.","Other changes to 2018 consolidated guidance include: A lower forecasted adjusted tax rate for the year due to the previously mentioned benefit realized in the third quarter, which is offset by slightly lower consumer net sales and adjusted operating income; a 100 basis point increase in the adjusted operating margin forecast for CHC International to 16.5%, driven by the margin enhancement actions in this segment, was offset by a similar decrease in the adjusted operating margin forecast for CHC Americas to 20%, primarily driven by the underperformance in the animal health business and operating inefficiencies.","Finally, as cash is king, we are currently forecasting annual adjusted operating cash flow to adjusted net income conversion to be approximately 95% to 100% at the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance.","In summary, we continue to drive growth in our Consumer businesses, and the team is moving forward with executing on our plan to create two separate, independent platforms to actualize strategic and operating focus and eliminate competing priorities, enhance the value creation potential of each of our respective businesses.","Turning to slide 12. I would like to offer a warm welcome to our new CEO, Murray Kessler, who I am sure you are looking forward to hearing from. As you know, Murray has over 35 years of experience across a broad range of industries, including highly regulated businesses from notable companies like, Clorox, Campbell Soup Company, UST, and Lorillard.","During his tenure as CEO of UST and Lorillard, he competed over $22 billion in shareholder value. In his brief time at Perrigo, Murray has already set a tone of focus, clarity, and prioritization. He has held leadership meetings in both the U.S. and Europe to quickly assess baseline his views of the core capabilities and market opportunities available to Perrigo.","I will now turn the call over to Murray.","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Ron; and good morning, everyone. Ron shared a bit about my resume. But for those of you who don't know me, let me expand a bit more on my background and how I operate.","I've created significant value in my prior CEO positions, using a pretty simple framework each time, while also approaching each situation's unique factors. The key elements of this framework are: First, and most important, focusing on the core with an emphasis on maintaining our competitive advantages; second, pursuing close-in adjacencies to keep the new product pipeline strong; three, making strategic bolt-on acquisitions when they make financial sense; four, strong cost control and elimination of nonproductive costs and bureaucracy; and five, allocating capital to the highest return options that build the business long term, while concurrently returning excess capital to shareholders.","I pride myself in transparency and telling it like I see it. And I never forget that I'm a fiduciary acting in the best interest of our shareholders. So, as I see it, Perrigo is a great company that has gotten off track in the last few years, as once again demonstrated in the quarterly results and projection for the remainder of fiscal 2018.","This was not a surprise to me when I joined. I came in having looked at the company the same way our investors do. And I believe the challenges I see are the same ones you all see. The challenges I saw confronting Perrigo today are the result of distraction, shifts in leadership, and a rapidly changing external environment that was not properly addressed. I came on board with the belief that by focusing on the initiatives that matter most, namely, a reallocation of Perrigo's vast resources, the sale or spin of RX, and the upgrade of certain skill sets and investment in technologies, we will be able to return Perrigo to its rich history of strong performance and creating shareholder value.","Having reinvigorated companies before, I know it will take some time to put in place a clear, consumer-based, strategic plan that will generate long-term, sustainable, and reliable growth. While we are doing so, we will remain cognizant of the near term and pursue actionable initiatives to drive meaningful progress. That was my incoming perspective, and after a month at Perrigo, including reviews of its operations, business units, skill sets and capabilities around the world, my enthusiasm and optimism is even stronger. I am glad to be here and my confidence on this team's ability to deliver is high.","Let me share a few of my initial observations. Share and volume in our core CHCA store brand business is solid but in the current environment of less Rx to OTC switches and increased pricing pressure, the new product pipeline is simply insufficient and lower than in prior years. We are already addressing this.","CHCI is in the midst of a transformation, which is beginning to take hold, but more aggressive top line initiatives are needed there as well. Again, those are being addressed, and I am very excited about the long-term prospects of this business.","I agree with the board's decision to sell or spin RX, as it is a distraction to our core Consumer businesses, even though it is a good and profitable business in its own right. Again, the level of new products being launched in the marketplace is a major issue. But unlike the Consumer business, the pipeline on RX is robust, and we are just a few FDA approvals away from significantly changing the trajectory of this business. Our regulatory team is optimistic they will come soon. Importantly, we believe it's not a matter of if; it's a matter of when.","Complexity has always been a core strength to Perrigo's global platform, but right now it is working against us, especially on the supply chain, adding cost and putting pressure on margins. This is addressable with more sophisticated planning tools, which are already being put in place. We have made a series of low-return inorganic investments. The criteria for investments in inorganic growth will be tightened, and you can expect an increase in investment towards organic growth.","My only real surprise coming into the company was the precipitous decline this quarter in the animal health business. But the reasons here, too, are quite clear and are being addressed, even while we assess the role this business plays in our future portfolio. Despite the challenges I've highlighted, I repeat that the core businesses are solid. There are significant resources to bring to bear on generating growth; the Perrigo workforce is talented and highly motivated; we have the commitment of the Board of Directors; and there are more opportunities for growth than I initially thought.","I'm excited to be leading this great company through transformation, and we will return Perrigo to its winning ways. I'll be out to meet with a number of our investors on the sell side on more of a listening tour over the next month while we are concurrently developing the strategic plan. We should be in a position to share the full plan in early spring.","With that, I'll now open the floor to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now open the question-and- answer session. Our first question comes from David Maris with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. I have a lot of questions, but I'm going to limit it to one, since I'm sure a lot of people have questions.","At the time of your appointment, Murray, the company did a number of calls in which your appointment was described as coming in during a -as a move of strength, that things were fine. I had specifically asked, would guidance be \u2013 guidance wasn't reiterated. And in my experience, that when companies don't reiterate guidance, there's a high likelihood that they're going to miss it.","And it was indicated that, no, this was being done from a position of strength. But from what you described, you knew that there were challenges coming in. So, how would you reconcile \u2013 I know you weren't part of those initial conversations. Is the situation at Perrigo changing so dramatically and so negatively that from one quarter to the next, things could change this much, or was this a trajectory that the company's been on and should have been expected? Thank you.","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","Okay. Well I'd break that into a couple different pieces. I am 100% confident that based on my discussions with the board prior to joining that if right now, Ron was telling you from the third quarter that we were raising guidance for the year, they would've still made the same decision.","The entire discussion was not about performance, it was a strategic discussion of how to transform this into a consumer company. And frankly, that evolved over the year. And I had talked to the company a year ago, but I wasn't available for personal reasons to start at that time. And my situation changed, and the strategy of the company evolved. And I think the board clearly has stated over and over again that was the reason for the change. They want somebody to lead this transformation into being a consumer-driven company.","So, I'm positive that it wasn't performance driving that. I would also say, having gotten here, you heard Ron clearly say that the change was pretty much attributable to one piece of the business, which is very new product-related. And depending on \u2013 there's a couple of big, new products in the pipeline there, and the timing of regulatory approval is driving that. So, no, I don't think that this is a lot of volatility.","I took a hard look at the fourth quarter. I wasn't here for the third quarter. But I think we have numbers we believe in and work is well underway to focus this organization, which it needed.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, as a follow-up, it sounds like what you're saying, or the description so far is that the earnings impact may be primarily related to \u2013 in the fourth quarter and for this quarter related to RX, which again had already been lowered a number of times. But we'll ignore that for a second and how fast that's dramatically changed.","But you've mentioned customer service and failures in customer service a number of times, which sounds like a much broader organizational issue. That sounds like something that hadn't been raised before of kind of the stumbles that Perrigo's making. Maybe if you could just expand a little bit on how that sort of emerges, and what it's showing up as? Is it just missed orders, or out of stock items? How does poor customer service show up?","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","It's a couple things. Here's a big difference between a consumer guy leading this company versus sort of in the past. Most of the dialogue that I've seen coming into the company is dollar-revenue-related versus volume-related. Coming out of a CPG company, most of the conversations I've always had are volume-related.","In doing so, the underlying trends on this business are almost completely different in many areas across all of the divisions. I mean, our Consumer businesses volumes were actually up 4% or 5%. We never talk about those kinds of things, which place different demands when an organization focuses on revenues that are kind of flattish.","There's also, in doing so, the other key framework in this company, the metrics that it measured itself against placed a lot of emphasis on keeping inventories low as opposed to maintaining that higher service level that Perrigo was always known for. And then third, there was a lot of complication that's been added to this business in the last couple of years.","The good news is those are all imminently fixable. There's a couple points of margin in the second half that while RX is the big thing that can \u2013 I'm not saying it's not hard work; it is. But we have too much of our volume with single-source suppliers that, in a number of cases, met \u2013 even with 5% volume growth in the U.S., we couldn't meet demand, which is unacceptable.","There is other areas and planning tools that, I would say, and I'm not criticizing the company. It's been focusing on a lot of \u2013 it's made a lot of acquisitions, but more investment needed to be on organic growth and making sure that we've maintained the Perrigo advantage.","This company has always been known for years of being able to handle complexity better than any other company can do. And given our breath of line, and the thousands of SKUs and all that, that's a strength for this organization. They know how to do it. We just need to refocus them back that, that's the top priority and recapture those margin points, which are easily identifiable.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi.","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","Good morning, Louise.","Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions here. So, the first question I have is something that we've been getting a lot this morning, which is that if you annualize your fourth quarter 2018 EPS, and you're getting to about $4 in EPS for 2019, that's not assuming any growth on anything or recovery or in any of the businesses. So, just wondering, is 2019 a growth year for Perrigo, and why or why not? Thank you.","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","Well, I think you've got to balance a couple things. And I'm here a month, and we're going through the planning phases. And we'll give you guidance in February, like we always give you a guidance. And like I said, shortly after that, we should be in a position to lay down our growth strategies.","But the good news is, I'd break it up into two pieces. And by the way, I'm not going to give you a full answer to that question, because I'm not ready to give you numbers yet. But I will say, I am encouraged by both the short-term opportunities for the company and the long term, because in my comments, I said, job number one is focusing on the core. So, that means job number one is to get back to full potential CHCA, which means that we have every distribution point, that we have competitive advantage, that every innovation that's being offered by the branded competitors is available, and that we have customer service levels that are back in line with where they've been historically.","So, I think it would be a mistake to straight-line the fourth quarter. I mean, that's where I sit today. But I also have to go through the full planning process. And then, clearly, I need to get the organization to ramp up the new product pipeline.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Trucchio with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Patrick R. Trucchio - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I have some follow-ups on the generic business. First, do you intend to initiate a restructuring of the business, and should we expect charges associated with that? Secondly, in the absence of a major restructuring, why shouldn't we expect the operating margin of that business to contract and to potentially contract substantially?","Third, how concerned should we be with the potential disruption caused by the split of this business? And finally, why should we have confidence you can stabilize the business and execute the split successfully? Thank you.","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","Okay. Yes. A lot of questions there, so Brad, you're going to need to help me. Let's start with the confidence in the distraction associated with the split, because that is a concern for me, and that is why we made a change in leadership with the most seasoned person we have in the organization to come back and run that business, so that it can. And I'm doing everything from aligning the incentives, and the goals, and the KPIs in this organization to make sure each group is set up to focus on what they need to.","Now, the level of effort that comes is radically different depending on which option we pursue and which one creates the most value for shareholders. And as the board and has been previously announced, we're committed to this split, because it obviously, over the long term, is not aligned with where we want to take the company and believe we can create the most wealth.","As it relates to the business, I think, depending on when, because we don't believe it's an if, those new products that have been geared up get approved. I mean, they're massive, and they have a significant change in the trajectory of the business.","I'll also say, when I look at the pipelines of all the different businesses, the pipeline on RX is actually quite robust. It's part of the U.S. that because of a slowdown on RX to OT (sic) [OTC] (34:16) switches that I'm most focused on in getting the new product program. I don't see an issue there. So, I think we have a lull period here. But RX, it's under good leadership now, leadership that can help prevent that distraction you're talking about. And it has a robust pipeline, and we just need to get through that gap period until those approvals start coming in.","Give me your first question again.","Patrick R. Trucchio - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC","Yes. So, just in terms of initiating restructuring, a cost restructuring plan, is that something we should expect? Would there be charges associated with that? And then, in the absence of one, why would the operating margins stabilize? Why wouldn't it keep contracting?","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","On the RemainCo, or on the new business?","Patrick R. Trucchio - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC","No, on the generics.","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","Well that just depends on the organization, right. I mean, it depends whether it's a sale and it's fitting into something; or it's a spin and it's its own stand-alone company. We'll give you more detail on that as we progress through the process.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","Good morning, Dave.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, and congrats on your new role. I have three questions. First, you had referred to OTC new product opportunities in the face of diminishing OTC switches. Could you just provide a framework for, at a high level, opportunities that you see for the OTC new product flow in the future? Second...","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","Sure. Why don't we just take them one at a time.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great.","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","Well let me start by saying that I see the company different than you guys do. You see a healthcare company and I see a self-care company. That change of reference opens this organization up to massive opportunity that you'll see in the transformation detailed in the strategic plans.","But if we are not limiting ourselves through a lens of healthcare, and again, take this self-care reference, there are massive, massive categories, some of which the company has tried before that opened up, again, billions and billions, and billions, and billions of dollars of categories for the company. So, I don't see any shortage of opportunities.","And changing references, what I've done in every company I've gone to. Each and every time, I change reference of, so that I don't look at us as north of 60%, 70% share in the United States of store brands in the OTC category. I changed that reference, so we're a much smaller percentage of all the self-care. I did it in my previous two roles, and the new product programs start to flow.","And by the way, a lot of those categories don't have to go through the long process of FDA approval. Many of them are products that we sell already in Europe. And we are not leveraging the synergies that are possible between our International business and our U.S. business. And you know as well as I do all the different segments are there. But I think you're going to see a whole different look on Perrigo going forward.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. That's helpful. And then, with respect to your comment earlier, I didn't quite follow it. I think you said, 5% volume growth and 0% sales growth. What were you referring to?","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","I don't know if I gave you the exact right net sales growth. There was net sales growth, and Ron spoke about that in the details. But I'm just talking, if you go underneath that and you look at \u2013 which I'm used to as a consumer guy \u2013 looking at the unit shares and the units moving through the registers through some of our sources like IRI, and actually our own units that volume is growing faster than revenues because there's a little bit of price contraction. Not as much in the CHC business, but some. But we gained market share in almost every segment we competed in.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. And then, the final question is, you had mentioned that you're a few regulatory approvals away from much better RX performance. Could you just comment on what those products are that you're hoping for, for approval in the next six months or so?","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","Ron, do you want to take that?","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. Sure. Obviously, the two that we've talked very openly about is with ProAir. We had a CRL that was issued this summer. We responded to that CRL. And obviously, we're not going to provide updates consistent with our practice, David, on the FDA process. But our team remains committed and dedicated to launching that product and getting the approvals. That's obviously one of them.","The second one, that's obviously in front of us as well, scopolamine. We pulled it off the market due to a deviation. The team again responded to that with the FDA, continues to move down our improvement plan on that product.","I don't want to get into pipeline next year. So, Murray is 100% right. We like our pipeline going into 2019, but obviously, we'll talk about that in February and give more color on our growth plans in RX at that time.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Z. Neyor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Morning. This is Chris Neyor on for Chris Schott.","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","Hi.","Chris Z. Neyor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","A couple of questions on the RX business. For the RX separation, you guys are committed, but does the weaker performance year-to-date caused you to rethink the timing of that potential separation for the business unit? And then, secondly, on the recent Androgel launch, could you elaborate on the market dynamics there? Specifically, from a share perspective, does that launch in line with your expectations? Thanks.","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","Well, on the first part of the question, we're stewards of shareholder value both short term and long term, and always apply a critical lens to any decision I make around any asset. But be clear, it is our intent to sell or spin and to focus this company.","As it relates to Androgel, I just think they had a higher expectation. They anticipated some competition. And Ron, in a second, can help me with this one, too, but I think this is like the first time they've launched in this type of environment with that type of product, where there was that buying consortium. And so, it's sort of all or nothing on a few of these. And while it's incremental, and it's going to be a big contributor, they didn't hit it, so it did not meet our expectation.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. I'll just confirm, Chris, what Murray said very well, is we assumed an authorized generic. And it's the first meaningful Paragraph IV we launched since the consortium formation in 2016. And some of the buying patterns became binary, and so we learned from it.","But to be clear, the exciting part of this product, it is changing the trajectory. It's creating momentum that we've been looking for in this business as we launched new products. And we're excited about the contribution it'll make for us in Q4 and heading into 2019.","Chris Z. Neyor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Steinberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","Good morning, David.","David Michael Steinberg - Jefferies LLC","Morning. Yeah. Thanks very much. Murray, you said in your comments that one of your strategic objectives is bolt-on or tuck-in acquisitions.","In the past couple years, the company's made virtually no acquisitions and maybe this is more a question for Ron than you. But historically, outside the very large Elan and Omega acquisitions, which didn't turn out so well, the company has made a lot of very successful smaller acquisitions, largely, private consumer. I was curious, why is it that in the last couple years, there have not been any acquisitions? Is it just a dearth of opportunities? Were the prices too high?","And then going forward, Murray, what's your philosophy on M&A? Obviously, there's some operational issues you have to deal with. But one of the good things coming in is the very strong balance sheet. What types of opportunities are you're looking at? And you can extend beyond the generally small consumer tuck-ins that the company's done in the past. Thanks.","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","Well, I think, initially, it's fair to say I'd be more interested in the, sort of historic level of tuck-ins that \u2013 you know, you have very different businesses around the world. Our leaders and the team in International is actually doing a good job of already starting their transformation.","And as you would expect, on a business that was very complicated in 35-something countries with different portfolios, some of those brands are good and some of those brands are weak and probably not a good effort for us to go after. There are other markets that look really quite opportunistic for us, but tuck-in acquisitions would give us the scale we need in those markets to be successful. So, I'm pretty confident that you'll start seeing some of those come around pretty quickly.","As it relates to a big bet for the company, that's the last thing it needs right now. Right now, the number one job is to focus on the core and bringing CHCA to full potential.","David Michael Steinberg - Jefferies LLC","And just a quick follow-up regarding Rx to OTC switches. I know you talked about looking outside healthcare, but within healthcare, there are only three categories that really have switched, and there are many, many more that could be switched. You pretty much run the table on PPIs, cough, cold, allergy.","And I know that we have a relatively new FDA Commissioner that's talked focus on OTCs and lowering healthcare costs. Have you seen any movement recently on FDA's interest to expand into new areas? I know there's been talk historically about statins or Viagra, things like that. But would you anticipate any major category switching in the near term?","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","Look, the company obviously made a $50 million investment in a significant switch that is planned to come in the next couple years, and there's other in the horizon. But I'm just not going to let you take me down that pathway. I don't view that this is a healthcare company. I view this as a self-care company. And those, along with dozens of opportunities that I see right now that are significant, will all be pursued and shared with you on our plans.","So, again, I view it from a different lens than you view it from. And I think we won't have any problems developing a strong pipeline. I'm also not convinced we've fully explored our product. You see us having run the gamut relative to being a player in the Rx to OTC switches that have already happened. That doesn't mean we've reached full potential on those, not even close.","Operator","Our final question comes from Tim Chiang with BTIG. Please go ahead.","Timothy Chiang - BTIG LLC","Oh. Thank you.","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","Good morning.","Timothy Chiang - BTIG LLC","Good morning, Murray. So, I know you're sort of coming in at sort of an inflection point for Perrigo. But I mean, one, could you just sort of talk about what you think the long-term plan for recovery is for Perrigo here? I mean obviously, other executives have come into specialty pharma companies and have aggressively cut costs, others have gone the organic route in terms of trying to fix companies. And I sort of wanted to get your perspective.","I mean, obviously, there's pros and cons with Perrigo at this point, but it does seem like they're running into some issues, certainly, on the Rx side. The OTC side had a tough time growing over the past couple years. And I just want to get your longer-term perspective on how you think you'll be able to fix Perrigo.","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","Well, I think that's what all of my comments have been about. I just don't agree that the company is facing challenges with underlying volume growth. It's facing challenges with price competition, because it's given back some of its competitive advantage which has to be reinstated, right.","So, I mean, I have worked on dozens of consumer packaged goods categories, and to have a growing segment like in the businesses we're in today, that our total store brand's growing as a percentage of OTC, and us gaining market share and growing more than that, I think that's a disservice to say that and is part of the just having a sales discussion.","So, that frame of reference also needs to change, that as we're growing volume and market share, do we have enough competitive advantages? When I talk to some of our biggest customers, they tell me that four years ago, they could not go to anybody else but Perrigo, because the advantage was so great. We still have an advantage, but the gap has narrowed. That gap needs to be widened again.","So, you're asking for my strategy without getting specific details. We will first and foremost focus on the core. Someone else asked the question, will we consider bolt-on? I don't see a transformational acquisition in the near term. Things change, but I don't see it right now.","I see bolt-ons helping stabilize or give us scale in certain markets. And in Europe, and in the U.S some of these new categories that present themselves from a self-care definition versus a healthcare definition require small acquisitions for technology or to give us a certain skill set, that could be on the table.","But job one, fix the core, get the core going. The volume is strong. The talent is strong. There's no resources that have been cut. R&D budgets are intact, which I was glad to see when I got here. All the makings are there. The organization needs to focus and go after those opportunities.","We have to fix the service issues on the core business, which are infinitely fixable, and this company knows how to do it. It's always maintained some of the best service levels despite the fact that it has a portfolio that is way more complex than that. We haven't kept up with technology and the planning tools that are available to make that happen. That'll be very quickly done as well. We'll ramp up the new product program, and that'll fix the midterm and the long term. And all of this will be shared with you.","And by the way, when we fix the service area, we will be able to \u2013 we've lost revenues in certain places, meaningful revenues, from not being able to service customers in certain respects. And there are all kinds of cost implications when that starts to happen relative to over time and customer finds and all kinds of things that can come as a result of that, that can be cleaned back up right back out of the P&L again.","And the company has resisted \u2013 even though it's made some very big bets on inorganic growth, it's been actually quite very, very conservative on investing for organic growth to the point that there are capacity constraints on some areas, where our demand is exceeding our capacity, and we're running full out. So, I mean, again, those can be changed immediately.","I recognize that I'm giving you high level. I'm just letting you know after a month here, I'm not seeing a shortage of opportunities at all. And we will go after those. And you will find I'm very transparent. I only need a few months to get that going. I'll see you in early spring, and we'll unveil the whole plan. The work that had been done with prior CEOs won't be wasted. There's a lot of good stuff that's there as well. And then, we'll have a full plan that brings to life these beginnings of a vision I'm talking about.","Murray S. Kessler - Perrigo Co. Plc","So, that, I believe was last question. So, let me just close by saying, I look forward to letting knowing you all, and most importantly, sharing our plans soon to deliver consistent and reliable growth that builds values for our shareholders. Thank you for your interest in Perrigo.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect."],"16633":["Perrigo Co.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Perrigo Third Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Brad Joseph. Please go ahead, sir.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you. Good morning everyone, and welcome to Perrigo's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. I hope you all had a chance to review the press release we issued earlier this morning. A copy of this release is available on our website, as is the slide presentation for this call.","Leading today's call are John Hendrickson, Perrigo's Chief Executive Office, and Ron Winowiecki, Perrigo's acting Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind everyone that during this call participants will make forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for investors and shareholders and Safe Harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued earlier this morning. In addition, in the appendix for today's presentation we have provided reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures presented.","Turning to the agenda on slide 3. First, John will highlight the durability of our business model, illustrated by the continued strong margin profile of our businesses. Next, he will discuss the financial and operational highlights from the third quarter. Ron will then provide details on our third quarter performance, along with comments on our balance sheet and our updated 2017 financial guidance. Finally, John will close out the call with our outlook on the business. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Before jumping into results for the quarter, I would like to highlight some of the strategic initiatives that have enabled the strong business performance that we will discuss today.","First, when I was appointed CEO, I laid out a strategy to simplify our portfolio, focus our business model, and execute against our long range plan. Over the past year and a half, we've taken several specific actions aligned with that strategy. And I am pleased to say that these actions are, once again, driving positive performance results.","Perrigo is a well-positioned company that has the right to win in the markets where we compete. We offer quality, affordable health care products in an environment where governments, health care systems, and patients are focused on health care spending. Our unique business model and diversified product offerings are focused on a number of key OTC and prescription categories across North America and Europe. These categories not only represent solid growth opportunities for Perrigo, but also represent important treatment categories for patients and families, making Perrigo the ideal partner in a global effort to lower health care costs.","On slide 6, you can see the established margin trends in our businesses remain strong and consistent. We remain excited about the durability of our unique business model led by our consumer-facing businesses, which comprise approximately 80% of our net sales.","In our CHC Americas business, adjusted operating margin remains strong at over 20% for seven quarters in a row. And this quarter's 23.2% adjusted operating margin is a record third quarter for this business. This is a great performance by the CHCA team, a testament to our execution and strong customer relationships.","In our CHC International business, we have increased the adjusted operating margin profile to the mid teens. Growth in our core branded portfolio has resulted in the third consecutive quarter of meaningful year-over-year adjusted operating margin improvement and notably, year-over-year operating dollar improvement. We remain committed to achieving an adjusted operating margin in the high teens within the next three years. And I am proud of the team's continued progress towards this goal.","In our RX business, the adjusted operating margins remain strong at over 40%, driven by our new product pipeline and solid execution by the RX team on the base business. Even in the face of some challenging pricing, our team continues to drive strong performance from our uniquely differentiated asset and from new product introductions.","Our overall business model continues to enable consistent cash flow generation. With a keen focus on total shareholder returns, we again repurchased 1.9 million shares in the third quarter, totaling approximately $133 million. I would like to again thank the entire Perrigo team for delivering excellent third quarter results.","Turning to slide 7. New products remain the driver of future growth for Perrigo. And each of our business teams is focused on driving our market leadership position through new products. This skill set is core to the Perrigo advantage. A good example of the team's distinct capability in developing new products is the speed at which our CHC Americas business is able to develop, gain approval, and bring products to market.","The launch of the store brand version of Nexium is a great example of that capability. The team was able to file our ANDA with the FDA for the store brand version of Nexium on the same day that the national brand launched. This enabled us to be the first to launch a private label Nexium equivalent into the market. In the third quarter, our overall business realized $55 million of new products net sales, led by the generic versions of Axiron and the store brand version of Nexium.","Turning to slide 8. Our focus on operational execution has yielded positive results for our business during the quarter as, one, CHC Americas adjusted net sales grew over 1% versus the prior year, and store brands again gained share versus national brands. Over the last nine months, against the backdrop of a challenging consumer OTC marketplace, CHC Americas adjusted net sales have grown approximately 1%.","Two, CHC International constant currency net sales grew a solid 5%, excluding $42 million in the prior year for the exited unprofitable European distribution businesses. Over the last nine months, the strategy of aligning brand prioritization, where we have the right to win, with disciplined ROI-based advertising and promotional programs, has yield approximately 2% net sales growth.","And three, in the third quarter, excluding the effect of Entocort, the RX team grew net sales approximately 4%, driven by our strong new product pipeline and solid execution on the base business.","Strong business performances across all segments, including the shift in operating margin performance in our CHC International segment and continued strong RX execution, have enabled us to increase our adjusted EPS range to $4.80 to $4.95, which Ron will cover in more detail shortly.","Now I'll turn over the call over to Ron for some more details. Ron?","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, John, and good morning everyone. Bear with me with my \u2013 as you listen to my raspy voice this morning. I helped kick off the 2017 and 2018 cough\/cold season this week.","Last quarter, the theme I used to describe our business performance was converting opportunities into bottom line results. We are pleased that this theme continues, which is reflected in our performance again this quarter. Each of our businesses have developed a keen focus on execution, action, and capitalizing on opportunities, all of which have provided the foundation of our financial results in the first nine months of the year. These results were achieved again against a challenging and dynamic market backdrop for each of our segments.","Now let's turn to slide 10, where you can see our GAAP reporting results for the third quarter. Please reference the appendix for a more detailed reconciliation from reported to adjusted results.","I would like to take a moment to outline the effect of the favorable adjusted effective tax rate, or ETR, in the quarter. As you can see in this slide, our adjusted ETR is approximately 12% in the quarter, which contributed approximately $0.09 of upside to our previous guidance. Year to date, our adjusted ETR is approximately 17%, which is lower than our previous guidance. Our ETR guidance has improved primarily first to the utilization of tax attributes supported by the improved business performance in the CHC International segment, and second, improved jurisdictional mix of income across the company.","For the third quarter, recall that accounting principles require what is commonly known as annualization of the expected decrease or increase of the annual tax rate to be recorded in the current quarter. Accordingly, the third quarter tax rate is below the expected annual tax rate of 17%, due to this cumulative benefit for the first nine months of the year.","Turning to the CHC America results on slide 11. You can see that the net sales in the quarter were $599 million, compared to adjusted net sales of $590 million in the prior year, or growth of over 1% on a constant currency basis.","This increase is primarily driven by higher net sales in the GI category, in addition to strong performance in our Animal Health and Mexico businesses as compared to the prior year.","New product sales in the quarter were $13 million, driven by the store brand launch of Nexium, which launched late in the quarter. Offsetting these positive effects were lower sales primarily in the smoking cessation and contract categories, in addition to pricing pressure in certain OTC categories. Discontinued products were $3 million in the quarter.","For the quarter adjusted gross profit margin was 36.4%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to the prior year. Sell through of higher margin products, specifically in the Animal Health and Dermatology categories, in addition to positive contributions from supply chain efficiencies, offset price erosion in certain categories versus last year.","Adjusted operating margin was above 20% for the seventh quarter in a row, driven by gross margin flow through and lower selling and administrative costs due to restructuring actions and timing of R&D investments. The durability of this business is evidenced by the strong operating margin and continued consumer acceptance of store brand products.","Turning to slide 12. Net sales grew by approximately 5%, excluding $42 million from the exited unprofitable European distribution businesses and favorable foreign currency movements of $12 million. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales in the cough\/cold, allergy, analgesics, and lifestyle categories, in addition to new product sales of $11 million.","Adjusted gross profit margin in the quarter was 51.4% or a 570 basis point increase over the prior year, primarily due to the cancellation of the unprofitable distribution businesses. This segment also benefited from our strategy to insource more production of our branded OTC products, which helped to offset unfavorable effects from foreign currency purchases and a mix of lower margin products sold in the quarter.","Adjusted operating margining of 16.4% was driven primarily by gross margin flow through and lower operating expenses, primarily due to the improved sales infrastructure. The year-over-year adjusted operating margin improvement included advertising and promotion, or A&P, investments in line with the prior year.","Year-to-date adjusted operating margin was approximately 14.9%. Quarter by quarter, operating margin may vary by an estimated plus or minus 150 basis points from this run rate due to the timing of investments in innovation, A&P, or expenses to build out our back office systems in this segment, as I will discuss in more detail shortly.","As an example, the third quarter adjusted operating margin was clearly in the upper end of this range due to seasonally lower A&P spending as a percent of net sales. Saying it differently, if A&P spending in Q3 was the same as the quarterly average percent of net sales in the first half of 2017, adjusting operating margin in Q3 would have been consistent with the lower end of our guidance range of 14% to 15%.","Turning now to RX on slide 13. Net sales in this segment were relatively flat compared to the prior year. Excluding the $10 million year-over-year impact of Entocort, net sales in RX grew approximately 4% compared to the prior year. New product sales in the quarter were $31 million, driven by the generic launch of Axiron, among other new product launches, which are offset partially by price erosion at the lower end of our previous guidance of 9% to 11%.","Adjusted gross margin was 54.9%, as price erosion in Entocort competition offset new product contributions versus the prior year.","Adjusted operating margin for the segment was 42.4%, consistent with the same quarter in the prior year due to lower selling expenses driven by the restructuring of the specialty pharma salesforce and timing of R&D investments. Excluding Entocort, adjusted operating income grew an impressive 10% in the quarter to $103 million.","The strategy in this segment of driving new product launches and proactively managing our cost base in the difficult to manufacture extended topicals market delivered solid results again this quarter.","Now turning to slide 14. I will provide an update on our cash flow from operations and balance sheet. In the first nine months of the year we generated $482 million in cash from operations. Excluding an unusual tax payment of $74 million and cash restructuring payments of approximately $48 million, year-to-date cash from operations would total $604 million. Our team continues to focus on cash flow generation, as operational cash flow conversion as a percentage of adjusted net income for first nine months of the year was 116% excluding these two items.","As of September 30, 2017, total cash on the balance sheet was $776 million, and total outstanding debt was approximately $3.7 million (sic) [$3.7 billion]. As a reminder, we intend to repay approximately $370 million of debt due in December of this year. Including this repayment, our total debt is expected to be reduced by approximately $2.6 billion in 2017. Our debt pay down actions this year continue to increase our financial flexibility, enabling the majority of free cash flow to be available for inorganic growth opportunities and\/or returning capital to shareholders.","Our combined total debt maturities for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 are approximately $550 million. We believe that this balance sheet flexibility, coupled with our cash flow conversion, makes us unique in this space.","Our capital allocation decisions are focused on total shareholder returns within the context of our long standing commitment to an investment grade financial policy. As part of our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy, we completed approximately $192 million of share repurchases year to date.","Perrigo's strategic priorities remain focused on driving organic investment and organic pipeline, targeting inorganic opportunities in our Consumer and RX businesses to achieve measurable shareholder value creation, supplemented by shareholder return programs.","On slide 15 you can see the bridge that walks from our adjusted EPS guidance provided on August 10 to the upgraded adjusted EPS guide provided this morning.","The increase in guidance is primarily driven by three factors. First, given strong execution across all of our segments in the third quarter and a lower adjusted effective tax rate, we are upgrading our midpoint adjusted EPS guidance range by approximately $0.25 per share.","Second, we used our balance sheet flexibility and strong cash flow position to repurchase $133 million, or approximately 1.9 million shares in the quarter, which represents a benefit of approximately $0.02 per share in 2017. This action in our \u2013 this action is reflected in our 2017 share count guidance of 143 million shares.","Third, accounting for favorable currency movements compared to the forecast provided against August 10, we are updating our adjusted EPS guidance range by approximately $0.03 per share.","The result of these combined factors is a 30% increase in our midpoint adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.80 to $4.95 per share. Our continued emphasis on operational execution and actions to focus and simplify our business model continue to strengthen our performance outlook.","On slide 16 you can see our 2017 segment guidance. In CHC Americas we continue to expect approximately $2.4 billion in net sales. This guidance has remained consistent since February 28, 2017, when we initially announced guidance for the segment. Our adjusted operating margin guidance is expected to be within the range of 21% to 22%.","At CHC International, given the actions we have taken in this business and the corresponding strong performance of net sales along with currency movements, we now expect approximately $1.485 billion in net sales. This quarter we are also upgrading our adjusted operating margin guidance for 2017 to approximately 14% to 15% of net sales. This is driven by continued execution of our focused business strategy. Included in this updated range are seasonally higher fourth quarter A&P investments, which were consistent with the 2016 spending levels.","The CHC International team continues to look for ways to improve the portfolio with targeted streamlining and business development actions, executing on our insourcing strategy, and improving the cost structure of this segment.","In RX, given the continued strong performance of new product launches and execution of our diversified extended topicals portfolio, we now expect approximately $965 million in net sales. This forecast also includes an updated price erosion assumption. We are now anticipating to be in the high single digits for 2017. RX adjusted operating margin is forecasted between 41% to 42% for the year. We have continued to upgrade both top line and bottom line guidance during the year for this segment, based on execution of our strong pipeline and our differentiated generics platform.","On slide 17 you can see our increased consolidated 2017 guidance metrics. Driven by the upgrades just discussed for our CHC International and RX segments, we now expect consolidated adjusted net sales of approximately $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion and adjusted operating income in the range of $990 million to $1.01 billion for 2017.","Regarding growth investments, third quarter consolidated R&D investments as a percentage of net sales were 3%, which is lower than our expected run rate of nearly 4% of net sales for the year, partially due to the timing of clinical studies and milestone payments. This shift of approximately $10 million to $12 million is expected to be invested in Q4.","Our expected adjusted tax rate is now forecasted at approximately 17% to pre-tax income due to the factors outlined earlier.","Our full year adjusted EPS range has been updated to $4.80 to $4.95, a $0.30 midpoint improvement from the range provided on August 10. This range includes the updated share count to reflect the buyback executed during the third quarter.","The quality of business execution that we have seen through the third quarter not only provides increased confidence in our full year guidance, as illustrated by today's upgrade, but it also enables us to execute longer term strategic investments.","While we are pleased to be on track to achieve the benefits from our cost savings program, we plan to invest a portion of these savings back into the business in 2018. These investments will be in such areas as continuing to improve the business capabilities in CHC International, including the IT infrastructure, and regulatory and compliance programs such as the new global data privacy regulation.","To give a tangible example of reinvestment back into the business, we are currently in the process of implementing a pan-European integrated sales and operating technology platform that will continue to improve our forecast accuracy, reduce inventory obsolescence and returns, and support our sales effectiveness programs.","Our guidance for operational cash flow has been increased to $620 million, consistent with the upgrade in earnings guidance for the year. Excluding the unusual tax payment for $74 million, cash restructuring payments of approximately $60 million, 2017 cash from operations would total approximately $750 million.","Despite dynamic end markets, our guidance reflects the benefits of our ability to focus, simplify, and execute our business model. On a constant currency basis, excluding divested and exited businesses, our CHCA, our CHCI segments year to date net sales growth for 2017 are approximately 1% and 2% respectively. Excluding the year-over-year effect of Entocort, RX growth is trending above 2% in the second half of the year, driven by new product launches. These are overarching business trends are expected to continue as we enter 2018.","I would like to thank the entire Perrigo team for the quality of business execution that we have seen through the third quarter, which has played a large part in our ability to again upgrade our 2017 guidance. I will now turn the call back over to John.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Ron. Slide 19, as you can see, store brand growth continues to outpace national brand growth in most categories. This was driven by continued consumer acceptance of store brand products and the launch of store brand products in categories where national brands previously held exclusive share.","The growth of store brand is particularly prominent in the GI and smoking cessation categories, as new store brand products continue to offer consumers an expanded selection of high value, quality alternatives to national brand products.","Turning to slide 20. We aim to be a retail customer's strategic partner in bringing innovation, content, and thought leadership in digital marketing and e-commerce merchandising, as we have done over the years with traditional brick and mortar retail. We are building and investing in marketing resources and tools to enable our leadership in digital marketing and e-commerce. We believe store brand share growth through e-commerce will emerge, as it provides our customers the opportunity to engage more directly and closely with the consumer to convey the compelling quality and value message of our products. We are working on these initiatives with virtually all of our key customers, including traditional brick and mortar customers, many of whom have online presence.","Turning to slide 21. We continue to focus on profitability and steady operating margin expansion in the international business. The team is driving brands, innovation, enhancing e-commerce and digital capabilities, streamlining processes and functions, and engaging and developing our people. We still have a number of initiatives to optimize this business. And given its improved performance, we are now reinvesting to drive innovation in building out back office systems for further support of our sales strategies.","I am pleased with the margin expansion that the team has realized this year. And we continue to target an adjusted operating margin in the high teens over the next three years, including additional investments to support our branded strategies.","Turning to slide 22. We continue to execute and manage the RX business for the long term. The market size of additional opportunities remain sizable. And the R&D team is busy adding projects and working hard to advance the pipeline. Many of the new products launched this year are expected to provide benefits beyond one or two quarters, a testament to the RX team's rigorous product selection process. Looking forward, we remain excited about the 2018 new product pipeline.","We remain optimistic about bringing our generic version of ProAir to market and continue to work with the FDA on answering questions pertaining to a complete response letter that we recently received. There were no additional clinical studies requested as part of the CRL. And we are working to respond in the next few months with a goal of delivering this first to market generic product in 2018.","In closing on slide 23, our businesses have performed well through the first three quarters of 2017 and we remain optimistic about the opportunities going forward. Perrigo is well positioned to win in the quality affordable healthcare space. Our durable business model continues to deliver strong financial results and cash flow conversion in challenging and dynamic marketplaces.","As discussed earlier, our Consumer teams are delivering at or above market growth. Furthermore, the RX team is delivering on their plan, and we continue to expect growth in this segment. And with our enhanced balance sheet flexibility, the team continues to look for the best way to deliver value for our shareholders through investments in our organic pipeline, evaluating inorganic opportunities, and\/or return of capital.","In closing, I believe Perrigo is a company uniquely positioned within the healthcare space. And that it will be an important part of the equation, as both public and private sector stakeholders search for ways to lower the cost of healthcare. I am proud of what we have done to focus our business. And remain confident in our ability to continue driving value for our customers, consumers, and owners in the future.","Before turning the call over to Q&A, I thought I'd give a brief update regarding our ongoing CEO search. As I commented last quarter, I remain excited by the level of interest received from many high quality candidates. The board is working diligently in its search process and is focused on finding the right strategic and cultural leader for Perrigo.","I personally remain committed to leading Perrigo and supporting a smooth transition, which has enabled the board to conduct a truly thorough search to find the next CEO. Thank you very much for your time. Brad, I'll turn it back to you.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, John. Operator, I would like to open up the call for questions. We ask everybody to please limit yourself to one question. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Unknown Speaker","Operator. Thank you. And your first question comes from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, team. John, on the e-commerce comments, for whatever set of reasons e-commerce has been very small in terms of purchase of store brand OTC products for the industry and therefore to Perrigo. Short of Amazon or someone getting in in a big splashy way and making a push, how do you think this will evolve? Is it a slow, steady evolution of more of these things going through to e-commerce and away from brick and mortar? Or could you see a more sort of abrupt change there? Thanks.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, thanks, Gregg. Thanks for the question. From my perspective, I would say until more \u2013 whether it's Amazon or others get more and more behind buying OTC and those kind of products online, it will be a slow and steady increase. If they put more energy, muscle behind it, I think it could grow faster than that. But I think it's a more of a slow and steady, versus a dramatic shift within a quarter or something of that sort. It still is a \u2013 it's a good part of the business for both retailers and Amazon as they're getting into it. But as you said, still a relatively small percentage of the overall OTC market sold through those venues.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital Markets.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, thanks, guys. John, the diversified footprint has been delivering across all the businesses, which is perhaps support to keep that overall business intact. But specifically on the U.S. Consumer business, that's still the primary value driver. Can you help us think about the growth in that business?","And how do you get back to the 2% to 4% that you're targeting? We've now had two quarters in a row with $13 million in new product launches. You had some help from Nexium this quarter. Is there a way to get us comfortable that we're going to see an acceleration in some of those new launch \u2013 product launch opportunities over the next call it one quarter to three quarter to four quarters?","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. Thanks, Randall. So a couple parts of that. I'd say first of all, just going to your \u2013 the new product side. First, just to be clear, Nexium, we launched it right at the end of last quarter. And so we'd expect to see bigger sales of that in the fourth quarter here and back half. I think as I look at the growth, what gives me confidence is that store brand in the U.S. continues to gain share over brands. In other words, we're doing all the right things to drive share, to gain share.","The markets have been tough. So when you're looking at a relatively low growth market, I would assume over time it becomes a 1% to 2% growth market, in which case our numbers kick up higher than they are. Given what the overall market growth is, which right now over the quarter, Q3, was relatively small, less than a percent. For us to grow more than that and continue to grow 1 times, 1.5 times that, I think is good performance. So part of it has to be the market has to kick in. I do like the fact that we're gaining share, even in a lower growth market right now in the U.S.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much. Just was hoping to get a little bit more color on the RX business and base kind of pricing trends. I guess specifically what was erosion this quarter?","And how do you see the pricing dynamic shaping up as we start looking out to 2018? I guess specifically, it seems like you're talking about a 9% erosion in terms of the 2017 target. Is that a reasonable range to think about as we look out to 2018? Or could we actually think about a smaller erosion rate as we start to think about next year's numbers? Thank you.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, thanks, Chris. Appreciate the question. So I would say in the quarter the erosion that we experienced was in line with our expectation, sort of that high single digit kind of erosion level. So it was in line with that. That's what we experienced in the quarter. That's what we would plan going forward for the next quarter, high single digits. That's what's in our guidance numbers.","I haven't seen it subsiding enough yet where I can see a trend change. So right now as we look at RX business, as we're looking at, say, the first half of next year, we would plan on relatively big erosion again as we look at that next year and going forward.","So I'm not saying that that will happen for the next five years. But I just haven't seen the trend change yet to where I can say, boy, there's all of a sudden a 5% number or something like that.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. This is Ron, but now I could just add, sometimes we focus on pricing, but at the end of the day it's about new products. Right? So take a look at that business, and essentially in the evolution of this business this year, we had $217 million of sales in Q1, $240 million in Q2, $251 million in Q3, and you'll see a sequential growth again in Q4.","So when we're focused on pricing, what I think we've asked you to do is looking at the quality of the business and how this business is growing with net pricing pressure. So although we're \u2013 and John has mentioned \u2013 experiencing the high single digits with new products \u2013 example, $30 million of new products contribution in Q3. We grew 4%. That to me is the story.","So pricing, you bet. It's a challenge. But it comes back to, how do you offset new pricing? Is through pipeline, it's through new products. And we're proving our capability to show net growth in this business. And as we've talked, we expect net growth in the circa 2% in the second half of this year. So that to me is the ultimate metric of where the business trends are.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Great, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Maris with Wells Fargo.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Ron, on taxes, what do you think the implication of the tax reform proposal would be if passed on Perrigo? And then, John, we've written a lot about Amazon as a potential disruptor in pharmacy. Just as a follow-up to the earlier question, do you think that they'll enter the pharmacy business? Thanks.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, thanks, David, for the question. Obviously, a very relevant and important topic for every company at this point. To start, Perrigo has always talked about we believe that tax reform is necessary. Modernizing what you could argue is an outdated United States tax code for competitiveness for the U.S. in jobs and investment is critical for the U.S. economy over the longer term.","You step back and think about Perrigo, kind of going to your question, we have over 10,000 employees. Our largest manufacturing footprint is here in the U.S. And our goal and our priority is to enable and deliver quality affordable healthcare to consumers around the world. So that's the business of Perrigo.","I think, David, we can agree to kind of three things to start with. Number one, we're very early in the process. The first H-1 bill was issued just a week ago. It still remains very dynamic. And I think we probably can agree the final reform to the extent it's achieved will not be like the first bill that was provided. So that's probably the first thing.","Number two, it's very complex. It's a very complicated process. And this goes to some of the amendments we're seeing already in the process relative to some of the architecture of the current bill. Tax reform is not simple. The third part is every multinational company, of which Perrigo obviously is in that umbrella, will likely be affected by tax reform.","And the question, kind of going a little bit to your question is, what's often asked, is this good or bad for you? In my mind, that not \u2013 it's not a binary question. I think the issue we're all faced with is looking at what I call the building blocks and the systematic changes of the entire reform package. And then coming back and saying, what does that mean for Perrigo, our investors, and our customers?","So again, we applaud the U.S. government for being serious about tax reform. David, we're taking a very thoughtful process. We do see the House bill as what I'll call the opening bid. And we continue to monitor and evaluate again what I call the building blocks and systemic changes.","But for us to provide a good\/bad systemic indication at this point would not provide a very steady hand, thoughtful process. So we're looking for what final reform is. Where does the final delivery of the legislative process come forth to? And we'll be very proactive in communicating and addressing Perrigo's situation at that time.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","And, David, on Amazon, and I'll say online or those kind of things. I probably can't speak on Amazon on their exact intentions any more than what's out there publicly.","What I can say is my belief is that given our pharmaceutical delivery systems and everything, there will be disruptors in the market. There will be people, whether it's Amazon or others, that come and try and figure out ways to get products to consumers in a more efficient way and do those things. I believe that that's frankly healthy for us as a U.S.","So I think there will be disruptors. I count on Perrigo as a company living up to our mantra. Our mantra has always been, fast, fluid, flexible. We're going to react to situations, we're going to be a leader once we see where it's going and driving it.","So whether it's Amazon or someone else, I do believe there will be disruptors out there on the buying, on the way of getting pharma products to consumers, on those kind of things. And our view would be we plan to be right there with those as they take better shape.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Great.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, David.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Louise Chen of Cantor.","Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So just another question here on this online vendor opportunity. So why have consumers not historically used online vendors more to purchase OTC drugs? You had mentioned that there have been a couple of endeavors in the space. And could you elaborate a little bit more specifically on if Amazon were to enter the market, how that could help your business? Thank you.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, so thanks, Louise. Thanks for the question. I would say I don't have the \u2013 I want to be clear. I don't have the exact consumer \u2013 we did not do consumer studies yet to say why aren't you buying online or anything like that. So I don't have that.","My belief is in just my perspective in talking with others is that for the most part today, when you want to cure a migraine headache or do something and you go to your pantry and it's not there, you run to the store and get it. It's sort of a, as used as needed. You go get the cough\/cold product when you have a cough or cold. Most people aren't necessarily saying, is my product in my cupboard expired, should I buy more. Those kind of things yet.","So I think it's more of a, I need it when I use it. I go to get it. Got pretty convenient locations locally to run and get that. I don't have to go to a large grocery store. I can go to anything that's close by if I choose to. So I think that is part of it so far.","I do think that Amazon, if you pull up Amazon and go through it, they have a number of products for sale there in the OTC categories. So it's not like the products are presented aren't out there. I think as they get more behind the merchandising of it, just as retailers get more behind the merchandising, it will continue to evolve and grow as a online purchase source.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Louise.","Operator","Your next question is from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.","Candace Richardson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, this is Candace Richardson on for Jami Rubin. I'm wondering if you're still considering strategic alternatives for the RX business? Or do you feel like you have enough flexibility to further invest and diversify away from derm? Or is derm relatively inflated at this point in your view?","And then secondly, can you just comment on product mix this quarter in RX? I know it was a pretty big benefit last quarter. And to what extent was it a driver this quarter? And how should we think about that going forward? Thanks.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, so let me tell you, and it's probably pretty consistent to what I've said over the last couple quarters on RX. First of all, we like our business. We continue to invest in our business. We think we have a good pipeline, all those things. So despite the market dynamics and the craziness, we feel we have one of the better businesses out there. And I think I've continued to say that relatively consistently.","When you do have that and you have market disruptions, dynamics like you have today, we're looking at every way still, with the RX business and frankly all of our businesses, but to say is there other ways to create value. Are there other things to do? Should we be adding products into our portfolio from the outside? Should we be doing other things?","So I would say we continue to look at all of those options of increasing the value. But we think we do it from a position of strength. We don't feel we have to make moves. We feel there's enough products in our pipeline and the extended topical area is broader than derm. We have nasal sprays and inhalation products, et cetera. But it's broader than that. And we feel there's plenty of products to continue to invest in, to continue to increase our R&D investments, to keep growing that category, and do what we do. So with that, Ron, I don't know if you want to take her mix question.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you bet, John. So product mix was normal this quarter. We've kind of talked to investors across the board that if you look at a average gross profit margin, adjusted gross profit margin as the indicator, it's around 55%. This quarter, 55%. Now again, quarter by quarter we may vary off that 150 basis points plus or minus. But a standardized margin in this business right now, it's about that window. And we are right there this last quarter.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","I would say the one thing as you think about the operating margin, is Ron talked about in his part, the R&D investment. And so we had lower R&D, some of that lower spend translated down the operating margin higher number this quarter. Excuse me, yeah, this quarter. So 100 basis points, 150 basis points normalize it between this quarter and next quarter, because we will be planning on spending that R&D in Q4, as Ron said in his comments.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Great. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, can you talk about the o-U.S. operating margin just a little more? You mentioned insourcing was a help in the quarter. How much was it a help in the quarter? And where are we in that process of starting to bring the products in? I mean is this the first quarter we've seen any impact? This is certainly first time you've actually mentioned it.","And then I guess I'm just wondering, if you didn't spend and you got such great returns on the top line, how did you do that this quarter? And why is there a need to spend next quarter extra money? Just, I'm just curious. Thanks.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Hey, Marc. I, yeah, I can take that one.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. Well, Ron will take that one, please.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","But yeah, kind of a two-part question there. So first of all, we have talked about insourcing for some time, so hopefully that message has been clear, Marc, at least in my mind. We provided systematic commentary that that strategy started about a year and a half ago and we're starting to see the benefits. If you look at the gross profit margin in this business, it's been running pretty much like clockwork at 51%, 52% adjusted GPs to sales. So pretty consistent performance. So we are seeing the phasing in.","And as we've talked about before, just to put kind of an overarching metric on it, we acquired the assets of Omega, the branded business. They were about 80% outsourced. Now our goal is to get that down to under 60% outsourced. And again we've said we're just about halfway through that journey, not quite. So figure a third to halfway through that journey at this point. So it's phasing into our performance as we speak.","On the A&P piece, it's seasonal. I mean if you look at the metrics, Marc, and trend backwards, this business, yeah, Q1, Q2, Q4, usually runs 12%. Q4 is a great example. You're spending into the cough\/cold season. You're spending into lifestyle. We have lifestyle weight loss products. You want to advertise and promote into \"the January renewal cycle.\" And Q3 is always running around that 10% of sales.","So there's nothing I'll call out that we've done dynamically different. It is A&P aligned with our sales strategy is one of the key things Svend [Andersen] has done is ensuring our sales management model is aligned with our promotional programs. So we are making sure in a disciplined way that that A&P ties to our top line execution. And you're just seeing that in Q3. Nothing unusual other than business discipline and again some seasonally lower attribution, just given the product portfolio in Q3.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","I would say, Marc, the other thing that \u2013 if you think evolution-wise we still feel \u2013 and this has been consistent as we've talked about that. Over the next three years we can get to that high teens. In order to get there we've got to continue to do things fundamentally different. So as opposed to just muscling through margin, doing some insourcing, it requires different infrastructures, different investments. We've been saving good money. We're making sure we're taking some of that and putting it back in the business to get to those higher margins.","So those investments of $10 million to $20 million that it will take to create a better infrastructure, we feel we're at a good position to initiate those and add those in. And those will be key parts of our 2008 (sic) [2018] investment strategy when you look at the expense side to get to those higher end margins ultimately. Thanks, Marc.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Annabel Samimy with Stifel.","Annabel Eva Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks. So while we're on the topic of the International, so a lot of what you've done has been on the operating efficiencies, infrastructure, improving that margin. Is it time to think where you can start bringing around the revenue synergy to bringing new products onto the platform? And have you identified those first areas that you want to sort of drive some revenue synergies from?","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, great question. So first of all, we are happy. We got out of the unprofitable distribution side. But we're happy with the 4% to 5% growth in that business that we had this quarter. We think that's very good growth for that business. So even without adding in all of those, we do have a new product pipeline, new product launch within CHCI that phases out over the next three years, as they look at those kind of products. And we are looking for both internal synergies I would say, Annabel, as well as inorganic opportunities to add in products. We feel like our infrastructure is more stable.","Again as I said earlier, there's a lot more we need to do to get it to where it's U.S.-like, if you will. But it's a lot more stable. And we feel like we could add inorganic opportunities into that infrastructure and be able to absorb it and have gross profit flow pretty well down to the operating margin. So we are looking at all of those. And we feel better about the positioning of our international business now, as we've made some of the initial changes. Thanks, Annabel.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Douglas Tsao with Barclays.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just on the Nexium launch, which you got off and you indicated it in the prepared remarks that you expected that to sort of build as we go through fourth quarter. We know there's at least one other competitive entrant into that category. So just sort of trying to think about how that will progress as we move through next year? And if you have any insight in terms of the competitive landscape in terms of how many you think there will be in say 2018?","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. So first of all, there is a competitor out there. We have that \u2013 we had that in our initial plans as we talked. There were three initial companies. One got the approval. Those were in our plans. We launched the product, expect to continue to build that through the quarter. We would expect over time, as we've done in most of the other products, to have our fair share of that product category.","Do we think we'll have other competition? I do. I believe ultimately there will be others out there. But we believe because of our strength, et cetera, we will have our ultimate fair share of a good GI category, as we do in the other products that we have within that category, lansoprazole, omeprazole, those kind of products, we have a fair share despite competition. And so we believe that we're able to do that, even though competition will be there.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Hey, David.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Morning, David.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Hi, congrats on the performance. I wanted to ask about consumer healthcare. So could you just provide a little bit more context? Obviously the performance that you delivered was well above expectations. But just sort of step back and put in for context for us why that segment revenue growth was only 1%, particularly when you launched Nexium?","And then in terms of helping us understand how to think about that segment sequentially going into the December quarter, how much fourth quarter revenue variability is there with respect to the cough\/cold\/flu season? Meaning, is that a big swing factor in the fourth quarter? And maybe you could just talk about the range of possibilities for the cough\/cold\/flu season in the fourth quarter. Thank you.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, thank you. So let me take the kind of first part of that. And, Ron, I think I'll toss you over for the second if you think of it.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","So in general, we actually feel very good about the growth in the quarter of the business. And just because of where the category growth is, where the market is, the actual performance of the brands, et cetera, we feel pretty good about growing share and being able to continue to grow that. We think then as market growth continues, we're a bigger share of that market, and it enables future growth. So in general, we feel good about that.","I would say cough\/cold \u2013 matter of fact, maybe, Ron, I'll toss both those over to you. Cough\/cold and then variability. I will say last year Q3, not that I'm trying to do too much of that, but we had a really strong last year Q3 with launches, with a number of things going on. I think it was 4% to 5% growth last year. So the 1% for us over and above that 4% to 5% number last year was actually a pretty good achievement as we looked at it overall. Ron, you want to talk about cough\/cold and\/or the growth side?","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, so certainly I'll kind of go through a couple things. So first of all, again to your question, we did grow last year Q3, roughly 4% in Q3, 5%. Just to kind of put the comps out there that we're growing off of. So again, still good performance against those relative comps, number one.","The cough\/cold dynamic, we've moderated \u2013 or I shouldn't say moderated. We put in a normalized cough\/cold season. If you look at normal business patterns, it's usually a little higher in Q4 just due to some seasonality. If you look at our guidance model for this year, you're going to see in the 2.5%-ish to 3% uptick from Q3. But that's pretty traditional. There's not a lot of difference from what we've seen in our historical patterns.","So again, we're modeling on a normalized cough\/cold season. We're not looking at any other kind of product \u2013 any kind of product dynamics other than the Nexium new product penetration that we see in Q4. And again on a sequential basis if you model out in that 2% to 3% zone \u2013 that's what our guidance tells you to do \u2013 you'll come out what we expect in the Q4 sales line.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).","Thank you. Art Shannon, you may begin your conference.","Art Shannon","Thank you very much, Lindsay. Welcome to Perrigo's fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. I hope you all had a chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the release is available on our website. Also on our website is the slide presentation for this call.","Before we proceed with the call from our headquarters here in Dublin, I would like to remind everyone that during the process of this call, management will be making certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for investors and shareholders and Safe Harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued this morning.","Following management's review of the presentation, we will open the call for questions. I'd like to now turn the call over to Perrigo's Chairman and CEO, Joe Papa.","Joe Papa","Thank you, Art, and welcome everyone to Perrigo's fourth quarter fiscal 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me today is Judy Brown, Perrigo's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Now let's go through the agenda for today's call. I will begin with a brief overview of the quarter and the year. Next, Judy will go through the details for the fiscal fourth quarter and walk through our fiscal year 2015 guidance. Then I will provide an update on each business areas as well as an overview of our expectations for the fiscal year. We will conclude by providing an opportunity for question-and-answers.","Now let's look at Perrigo's fourth quarter. On Slide 4, you can see that this was another great quarter for Perrigo, finishing our fiscal year on a very strong note. Our quarterly performance is highlighted by all time record net sales of $1.14 billion, with an 18% net sales growth, leading to continued record adjusted gross profit and operating margin expansion, which was up 510 basis points.","Moving on to Slide 5, it was an historic year for Perrigo with a record top and bottom-line results. We recorded a 15% year-over-year improvement in net sales for fiscal 2014, reaching $4.06 billion, which included 7% organic growth.","New product sales added $231 million far surpassing our goal of $190 million. Fiscal 2014 adjusted net income increased 40% to $740 million or $6.39 per diluted share. The strong sales results correlate with impressive improvements in adjusted gross margins and operating margins, which saw 340 basis point and 250 basis point improvement respectively. This strong performance was driven by great executions especially within our Rx business segment and the acquisition of Elan.","Looking at Slide 6, we achieved over a $1 billion in sales for the second straight quarter. Rx business grew 30% 30% in the quarter, while CHC achieved an 8% growth rate, and Specialty Science has been very pleased with the performance of Tysabri, it is a great asset that is generating significant cash flow. And as I stated when we acquired it, we loved the Tysabri asset and the optionality that it gives us. We look forward to a full year contribution of fiscal year 2015 at the higher royalty rate for Tysabri.","The Nutritional segment was relatively flat compared to last year's comparatively strong performance with the launch of the smart tub in infant formula.","As you could see on Slide 7, the overall OTC category was up, while store brand were slightly down. The reason for this was the return of two main national brand companies. Excluding that dynamics, we continue to gain market share in store brands across most categories. Compared with 7% organic growth in quarter and for the full year and a flat-to-down store brand market illustrates the strength of the Perrigo business model that focuses on quality affordable healthcare.","Now let me turn the call over to Judy.","Judy Brown","Thanks, Joe. Good morning everyone. As you just heard, we closed fiscal 2014 on a high note, delivering record financial results, despite the various challenges the organization confronted. On a consolidated basis the team continued its strong performance, posting record quarterly revenue, adjusted margins, and adjusted earnings.","As usual I will provide a brief overview of the adjusted results to the fiscal fourth quarter by business segments. Then I will walk you through the consolidated and segment earnings guidance for fiscal 2015.","So let's begin with the fiscal fourth quarter highlights in the individual business segments starting on Slide 8 with Consumer Healthcare. The 8% net sales growth was driven by an increase in sales of existing products for $52 million primarily in the antacids and smoking cessation category. New product sales of approximately $15 million and $6 million attributable to the recent acquisition of OTC products acquired from Aspen. These combined increases were offset by a decline of $29 million in sales of existing products, due primarily to relatively lower sales in third-party contract manufacturing and a delayed start to the flea and tick in the U.S.","The animal health revenue realized in the quarter was in fact softer than we had hoped as the slow start to the season we noted last quarter continued. Despite these impacts, I'm pleased to note that sales within all major categories of OTC were up year-over-year. Specifically the smoking cessation category performed above our expectations due to two factors. One, continued robust sales of the store brand version of Nicorette mini lozenges; and two, our teams ability to efficiently supply our customers needed products as national branded competitor is not shipping specific skews at this time.","Within the GI category, sales of Lansoprazole were higher year-over-year, due to increased customer utilization of the store brand products, as well as manufacturing issues at a competitive store brand supplier.","The adjusted gross margin decline of 210 basis points was due to a combination of relatively weaker sales within the higher margin animal health category, relatively weaker products mix, and an under absorption of fixed production costs.","Remember, as we have previously stated, we have begun to make investments to an increased plant capacity to support our long-term growth initiatives. These forces were partially offset by greater sales in specific higher margin products within the categories I just mentioned.","The difference between the adjusted growth and adjusted operating margin leverage year-over-year was due primarily to lower DSG&A expenses as a percent of sales, as we further integrated the animal health and diabetes category, thereby decreasing redundant costs. This lower DSG&A spend was partially offset by increased R&D investments as we continue to build our long-term pipeline.","On Slide 9, you can see that net sales in nutritionals were $145 million as new product sales of $6 million were more than offset by the combination of lower year-over-year sales in infant toddler foods and $4 million in discontinued products.","Despite not achieving our sales guidance range for the segment in total, within the infant formula category revenue was driven by strong growth in our organic formula product line as consumer interest in these types of high quality offerings continues to grow.","Additionally, our infant formula sales to China relaunched in fiscal Q3 continued this quarter consistent with our expectations.","Adjusted gross margin for the segment decreased 140 basis points year-over-year to 27.5%, due to scheduled maintenance effort at our manufacturing facilities in June.","Adjusted operating margin was impacted by increased promotional investments to support the launch of our branded probiotic insync.","On Slide 10, you can see that our Rx business continues its robust performance as net sales growth was driven by new products sales of $35 million and sales related to products acquired from the acquisition of Fera of $20 million.","Adjusted gross and operating margin expansion continued increasing 440 basis points and 550 basis points respectively. The adjusted operating margin expanded even despite higher dollar investments in research and development clinical studies, as well as continued investments to grow our specialty Rx sales force.","Turning to Slide 11. Net sales in the API segment declined to $33 million, due to a decrease in existing product sales of $70 million, as a result of increased competition on certain products, partially offset by $8 million in new product sales.","Growth and operating margins expanded due primarily to product mix and decrease of G&A expenses. Given our continued focus on vertical integration we may start in rightsizing API's cost structure to mere this focus, evidenced by an expansion in margin. The majority of this impact is expected to materialize next quarter.","Turning to Slide 12, Specialty Sciences revenues were $86 million for the quarter comprised of one month of Tysabri royalties at 12%, two months at 18%, and approximately $10 million attributable to the royalty recognized from Biogen's deferred revenue in Italy. Adjusted operating margin incorporated ongoing administrative operating cost for the quarter.","The consolidated adjusted effective tax rate for this quarter was 21% and 20.7% for the fiscal year in line with our expectations.","I will end my fiscal year 2014 comments with my favorite topic, cash. We concluded the year with cash flow from operations of $694 million, even after the inclusion of $186 million of one-time costs related to our Elan acquisition this year, a very strong finish to the year.","Now I would like to discuss fiscal 2015 guidance for the company and by individual segments, starting on Slide 13. Since our third fiscal quarter earnings announcement we met with a large number of investors and analysts and received comprehensive feedback on a number and type of guidance metrics we provide the Street. After a period of self-reflection, we made the decision to put forward today's revised guidance framework which, we believe will enable you to properly model the company in sufficient detail, but also keeping focus on the overall value creation imperatives. Importantly we are opting to guide to an expected adjusted operating margin percentage for the company as well as the segment rather than the previously provided ranges, anticipating actual full year performance to be within approximately 200 basis points in either direction of the stated target.","So within Consumer Healthcare, we anticipate that store brands will continue to be important contributors for the growth of our retail customers, and therefore our plan assumes that excluding those categories impacted by national brand market return, store brand share of the OTC pharmaceutical market will continue to grow. Likewise we have assumed that our store brands, our share of store brands will continue to increase.","Also I would like to remind you that our annual planning follows the same assumptions we have used in the past regarding each of the cough, cold, flu and allergy seasons. That is we estimate the demand for the upcoming season choosing the average of the previous 10 seasons.","Now let's walk through a few specific products in detail. Included in our guidance on a risk adjusted basis are the launches of the store brand versions of specific nasal corticosteroid products in time for the spring 2015 allergy season. Our guidance also includes the expected launch of store and value brand versions of flea and tick line extension products in time for next season.","Not included in our guidance at this time are either the 600 milligram extended release guaifenesin product or the broader family of Mucinex D, DM, Max et cetera equivalent products. Joe will discuss these items in further detail in a few minutes.","And repeating a comment from a moment ago, CHD's year-over-year revenue growth range also reflects the impact of a continuing return to market of a large branded analgesic competitor's product lineup.","In our Nutritional segment, our revenue guidance includes the assumption that by the end of fiscal 2015, we will grow infant formula store brand market share, increase our international presence, and launch the store brand version of Ensure adult nutrition drink. This revenue guidance also includes growth greater than 5% in our BMS category as we continue to expand distribution and sales of insync probiotic.","For Rx, we anticipate top-line growth driven by new products and recent acquisitions. Adjusted margins are expected to remain strong.","Within the Specialty Sciences segment, we expect to receive an 18% royalty on in-market sales of Tysabri up to $2 billion and a 25% royalty on any sales above this level.","Now looking to our consolidated projections, for fiscal 2015 we anticipate adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $7.20 and $7.50, an increase of 13% to 17% compared to fiscal 2014's $6.39.","Summing everything back up at the consolidated Perrigo P&L, we estimate that net growth will be between 7% and 11% compared to fiscal 2014 and assume new product sales of greater than $235 million, with approximately 70% of these sales expected in the second half of the fiscal year, as well as continued growth in our base business.","After you roll up the individual business units, you should include in your model corporate unallocated expenses of approximately $80 million and interest expense of approximately $100 million.","Additionally, we are estimating an adjusted worldwide effective tax rate of approximately 16% for fiscal 2015, excluding any impacts from the resolution of ongoing tax examination and other statute expiration.","So that is the full year view. As I noted a few minutes, we also spend considerable amount to time debating the need to provide our investors some additional color around upcoming quarters. While we are not moving to a quarterly guidance model, given the many complexities of our varied business units, we would like to provide an overview of our first fiscal quarter to help further refine your FY 2015 model.","As you may recall, earnings in our first fiscal quarter of 2014 were strong. We exclusively launched the U.S. generic of Temodar, we shipped a large amount of OTC product as retailers pushed for an early buy into the season, and we recorded a large amount of contract sales in Consumer Healthcare.","As you model fiscal 2015 please note that while we expect to execute well on our core businesses, these same specific dynamics experienced last year at this time are not expected to repeat. The totality of these relative quarterly dynamics including additional investments to further our strategic plan, are expected to produce first quarter FY 2015 year-over-year adjusted net income growth at the lower end of the full fiscal year 31% to 37% guidance range you see here.","Taking the incremental 39 million shares outstanding in the first quarter FY 2015, adjusted EPS are expected to be lower versus this time in fiscal 2014.","So thinking about the remainder of the fiscal year, due to the dynamics I just highlighted, we expect the weighting of net sales and EPS to be lowest in our first fiscal quarter to notch up in the second and third fiscal quarters and to be at their highest in the fourth quarter due to seasonality as we plan to launch further line extension flea and tick products and a more heavily weighted second half for anticipated new product launches which I mentioned earlier.","Operating cash flow is expected to continue to be robust in fiscal 2015 growing to over $1 billion furthered by a full year of Tysabri revenues and a strong base business cash generation.","In summary, we've concluded another record year where we crossed $4 billion in annual sales, grew organic top-line sales 7% in a difficult environment, and furthered our operational excellence. The acquisition of Elan provided us with a significant platform to continue growing and we continue to invest in R&D and plant capacity for the long-term.","Fiscal 2015 looks to be another productive year as we expect to launch over $235 million in new products and advance many strategic initiatives through both organic and inorganic growth.","Now let me turn it back to Joe.","Joe Papa","Thank you, Judy. It was a great year but it did have some challenges. Think about the growth in our consumer healthcare business. It grew 8% despite not having the store brand version of U6 600 milligrams for much of the year and we also had to overcome the loss of $100 million in contract revenue based on the reentry of major national brand and lower contract manufacturing sales. That shows the strength of our Consumer Healthcare core business.","Now let's talk about fiscal year 2015. First, we have to bring the store brand version of Mucinex 600 milligrams back to the market. We have a pathway to get this product to the market. I have a dedicate team meeting weekly to make this happen. I feel strongly that we will get this product done but I'm not going to give you a specific date until I have product headed to the retailer shell. As Judy just told you, Mucinex 600 milligrams is not included in our fiscal 2015 guidance. It is a critical R&D imperative for us to bring this product back to the market in our fiscal 2015.","Second, we are continuing to invest in future growth. We continue to invest and import new products and anticipate reaping the benefits from those products in the future. As you saw just last month, as a result of the hard work by our team, we received an AB therapeutic equivalent rating from the FDA for Testosterone Gel 1%. We were also the first to receive final approval from the FDA for the store brand version of Advil congestion relief tablets. These are examples of why we are continuing to invest in research and development with the goal being first to the market in Rx OTC switches, new products, and innovation, plus we have new product offerings in our animal health, in infant formula business that we expect to launch during the fiscal year.","These investments give us every reason to believe in the strength and long-term viability of our business model. That belief is further supported by three mega trends that we've been discussing since I joined Perrigo years ago. First, the continued movement of consumers from national brands to store brand products. Second, the continued movement of prescription products switching to over-the-counter status, just a few weeks ago, Flonase received FDA approval to switch from prescription to OTC. Third, the rise in healthcare cost combined with an ageing population will continue to drive the global need for quality affordable healthcare products. This is why we are continuing to invest in our research and development, and in fact, in fiscal year 2015, we are investing an incremental $19 million in research and development.","Now as you can see on Slide 14, our team is poised to launch a number of products in fiscal 2015 highlighted by launches of nasal sprays and product line extensions in flea and tick products for pets. For the year, we expect to launch over 100 new products across all of our segments, resulting in more than $235 million in new products sales, which will exceed last year's strong new product sales level.","Moving on to our growth opportunities Rx segment on Slide 15, we have a very robust pipeline of 31 ANDAs pending FDA approval representing over $4 billion in branded sales. This includes five confirmed to first-to-file ANDAs, including the generic version of Androgel 1.62%. The positive momentum in this segment should continue with the best new product pipeline in our history.","I just had a pleasure of sharing my objectives for fiscal 2015 with the board of directors of Perrigo here in Dublin, Ireland, and what we're focused on is number one, execution across our five pillars; number two, continued focus on quality and service; and number three, the realization of the best new product pipeline in our history. We plan to grow adjusted net income from 31% to 37%.","In summary, on Slide 15, the strength of our enhanced platform for growth, combined with the mega trends I just discussed, positions Perrigo for further growth as we continue to execute on our mission in making quality healthcare more affordable for consumers.","Operator, let's now open up the call for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions).","Your first question comes from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley","Yes. Thanks very much. So congrats on the great results.","Joe Papa","Good morning, David.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. I have a couple of questions. Did you say that you wanted to limit the number of questions each person ask, I forget?","Joe Papa","We would like to limit it to one question please.","Judy Brown","Pick your best one, David.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Well, they are all great. But I guess I'll just pick number one. So just wanted to better understand the net income growth guidance for fiscal 2015. So it's 31% to 37%. But when one backs out the likely step up in Tysabri net income of about $200 million the implied net income growth for the core seems to be up in the high-single-digits. And so I just wanted to get a little bit more color on why that's below the company's long-term earnings growth targets when there is an easy cough, cold, flu comp versus fiscal 2014?","Joe Papa","I'll just start with a couple of highlights but then Judy I'll turn it to you for some of the more specifics. I mean, as we thought about 2014 and 2015 one of the things that we would have to do in terms of looking at this is look at some of the things that have happened relative to share counts I mean, specifically in how that would affect our EPS.","The other area is some significant investments we're making in a couple of areas. One is research and development going up to $19 million; and the other one is some investments in our sales efforts especially in the Rx business as we look to launch some additional products that we think are going to be very good margin products in the Specialty Science area -- I'm sorry our Specialty Pharmaceutical product area. But those are couple of the highlights of things that are driving some of the questions that you have. Judy you want to give him anymore specifics for David.","Judy Brown","Sure, Joe. We gave a lot of thought on how to explain the fact that I'm sure many of you have already done the math. Trying to roll forward EPS is complicated because there is a lot of noise when you roll last year to this year. So let me just roll EPS for a split second and I'll talk about adjusted net income as well on this because you take separate FY 2014 on an adjusted basis we end the year at $6.39 of EPS.","On a year-over-year basis with the change in the tax rate I just commented on and this is all very round numbers you pick up about $0.50 of EPS. But then of course we have the bad guy of a higher share comp over the course of the year. So that's a bad guy of about $0.90 just on a year-over-year basis. And we have full year while the interest rates that we're going to pay for the full year goes down by just having the same debt outstanding for the full year, full, full year versus what we have in fourth quarter it's a bad guy about $0.05.","So just on a really clean normalized basis you would say we're kind of starting with $6 a share on a clean basis this year. So now what are we going to do, we're going to roll forward midpoint of that range $7.20 to $7.50. If you pick the midpoint it's about $7.35. So there is the spread of what you're growing into next year just on a business basis.","David you keyed up an amount of contribution coming from our Specialty Science business of 200-ish million dollars of income. Don't forget we do have running costs that come with that. So we have give or take, I'd say about $29 million of operating costs that come with that business think about we've acquired not just a royalty stream but we have incremental activities as well so you have to take that into consideration. We're not commenting specifically on what we put into our forecast the Specialty Science revenue but suffice to say the remainder as you're backing into that still implied a growth rate of our overall business in that five-year CAGR range or a three-year CAGR range. Remember our three-year CAGRs we've said of between 5% and 10% top-line revenue growth.","Joe made the comment about the investments that we've been making incrementally in our base business and R&D and other selling and related expenses to further our strategic initiative. So I come back to actually when you back out that math like I just said, the remaining growth on the non-specialty science related business is firmly in that three-year CAGR overall growth guidance that we provided in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. I guess this is sort of a follow-up from Dave's question. But just in looking at your consolidated revenue growth outlook for 2015 7% to 11%, Judy if I adjust for Tysabri just the revenue contribution that we are anticipating for Tysabri we're getting about 2% growth if we assume the high-end of that revenue growth outlook of 11%. And if we then adjust last year for the contribution from Tysabri we're getting again using the high-end about 5% growth to the base business. Can you confirm to that we're looking at that correctly?","Judy Brown","I'm starting to sit and look at your excel model, which I'm sure I need my glasses for but --","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","Just looking at the guidance for this year the 7% to 11%?","Judy Brown","Sure, the top total company 7% to 11% you're spot on. And like I said we feel that our non-spec science growth is in -- got the ranges on a business unit by business unit and as we look at it and look at the sensitivity around those various segment guidance ranges we still feel like the non-spec science business is growing in our 5% to 10% longer-term CAGR. So again I don't know how much weight you've placed within the Tysabri number but suffice to say as we look at our model and add up the different segments, we are at that CAGR that we've provided in the past.","Joe Papa","Yes. I would just maybe I go with what Judy said and just may be a little more specific as we said Consumer Healthcare we think 3% to 7%; Nutritional 7% to 11%; Rx Pharmaceuticals in that 5% to 9%; and API admittedly is going down. We do think there's going to be a decline in that business. But those give you some sense of Jami what we're thinking about for the individual business units.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank","Thanks, good morning, or good afternoon to you. Joe the acquisitions you made before the Elan deal were I would say in the small to medium category. And is it fair to say the deals you're considering now are similar to those you've done in the past pre-Elan in terms of the flavor and size or would you add any other context to set expectations for folks? Thanks.","Joe Papa","Yes, thanks, Gregg. Gregg I think first comment may be just a reflection on where we've been. I've been in pharmaceuticals for 31 years. This is a most dynamic M&A market I've ever seen in the 31 years of being in the pharmaceutical business. I think from our point of view everything that we said a year ago is going very well relative to our plans to delever.","I would specifically say though relative to our targets and the size of the targets -- well, there are certainly adjacent category that I think would fit very much along the lines of what we have done historically in terms of being bolt-on product categories, things like pet care, ophthalmics, diabetes, adult nutrition. Those are all clearly things that we are very excited about to bolt-on some additional sell more products to our existing customers.","The other thing I'd say that is a little bit of an expansion as we continue to think about geographic expansion, where can we go geographically to continue to take our version of quality for the healthcare around the world. And the other comment, which we haven't talked about as much is we're interested in platforms, platforms where as we think about the future, what areas that we don't have our current capabilities from a technology point of view. Ophthalmics is an easy example for that in terms of platforms where we would be able to make our own ophthalmic products as example.","So in conclusion, I think lots of targets, there are some competencies that we are seeking to bring into the business, as well as to these adjacent categories from geographic expansion.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Hold back from asking 10 more. Thanks for that, Joe.","Joe Papa","Thank you.","Judy Brown","Thanks, Gregg.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Elliot Wilbur with Needham & Company.","Elliot Wilbur - Needham & Company","Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a very deep philosophical question directed toward Joe. And has to relate -- relates to the Consumer Healthcare business and I guess some of the -- I don't want to say may be challenges business is facing but may be in light of anticipation and some of the tailwinds that you've benefited in the last couple of years and just the growth outlook going forward. If you were to compare and contrast that business with your Rx business, there is many, many similarities but there seems to be sort of one critical differential and that's sort of in the value proposition of the two businesses once the product actually leaves the factory. And what I'm getting at is that on the consumer side store brand market Perrigo seems to capture significantly smaller portion of the overall value of the product that you would on the Rx side long and short of it, just putting in terms of numbers. I mean, it looks like products are sold at retailers at 65%, 70% discounts so the brand retailers enjoy enormous margins on that business. Obviously, on the Rx side distribution channel doesn't enjoy anything close to that. And I guess the observation would be kind of given some of the challenges that you're facing isn't it sort of time to sort of rethink that fundamental value proposition, seems like a lot of money is being left on the table? Thanks.","Joe Papa","That was a very philosophical question, Elliot. Let me step back and try to really just talk about what I think is really the fundamental vision we have for the business. And I start with this concept the word we want to focus, its quality affordable healthcare that's the area that we think that we can really make a difference whether that is within our Consumer Healthcare business or within the Rx business. What we continue to try to strive to is, try to figure out how can we get one more product that adds value for our retailers. If we get that one more product that goes in our truck from Perrigo going to one of the large retailers, we think that's important to them and important obviously and good for Perrigo shareholders.","So I do accept that they're just looking at -- I can't disagree with your basic premise in terms of just looking at the operating margins of the business. There are differences. No question about it. But at the same point, we do have a very significant market share in our Consumer Healthcare business. We do think that's a long-term very significant opportunity for us to continue to expand the product offering, especially as we -- as what we think about the newer products that we get in Consumer Healthcare tend to have better margins than our existing business. So we're always trying to add those next new product categories.","That's why the -- our comment today about having new product is so important for our future, because within those new products the actual new products aren't that different from what we have in the Rx or Consumer Healthcare. They tend to be close to each other. But I don't discount your commentary about there are just some difference in operating leverage. It deals somewhat with competition, it deals with somewhat -- with how we approach our retailers but that's going to happen. It's really us trying to drive our overall operating margin for our business, which I don't want to be repetitive but when we -- when I started the business it was in the single-digits and delighted to say that we had the latest quarter was in that 28% range. So we made great progress. Operator, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with B. Riley.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley","Hi. In the Nutritional category, I mean you explained how you expect to grow through adult nutrition in BMS. But does that imply that you expect infant formula sales to be down? And if you could just elaborate on that business and how you're feeling about it? I mean, I kind of wonder Joe if maybe that's one acquisition you regret. And then, secondly, on the smoking cessation, branded competitor that has gone out of the market temporarily, can you describe more specifics about that and how long you expect them to be out of the market and what your -- including in your guidance for that going forward in FY 2015? I guess those are my questions. Thanks.","Joe Papa","Sure. So you had a couple of parts to this question. On Nutritional business, as we stated we think that that's actually given a very good growth opportunity from 7% to 11% growth for the business. Infant formula is going to be up significantly. We do think that business is going to be up more than the respective average of the combined business of nutritionals. But the large part of that is both here in the U.S. but also some of the things that we're going to be doing internationally with infant formula.","The other area of importance for us is what we're looking at for adult nutrition. As you stated that is good, a good part for us that we -- as we launch these new products that area is very exciting.","Relative to your statement do I regret the acquisition of our infant formula business, the answer is absolutely no. I think it's a great business. There is only four manufacturers in the United States that can make infant formula. We are -- the other three are the branded companies and then there is Perrigo. Anytime I can find myself in that kind of position over the long-term with what I believe are significant barriers to entry for additional players I believe that that offers tremendous long-term growth opportunities. Have we had some challenges bringing out the plastic container and other things? Yes, we have. But that things that we've worked on, we've worked hard, we continue to see great growth opportunities.","On the smoking cessation portion of your question, Linda, there is really one major manufacturer of branded product out there that's run into some difficulty specifically in some of the lozenges product. I probably don't want to make any specific comments about how long I expect them to be out but we have found some opportunities in the lozenges category as retailers come to us for additional products for their shelves.","Judy Brown","Yes, Linda its Judy I just want to apologize if there was any confusion. I just highlighted a couple of things that we're new to point to on a -- into the fiscal 2015 year as opposed to implying that because I didn't comment on infant formula that in some way it was (inaudible).","Joe Papa","Operator, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital.","Randall Stanicky - RBC Capital","Great. Thanks guys. Can you hear me?","Joe Papa","Yes, Randall, hi.","Randall Stanicky - RBC Capital","Great. Hey, Judy a question for you on the consumer business. If we were thinking about some of the swing factors we look at seasonality at may be about 200 basis points should we think about the offset there being, the contract manufacturing customer just one more quarter to go, J&J and then Mucinex kind of offsetting each other, is that the right way and then any other swing factors that I may be missing?","Judy Brown","You hit the nail on the head. I have my answer all set you're basically answered yourself so that you're spot on. In terms of there is a seasonality factor that I mentioned to think about over the year but if you're talking about the full year-over-year you hit the critical point in terms of the headwind and then you got the good guys obviously with new product launches coming on in the year including with animal health.","Randall Stanicky - RBC Capital","And 200 basis points is that the right way to think about the seasonality aspect of it?","Judy Brown","You talk about in the quarter-over-quarter or the impact?","Randall Stanicky - RBC Capital","Well year-over-year cough, cold, flu and allergies we think about a normal year next year versus, I think we had a late seasonality here on all three of them this year?","Judy Brown","So for the entire segment do those things have about 200 basis point drag on growth is the question?","Randall Stanicky - RBC Capital","Correct.","Judy Brown","Probably a little bit lower somewhere between 1 and 2 I guess I'm ballparking it here. I don't -- I haven't done that exact science trying to drive through the season because again the seasonal impact is trying to extract how much a season versus how much is with volumes driven because of the return of national brand as well. So that is a directionally you're probably fairly accurate.","Randall Stanicky - RBC Capital","Okay. And you said Mucinex is not in the Nasacort is risk adjusted with that right?","Judy Brown","I said Mucinex and the family thereof are out.","Joe Papa","And I did say that we have nasal corticosteroid sprays in the number we have risk adjusted them but they; we do have a opportunity for those products.","Randall Stanicky - RBC Capital","Got it that would be upside then. Okay, great. Thanks, Joe.","Joe Papa","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Steinberg with Jefferies","David Steinberg - Jefferies","Thanks very much. Had a question on your Rx Pharma business. You've had very healthy growth over the past couple of years I think growing at 25% this past fiscal year. But in your guidance you're looking for 5% to 9% which is pretty sharp deceleration just curious what might be going on there is the pricing dynamics as more competition expected anything else going on why you forecast so much, substantially a lower growth rate going forward? Thanks","Joe Papa","Yes, I mean, I think, David you're right actually the growth rate for the full year is actually a little higher than that 31%. So we did have a very strong year. Having said that we're excited about the future, we think we got some great new products. And one of the questions really there is some competitive challenges that we expect from some of the new products if that does not manifest itself and we find ourselves without some of those competitive challenges there may be some upside in the growth. But much of what we're doing in the Rx business in terms of holding an upside would be really manifest itself in the new product category depending on what happens in new products.","Judy Brown","And don't forget David this year we had an acquisition. So you have the impact of the Fera acquisition in fiscal 2014 that contributed significantly and we talked throughout the year about how much that contribution drove top-line and adjusted operating income dollars. So the organic business, if you will, continues to grow well and then those acquisitions get calendared in because the Fera acquisition was effective essentially July 1 of last year. So it's fully calendared in at this stage.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Goodman with UBS.","Mark Goodman - UBS","Yes, I was hoping you could give us more color on the animal health, what happened in the quarter and how you're thinking about this growth in the future? Joe, this has been one of the areas you talk about as a big opportunity. So how is that changing and what are you looking for? Thanks.","Joe Papa","Well animal health did have a challenge in the quarter. As Judy said and I said, one of the issues was the leaner flea and tick season or a shorter flea and tick season during the first couple of months because the weather was colder. We really didn't see the start of the flea and tick season, for instance, in the southeast until March\/April timeframe versus an earlier timeframe. So it was a delayed start to the season to be clear.","As we think though about the future of what we're doing with flea and tick we do think there is some significant upside as we launch some new products into the category. That was really one of the commentaries we talked about in terms of the growth opportunity with new products in the animal health and specifically in the flea and tick area as we bring out some additional line expenses. So that that continues to make it very promising for us.","I think longer-term the issue simply for us is that we've got some good new products that we expect to launch but we do think that this category of animal health will be a category that would be even greater opportunities as the entire animal health business looks to -- a discontinuity on how the current prescribing, dispensing functions occur in the area versus what happening and what's got human health and we think some of that discontinue will change over the next five years. I don't want to get into long-term of that but that that's really why we're excited about it, why we think it's important and why we think the retailers the Wal-Marts, the Walgreens, the CVS, the Targets, all large club stores are all part of it has a significant interest in getting more involved in animal health and we want to make sure that we offer them the products to help them be more involved for the future opportunities there.","Mark Goodman - UBS","And Joe, just quickly on Nasacort, so you risk adjusted it in the numbers. Can you give us a sense of has anything changed in the past two or three months?","Joe Papa","Well we -- just let me state we do not have a final agreement with our partner but we continue to work very closely with our partner. We believe it's in the best interest of Perrigo and in the best interest of our partner to come to a resolution to get the -- to launch a store brand private label of Nasacort into the marketplace. The only thing I would say that it has changes that Sanofi has done very well with the product relative to its launch of the branded Nasacort product. So that's good news because once we do get to the marketplace, we think obviously there's going to be a very significant store brand private label opportunity for our product to get to the marketplace.","So we are making some progress but as I said earlier today we do not have a signed agreement at this time. Operator, next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sumant Kulkarni with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Sumant Kulkarni - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking the question. Could you talk about your outlook for the segment gross margins on an adjusted basis and could you provide us any sensitivities on tax rate in case there are any measures implemented by U.S. lawmakers that may affect already in tax inverted entity?","Judy Brown","Sumant may be I will just grab your first question. We as you can see on I believe its page 13 of the material are no longer providing gross margin guidance and we're trying to streamline all that. So we've given you operating margin, a targeted operating, adjusted operating margin by segment and for the company. So we are no longer going to be commenting on gross margins specifically apologies.","Joe Papa","And the second part was really concerning the tax and some of the questions around inversions I guess Sumant that was your --","Sumant Kulkarni - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Yes, any sensitivities on your tax rate in case there are measures implemented here by lawmakers that could affect already inverted entities like yourself.","Joe Papa","Well may be just -- I'll just offer a couple of facts and may be just leave with that. Number one, our transaction has been completed as evidenced by we're here in Dublin today talking to you. I think most of the focus right now is determining future inversions impending transactions. Specific to our transaction, we worked with a lot of advisors, lot of time resources dollars allocated towards making sure that our transaction met all the laws and requirements that are out there to simply to be sure.","I guess relative to any changes I ever don't want to speculate on anything specifically relative to potential changes but may be Judy you want to add something to give some color.","Judy Brown","Honestly, there may have been so many things that have been going around in the media, so many proposals, so many ideas being generated that frankly I would be imprudent to make any comment on potential impact rate not knowing what the change could be, if it all that would be implemented. That being said, we've always been keen on comprehensive tax reforms just in terms of supporting the global competitiveness in the United States and driving obviously all multi-national businesses to better results.","So although it's flowed up right. So at that point you say you're not to make comment on what happens to our effective tax rate with a variety of moving parts that Joe just mentioned. Our transactions closed and we believe a solid position going forward, and we'll just continue to monitor very closely what if any changes ever come through.","Joe Papa","Operator, next question","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JP Morgan.","Chris Schott - JP Morgan","Great, thanks. Primary question was on the Rx market and some of the price assumptions you're making for your base business in 2015. I guess you see some positive price trends and so what product offerings across the space. Can you just a little bit about just do you see more opportunity for price and just also gives us a flavor of what's in that guidance? And if I could just a second quick follow-up just turning back to last question. I know there has been a lot of attention for whatever reason paid specifically kind of interest rate deductibility and earnings stripping. Is that something that Perrigo -- would affect Perrigo if there was a change to how that's treated or just on that issue in particular can you just give us a little bit more color? Thanks very much.","Joe Papa","Well I'll take the first part of the question here in the Rx market. I think probably the best way to answer this question is do I think there are some opportunities on pricing in the Rx category, the answers is yes. But I think the overall comment I would make is that our strategy on pricing hasn't really changed in the past six, seven years, when I've been at Perrigo, is to try to keep our pricing flat to up slightly across our total book of business, in other words across all of our portfolio keep pricing flat to up slightly.","Our logic being that in any given year, in any given quarter we may raise prices on product A but then we make take a concession on Product B and C but try to keep that pricing flat to up slightly. If we do that and we're successful at that then which we've been then it allows to then layer on new product one, new product two, new product three which is why in our mind we're really excited about this year because of the magnitude of the new product that we have to bring to the marketplace.","So I think in general pricing is -- there are some opportunities but we're seeking to keep that pricing flat to up slightly across the total book of business that we have for all of our portfolio. Judy, do you want to take the other part of the question?","Judy Brown","Sure. So it's another case of negotiating against yourself right. There have been, we understand some things that have been floated around in some draft possible legislation talking about limiting interest deductions specifically on some intercompany debts. Obviously any discussion around intercompany debt and deductibility thereof is going to have an impact to really every multinational that has cash and capital movement between jurisdiction. So it's less about specifically companies that have redomiciled or really about how you view the entire international network for multinational company.","So would it affect us to some extent? It's hard to know at what point that might change and what in the meantime we have done proactively through organic and inorganic growth to change our international footprint. We can move our international footprint and become -- have a better jurisdictional mix as we continue to grow ex-U.S. as well. We keep growing in the U.S. that's good. We keep investing in the U.S. I'm telling U.S. tax great. And to the extent that there is some comprehensive tax reform, super. Yes, there are some discussions out there. But again, I'm not going to -- we're not going to negotiate against ourselves. We're going to wait and see what the proposals are and obviously act accordingly.","Joe Papa","Thank you. Operator, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Annabel Samimy with Stifel.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I want to just go back to the generics growth rate. I know year-over-year obviously the growth rate has come down, but it's also lower than your 10% to 20% three-years CAGR, historical three-years CAGR. So maybe can you help us with the granularity on some of the competitive business that's coming? And because it looks like you got a lot of products coming out with 31 ANDAs and about $1.2 billion in new products that you expected for this year. So may be some help there. Thank you.","Joe Papa","Yes. Let me -- may be just I'll comment -- I'll make a comment about specific part of your question then I'll get to just more of a general comment. I just remind you that when we give out a three-year CAGR, we do attempt to look at a compound annual growth rate over years, over three years. So if you add the 30% plus this current rate, we'll still be well within the range of what we have said for our guidance, first comment.","On the other question though do I think -- as we look at our portfolio, there is -- we have some significant new products that we are planning to launch, as I said over a 100 new products? What we are viewing that it will -- our competitive position and how many people launch products with us or we launch it alone and what our relative timing is could make a very big difference in that growth rate.","I think what was important for is to make sure that we could put numbers out that we felt comfortable with, knowing that if we have good timing or better timing or we have a less competitive environment there could be some upside. But as we look at our guidance across all of our business, we wanted to be very cognizant of the fact that we're in competitive situation with some products and want to make sure we know where the upside is for us, depending on when we want to keep new product and timing and competitive landscape. So that was really predominantly the reason we looked at what we did relative to our Rx guide but really for that matter across our total book of business.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel","Okay. Thank you.","Joe Papa","Operator, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Guggenheim Securities.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So first question I had was on the fiscal 2015 guidance, just a little more color. Wondering how we should think about upside if you do launch Mucinex. Sounds like you are still very committed to that product. And then, is there is any risk adjustment for Flonase at all? And then, if you assume any sort of a prolongation I guess of the smoking cessation opportunity? I know you won't talk about the exact timing but just wondering what you think about it qualitatively in your guidance. And then, second question I had was just back to your thoughts on consolidation of the industry and how Perrigo fits in there? And what kind of companies you view as buyers and sellers of businesses in this kind of market? Thank you.","Joe Papa","Well, quite a few comments there. Relative to Mucinex are we absolutely trying very hard to get that product back to the market as soon as possible? Answer is absolutely yes. As I mentioned, I got a team of individuals working on that on a weekly meeting to ensure we get that product back to the market as soon as possible. We do think there is a very specific pathway back, but I learned some hard lessons of just -- I'm not going another specific date on that, though I know the product is on its way to our customers. It's just things are fluid. But are we committed? Is it one of our highest critical imperatives within our R&D organization? Answer is absolutely yes.","On the question on Flonase, flonase is -- let me say it differently. Nasal Corticosteroid are in our forecast that is correct. What we have done though is risk adjust them. We think we have got the Nasacort opportunity, a Flonase opportunity. What we are simply trying to say here is that we believe there is a nasal corticosteroid opportunity reflecting these two products. We though want to make sure there is a risk adjustment to ensure that we don't get too far ahead of ourselves relative to getting the product to the marketplace.","I personally think that this whole area of Rx OTC is a very important area for us as evidenced by the fact, just in the last several months to year; we've seen the Flonase and Nasacort go over-the-counter. We've seen the overactive bladder market with the first product Oxytrol go over-the-counter. We obviously saw the very successful Nexium product go over-the-counter. We think there's a lot of opportunities in these Rx to OTC switches not just for the products I mentioned, but for the other members of the category that are in nasal corticosteroid sprays, overactive bladder, proton-pump inhibitors.","On the smoking cessation question, we don't have a good answer as to the exact time that that competitor will be out of the market. So therefore, we were really going to limit it to just take it on a -- we know the opportunity is today but I can't say whether that's a one month opportunity, another six months. So we try to be conservative in our guidance as to what we expect relative to when they will return to the market. I think I hit all the questions.","I'm sorry M&A. She has an M&A question. Sorry. Part four, M&A very robust or really active looking at things. What I would simply say to that is there is a lot of things on the table from other companies who have placed themselves up for sale. We continue to be very active. We think there are some great opportunities to build on the platform that we already have. As I said it's either adjacent categories, geographic expansion, or the technology competencies that we're seeking to add to the business. So we're going to continue to be very active there. Operator we have time for one more question -- two more questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Chiang with CRT Capital.","Tim Chiang - CRT Capital","Hi, Joe. Could you pull out a little bit more color on Androgel? I know there is two strengths. I mean and you've got what the only AB rated generic version of the 1% and your litigation on the 1.6. Is that something that you think you could be in on the market on both strengths next year?","Joe Papa","Let me make a comment on, but I can't further make any specific comment on timing. Number one, yes, I'm very -- we will say the team has probably done a absolutely great job research and development regulatory team to get the Androgel 1% products -- generic equivalent to that products approved and indeed to get the AB rating. So congratulations to the team that have accomplished that.","On the 1.62 that's a product that is in -- we are still in litigation for that product that's an area that's going to be a longer duration in terms of trying to resolve that. But I really can't make any specific comment about timing for that product at this point as I sit here today.","Tim Chiang - CRT Capital","Joe, may be just one follow-up on Nasacort. I know it's a high unit product. Are you already starting to build pretty launch quantities of that product?","Joe Papa","Yes, I probably would say, number one, we have the capabilities and capacity to make this product because we do make it for the prescription pharmaceutical market. So we do have the components or materials to make the product, yes. And we have obviously the experience of being out of the market place for several years in the Rx category with Nasacort. So we know to make it. We made a number of -- significant number of batteries over the last several years with the product so we are well prepared to do that.","As to the specific comment, I have to go back to what I said previously, we do not have a final agreement with our partner, we are working on that with our partner but I do believe it's in the best interest of our partner and Perrigo to get a store brand and private label product to the market as soon as possible and we will continue to move along that pathway.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Jon Andersen William Blair.","Jon Andersen - William Blair","Thank you for taking my question. Just one clarification the -- on the CHC guidance are you assuming that store brand share is higher in aggregate across the portfolio in fiscal 2015. And I think you mentioned you are expecting Perrigo's share of store brand to be higher and just wondering if that second piece is a continuation of a recent trend or is something new that's happening on the year ahead? Thanks.","Judy Brown","Well I'll take that, repeat a couple of the comments that I had in the prepared remarks, which is we assume that our share at store brand, if you take -- remember it's a big slice to the pie. The share is store brand we can well continue to grow within that size. We said that we think that store brands will continue to grow potentially except for the market that are going to be impacted by the return of the national brand to market. So what does that mean? Think analgesics will be a challenging category as the national brand returns to market in terms of overall share mix but we will as a company continue to grow. And then in the other categories we believe that we will continue to grow share overall in store brands. So it's hard to view it all holistically because of the impact in the mix of the different categories but in general store brand share continues to grow.","Joe Papa","Thank you. Operator that concludes our call for today and thank you everyone for your interest in Perrigo. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Brad Joseph, VP of Global Investor Relation and Internal Communications. You may begin your conference.","Bradley Joseph","Thank you. Good morning and welcome everyone to Perrigo's fourth quarter and calendar year 2017 earnings conference call. I hope you all had a chance to review the press release we issued last night. A copy of the release is available on our Web site, as is the slide presentation for this call.","Joining today's call are Perrigo Chairman, Laurie Brlas; Perrigo President and CEO, Uwe Roehrhoff; and Perrigo's CFO, Ron Winowiecki.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call participants will make forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for investors and shareholders and Safe Harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued last night. In addition, in the appendix for today's presentation, we have provided reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures presented.","Turning to the agenda on Slide 3. First, Laurie will discuss the CEO search process conducted by the Board of Directors and then introduce Uwe. Uwe will then build on this introduction with insights into his leadership philosophy and how Perrigo is well positioned in the healthcare and consumer industry. Ron will then discuss our calendar year 2017 performance metrics, before diving into the fourth quarter results. He will then highlight the strength of our balance sheet and discuss our 2018 guidance. Finally, Uwe will close out the call with his 2018 priorities after which we will open the line for questions.","Before I turn the call over to Laurie, I\u2019d like to personally congratulate Uwe and Ron on their appointments. I look forward to working alongside both of you in your new and merited capacities. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Laurie.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Laurie.","Laurie Brlas","Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and thanks so much for joining us today. I\u2019d like to take a few moments before we get started, discuss the Board's CEO search, selection of Uwe and the CEO transition process that is well underway. When John Hendrickson announced his decision to step down as CEO last June, the Board launched a thorough search process that included the engagement of leading executive search firms to identify the most appropriate and qualified CEO candidate.","As part of our search criteria, the Board was looking for a very strategic leader with a proven track record of operational excellence, experience in managing a complex global supply chain, and a focus on customer service. In addition, the Board was searching for a leader who would fit well within Perrigo culture and it would build on the open and transparent leadership approach established by John.","I'm pleased to say that Uwe checked all of these boxes. The Board was particularly, John to his ability to drive growth and operational excellence which resulted in a total shareholder return of approximately 225% during his tenure as CEO at Gerresheimer. Uwe is an experienced customer centric executive focused on value creation. During his 25 years at Gerresheimer, and especially the seven years he was CEO, he demonstrated his ability to manage a large complex global manufacturing and supply chain operation.","Uwe was instrumental in driving the company's strategic focus, transforming and reshaping its corporate portfolio and delivering on operational objective. This strategic focus was critical to the selection. In addition, he managed global relationship with hundreds of customers including the top 10 global pharmaceutical companies.","Appointing Uwe emphasizes the Board's confidence in the Perrigo management team and business unit leaders. The depth and breadth of their business acumen allow the Board to focus on selecting a strategic reminded CEO who brings experience, complementary to our healthcare and consumer focus. It was a great addition to the team and he has the Board's full support as he designs his strategic vision for the company. Uwe has already hit the ground running, and we\u2019re quite excited for the next chapter at Perrigo.","Finally on behalf of the entire Boar, management team and employees, I want to once again thank John Hendrickson for his nearly 30-yers of commitment to Perrigo. John was appointed CEO during a challenging period in our history and its leadership, operational focus and strategic company have set the stage for Uwe to leave the company into its next evolution.","And now I will turn the call over to Uwe.","Uwe Roehrhoff","Thank you, Laurie, for those very kind words. Good morning, everyone. Before discussing my excitement about Perrigo, I'd like to first address the decision to reschedule our full 2017 earnings release and conference call. Let me first apologize for the delay. We made this decision due to certain text review procedures that were not fully completed. We simply underestimated the amount of work and time needed to complete these procedures and we\u2019re committed to doing all we need to do to improve and correct our processes.","Now, please turn your attention to Slide 7, where I want to discuss my excitement for the opportunity to serve as CEO of such a great company with a legacy of providing affordable healthcare solution. Perrigo is well positioned in the healthcare and consumer industry. I look forward to working with experienced management team and the Board of Directors who leverage the company's unique asset base to deliver value for shareholders.","As a trusted partner for 130 years, Perrigo has made an impressive reputation within the industry to deliver affordable healthcare solutions for patient, consumer, and family. Perrigo's mission to provide quality affordable healthcare products, provides a true benefit to society in an environment with an increasing focus on rising healthcare cost.","After approximately six weeks as CEO, I want to share with you my first impression and why I\u2019m excited about our business. First, delivering results. Perrigo has a market leading business unit -- market leading businesses that deliver results in dynamic end markets. Giving our strong performance in 2017, we are entering 2018 from a position of trend across our businesses.","The CHC Americas business model is unique. We provide turnkey solutions to world's store brand share. We are driving new product investments, and are focused on channel expansion opportunity, including ecommerce, and customer service excellence, all of which make Perrigo the store brand partner of choice.","In CHC International, we meet the healthcare needs of consumers by levering our regional branded OTC growth strategies and over 200,000 pharmacy relationships. The Rx business invests in its diversified extended topical strategy and leverages its differentiated product development process. This business focuses on the categories that are best suited to deliver value for patients and healthcare system.","Second, supply chain excellence. Perrigo is a leader in operating an efficient and complex global supply chain that is challenging to replicate. Third, commitment to quality and customer service. Delivering on customer's high expectations is one of my top priorities. And I\u2019m encouraged by the Perrigo's organization's commitment to quality and customer service.","Fourth, dedication to compliance and business integrity. Perrigo has an outstanding reputation and demonstrates a high-level of integrity in all of its business practices. And fifth, passionate employee. I\u2019ve been energized by the dedication of the Perrigo team. This is an organization with passionate employees and a positive culture that strives to meet the high demand of customer.","My management philosophy is a one team approach, which is crucial in driving meaningful and timely solutions and I\u2019m impressed with -- by the high caliber of talent across the entire team, including John Hendrickson. I\u2019d like to thank John for his guidance and steady leadership during this ongoing transition period. His focus on the company's core businesses and operational excellence have provided us a greater foundation to drive value for customers and to many stakeholder that rely on us to deliver quality affordable healthcare products.","Finally, I\u2019d like to congratulate the Perrigo team on an excellent finish to 2017 and Ron on his appointment as CFO. Congratulations.","I will now turn the call over to Ron.","Ron Winowiecki","Thanks, Uwe. For covering our results for 2017, I\u2019d like to take a minute to discuss our rescheduled earnings call. One area of focus this past year has been remediate our tax material weakness that was identified in 2016. We have made progress towards this goal including: one, strengthening our tax capabilities to a combination of key new hires and additional resources. Two, enhancing the overall design in our tax process, and three, improving the precision of our new -- our review controls.","Despite this progress, we underestimated the time needed to implement tax reform in the U.S and Belgium, and to complete our yearend procedures. We continue to improve our processes as meeting deadlines as a top priority.","Now let me take a moment to welcome Uwe to Perrigo. Uwe's track record speaks for itself. And as a leadership team, we\u2019re excited to work with him in writing the next chapter of the Perrigo story. On behalf of the Perrigo leadership team and employees, welcome to Perrigo.","Turning now to Slide 9, you can see the highlights for 2017. Our consolidated 2017 performance illustrates the experience of our leadership teams and their abilities to drive their businesses to fully leverage Perrigo's unique platforms. This team finished the year strong, delivering adjusted net sales of $4.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.93.","In CHC Americas, adjusted net sales grew 1.4% in a challenging consumer environment. The durability of this business is illustrated by an adjusted operating margin of 21.9%, which the team now has achieved for two consecutive years. In CHC International, net sales grew 2.6% on a constant currency basis, excluding the exited distribution businesses. The team has rebased the run rate adjusted operating margin level of this business with 2017 adjusted operating margin of 15% compared to a 11.4% in the prior year. As previously discussed, the objective in the CHC International segment is to achieve adjusted operating margin in the upper teens, I\u2019m pleased with the progress of this leadership team is making as we continue to drive towards this target.","In Rx, net sales were roughly in line with the prior year, excluding the year-over-year impact of Entocort. The team launched more than 10 new products in 2017, offsetting high single-digit price erosion, which was in line with our expectations. Our diversified extended topical strategy once again delivered adorable adjusted operating margin above 40% for the seventh consecutive year, highlighting the quality of this uniquely differentiated asset.","Underpinning these positive results is the strong operating cash flow achieved in 2017. Excluding a total of $134 million in cash restructuring payments and an unusual tax payment, adjusted operating cash flow was $833 million, which equates to a strong 120% to adjusted net income. Our strong and steady cash flow conversion highlights the consistency of our business and the ability to generate significant capital for future deployment.","Overall, calendar 2017 was a year to simplify, focus and execute in our core businesses. The actions and achievements in each of our segments places us in solid position to execute our 2018 business plan.","Now turning to Slide 10, you can see our reported results for the fourth quarter. Reported net sales were $1.3 billion and reported net income was $73 million. The primary adjustments to GAAP results are driven by the exclusion of $90 million of non-cash amortization expense and $6 million of restructuring charges related to our cost improvement program.","Partially offsetting these expenses, were the exclusion of $10 million related to product milestone payment. GAAP tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax income was 44.5% in the quarter compared to a GAAP -- non-GAAP tax rate of 16.9%. The difference is due to the tax effect of the pre-tax adjustments and deferred assets and liabilities consistent with non-GAAP pre-tax income.","Turning to the CHC Americas results on Slide 11. Net sales in the quarter were $644 million compared to net sales of $627 million in the prior year or growth of 2.5% on a constant currency basis. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales in the gastrointestinal and analgesics categories compared to the prior year.","New product sales in the quarter were $70 million driven by the store brand version of Nexium and certain smoking cessation products. Partially offsetting these positives were lower net sales of nutritional drink products in the infant nutrition category, in addition to pricing pressures in certain OTC categories and discontinued products of $3 million.","Adjusted gross margin was 36%, an increase of 50 basis points compared to the prior year. Sell-through of higher margin products and positive contributions from supply chain efficiencies offset pricing pressure in certain OTC categories versus last year. The segment delivered a record fourth quarter adjusted operating margin of 23.1%, which was above 20% for the eighth consecutive quarter. This performance was driven by gross margin flow-through and a lower selling and administrative cost due to previously announced restructuring actions.","Turning to Slide 12, net sales in the CHC International segment grew by 3.3%, excluding $82 million from the exited unprofitable distribution businesses and favorable foreign currency movements of $26 million. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales in the personal-care category and in the U.K store brand business along with new product sales of $40 million. These increases were partially offset by lower net sales in the anti-parasite category in addition to discontinued product of $2 million.","The improvement actions we took in this segment increased the adjusted gross margin from 41.9% in the prior year to 52% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating income increased $21 million over the previous year, while adjusted operating margin expanded 660 basis points to 15.3%, driven primarily by gross margin flow-through and lower operating expenses.","Turning to Rx on Slide 13. Net sales in this segment were $261 million for the quarter relatively in line with the prior year, excluding a $5 million year-over-year unfavorable impact of Entocort. New product sales in the quarter were $23 million offset by lower net sales of existing products of $21 million due primarily to price erosion which was in line with our expectations.","Adjusted gross margin was 53.2% due to variation in product mix experienced in the quarter and price erosion. As discussed in previous calls, adjusted gross margin in this segment may vary in any quarter plus or minus an estimated 150 to 200 basis points from the midpoint of approximately 55%. As reference, adjusted gross margin for the full-year 2017 was 55.3%.Adjusted operating margin for the segment was 38.1%, which included an increase in R&D investments to 7% of net sales in support of our strong pipeline, partially offset by lower selling expenses as a result of previously announced restructuring actions.","Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 14. As of December 31, 2017, total cash in the balance sheet was $679 million and total outstanding debt was approximately $3.3 billion. In 2017, we repaid $2.6 billion of debt or nearly 45% of the total debt outstanding at the end of 2016.","Our focus to proactively improve our capital structure combined with our strong operating cash flow conversion has greatly improved our financial flexibility. As a reminder, the combined total debt maturities for years 2018, 2019, and 2020 are approximate $564 million, enabling the majority of future free cash flow to be available for enhancing investment opportunities. We believe this flexibility differentiates Perrigo.","Our capital allocation decisions are focused on total shareholder returns within the context of our long-standing commitment to an investment grade financial policy. As part of our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy, we completed approximately $192 million of share repurchases and paid $91 million in dividends during 2017.","On February 15, we announced our quarterly dividend, which represented an increase of 19% from the prior year. This increase in dividends per share equates to a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of 15%, which reflects management's and the Board's confidence in our durable business model, cash flow generation and earnings growth.","Next, let's discuss our key operating actions for 2018 on Slide 15. First, drive new product launches. We are investing approximately $75 million in working capital to support the launches of our strong new product pipeline, which is expected to deliver net sales of more than $300 million in 2018.","Second, invest for long-term growth. Building on the strong foundation established by the team in 2017, a core theme for 2018 is investing for organic growth. Consistent with this theme, we expect 2018 growth investments in R&D and advertising and promotion to increase approximately 12% to 15% compared to the prior year.","Third, invest in operations. As previously discussed, we're investing in our infrastructure, including integrated sales and operating systems, global supply chain capabilities, cyber security and global data privacy. And fourth, achieve productivity gains. The investments I just discussed are being made on top of a successful completion of our cost optimization program and ongoing productivity improvements in supply chain, offsetting the estimated effects of price erosion in the year.","Turning to the segment guidance on Slide 16. In CHC Americas, our guidance includes growth versus last year in our market-leading OTC and infant formula categories as a unique position drives growth in these markets. Partially offsetting this expected growth is a loss of a partnered product in our animal health business, as the partner will now take over marketing and distribution of the product.","We expect segment net sales to be approximate $2.44 billion or growth of approximately 1% on a constant currency basis of what remains a challenging consumer market. The durability of this business is once again evident as the adjusted operating margin in 2018 is expected to be approximately in line with the prior year, remaining at record levels. Included in this margin assumption are increased growth investments versus the prior year.","In CHC International, we expect approximately $1.56 billion in net sales. This guidance includes a year-over-year reduction in net sales of approximately $33 million as a result of actions taken in 2017. To be clear, these actions were completed in the prior year, included the midyear restructuring of our Russia business and the exited unprofitable distribution businesses.","Excluding this $33 million impact, our 2018 growth is expected to be approximately 2% on an organic constant currency basis. The adjusted operating margin guidance for this segment is expected to be approximately in line with last year. Included in this margin assumption are the investments in growth and infrastructure I just discussed. As I previously mentioned, we continue to target adjusted operating margin in the upper teens for CHC international and are making the investments acquired to achieve this goal.","In Rx, we expect 2018 net sales were approximately $1.06 billion or greater than 9% growth compared to 2017, driven by the launch of new products from our strong pipeline. This guidance includes on average for the year a high single-digit price erosion assumption. We expect meaningful contributions from new products in the fourth quarter of the year as we prepare for launches of, one. a significant product that we are not permitted to disclose and, two. anticipate a launch of the generic version of ProAir.","Our 2018 Rx adjusted operating margin is forecasted to be approximately in line with the prior year, driven by our diversified and durable extended topical strategy and strong new product launches. Included in this margin assumption are increased R&D investments to approximately 7% of net sales. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, we continue to be extremely excited about the pipeline opportunities in our Rx business and believe that the increased investment in R&D can generate extremely attractive returns for shareholders.","On Slide 17, you can see the bridge that walks our 2017 adjusted EPS to the 2018 adjusted EPS guidance provided today. Let me highlight three factors to consider in the context of our 2018 adjusted EPS guidance. First, is the approximate $0.25 per share impact from U.S tax reform. As you will see in the next chart our effective tax rate guidance for 2018 is approximately 20.5% to pre-tax income, which compares to approximately 16.8% in 2017, a very important distinction is that our operating cash tax payments are expected to be approximately flat with 2017. In other words, U.S Tax Reform has relatively no impact on our cash tax rate.","Second is a year-over-year impact from the divested API business. The API business was included in our results for the first half of 2017, contributing approximately $0.06 per share. Third, is an approximate $0.07 benefit in 2018 from the favorable currency movements versus the prior year.","Taking these items into account, you can see that our pro forma 2017 adjusted EPS sums to $4.69 per share. Building from this base, you can see the positive drivers of our 2018 adjusted EPS guidance, which include: first, continue to operational execution across all of our segments and strong performance of our new product pipeline, representing an increase of approximately $0.29 per share as compared to 2017.","Included in this increase is the expected fourth quarter launch of generic ProAir with an estimated EPS contribution of approximately $0.09 per share. Second, the completion of our 2017 capital structure actions result in a benefit of approximately $0.27 per share to our 2018 guidance. These combined factors equates to a 2018 adjusted EPS range of $5.05 to $5.45, our growth were approximately 12% from our 2017 pro forma adjusted EPS results at the midpoint.","Now let's pull this altogether in Slide 18. We expect consolidated net sales of $5 billion to $5.1 billion or approximately 2.5% to 3% growth at the midpoint on an organic constant currency basis. Included in this net sales guidance are expected new product launches of greater than $300 million, which are heavily weighted to the fourth quarter due to the two Rx new product launches I discussed earlier.","Adjusted operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.09 billion. This growth in adjusted operating income represents greater than 2x operating leverage to net sales growth on an organic constant currency basis. Regarding growth investments, consolidated R&D investments as a percent of net sales are expected to be approximately 4%.","Taking the two -- fourth quarter Rx new product launches into account, we are expecting approximately 30% of our adjusted operating income to be realized in the fourth quarter of 2018. Operating income is expected to be moderately improved on a sequential basis from Q1 to Q3 due to new product launches. Our guidance for operational cash flow is to achieve approximately $770 million in 2018. Included in this guidance is working capital to support our new product launch forecast notably the expected fourth quarter launch of generic ProAir.","Before I wrap up, I\u2019d like to point out as part of our commitment to transparency and based on feedback from the investment community, we are now including in the appendix of our quarterly earnings presentation a breakout of segment operating expenses, including advertising and promotional investments in our CHC International business and consolidated depreciation to more easily calculate EBITDA.","You will also see in our appendix a net sales bridge similar to the EPS bridge we discussed earlier. These two charts should provide a framework for modeling 2018 growth versus 2017.","In summary, as a testament to the leadership and culture at Perrigo, we executed on our business plan as illustrated by our 2017 results. I would like to congratulate the team on a great year in which we took a number of actions to set the foundation for delivering on our 2018 operating plan.","I will now turn the call back to Uwe.","Uwe Roehrhoff","Thanks, Ron. In closing on Slide 20, I would like to outline our top priorities for the year ahead. Number one, deliver on our plan. We are well positioned to capitalize on our durable platform and the healthcare trends to deliver on our commitment across all of our businesses in challenging end markets. Two, maintain focus on operational execution. Continue to sharpen operational execution across our businesses with the focus on quality and customer service, supply chain productivity, our ecommerce strategy, and new product launches.","Three, drive growth. Our commitment to future growth is evidenced by the fact that our 2018 guidance assumes an approximate 12% to 15% increase in growth investments to drive long-term organic growth across our businesses. And four, develop a value creation roadmap. Over the next six months, I will continue to work with management and the Board to develop our long-term strategic vision and capital allocation strategy, after which we will discuss the outcome with the investment community.","In closing, Perrigo occupies unique space within the health care and consumer industry. We provide savings to consumers and families at a critical time as healthcare costs continue to rise. Perrigo's business model meets the needs of consumers and families that want healthcare options that are high quality, effective, and yet affordable.","I am energized by my colleagues and the entire Board and management team. I\u2019m excited by Perrigo's progress over the past year and our opportunities ahead. I look forward to getting to know all of you in the coming weeks and months.","I'll now turn the call back over to Brad.","Bradley Joseph","Thanks, Uwe. Operator, we would now like to open the call for questions with Uwe, Ron, and me, and ask that everyone please limit yourself to one question, so we can get everybody -- get every question answered.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Louise Chen from Cantor. Your line is open. Please ask your questions.","Louise Chen","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So your cash flow is going to be improving meaningfully this year. Could you give us more color on your capital allocation strategy? And then how much of your expected free cash flow is assumed to be deployed in your 2018 guidance? Thanks.","Ron Winowiecki","Yes. So let me start, Louise. Thanks for the question. So from an operating cash flow standpoint, listen, we saw very strong operating cash flow in '17 on a reported basis just sort of $70 [ph] million, a 100% conversion to net income, $833 million when you take out some of the neutral items and to your point, $775 million guidance in 2018. If you look at our capital location policy and process, this is based on two fundamental tenants, right. It's total shareholder returns and it's also an investment grade framework. And you saw act that way in 2017 and you look in the 2018 we don\u2019t have any debt payments material due in for the next three years. We talked about that. So debt pay down is not a priority for the company given the -- particularly the low interest profile that we have at this point, a nice maturity curve. You know, listen, if the market continues disruption relative to the equity, there's a lot of volatility at this time. We look from time to time, it is not a core part of our policy at this point. But it will be something we look at if there's something in the market that make sense to us. And you saw our dividend increasing, we\u2019re excited to continue providing a return to shareholders relative to dividends, compounding 15% growth rate. We know the yield is low, we understand that. But having said that, having a compounded growth rate of 15% shows our confidence in how we\u2019re moving forward to our business model. I will let Uwe speak, and Uwe is engaged with the process on the strategic review and we can talk a little bit about that and how that ultimately plays out going forward. So \u2026","Uwe Roehrhoff","Yes, thanks, Ron. I think decisions regarding our capital allocation as Ron said we will be focused on shareholder value creation within the context of our commitment to an investment grade profile. Over the next six months, as I said, we will work altogether management and the Board to develop our long-term strategy and our capital allocation strategy for Perrigo. And then we will discuss the outcome with all of you.","Bradley Joseph","Great. Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Trucchio from Berenberg Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Patrick Trucchio","Thanks. Good morning. My questions are on CHCA business. At the CAGNY conference last week, several of the branded OTC players noted that disconnect right now between sell-in and sell-through is dampening organic growth. And then when we look at Slide 22 in your presentation, we see store brand growth of 3%, your guidance for 2018 at the midpoint calls for about 1% growth. So I\u2019m wondering if this is because of the mismatch between sell-in and sell-through now. And then what inventory levels look like at retail? And related to this to get to that high-end scenario the plus 3% or so scenario, would this dynamic in sell-in and sell-through have to improve, and what might lead to that scenario? And then, if you could, tell us what might lead to the low-end scenario in your guidance as well? Thanks very much.","Ron Winowiecki","That\u2019s a very good five part one question. I like how you phrase it, it's outstanding by the way. So well done. So, listen, if you look at Consumer Healthcare Americas, the segment grew 1.4% last year. And I think the key part of that chart you referenced by the way, is please note store brand is gaining share. So if you look at what's taking place relative to the brand category, store brand gain share last year, and again as you always know that chart is based on MULO data. There is R factor in your shipments in that 52-week, you\u2019re always going to have some variation, we know that. And we\u2019ve explained that before. When you think about, I will call it the corridor, I think that\u2019s the way you\u2019ve to ask the question. It's a fair way to think about it. As I think about the corridor, how our asset is positioned as we continue to grow above market. On the low end of the corridor, inventories are abating. We are not seeing it as a material item. Obviously, when you have an effect like there were some store closings of one of the core customers, listen you got some normalization of inventories. That\u2019s just a natural part of the model as industries play through that rationalization process. So, yes, you have some of that effect. I\u2019m not going to call it a material effect at this point. I do want to remind you, you talk about the 1% growth into next year, and again that\u2019s actually true. If we look at OTC nutrition, a formula business is growing much faster than that and we are being offset by this loss in the pet help business. I mean that if you take a look at the core, we have market-leading positions. The growth in those market-leading positions, it is higher than 1% and the reason that has diluted back to that level is because of the loss of the supplier arrangement with the pet help business. So I will say within that core space we're sitting in that middle of that corridor and that\u2019s why I like to answer that question. I don\u2019t want to worry too much about the lower upper end. If you look at the core part of our segments, where we\u2019ve market-leading positions we're seeing healthy growth going into '18 in a touch consumer market.","Bradley Joseph","Thanks for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Randall Stanicky","Great. Thanks, guys. I just wanted to follow-up, is 2% to 4% the right way to think about the U.S consumer business over time or should we be thinking about it as something on top of the overall OTC market? Then the real question I had was, as we think about the shift to online or to Amazon, does that shift help or hurt that CHCA growth rate over time? Thanks.","Ron Winowiecki","Again, we really got a three part question in one. The -- which is good by the way. I appreciate the question. So first of all, listen, we talk about relative to market. So 2% to 4% is a good threshold relative to our normalized market. Now we're not in the normalized market, I mean, you could dispatch that -- we see is that the markets like .5% to 1% growth and we\u2019re growing 1.4%. So we are indexed above market, Randall, and we think our business is very well-positioned to continue moving forward with that market structure. So I can guide you at 2%, 3% or 4% within that quarter, but what I can't say is our business is positioned, if you look at store brands gaining share, you look at -- we\u2019re the partner of choice within that space that we continue to grow above market. So think it relative to market to be directly to your question. So ecommerce is an interesting one. Listen, if you look at our business model, we provide end-to-end solutions, right. We talk a lot about that. We provide -- there is a broader scale of products in the U.S marketplace, bar none, number one. Number two, we provide turnkey solutions and it's a core competency. A lot of persons don\u2019t understand relative to our merchandising capabilities, our regulatory capabilities. We provide those turnkey solutions to our customers. In addition, we manage within the supply chain, a complex supply-chain environment. So what I say is we\u2019re the partner of choice, so as the channels developed e-commerce being a channel, we\u2019re excited of helping our business partners, our retail partners develop both the retail competencies and e-commerce competencies to be successful. In the intermediate period, short-term, listen it's probably an arbitrage. I mean, that\u2019s kind of -- you think it through and you see the stats, we all see them, ecommerce is about 1% to 2%, I think of the space today. You\u2019re probably going to get an arbitration where consumer probably would have gone to the store or maybe they\u2019re buying on Walmarts, jet side at this point, that\u2019s an arbitrage over time. Where we are excited is that you provide the merchandising to the customer. So now the consumer has to walk up to the shelf, look at the branded product, look at Perrigo's product to make the consumer choice on their own kind of own diligence. In the future with e-commerce, you get digital market, you can put in their hands. You can sell them the value store brand, the efficacy of the product, the quality of the product and over time we do see that\u2019s creating share, but understand that\u2019s over time. That\u2019s not an immediate effect. So, hopefully, I answered your three part question, Randall.","Randall Stanicky","Yup.","Bradley Joseph","Great. Thanks, Ron.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Jamilu Rubin","Thank you. Just staying along the lines of ecommerce, can you today describe your Amazon partnership? I know that it's about to expand, but what -- is ecommerce as you said, Ron, is a very small proportion of the overall business. You said 1% to 2%, but where do you expect that to go over the next five years? And I think more importantly what implications will that have for your margins? It's hard to imagine that e-commerce -- is that growth is going to be good for your margins that maybe you can help to describe that? And then also you talked about pricing pressure in certain OTC categories. Can you describe what that pricing pressure is and is this something that we should just model as a going forward headwind or is this more temporary? Thanks.","Ron Winowiecki","So, listen, again a couple part question. Thank you, Jamie. I will let Uwe start on maybe the Amazon component. When he gets down to that, I think you asked about kind of margin profile and pricing pressures, so I can give some color, that\u2019s fair.","Uwe Roehrhoff","Well, thank you, Ron. Let me start with that Perrigo has a long standing history of meeting consumers as a healthcare point of purchase and ecommerce is just one element of that. And we obviously work with all of our retail partners to maximize the value of their store brand offerings, online and in the store. So this makes us the partner of choice on the OTC healthcare space for both in store and ecommerce solutions. And from a margin profile, it is fair to say, that this is relatively consistent across all of our customers.","Ron Winowiecki","Yes, just to echo what Uwe just said, right. If you walk into the pricing pressures, listen, the pressures are predominantly into, I will call legacy categories. So after the long technologies, particularly, in some of the tablet liquid space. Jami, it's the way to think about it. That\u2019s where you have margin pressure. If you look at some of the great categories at Perrigo, that\u2019s being building out over time, gastrointestinal and nutrition, you have less pressure, but there's pressure in every category. To be clear, this is a multisource competitive marketplace. But if you say where do you start seeing, I will call it bid activity. It will be in some of the longer commodity type of things, some of the tablets and some of the liquids technologies.","Jamilu Rubin","So just to be clear as e-commerce becomes a bigger component of your overall revenue, you would not expect that to have a depressive effect on your margins, presumably because of increased volume, is that the right way to look at it?","Ron Winowiecki","Yes, listen, we don\u2019t think winners or losers, Jamie. It's the way to think about it. So we look at our margin profile cost of all of our customers. Their pricing strategies are their strategies. That\u2019s how they position products in their space, whoever maybe, but our margin profile is consistent across our customer base. So at this point we\u2019re not seeing any degradation of margins relative to channel changes.","Jamilu Rubin","All right. Thank you.","Bradley Joseph","Great. Thanks, Jamie. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Maris. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Katie Kerfoot","Hi. This is Katie Kerfoot on for David. I\u2019m just wondering, because when we heard earlier about your priorities for capital allocation going forward, expanding the business inorganically wasn't a priority. And so is it fair for us to -- that you mentioned at least and is it fair for us to think that why you\u2019re doing that review with the Board, you might be quiet on the M&A side for at least the first half of this year or throughout this year, as you kind of level those priorities? Thanks.","Uwe Roehrhoff","Yes, thanks for the question. I think, number one, is the -- if it came across that organic growth is not a priority, then I need to correct that, that is obviously a top priority \u2026","Katie Kerfoot","No sir, I meant inorganic. I meant acquisitions.","Uwe Roehrhoff","Yes, obviously, when you and we will go through our value creation roadmap, exercise and that will include holistic approach looking at everything. Looking at opportunities to optimize the business, looking at opportunities to drive growth, but also look at opportunities for inorganic subjects in our portfolio. And from that perspective, it is fair to say that over the next six months we need to conclude that exercise and then we will announce what we\u2019re going to do on all of those fronts.","Bradley Joseph","Great. Thank you, Katie. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Marc Goodman","Yes. First, can you give us a sense of flu season and how much it impacted sales in the quarter, and how we should expect the first quarter of this year to have an impact? And then you mentioned an animal health, there was a product that you were giving back. Can you just give us a sense of how big sales growth for that product? Thanks.","Ron Winowiecki","Yes, thanks for the questions, Marc. I will take those to start. So flu season is -- why I\u2019d like to step back and think about it is, first, what is the relative effect of cough\/cold kind of products within the portfolio. CHC Americas as you know have done a fantastic job of building out, I\u2019d call it categories that aren't dependent upon \"the weather\". So gastrointestinal products, smoking cessation categories, infant nutrition is an example, you really kind of zero in cough\/cold at this point. You're talking, 20 percentage of the segment revenues are in that category and frankly if I call, just a strip of pure cough\/cold we are talking like 10%. I mean, to be clear, it\u2019s relatively small on that category. Now having said that, the next thing you look at is shipping patterns in Q4, not a meaningful effect. Really into Q4, our shipping patterns are selling into the season, little tick, but not much, we had a small uptick, but those are very small. If we didn\u2019t mention on the call. Looking at Q1, we\u2019re seeing an uptick. We are seeing some pull through of sales given the season. However, having said that, built in our guidance, to be very clear, so that\u2019s built into our model at this point. And then we think about the animal health business, I don\u2019t want to disclose the exact sales number. I think it's appropriate to go after any particular product for category. But suffice it to say, it is a point. You think pet health, it's interesting. Our PetArmor brand is the number one brand in the MULO space. So, it's disappointing, we had a partnership. It was going well. We were notified late December that they showed a different strategy, fine. Its -- they made a choice, but suffice it to say, again, if our -- if we did not have the effect of this pet health change, our growth would have been, let's call it consistent with last year within the core categories at a minimum. So you can start kind of modeling out the construction of what the relative effect would have been.","Marc Goodman","Right.","Ron Winowiecki","Thanks, Marc.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. This is Chris on for Chris. In the past you had discussions on the potential for an Rx divestiture. And you turned Perrigo into a pure consumer business. Is this an area of opportunity? Do you feel get about the current mix of the portfolio?","Uwe Roehrhoff","Well, first of all, I think I can say that we enter into 2018 from a position of trends, in all of our three businesses. And the next step we\u2019re going to take is to go through our value creation exercise. And within this, we obviously will also challenge the positioning of each business segment and it's growth opportunities. And we will come back to you again once we have concluded this and share our views on how we take the company forward for all of this year.","Bradley Joseph","Great. Thanks, Chris. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Gregg Gilbert","Yes, thank you. Bigger picture question on the industry as large buyer consortia have formed in recent years to more efficiently buy generic drugs. Have you noticed any changes in how those customers or others have approached buying OTC products. It was once thought that the buyers were very separate and that there was no synergy to a large generic company and a large OTC company coming together. But curious if that\u2019s still the case or is there potential synergy between OTC and generic purchasing with these increasingly important customers? Thank you.","Ron Winowiecki","Yes, Gregg. Thanks for the question. I will take that to start. So, first of all, you could think about the business model, right. The business model is really delivering store brand solutions to our end customers. So when you think about the consortiums and how they play out, remember what will have to play is, is also on Walmart who would want to give up their brand or target their brand or Costco their brand. So they really say that these consortiums are going to have a big effect in the OTC space in our situation and a store brand situation, that would mean the business of the turnkey solutions, merchandising their brands themselves. They would want it to hand it to somebody else who is going to be a better buyer. So, listen, I don\u2019t want to say, never. You can never say that it's industry structure and condition. We monitor all emerging trends to be very clear. Jeff Needham and his team are very proactively looking at any types of dynamics in the marketplace or very proactive and addressing any structural things that take place. But at this time, we\u2019re not anticipating or seeing effects from those consortiums. Again, remember the business model, it's about the brands of the customers that we serve. We are not seeing any immediate effect at this point, Gregg to your question.","Gregg Gilbert","Thanks.","Bradley Joseph","Thanks, Gregg.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ami Fadia from Leerink. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Ami Fadia","Hi, good morning. Could you give me a sense of where you\u2019re with respect to some of the initiatives that were ongoing in consumer international with respect to winning products and how -- we saw a good expansion in the margins this year. But it doesn't look like you were expecting similar expansion or at least some expansion next year? So wanted some color on where you were with that. And then, how should we think about margins -- gross margins in the Rx business as you launch some of the larger products like ProAir at the end of the year? And lastly, just tax rate, how should we think about that into next year? Thanks.","Ron Winowiecki","All right. Very good. I will try to remember every question asked. The -- so thank you for the questions by the way. So let\u2019s start with CH International. Listen, we are very pleased with the progress in this business. If you remember we\u2019ve got a multi part strategy relative to building out the improved business model. Number one, is we did some portfolio rationalization. We sold the unprofitables to European distribution businesses. Most importantly is we\u2019re putting a focus brand strategy. So at this point, Sharon, and his team have a very clear strategic lines relative to their brands and how they\u2019re positioning those in the marketplace, that\u2019s been a big shift for us in the last -- over the course of the last year. Number two, is we\u2019ve done with that focus brand strategy, a number of sales force rationalization, restructurings as well in certain markets. We\u2019ve consolidated teams to make sure are most effective in the marketplace. Could there be more of that? We\u2019re always looking at efficiency and effectiveness, so you could see more of those changes. But again that has gone very well for the actions completed at this point. Married to that, the trifactor of that, kind of triangle of improvement is really disappointing A&P. So really now matching the A&P architecture for how we promote and drive brands in the markets, relative to -- again, the focus brand strategy and the commercial activities that we have. Underpinning that, action has gone very well. The in-sourcing activities, we talked about that we\u2019re -- we acquired CH International, the branded business back in 2015. They were about 80% outsourced and our goal is to get down in that 50%-ish kind of range and I will call it we\u2019re kind of half way there. [Indiscernible] and his team have done a fantastic job working through the portfolio, what is the best insource and we\u2019re about halfway through that journey. So it\u2019s going very well from that standpoint. And again, you talked about margin expansion this year. We\u2019ve been pretty clear. We want to reinvest back in this business. That our goal that we\u2019re very focused and targeted on is upper teens. Upper teens adjusted operating margin, so that is the directive that we\u2019ve been playing towards, we always knew. You think about when you -- it goes through a margin expansion process, you obviously want to fund it with improvements and then fund the next frontier. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve made improvements this last year, so now we\u2019re funding the next phase of this by improving our management infrastructure, putting in things like integrated sales and operating planning systems. You\u2019re putting in some R&D systems and architectures that help the team from innovation standpoint. Now that helps build out the growth profile going forward. So, yes, a pause. So you\u2019re seeing is, give guidance in that 15%-ish kind of range on a year-over-year basis. But if you model out the business, you\u2019re seeing margin expansion of the gross margin level, investing back at a -- from an infrastructure standpoint, margins in '18, in that 15% range. And then again, growing back to those higher teens on a later point. I think you asked about our Rx. Listen, Rx margins, I\u2019m going to say is, we feel very good about this business. We feel very good about the pipeline, you had a 42% margin last year consistent going into next year. It's a business that continues to create great value for shareholders and we\u2019re excited about the launch opportunities going into next year.","Bradley Joseph","And then lastly, it was tax rate going into '18.","Ron Winowiecki","Oh, tax rate. My apology. I missed that one. Tax rate in '18. So listen our guidance is 20.5%. You saw that in the -- in our discussion. It's Tax Reform, it drives a lot of different elements under the different parts of the -- under the parts of the accounting system for tax. Again from a cash standpoint, we\u2019re not seeing any effect. That\u2019s the important part of your discounted cash flow or you do perpetuity there in the company, there's no change in the cash tax rate from a 20.5% versus the 17%, it really relates to some of the accounting mechanisms that we have to work with relative to how the balance sheet thinks and operate, so therefore you get some noncash effects on the deferred tax accounting. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the difference. On a long basis, I\u2019m not giving any long guidance on tax rate. Our guidance at this point is 20.5% in '18.","Bradley Joseph","Great. Thanks for the questions, Ami. Next please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao from Barclays. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Douglas Tsao","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple. First, in terms of e-commerce, I mean, how -- it seems to be relatively small part of the business today. How -- any perspectives on the timelines that you think it will become a much more material part of the business? And then just in terms of generic ProAir, just curious if you have an FDA action day and just any commentary on -- sort of the engagement level of the agency in terms of the review of your application. Have you been getting information requests, sort of the status there? Thank you.","Ron Winowiecki","Yes, so first on your first piece of e-commerce. A small part of the business, it's a small part of the market. So again, it's -- yes, it is a small at Perrigo, but again when I gave the 1% to 2%, that\u2019s not Perrigo, that\u2019s market numbers relative to our space, right. So, listen, growth over time it is going to grow. I don\u2019t want to give any guidance to that effect, but we do know it\u2019s going to be a growing market. Our teams are very focused on it from a capability standpoint. And again, we\u2019re looking to empower our customers to continue store brand growth. I really don\u2019t want to give any kind of longer term guidance. And again in the short-term, it's probably an arbitrage. I mean, that\u2019s probably the important way to think about it is you probably have a consumer buy in one channel versus the other. Over time, as expansion takes place that\u2019s where the channel will grow more. On ProAir, listen, so we\u2019ve been pretty open that the FDA did issue a CRL late in the year in 2017, we responded to that CRL to the FDA, so we\u2019ve given that response back to them. And everything we\u2019re working at this point is consistent with our goal to launch in Q4. And you saw the $0.09 a share that we included in our numbers. So we\u2019re continuing to drive to that objective.","Bradley Joseph","Thanks. Appreciate the question. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Annabel Samimy from Stifel. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Annabel Samimy","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, I wanted to go back to the 2% to 4% long-term growth rate that you expect for the business. Obviously, underpinning that what is always some tailwinds such as further store brand market penetration or new product categories going from Rx to OTC. We already know that the price erosion component of it. So can you talk about some of those broader tailwinds within that 2% to 4% growth rate and if those still stand going forward? Because we haven't really heard much about new product categories the way we used to. Thank you.","Ron Winowiecki","Yes. So, another way to ask the questions. So, I appreciate the dialogues. So if you take a look at again store brand penetration, store brand market share, this business as I call it three legs on the stool for growth, right. So you have product line extension, so you had a channel innovation developments and the third is the Rx to OTC -- RX to OTC component that you had talked about. So think like product innovation, yes, we follow national brand in many instances, but we also do our own innovation. We\u2019ve colors and dosage forms and oral dosing -- dosing technology is an example of that, that extend the product line, that the national brands may not have. So that\u2019s an area of growth that we don\u2019t talk a lot about, but why you see us grow above market. If you take the Rx to OTC, there are -- we don\u2019t have any, what I will call home runs. There's no omeprazoles or Cetirizines built in the model, but we do have a series of singles and doubles built into our longer range thinking. So that, we continue to see Rx to OTC switches. In addition, what we're pleased by is the current tone of the FDA regarding looking at having more OTC, products in the marketplace is an exciting tone. A small example, albeit it gives a tangible example of developments is the monograph modernization Act. It's under development, CHPA, Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which is currently Jeff Needham is the President, it's very active and continuing to drive and support regulatory change in the industry. Are there other categories that can switch? Listen, we\u2019ve talked about those, we\u2019re continuing to monitor them, we don\u2019t want to get over our skis and say they\u2019re in the bottle on date X, that\u2019s not fair to do that. But listen, products like Xyzal within the allergy area, you're looking at Cialis potentially in erectile dysfunction, there's things where we see being worked on in those categories. But again we\u2019re never going to give at this point, this product, this category at this time. That\u2019s not appropriate at this point.","Bradley Joseph","Thanks, Annabel.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur from Raymond James. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Elliot Wilbur","Thanks. Good morning. Ron, just a follow-up to your commentary around the -- in the consumer healthcare business, you\u2019ve alluded a couple of times to challenges in that business. But maybe you can elaborate a little bit more detail in terms of what you guys see is the key challenges whether or not you think they\u2019re transitory or structural? And [indiscernible] different from what we\u2019re hearing from some of the branded companies. So just want to get a little bit more color on that? Thanks.","Ron Winowiecki","Yes, so I think the question to rephrase it back, it was a little broken up at first. So I\u2019m going to try to rephrase it back is, in the healthcare OTC space, consumer space, there's some challenges on growth. Are they structural or they -- are they items that are just transitory in nature? I think it's the way you phrase the overall question. Listen, a key part of it is always about innovation, right. So, key part of -- I would see from a branded standpoint is their focus on innovation, bringing new products to the pipeline, whether that\u2019s structural or transitory, I don\u2019t want to represent that. I think that the brands themselves would have to respond to that nature of what\u2019s taking place in the marketplace. Relative to the channel itself, there are some dynamics. Again, when you see retail stores closing, that\u2019s transitory in our eyes. In other words, the consumers are going to pull through the product. The demand for the product is still there in our eyes. We're seeing nothing changing from that standpoint, but when you get some of the structural changes that take place in an industry, you do see some dynamics that take place relative to sell-through, right. You just have the inventory normalizations that take place and although an event may not be material, you get those kind of layering effects that drive some of those changes. So I don\u2019t want to represent structural or transitory, but again we\u2019re not seeing anything in our business model which I think is a core important takeaway that we continue -- that we will still continue to grow by market. We are still confident in that structural benefits of our business models, the key way we think about it.","Bradley Joseph","Thanks, Elliot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Steinberg from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","David Steinberg","Yes, thanks very much. On capital allocation, I know you said you may take a hiatus, this is you develop your external strategy, but the last year you bought almost 3 million shares. I\u2019m just curious at the current valuation, do you feel like that will be centrally -- capital allocation at this point in time, given the valuation? And then, secondly, if for some reason ProAir is delayed this year, do you still think you can grow your generics business in 2018? Thanks.","Ron Winowiecki","Yes, you bet. Great question. Let me start with the latter. Yes, so I will just answer that with an affirmative we\u2019ve been saying for some time our pipeline support gives us a growth in '18 without ProAir. So, the answer is yes. On the capital allocation, listen, I\u2019m never going to represent on a call with you guys, good buy, bad buy. I\u2019m going to -- I will certainly say and I think Uwe would support that we will continue to look at market disruption will make sense at any point in time. And again, I don\u2019t want to represent any particular price as good or bad. That\u2019s not the way we think. We think long-term relative value. We want to make sure everything we do is on a long-term basis, not in a short-term thought process.","Bradley Joseph","And Just also to add on the Rx piece of ProAir, we\u2019re talking top and bottom line ex ProAir.","Ron Winowiecki","Correct. Thank you, Brad. Yes, I agree. Yes, good call.","Bradley Joseph","Great. Thanks, David. I appreciate it. Last question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Chiang from BTIG. Your line is open. Please ask your question.","Timothy Chiang","Hi. Thanks. Ron, could you just comment a little bit more on just the Rx pharma business? It looks like this is going to be your fastest growing segment in '18 and yet you\u2019re still experiencing price erosion on the base products. You commented about ProAir, but are there other products that you do expect to get approval across the year and is that what\u2019s driving the growth for 2018 in that segment?","Ron Winowiecki","Yes, so thanks for the question. The -- yes, it is a strong segment, performance going into next year we\u2019re very pleased with the performance guidance we have out there. Now again, at the end of the day, it\u2019s about new products. We don\u2019t want to predisclose any new products. We will certainly, we will give you information updates as the year continues. Remember, there's two new products in Q4, so there is one product, again, we\u2019re -- based on an agreement, we cannot disclose and discuss, but there's another strong product that will launch in Q4. So in your modeling, please take that into effect in that architecture of how you model it out. So, again, great business, great pipeline. And the other thing to indicate, I will call it a long-term basis, because that's probably how we like to think and talk about the business. We are increasing R&D next year as 7% of net sales. And that just shows you our confidence in that pipeline in the business. So with that increase in R&D percent, we\u2019re still circling roughly approximately 42% adjusted operating margin. So we feel very good about the business next year.","Bradley Joseph","Great. Thanks, Tim.","Timothy Chiang","And Ron, let me just one last follow-up. I mean, would you say your generic business from a pricing or a price erosion perspective that sort of bottomed on the base business or is that sort of a term that\u2019s not the right term for 2018?","Ron Winowiecki","Yes, I don\u2019t want to guide bottom, middle, or top, right. Our guidance is consistent. Listen, the way we think about this and we\u2019ve been very consistent in our approach is what we\u2019re seeing in the market we guide forward. So we\u2019re not going to get ahead of our skis. We are looking at high single digits experience last year in '17. We are modeling out that same kind of expectation to '18. We will keep you updated quarter-by-quarter as we see performance dynamics, but I don\u2019t want to represent, again, bottom or top. That\u2019s -- we want -- we don\u2019t want to represent that at this point.","Bradley Joseph","Great. Thanks, Tim.","Timothy Chiang","Okay, great.","Bradley Joseph","Thanks everybody. We appreciate your time and look forward to having more discussions here shortly. So thanks everyone. Have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Perrigo's Calendar Year 2016 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I will now turn today's conference over to Bradley Joseph, Vice President of Global Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Bradley Joseph - Vice President-Global Investor Relations","Good morning. Welcome to Perrigo's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. I hope you all had a chance to review our press release which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the release is available on our website, as is the slide presentation for this call. Joining me today is Perrigo's Chairman, Laurie Brlas; Chief Executive Officer, John Hendrickson; and Executive Vice President-Business Operations and Chief Financial Officer, Judy Brown.","I'd like to remind everyone that during today's call, participants will make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for investors and shareholders and Safe Harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued this morning. In addition, in the appendix for today's presentation, we have provided reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures presented.","Turning to slide three. Next, I'd like to walk through the agenda for today's call. Laurie will begin by discussing Perrigo's recent CEO transition process from the perspective of Perrigo's Board of Directors. Next, John will walk through his priorities and overarching management philosophy and then, will discuss his perspectives and insights on the future direction of Perrigo by segment. Judy will then walk through the financial results for the quarter and guidance for calendar 2016. Finally, John will discuss the team's philosophy around guidance and what you should expect from Perrigo going forward, concluding with Q&A.","I would now like to turn the call over to Perrigo's Chairman, Laurie Brlas.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chairman","Thank you, Brad. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. I have been a member of Perrigo's Board of Directors since 2003 and have the privilege to serve on both the audit and remuneration committee. During my tenure on the board, I've come to deeply appreciate the strength of this company and its management as well as our ability to value while effectively addressing challenges.","I'd like to take this opportunity today to talk with you about our CEO transition process. As previously announced, following our robust succession planning process, on April 25, the board of directors unanimously selected John Hendrickson as Chief Executive Officer. Speaking on behalf of the entire board, I can assure you that the choice to elevate John was clear.","John has been essential to the company's success in each of his roles with Perrigo. John led and shaped the operational backbone of the organization, designing a vast and multi-faceted infrastructure to produce and supply a broad and complex portfolio of products. He showed distinctive leadership as Head of our Consumer Healthcare business from 2003 to 2007. During that challenging period when we were grappling with the movement of pseudoephedrine, which is the largest product in our OTC portfolio at the time behind the counter, John led the team to increase revenues. All functions reported to him including R&D, regulatory, sales, marketing and operations.","Since 2007, John has served as EVP and Head of Global Supply Chain until his promotion to President last year. His manufacturing and supply chain leadership, exceptional operational track record, and ability to connect with and get the most out of his people give us great confidence in our decision to promote John to President, as well as our recent decision to appoint him to CEO. In John, we identified a leader who knows the business, is committed to our mission and could make the choices necessary to deliver value to our shareholders.","The board recognizes, of course, that the success of Perrigo does not start or stop with one person. John is supported by a talented, experienced team, and the board has full confidence in the team's ability to work effectively with John, execute and deliver shareholder value.","Finally, I want to underscore my remarks by highlighting our commitment to corporate governance and transparency. To enhance independent decision-making at the board level and to align our structure with what we believe is appropriate for the company at this time, the board has chosen to separate the roles of CEO and Chairman of the Board. Our commitment to shareholders will remain, as it always has, essential to our decision-making process going forward.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to John.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Laurie, and welcome, again, everybody to Perrigo's first quarter 2016 earnings call. I want to start by saying how honored and privileged I am to be CEO of this great organization and lead our more than 13,000 talented employees.","During my time with Perrigo, I have served in a variety of different capacities, as Laurie outlined, and I'm acutely aware of what this great business has to offer customers, consumers and our shareholders. I will say it unequivocally, at its core, Perrigo is a truly diversified unique business transcending generic prescription products with a resilient OTC base. I believe there's a long runway for growth ahead of us, and I am confident we have the right cohesive management team in place to focus on the execution that is required to deliver clear value to our shareholders.","That said, I know that meeting or exceeding expectations is the foundation for establishing your trust. This will be my personal focus and the focus of the management team going forward.","Turning to slide six, our recent track record of performance against our own expectations is unacceptable. I understand that; our team understands that. My focus and then of my team will be on operational discipline in generating consistent results. I'm confident we will deliver, given our opportunities for growth, the power of our platform and our deep long-standing relationships with our customers. We will deliver our results.","Now, let me highlight the key components of my overarching leadership principles for our business. First, as I said, our operational execution is the cornerstone of our success. Developing marketing, purchasing, manufacturing, distributing a broad complex array of customized products have always been our strengths. Quality continues to be the driving force behind the organization, and we have the infrastructure and quality track record to consistently move our products onto shelves for our customers and into the homes of our consumers.","Second, I'm action-oriented. I've already made critical decisions in a number of our businesses. I will continue to take appropriate steps to capitalize on opportunities and effectively address our challenges.","Third, I felt it important to share my guidance philosophy, which we'll address in more detail soon. I'm unequivocally committed to transparency and will be actively engaged with and listening to you, your questions and comments. That's how I've always worked with our customers, suppliers, employees and shareholders.","Finally, our goal is to ultimately create value for the shareholders, the owners of our company. To that end, my primary focus at this time is on our core operating and organic growth vehicles. As always, we will continue to evaluate ways to refine and enhance our portfolio of products to customers and consumers. We will continue to look at synergistic bolt-on acquisitions that fit strategically within our core infrastructure. And we will continue to evaluate methods of returning capital to our shareholder base.","Now, I'd like to give you my insight into the Perrigo advantage and my perspective on each of our business segments. Looking at slide seven, our Consumer Healthcare platform is core to Perrigo. We have a strong and durable position with numerous products, dosage forms and capabilities. Our U.S. Consumer business includes more OTC abbreviated new drug applications than any other manufacturer, even including the large branded pharmaceutical companies that you all know. This ability to bring new products to market will continue to drive growth in our CHC segment.","In addition, we have one of the broadest store brand OTC supply chains in the world. That means the first raw materials being procured through manufacturing, all the way through logistics and distribution, ultimately to our customers. One truck ordered product leaves a Perrigo distribution center every 30 minutes, 24\/7, 365 days a year to go to our customers to ultimately go to our consumers. We are the company retailers look to as their partner of choice. We are the company retailers look to, to drive value for their consumers, and ultimately their shareholders.","This segment continues to be led by Jeff Needham. Jeff is an industry innovator with over 30 years of experience. The deep customer relationships we have help ensure we continue to be a valued partner in this consumer space.","Next, turning to our Branded Consumer Healthcare division. Despite some challenges, my view of this business segment is one of optimism about the power of the platform that it provides us. Perrigo is now able to distribute products to an additional 32 countries globally, reaching greater than 300,000 pharmacists and retailers in these countries. The European OTC market represents $30 billion a year in sales.","Since the beginning of this calendar year, I worked with the country leaders and the executive team in our Branded Consumer Healthcare division to develop a deeper understanding of the day-to-day operations of the business. We are now fully and effectively integrating BCH into our existing leadership structure. We are building upon the team's core sales and marketing strengths, implementing our own strong operational controls and structures.","As CEO, I have made a number of additional changes to the BCH business such as coming to a mutual agreement with Marc Coucke that he would resign, and appointing Sharon Kochan as Head of the BCH business. Sharon's background, disciplined approach and ability to drive organizations to peak performance made the decision to appoint him to lead the BCH team a clear one. Sharon was the architect of our Rx business, which he built from the ground up with a superb executional track record. Track record that includes the acquisition and integration of various bolt-on products and businesses during his tenure.","As the current head of our international business, Sharon has also overseen diverse markets, including both branded and store brand offerings in multiple geographies such as Mexico and the UK. I am confident that the growth, execution and financial accountability of the segment will be enhanced under Sharon's leadership.","In addition to personnel changes, Sharon and I are providing our strong BCH leaders with increasing responsibilities to lead new geographies; prioritize our portfolio and divest underperforming assets. We are also emphasizing new and innovative products, such as our nicotine replacement therapy franchise, acquired from GSK last summer.","Our leaders are now aligned with the strategy to continue focusing on our top 20 brands to ensure growth of this strong portfolio. And to be clear, today, these top 20 products continue to grow at a faster pace in the markets that they are in.","These changes are in conjunction with the important decisions Judy has made in the finance organization. She has enhanced financial management and we are actively in the process of putting BCH's sales, forecasting, inventory control and operations planning onto Perrigo's existing platform, and upgrading the financial planning and analysts to support these activities and drive growth.","Again, I want to reiterate that the top 20 brands that we have in the business today continue to grow faster than the markets. We have a supply chain and a platform to support Pan-European growth, and we can add products to further leverage this business.","Turning now to our Rx business; our Prescription business is an important part of our diversified, consolidated portfolio. Our Rx business has a clear, strategic rationale as part of our broad diversified portfolio, and is a great complement to our core consumer competencies. Products, plans, procurement, technology distribution are all highly synergistic with our OTC business. And this business represents a potential feeder pipeline for product conversions from Rx to OTC.","For example, take our topical acne category within the Rx portfolio. When a category like this begins to switch, we are in a prime position to capitalize on this opportunity. Switch provides a dermatology pipeline and allows us to benefit from two life cycles for a single pharmaceutical product. We also have a strong pipeline in our Rx business. While these new products tend to be more technically challenging with longer regulatory approval timeframes, they do potentially create a higher barrier to entry, allowing for a longer, more enduring product lifespan.","As all of you know, pricing pressures and ultimately deflation have been a major have been a major topic across the industry. Our Rx team has done a great job over the past years of managing through this. However, we are not immune to this dynamic. And ultimately, increased competition and greater-than-expected price erosion hurt our performance in Q1 and resulted in lowering of our expectations for the year.","Doug Boothe, our EVP and General Manager of the Rx business, has been with Perrigo since 2013, leading the business through exceptional growth. Doug has been in the industry and seen various cycles in the prescription pharmaceutical business, and is the right person to guide the business in this market.","Finally, Specialty Sciences and TYSABRI. From my perspective, TYSABRI is a valuable financial asset, which contributes meaningfully to our financial flexibility and enables us to capitalize on opportunities. Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Judy, but before I do so, I'd like to first congratulate Judy and our company on her newly expanded role announced this morning. As part of my strategy to take actions that will deliver enhanced value for our company and for our shareholders, you as owners, Judy Brown will take on an expanded role as Executive Vice President, Business Operations and Chief Financial Officer.","In this role, Judy will have leadership of our Global Product Portfolio and Global Shared Service platform, complementing her current responsibilities for corporate development, finance, strategy and communications. Leveraging her experience in leading multinational, financing and product development organizations, both at Perrigo and at Whirlpool, Judy will now lead the expansion of our existing portfolio and pipeline products across all business segments and geographies, while optimizing our business services. So thank you, Judy.","I will not turn the call over to Judy, Judy Brown.","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you very much, John. Good morning, everyone. Before I delve into the financials, though, let me congratulate John on his appointment to CEO. I have worked with John on this executive team for many years. Very many years. But, time flies. And I agree with Laurie and the board that John is absolutely the right leader for Perrigo at this point in our history. I look forward to supporting his stated focused on execution, growth and transparency in his new role. Congrats.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Judy.","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","So, diving in. You can see on slide nine that GAAP net loss for the quarter was $133.1 million compared to a net loss of $95 million in the prior year. Let me explain the primary differences between our GAAP results and adjusted earnings. Our long-standing philosophy is to adjust GAAP EPS to help you better understand our underlying operations.","These adjustments include such items as acquisition-related matters such as non-cash acquisition-related amortization expenses, restructuring charges and related tax effects, and those items outlined in tables I and II in today's press release. You will notice that, as described on February 18, we are also removing our vitamins, minerals and supplements operating results from our adjusted earnings in 2016 as the business is currently held for sale. A full reconciliation can be viewed in tables I and II in our press release.","There are two specific large non-cash impairment charges here related to Branded Consumer Healthcare, which I will also talk about in a moment when we get to the segment details. So, as you can see now on slide 10, Perrigo delivered consolidated first quarter adjusted net sales growth of 33% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, excluding contributions from the VMS business for both 2016 and 2015. As noted on our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call, please exclude approximately $40 million of contributions each quarter in your models for 2015 related to this business.","During the first quarter, we experienced a confluence of events, which have impacted quarter results to a magnitude we could not have anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, and which have also impacted our guidance for the full year, as I'll discuss shortly. Net sales contributions from Branded Consumer Healthcare, which was not part of our business this time last year, was the primary driver of our year-over-year top-line growth. Consolidated new product sales of $74 million, including $31 million in BCH new product sales were partially offset by $39 million of discontinued products.","First quarter consolidated adjusted gross margin was a March quarter record of 47.9%, highlighted by first quarter adjusted gross profit margins in our Consumer Healthcare segment of 33.8%, with first quarter consolidated adjusted operating margin of 25.1%.","So, walking through the segments starting with CHC on slide 11. In the quarter, adjusted net sales excluding VMS grew 2% on a constant-currency basis, driven by continued momentum in store brand infant formula and continued strength in our NRT franchise.","I'm pleased to note that Perrigo-supplied infant formula market share has grown to 13.9% according to IRI data, which is a record for the Consumer Healthcare team. These gains were partially offset by decreases in the analgesic and cough\/cold categories following an extremely mild cough\/cold season and the absence of the guaifenesin 600mg ER product as compared to last year.","As previously discussed, this is the last quarter where our infant formula label refresh will have a negative year-over-year impact. This conversion accounted for the majority of the abnormally-high discontinued product number of $32 million embedded in these results.","New product sales in the quarter were $31 million. Remember, we anticipated our new product launches in this segment to be weighted more heavily to the second half of the calendar year.","On slide 12, you can see that BCH posted net sales of $318 million, with new products contributing $31 million and our acquired GSK portfolio and Yokebe brand contributing another $37 million to this total. The BCH segment revenues were organically flat compared to the prior year, with growth in our top 20 brands primarily in the cough\/cold and allergy category, despite a soft season in Europe, which was offset by lower OTC sales in certain markets.","In the quarter, BCH fell considerably short of our top-line expectations. Despite soft top-line results as previewed in February, we continued to make significant investments in advertising and promotion in this quarter, equal to approximately 18.6% of net sales. These effects were the primary drivers of adjusted operating income as a percent of sales of only approximately 8%.","The net sales miss in the quarter combined with the change in forecasted net sales and adjusted operating income for the remainder of the year were the basis for the changing guidance for this segment, as well as triggering an initial indicator of impairment. This started a process to update our long-range segment plans to evaluate asset carrying values. The change in fair value from previous estimates was due primarily to the changes in the current market and performance of the brands, such as the evaluation of the brand prioritization and product extensions or launches in new regions, are being more focused to maximize the potential of the whole basket of brands in the segment portfolio.","The result, as outlined in our press release this morning, is that we realized a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of approximately $467 million related to intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the Omega acquisition, $273 million related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and the remaining $194 million related to goodwill.","This is clearly a disappointment, but steps are being taken to correct the underperformance in BCH, including changes in leadership as John has outlined. While many steps have already been taken, it is important to note that it will take time to fully realize the true value of the actions we are taking.","On slide 13, Rx net sales increased 2%, which came in below our expectations. We experienced negative organic growth within the segment resulting from several factors. So, let me explain. The change in the competitive landscape was much more disrupted to our plan than have been anticipated and impacted our overall pricing strategies for the segment.","During the quarter, we experienced 24 competitive launches against our portfolio, producing sharp price erosion in a number of topical products we sell. These factors, combined with continued pricing pressure due to the consolidation of the large buying cooperative groups and the absence of significant new products in the quarter, further impacted our ability to execute on our planned pricing strategies. Despite all of this, however, the team was able to maintain its extended topical leadership position in the quarter. These pricing pressures impacted both the adjusted growth and operating margins, accounting for the decline you see here year-over-year.","Turning to slide 14, Specialty Science net sales were $88 million in the quarter, up 9% on a constant-currency basis.","Before I turn to the forecast, I'll make a quick comment on the balance sheet. As of April 2, 2016, total cash on the balance sheet was $589 million and total debt was approximately $6.5 billion. The increase in debt from December 31 reflects the financing of the tretinoin acquisition in January and the subsequent $1.2 billion senior notes issuance we did in early March to term out our short-term debt.","As we've stated in the past, we are fully committed to our investment grade ratings and delevering our balance sheet through EBITDA growth and debt repayment. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $170 million, which included onetime unfavorable reduction in accounts payable of an estimated $67 million in Branded Consumer Healthcare related to the normalization of their accounts payable terms.","As a reminder, we intend to fund our previously announced share repurchase program which runs out until late calendar 2018 through operating cash flow. To the extent the use of those cash flows for share repurchases would impede our deleveraging goals or any tuck-in acquisitions, we would slow or suspend the program for a period of time. Quarterly, given the cash generated and our commitment to delever, we will evaluate cash available for M&A and\/or share repos.","So, let's move on now to 2016 guidance. On April 25, we provided preliminary guidance without much detail. So, let me walk you through more information by segment on slide 16 starting with CHC. We expect Consumer Healthcare net sales for 2016 to be approximately $2.65 billion. The segment has been updated primarily for the exclusion of the guaifenesin 600mg ER product relaunch, delay in new product launches, which include a risk-adjusted launch of the store brand version of FLONASE in the second half of the year, and some adjustments for recent customer negotiations.","While the team continues to work on re-launching the guaifenesin 600mg ER product, we believe it make sense to remove it here from our financial forecast. We anticipate CHC adjusted operating margin to be relatively flat year-over-year.","Next, we expect BCH net sales for 2016 to be approximately $1.4 billion. To help you through your modeling, let me give you some color on our expectations for the adjusted operating margin in the segment. 2015 adjusted operating margin for the segment was 15.8% for the nine months ended December. Our updated guidance assume that adjusted operating margin will be approximately 200 basis points lower in 2016 due to the many organizational and portfolio changes we have discussed this morning, coupled with continued investment in A&P in our top 20 brands.","Rx. We expect Rx net sales for 2016 to be approximately $1.2 billion. Within Rx, we assume price erosion of approximately 6% for the remainder of the calendar year and now assume the launch of the generic version of ProAir in 2017. Our guidance reflects the expectation that the adjusted operating margin will be in the high 40% ranges for the year.","All of this leads to our updated consolidated guidance perspective on slide 17. We now expect revenue between $5.6 billion and $5.9 billion, which assumes greater than $300 million in new product launches across all segments for the year, adjusted to reflect the new product delays we've already discussed.","Given the new jurisdictional mix of income expected across segments, particularly with the new products slated for launch in the second half of the year, we are updating the full year adjusted effective tax rate guidance to be approximately 15% for 2016.","Given the fact that this quarter's tax rate was 11.4%, you should model a tax rate of approximately 16% to 17% on a quarterly basis for the rest of the year.","Summing all of this up to the consolidated P&L, we continue to expect 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range between $8.20 and $8.60. As previously noted, we continue to expect approximately 55% of our adjusted diluted EPS to materialize in the second half of the calendar year due primarily to timing of expected new product launches.","Lastly, a few comments on operating cash flow guidance for the year. We expect the performance of our business to deliver full year operating cash of approximately $1 billion, which includes the onetime unfavorable $67 million BCH-related normalization effect I mentioned a few moments ago. This represents an operating cash flow conversion approaching 90% to the midpoint of our adjusted net income earnings guidance. This business model continues to drive strong cash flows and illustrates the ability of our platform to generate quality net income performance.","I'll now hand the call back to John.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much, Judy. Turning now to slide 19. I want to emphasize what Judy said about our guidance. The guidance range that we put forward on April 25 accurately reflects the perspective of my full management team and our opportunities and on the dynamic space in Perrigo and our industry. As we stated earlier, we will set and communicate proper targets and work tirelessly to meet or exceed them.","I also want to reiterate my leadership principles that I talked about upfront which at the core focused on execution designed to drive shareholder value. First, as I've said earlier, my foremost priority is operational execution. We have a great business, and operational excellence is the foundation which all of our successes is built. This is who we are. Our platform is designed to add products and technologies that foster our growth.","High quality and affordability for our consumer is paramount. When we add new legs to our stool, like we did with infant nutrition and animal health, we leverage these business models, investing in R&D, talent and infrastructure to further growth. This is why we generate the strong cash flow that Judy emphasized earlier.","Second, I'm action-oriented and will deal with challenges and opportunities head-on. I've made and will continue to make critical decisions to improve certain aspects of our businesses.","Third, I'm unequivocally committed to transparency and will be actively engaged with and listening to your questions and comments. That's how I've always worked and that's how I will continue to work.","Fourth and finally, everything I and the management team do is direct to delivering value to Perrigo shareholders, and we will continue to deploy capital prudently and appropriately to that end.","I'd like to close by reiterating my confidence in the strength of Perrigo business. We have a solid foundation to build on. We have an experienced management team. We have a deep pipeline of new products. We continue to refine and improve our operating model across all of our segments of business to drive returns.","Our global platform gives us a springboard for growth, and we are all fixated on leveraging our core advantages to deliver shareholder value. And I would be remiss if I didn't thank our more than 13,000 employees around the world for their hard work in building Perrigo to the business it is today. We have an exceptional group of professionals working to deliver quality, affordable healthcare products around the world and they are core to our success in the past and in the future, and I'm honored to be part of this outstanding organization.","We will now open the call for questions and answers. I want to remind you that I am joined for Q&A by Perrigo's Chairman, Laurie Brlas and our Executive Vice President, Judy Brown.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Louise Chen with Guggenheim.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So, first question I had here was just for John and Judy in terms of your philosophy of financial guidance. Has that changed going forward? And if so, how?","Secondly, a question that we've gotten pretty often is regarding your debt covenants and coverage ratios. I was wondering if you could address that. And then last thing, just how we should think about growth in margins for Omega in 2017 and beyond. Thank you.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thank you very much and appreciate your question. I think I will tackle the guidance question and I'll probably toss the next two to Judy to deal with. So from a guidance, as I've said, my philosophy is to be very open clear with our guidance, with our expectations, with our growth, and then drive our internal team relentlessly to meet and exceed that guidance. So, very clear on what we're trying to do and where we are trying to set the bar.","Judy, if you want to take the debt covenants and the growth.","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","Right now, without reconciling EBITDA on the call, suffice it to say, our leverage ratio right now is in the high 3xs. With the adjustment we just talked about, the guidance, not exactly where we had anticipated to be at this point with the results in Q1 on delevering, but suffice it to say committed still to our pay-down in Q4 and with a strong cash flow and continued growth in EBITDA continuing our deleveraging path.","On the coverage side, we are very solid in our covenant coverage. So, no issue there whatsoever.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Very good. Thank you, Judy.","Bradley Joseph - Vice President-Global Investor Relations","There was a question on...","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","The report?","Bradley Joseph - Vice President-Global Investor Relations","Yeah, the Omega \u2013 the margins for Omega.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. I would...","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","Expectation?","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Branded Consumer Healthcare margin expectations for 2017.","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","Pardon me. Sorry, I missed the third part. Maybe I'll just make a comment on that. As we stated, we expected operating margin not to see much growth for this year on a year-over-year basis. In fact, given a soft first quarter, mid-teens throughout the rest of this year.","And going into next year, we're not giving 2017 specific guidance yet. But suffice it to say, for your modeling purposes, assuming that same mid-teens would be appropriate at this time as we did our long-range planning that became part of the analysis that was done in the last few weeks that I just mentioned earlier.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And I would add to that, we see good strength in the brand, good strength in the markets. We want to continue to invest in our advertising and promotion campaigns to drive those products. And so, we'll do that prudently to manage the bottom line.","Bradley Joseph - Vice President-Global Investor Relations","Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. First, thanks for being on the call, Laurie. I want to start with you. Is there anything investors should know about the circumstances around Joe's departure so we don't have to rely on media or speculation? And sorry to look backwards, but can you talk us through how the board handled the Mylan situation and assure investors that all options were fully explored?","And then for John, the issues that have weighed on Perrigo in recent times seem to be a blend of expectation setting, execution, as well as strategic decisions that have been made in the past. So, my question for you is, what changes do you plan to make? It seems like setting expectations at least on paper should be the easiest part of that, but perhaps you can talk about specific changes at the execution model and whether or not you agree with the strategic sort of platform. It sounds like you believe the platform is intact and correct and it's about execution, but would really like you to express whether you sort of agree with all the pieces at Perrigo and whether they're all core, et cetera. Thanks, guys.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Gregg. Good question. Laurie, why don't I have you pick up the first one first related to the board and Joe?","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chairman","Sure. Thanks, John. First of all, I'd say Joe made a decision to resign to pursue another opportunity, and you'd have to ask him of why he did that and what his thought process was. But when he made that decision, the board looked forward as we need to do and we felt it was an easy decision.","As I mentioned, we were very clear that John was the right person to elevate to the role. And I know John and Judy can tell you this, it's a very active engaged board that spends a lot of time with them. We spend a lot of time talking about discussions. So, we were very comfortable that John was the right person and moved on from there.","As to the Mylan question, I'll go back to we're pretty active engaged board. We spent a lot of time during the period of time that was an active event. And that time with John, Judy, Joe, all of the advisors evaluating what the different opportunities were that were available to the company and we continue to feel that we made the right decision.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Laurie. And Gregg, I'll take the other one as you directed them to me, the other one. First of all, going back to kind of expectations, guidance, et cetera. My philosophy is \u2013 again, I'll try to be as transparent as possible. I want the expectations we lay out to be realistic, numbers we feel we can deliver, and then drive our team to deliver and beat those every day. So, I'll state that and let that stay to that.","I think on the execution side, we have a great team. We have a good executional platform. We're trying to put strong operators in charge of all of the business segments that we have that know how to drive the results of the business all the way through to operating income and after-tax income.","I, as you know, Gregg, am a operator at heart delivering how do we sell, how do we market, how do we add organic products to the truck, how do we continue to deliver more through our BCH platforms. I feel we have great platforms in place.","I feel there are things we can do to continue to add products and what I call bolt-on acquisitions. So, not necessarily transformational but bolt-ons into our current platform. And by doing that with the infrastructure, I feel we have a good growth platform ahead of us. And I think our strategy fits right around those cores. I think we're currently in great areas to operate, great areas to deliver increased value, getting back to the things that Perrigo does very well.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Gregg.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky with RBC Capital Market.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks, guys. John, Judy, I was just hoping that you could help us get a better sense of recent changes. Is it fair to assume that most of these challenges hit between late March and late April?","And then just help us better understand what happened over that one-month time period relative to chain of events with respect to Omega and the generics businesses. Specifically, Judy, maybe you could just comment, how much of the generic impact was competitive entries versus bid cycles? And with the 6% erosion that you've built in, how can you get us comfortable that that's not going to continue, that we now have good visibility into that business?","And then the quick follow-up for John, is it fair to assume from your prepared comments that you view TYSABRI as a core asset and there's not going to be review to divest that business? Thanks.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Why don't I start out? First of all, on the big picture-wise, when we look at the big segments, Branded Consumer Healthcare, Rx business, et cetera, a lot of those changes, they all kind of came and materialized stronger within the first quarter and many of them more evident towards the end of the first quarter. So, without giving dates, they all happened at that time period and continued. And as we looked at the year, some of them lingered on and so we changed our guidance based on what we saw there.","And I'll let Judy jump in to the chain of events or anything else there that she wants to add, then I'll come back to TYSABRI. So, Judy, do you have anything?","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","So, on the Rx front, specifically you had asked about the evolution there and the update to our forecast. So we saw, I'll call it, some softness starting in January began to accelerate as these competitive launches. I quoted 24 competitors launched against our products in Q1. And that, in and of itself, changed the pricing dynamic for our team versus their expectations. And so, if you look at the \u2013 sorry, to build over the course of the quarter.","So, as we look pragmatically at the rest of the year, we had to say what is a reasonable assumption based on the competitive landscape as it faces us right now. Things I called out, the increased buying pressure across the cooperative large groups, which everyone in the industry is seeing to some extent right now; building that into our expectations; updating our forecast to reflect specific contractual agreements now in place for the rest of the year; evaluating the pricing strategies that we had had in place for the last three quarters of the year and making sure that those are updated to reflect the new reality for the remainder of 2016; and making sure, though, that in our numbers and in our bottom line that we're still making the right investments in R&D.","So not skimping in R&D entirely with this situation in the market, but making sure that we still made that contribution to the long-term growth of the portfolio. So, that's the evolution of the pricing update. We said 6% for the remainder of the year. I think the team feels that that's a reasonable approach to pricing, where they've evaluated and tried to take in the known knowns as well as a little bit of wiggle room for the unknowns and, going forward, still looking at adjusted operating margin for the segment in the high 40%s, adjusted operating margin for the full year.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Judy, just a quick follow-up. I mean, the gross margin was stronger than I think a lot of people would've expected, including us, just given what you called out as some of the pressures. Is that realistic going forward to hold at 61%?","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","Our expectations for the year and the adjusted operating margin framework I gave you would imply that that's the case because we're still making the R&D investment. So, if you back up, if you work backwards, you would say that that would be a reasonable assumption.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","And related to TYSABRI, I'll step back, first of all, and kind of give you the big picture perspective. I think TYSABRI is a great product from a healthcare standpoint, serves a tough disease, a tough population. I think the company that owns it, markets it, sells it, they're a great company. I have high respect for them.","For me and my perspective, it's not a strategic asset for Perrigo. It's not something we're looking to invest a bunch of money in or get into more products related to it. It is a financial asset. It has great cash flow. It has great other benefits around it that enable us to do other things.","I am open every day to different ways of thinking about TYSABRI, other different ways to utilize that financial asset to do other things within our business or for a shareholder base. So, I'm very open, but I view it as a financial asset, not a strategic investment for us.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks, John.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","Next question. Can we put a limit to questions to the one going forward? Thank you. Now, we have (45:20) one set of question, Brad.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So, now you implement the one-question rule.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chairman","Oh, but you always ask the good long ones, Elliot. Go ahead.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah. I've never cheated on airtime, that's for sure. Thanks. And congratulations, John, and congratulations to Judy. And look forward to working with you, John...","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Elliot.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","... in the future. Judy, part of your prepared commentary, you mentioned something that sort of caught my attention and I want to just ask you to elaborate on it, specifically talking about the Consumer Healthcare Business and some negotiations and concessions with the customer base that, obviously, as I take is you guys giving up something in order to secure shelf space or protect margins. And I just wanted you to maybe elaborate on that a little bit.","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","Absolutely. Good catch, Elliot. Well done. We've frequently talked about our overall basket of Consumer Healthcare products being able to maintain stable pricing and that continues to be the case. But I have always said very clearly that in periods of time when we're not launching big new products, that dynamic becomes more challenging for our Consumer Healthcare team. They do yeoman's job out in the field every day sitting with the buyers at important, large, sophisticated retailers talking about overall pricing.","So we don't have the ability, of course, to set pricing to the consumers on the shelf. That's the determination by the retailers. But we work actively on being effective in our own buying, having an effective supply chain to mitigate any pricing pressure seen for the Consumer Healthcare team. And of course, when we launch new products, it gives leverage to the entire basket of sales that the team goes out and speaks with the retailers about.","So, the phrase used in my prepared remarks is directly linked, of course, to the dynamic of no big, very visible, large products launched this quarter in the OTC basket. We're going to have some very attractive ones coming up just very soon, but that's part of the yin and yang. And so, as the team sits down, they say very clearly, get me my new product launches because it helps the whole basket of goods have better stickiness long term in pricing.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","If I could add one other just \u2013 if again stepping back, I think when you look especially at the U.S. consumer business segment, the relationship with our customers, the partnerships that we have with the customers, the frankly mutual importance that we are to each other with our customers is the strength of that core business.","We've worked with them for so many years. A lot of their profitability, their growth, their sales were integrally connected. And so, that bodes well for us continuing a strong relationship there going forward.","Next question?","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chairman","Thanks, Elliot.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks very much and I want to also congratulate you both, Laurie and John, on your new roles.","So, Laurie, since we have you on the phone, I was hoping that you could provide some more color on a key question that we've received from investors, given the media stories a month ago on the CEO contract and that question is why did the board release Joe Papa from his contract without greater penalties in the wake of Perrigo's issues over the past year?","And then if I could drop one in for John, given your new role, just could you comment briefly on Perrigo's long-term organic revenue growth target of 5% to 10% and whether you expect to update that or how we should think about that at this point? Thank you.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks. I can certainly also start out and then I'll toss over to you, Laurie, on Joe's departure and where we ended up with that.","There are rumors out there that we've got rid of his non-compete. Those weren't true. We did not. We actually fine-tuned his non-compete. Valeant and Perrigo do not compete today on products, et cetera. So, there's very few fringe products.","We actually fine-tuned his non-compete agreement, so that it's more aligned with categories within Perrigo that he could not compete in. And so we felt good about that negotiation. So, other rumors about what Joe got when he left, et cetera, he was basically paid up until his last day of employment and nothing going forward.","So, Laurie, I don't know if you have anything to add to that, but I just want to clarify some of those rumors that were wrong out there in the marketplace.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chairman","Yeah. Thanks, John. And I really appreciate the question, David, because the board spent quite a bit of time ensuring value for the shareholders and focusing on the non-compete. It was amended; it was not waived. He did not get out of it. As John said, we felt that we made it absolutely clearer that during in the next 24 months, Joe remains prohibited from really serving as a significant competitor to Perrigo.","So, we felt very good about that. And he did walk away from any of his unvested shares or so forth, so we think that we did the right thing for the shareholders and I really appreciate you asking the question so that we can clear up some of those rumors.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","And David, on the long-term plan, what I will do is walk you through the process of how I'm going to kind of work our team through it rather than give you the number today because I'm not prepared to say here's what the next three years, four years look like. We are getting together here over the next few weeks and next month and then presenting to the board our perspective of our long-range plan, which goes out and looks at that. And I will commit to you and everyone else that in the summer timeframe, we will be coming back to folks with our updated long-range plan and outlook.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from David Maris with Wells Fargo.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. A couple of questions. First, on the capital deployment, do you think that a continued M&A strategy in Europe's compatible with what you say is a principle of returns to shareholders since it appears that return on equity and assets and ROIC have weakened since you started that strategy?","And then separately, 24 competitive launches against the topical product line, can you quantify that in dollars? And what's this trend related to? Is this the FDA pushing more approvals? And maybe just any comments on the vulnerability that you might have on that happening with more products going forward.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, David. Let me take some of those, then I may toss over to Judy for a couple of others. First of all, capital deployment and return to shareholders. As I go through again and think about priority, and I lay this out trying to mentally get these clear, I think organic growth, great way to do it, great platform, makes sense.","I believe in Europe, we have a good platform. We're trying to put more operating structure into it, think a little bit about the operating entrepreneurship out of it and bring some structures into it, but it is a good platform. The GSK products that we bought a few months back are performing well in those markets.","The nicotine franchise, we're on the biggest nicotine franchises, nicotine replacement therapy franchise in the U.S. And now having that in Europe, a great natural extension for our core consumer businesses. So, I do believe that adding on core bolt-on acquisitions within the infrastructures can have a good return for shareholder value. So, I'm a believer in that.","And then, ultimately, what else do we do with the cash and the value that we're generating are the other ways of returning that value to shareholders. But I would put them in that order because I think that's a priority that we can deliver value to the group.","Why don't I turn over to Judy on the 24 and the escalation, et cetera, on what we've seen from the approach.","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","And David, I just called that out. I'm not quantifying the specific dollars versus our expectation in Q1 that the 24 launches had on our bottom line this quarter. But what I \u2013 the reason I did call it out is because compared to probably every other quarter since we've owned Rx, it was an escalation, a rapid escalation of approvals and changing competitive landscape that I just wanted to call out. So, faster than we had anticipated and we have launches coming up in the remainder of the year. This particular quarter, the dynamics for the competition was different than ours. So, that's the only reason I called it out.","David Maris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Judy. Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from David Steinberg with Jefferies.","David Michael Steinberg - Jefferies LLC","Yeah, thanks. John, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned you'd put a new leadership team into the Omega business, one that had been very successful with bolt ons. Just curious, how can you get us comfortable that you can do the same with Omega? After all, it's a very large acquisition, over $1 billion in sales versus bolt on. They have mom and pops in Europe, it's multiple countries, they don't have consolidated chains. How can you get us comfortable that that integration will go well and that you have a handle on the business?","And related to that, during the Mylan saga, apparently STADA had changed their business with Omega and I think Mylan was blamed somehow, but we never got a full answer on what happened with STADA. And will they come back as they were before? And finally, can you give us an update on the FLONASE launch? Thanks.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, thank you. Thank you, David. Let me try and go in order. First of all, I do, as you said, have great confidence with the team and the initial actions we've taken with the Omega, with Branded Consumer Healthcare, as we call it in Europe.","I won't go back to go through all of Sharon's accolades, but his integrity, his ability to drive performance to the operating line, he's proven himself. So I'm confident in him. I'm confident that we won't need to add more leaders and add more things to drive it, but I think we're off to a great start. We also added one of our experienced financial leaders to that business about two months ago. He has already begun a much stronger financial planning, financial control acumen to the BCH team, so I feel good about that.","Do I think that you can add a brand across every European country just like you do in the U.S.? No. Each of our brands are more specialized within regions there. It might be the Nordics or it might be down in the Baltic areas, but they're all more regionalized. I believe that even within those regions, one of the advantages that Omega has in our Branded Consumer Healthcare division is they have the ability to launch products within region segments and make them profitable.","So when I say bolt ons, they may not be just one Pan-European brand. It may be brands that are much more regional where we can add to that infrastructure and growth. So I do have confidence in that. I have confidence in our ability to continue to provide growth under that platform.","I think integration, we're going to continue. They have a great sales marketing dry footprint. The way they worked with each country, whether it's a pharmacy-driven country, whether it's more like the UK, which tends to be more like the U.S. from a retailer distribution. No matter what, they've got a good infrastructure there and they've been able to show strong leadership. And so I've got a lot of confidence in the business drivers there, et cetera. I think we need the operational backbone, the financial backbone that Perrigo brings to solidify that overall structure.","Related to sort of the Mylan-STADA business, STADA is a generic company that we distribute for in Belgium, as you might recall. During all the Mylan discussions, et cetera, there were some strange relationships there with STADA holding off some distribution, et cetera. We are basically through that. We are continuing to operate with STADA and distribute their products in Belgium. We are talking with them about what the go-forward relationship might be or might not be, but we still have a time period of a couple of years for that relationship. So that's worked out. As today, we're meeting well with them.","David Michael Steinberg - Jefferies LLC","And just the update on FLONASE?","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, FLONASE. So we are still planning on launching FLONASE, awaiting for our final approval and have retailers, et cetera, ready to launch and ready to go. Product is in our docks ready to ship as soon as we get our approval.","David Michael Steinberg - Jefferies LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. You mentioned FLONASE just now. You also had mentioned ProAir. You pushed out the Mucinex 600mg. Is this just being more conservative across the board, or is there some reason you can't launch ProAir now in this calendar year?","And Mucinex, I guess I understand you're just being more conservative. Just give us a little more flavor on that. And then Omega, you mentioned lower lifestyle and natural health, VMS, I guess, products was key in the quarter and for the change of the guidance. Can you just give us a sense of how big these products are? What was the change? Thanks.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So first of all, we talked about the new products, FLONASE, ProAir, Mucinex. I don't like to say conservative, I'd rather say realistic. We're trying to put realistic expectations out there. Could some of those still hit in the year? Yes, they would, but they're not planned. FLONASE, we still have in our plan. Mucinex, we moved out. Are we still aggressively working to get that back to market? We are. ProAir was planned to launch right at the end of the calendar year. And given all the dynamics, we've decided to move it out of the year. Are we still working to try and drive it? We are. It's a delay on when we'd expect it, but we're still trying to drive that to completion.","Related to the Branded Consumer Healthcare and Omega products, the \u2013 and Judy, I don't know if you want to talk about that related to the impairment side and the issues related there that we took on those areas.","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","Certainly. Maybe \u2013 let me just give everyone a little bit of color to the extent you had questions on the impairments discussed. The intangible assets that are recorded in the indefinite-lived intangible asset basket that is recorded on our balance sheet is a composition of the branded portfolio of Omega at the time of acquisition. So within each of the major categories are several brands.","As the year has progressed in 2015 and into 2016, we also did additional acquisitions. We did a GSK portfolio. we launched the Yokebe product line, which has proven to be a very successful lifestyle health product that is performing very well in the portfolio and capturing a lot of market share. As we moved then strategically as a team, the team's looked at offerings of products and are moving away from XLS, which was in the original acquisition basket and moving towards Yokebe, that triggers the requirement to lower the carrying value of those particular assets on the balance sheet.","So one can look at the impairment as a negative. We are writing down certain assets that were acquired at the time of acquisition. But in the same time, we're also investing in other brands in the portfolio for future growth. So that's part of this composition of John talking \u2013 he made several comments about re-analyzing the portfolio, re-prioritizing that portfolio for growth. Part of that prioritization process, actually, is what triggered the discussion around the impairment. So, it's moving from plan A to plan B in triggering net impairment, that non-cash charge.","In looking at the remainder of the year, all of that kind of comes together. So the guidance was updated to reflect certain changes in that portfolio, some ups, some downs, lowering the overall guidance across certain categories to make some adjustments, primarily with the focus on new products. So some expectations of timing changes on those and how we reprioritize the top 20 brands are what were the drivers for this year's guidance. And we didn't get specific on which categories got changed in guidance, but suffice it to say, it's really about pulling different levers within the overall top 20 brand basket.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, Judy.","Bradley Joseph - Vice President-Global Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Annabel Samimy with Stifel.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on your appointments, myself for you. I guess I want to look bigger picture at the generics business. It's always been characterized, given that it's topical, as a higher barrier type of generics composition. And that doesn't seem to be the case at all this quarter, given you had so many competing products that got approved. So how should we really think about your generics business from this point forward? Is it going to be \u2013 is topicals now becoming a more commoditized business, or is this just a fluke in terms of the backlog the FDA started approving? And do you have the right composition of assets there?","And then in terms of Omega, just longer-term it's always been characterized as the 5% to 10% growing business. And also, the strategic rationale was to really be less of an operating synergy play but more of a revenue synergy play. And so does that still stand? Do you still have a lot of opportunities for revenue synergies in the longer term, two to three years out? Thanks.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Judy, why don't you lead off on the first question?","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. That was a multi-part question.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","But I didn't breathe. I didn't breathe between the questions.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","No. No commas. No commas.","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","So that's a tip for everyone else. If you can manage to go a long way without breathing, you're all set. All right. Let me just start off just briefly. I want to make one point on the Rx front. Because the Rx quarter performed so much differently than our expectations because of the items I've already mentioned, and we're taking a pragmatic view for the rest of the year, we lowered our guidance. We're calling out the reasons, therefore.","But I just want to point out to everyone, sort of stating the obvious is we saw flow-through in these pricing dynamic at the top line, which rolled through in dollar terms through to the bottom line versus our expectations and the impact of the full year. But please note, the adjusted margins are still very strong.","So the team's still leadership position in this space, the products that we put to market are still secure in relative terms than the average generic. And you can see that through both this quarter, while the quarter, year-over-year is, in fact, down, not arguing that point. So they're still very attractive operating margins with continued investment in R&D.","So I just want to point that part out because it's really about relative dynamics, but still attractive portfolio. And we believe that we've built in an update to the new landscape and still are looking at very attractive margins.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you, Judy. And it's similar. I think that the technology, the barriers through all barriers we described to command a good market and what's there. On the Omega front, I would say on the long term, look at the Omega growth. I'm going to say the same thing I did earlier, which is I want to make sure we get a chance to get our whole team together to look at the long-range plan to review it and consolidate it. We look at it by business segment, but then we look at what other value we can bring to each of those businesses. And again, my commitment is to come back to you and others in the summer here with our long-range growth plan that relate to Omega.","When you think about the synergistic side that we have with the Branded Consumer Healthcare business, they are still there. The operating side synergies, teams still driving hard to try and deliver, driving those to the bottom line. The revenue synergies in my mind are still there. They take, and even in our model, longer to get through because you have multiple registrations, multiple \u2013 how do you advertise and promote different things, multiple regulations within different countries even in the U.S. So in my perspective, they are still there from a long-term plan standpoint but just takes longer to get to those ultimate revenue synergies.","By putting Judy in her new role, one of her great opportunities will be taking the products that we have in different divisions and figuring out how do we leverage those across our global business portfolio. So that will be one of Judy's key to-dos beginning tomorrow.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just a higher level question. I guess in light of Joe's departure and the recent performance in the business, and I guess this is for John and Laurie, are you reviewing the overall portfolio? I guess my question here is do you have the right assets in place? And is this maybe a time to look more carefully at the portfolio and perhaps, even more refocus on a core group of assets and divest some franchises?","And if I can just sneak in a quick follow-up on just the Rx business, and Judy, sorry to re-ask this, but I'm still just not clear exactly why. But why isn't the business seeing more margin erosion given the competitive dynamics and pricing? It seems like many of your peers were seeing pricing competition that's translating to very steep margin erosion. And I'm just \u2013 I'm trying to understand why that isn't the case with Perrigo, and then I would think lower prices would drive down margins here. Thanks so much.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Well, let me \u2013 Laurie, I'll jump in. And clearly, add something, with Joe's recent departure. I would say the Board and I are very aligned on looking at every aspect of the business and figuring out if there's business segments, product lines, anything that does not fit or there's a different value that we should be looking at.","I'll say it for me and I won't speak for who are in the Board, but there is no \u2013 I'm not married to any business segment that isn't delivering its fair share of value. We did that with vitamins. We did it with the India business segment we had that we put up for sale. We did it with a couple of the brands in Omega that we put for sale because they weren't adding value to portfolio. So I'm very open to looking at that and open to listening to other ways of thinking about it.","Big picture, when I step back, there are certain parts of our business that are very synergistic together, and even though they seem as separate segments, do add value to each other. And so when we think about standalone or breaking up all the parts, a lot of them do connect very well together to give us ultimately more value than they would separated. But still, very open and interested to thoughts, comments from anyone. And the board is very open to that also. Laurie, I don't know if you have anything to add to those comments on that.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chairman","I don't know that I could a whole lot, John, but I would just echo what you said. The board is very interested in learning about and hearing about different options, and very open to considering all options that will drive shareholder value from that perspective.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. So let me jump on the second part of the question and then, Judy, please jump in. If I step back and look at it, we certainly have had pricing dynamics that weren't as expected or weren't as desired, all of those things. When we step back and look at our portfolio of products and mix that we have, it's a pretty profitable mix.","So despite \u2013 I know it sounds contradictory, but we've had pricing pressures, price and margin have come down, but when you look at our whole basket of mix within our Rx business, it is still a very profitable mix as you see in the margins.","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","And we've had the acquisitions completed at the end of 2015 and beginning of 2016, which have contributed attractive margins to the basket as well. So on a year-over-year basis, there are pluses and minuses. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, there were the pricing pressures that we spent a lot of time on already this morning, offset in large part from the margin perspective with the acquired products. So the basket's still working in the portfolio. On a margin perspective, it's still working well.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, Judy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sumant Kulkarni with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You have a small branded specialty pharma effort going, is it fair to characterize that as being on the back burner now? And is the infant nutrition business meeting your criteria?","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So why don't I start from the back first? First, the infant formula business is meeting our criteria. It is growing. If you go back a year or two ago, we converted the whole business to a new marketing presentation, et cetera. Since we have re-launched all of those products, it has done very well. Good movement at retail. We are very pleased with where it's going and the upside potential of that business. So in my mind, it is meeting our criteria. It's well into our consumer franchise.","Related to the small branded, Judy, maybe I'll toss that one back to you on the small other investments we have other than TYSABRI.","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","Within our branded portfolio?","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","Branded Rx portfolio? It is a nascent business. Doug Boothe and his team are continuing to look at opportunities to expand their basket of products. Very specialty focused. Not trying to go out to product categories where we have to have thousands of sales folks to cover the United States. But being very targeted and looking for also additionally, products that would fit into our Durham business where we could have a whole lifecycle management of branded to generics, of course, to our OTC businesses. So still small, but looking for products that can be tucked into that and utilizing the sales forces we have today.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Bradley Joseph - Vice President-Global Investor Relations","Next question please.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao with Barclays.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So just first, Judy, maybe if you could help us in terms of the sequencing for the Consumer Healthcare business through the rest of the year. I mean, in terms of the guidance, it seems to be relative \u2013 the rest of the quarter seems to be relatively flattish, maybe up a little bit from the first quarter, but should we expect it to be down and then back up in the second half? And then just in terms of ProAir, did you receive a complete response letter, or do you have a target action date from the FDA for that launch?","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Judy, why don't you talk the healthcare?","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. On a relative basis, so as I think about the year in Consumer Healthcare, in some ways it's similar to the way we tried to guide you \u2013 I would call it the arc of the year for the full company. The Consumer Healthcare business will have a bigger second half. Their new product launches are concentrated in the back half of the year. So that means that it's a build over the course of the year. Investments continue over the course of the year. And if you recall, the June quarter for them last year, as well as for Branded Consumer Healthcare, were quite big in the June quarter of 2015. So it was a huge quarter.","So, expect the comps in CHC on a year-over-year basis to be more challenged, again, because of the last year dynamic. New products launch up in the second half, growth continues so that CHC line, to your point, I think you called it out as a dip and then pick back up. And that's a reasonable estimate. And that's why we also made that comment. CHC is our largest business. We made that comment about expect approximately 55% of EPS to come in the second half of the year.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Related to the ProAir product, we did \u2013 basically we got some comments from the FDA. We're working to address all those comments and concerns and get that information back in their hands. And I'll just leave it at that due to confidentiality at this point.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much. That's very helpful.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much for the opportunity to ask a question. And John, I'm looking forward to meeting you and congratulations on your new opportunity.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Likewise. Thank you.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Judy, if you can just \u2013 both of you guys take a step back at the generic drug business because it seems that the companies that got caught off guard on Rx pricing were companies with concentrated portfolios. Certainly, your portfolio is mostly derm products, which has benefited from unusual price inflation. Typically, generic drugs are deflationary, but you've benefited from inflationary products. I mean, when you take a step back, clearly, the environment's changed. It seems that the FDA is approving more drugs in this space that's creating competition, which is pushing down prices. And at the same time, consolidated buyers are pressing for a broader depth of portfolio. So it just seems that at the end of the day, the companies that were caught off guard had concentrated portfolios to those that weren't, and who had anticipated a low-to-mid single digit decline in prices have broad global portfolios.","John, your portfolio is highly concentrated all in the U.S. While that has clearly served the company well over the past couple of years, going forward, it does appear that the environment is changing for your type of portfolio. What do you see as a possible strategic option for this business? Does is still make sense to keep for Perrigo? And is this a one-time re-basing or do we worry about those margins eventually coming back down to where Teva's and Mylan's are? Or how do you think about that business strategically?","And then just my follow-up question on TYSABRI. You talked about that not being core. That's a financial asset. Isn't, though, the longer you wait, the less it's worth just given the competition that's coming next year? Thanks very much.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Wow. That was a lot of them in there. I'll try and \u2013 I think I made good notes here, but will do my best to try and do those. Let me start back and comment on our generic business. Kind of go back to the big picture.","It definitely is a business focused on extended topicals. So it's not just derm. It's ophthalmics, it's women's health, but it's extended topical kind of products, those that usually require clinicals, broader types of approvals to get in there. They usually are not billion-dollar blockbusters. They usually are much more the brands. They usually are much more $100 million products, et cetera. And so you usually don't have 57 competitors going after that like you might with a 800-milligram ibuprofen or something of that nature. So it is still a space.","We are a relatively big Rx player. I mean, we're certainly in the top 10, not just within the extended topical, but in general when you look at the U.S. generics space. I think it hit \u2013 as we look back and understand how it hit, there certainly were some approvals, there's some buying power, all of those things that hit us faster than we expected and we had to address. I think the others had been \u2013 it hit them earlier because of their broad portfolio. They had a number of products that certainly were targeted in the initial barrage, if you will.","So I do think we're in a unique time. We have a good product pipeline, and we expect to continue to get those approvals and continue to be able to balance out the ups and downs of our product mix and portfolio given we're going to continue to see constant price pressure on our older products. We've always seen that. It's just that escalated here in the last quarter with the approvals.","So when you look globally, I think it's a great question, one I think we'll contemplate here over the next couple of months as we look through the long-term strategy of our Rx business. We, certainly, as we get to other countries, have Rx businesses. They're not nearly as big. We do an Rx business the in UK. That makes the very specialty prescriptions. We have some businesses that distribute through Rx in Mexico. So we have parts of our business that our Rx are certainly much smaller than our core U.S. business. And so, we will look at how that fits. Does it fit internationally? Does it fit globally into our structure?","Clearly in the U.S., it has a lot of advantages. Again, our whole infrastructure is geared around both of those and it provides a pipeline for us to continue to feed our OTC marketplace and OTC engine. So all of that, very good.","I think the last kind of part of it is TYSABRI. Again, I do see it as a financial asset. I think we will continue to look at it and figure out what is the best way to utilize that asset. Does it add cash to fund other things? Is it liquidating parts of it to use money to do other things? Well we'll continue to evaluate the best use of that TYSABRI asset.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Bradley Joseph - Vice President-Global Investor Relations","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Chiang with BTIG.","Timothy Chiang - BTIG LLC","Hi, thanks. I wanted to just go back to the prescription pharma business. If I look at just sort of the overall market that you're in, in topical, it did look like you suffered from much more price erosion on your base business. It looks like you lost about $50 million in the first quarter or in this quarter on sales. And then you're still forecasting about what, $1.2 billion of prescription pharma sales which would reflect around about 11%, 12% year-over-year growth. So could you guys sort of provide a little bit more color on how you get to that figure for the full year? Either that's going to require more acquisitions or you're going to have to have a lot of incremental new prescription products coming online. Any color would be greatly appreciated.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. So let me kind of start, first of all, and then I'm going to go back and reiterate. We think it's a great business. We did experience more pricing in Q1 and adjustments there. We do expect about 6% pricing in our model going forward and feel that is the right number. And we're comfortable with where things are at, but that number at this time makes sense for us.","As we look at the overall growth, we've got new products and product mix that are all part of that go-forward projection and lead to that mix of products, that blend of gross margin operating income for that segment. Judy, I don't know if you have any other perspectives or details to add to that?","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","I just want to make sure \u2013 just to clarify one point that confuse me. Our number is approximately $1.2 billion in revenue expected in that segment this year includes announced acquisitions, Entocort, tretinoin. It include launches. Like John said, we put ProAir out. But other product launches, it doesn't have any sort of a gap filler in there for acquisitions or potential tuck-ins over the course of the year. That is the footprint of products that we own today and\/or we have on deck the calendar year to launch.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Correct. Thank you for clarifying, Judy.","Timothy Chiang - BTIG LLC","I guess ...","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Timothy Chiang - BTIG LLC","Okay, thanks.","Bradley Joseph - Vice President-Global Investor Relations","Thank you. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Buck with Northland Capital.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Mike on for David (01:24:30). Thanks for taking my question. I know you guys talked about a little bit about balancing M&A with other uses of capital. So the recent changes in pricing pressure, does that change how you look at acquisitions across different segments? Thanks.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks for the question. So again, I'll step back and say if you look at our business composition, we still remain 70% direct consumer phasing without a pharmacist interface. So if I look at acquisitions, using M&A and talk about bolt-on acquisitions versus completely transformational-type acquisitions, my belief is they will fit within the categories in that sort of proportion.","Bradley Joseph - Vice President-Global Investor Relations","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Okay. Your last and final question comes from Jon Andersen of William Blair.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning, everybody. And congratulations on the new and enhanced roles.","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Jon.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","I wanted to ask about the CHC business. And specifically, if you could comment a little bit more on overall market share trends for store brands in your target categories, and whether we're reaching kind of a plateau in the legacy business in terms of overall market share, or whether we should continue to consider kind of a historical trend rate of 50 to 100 basis points of share improvement over time? Thanks.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you, Jon. I appreciate the question. As we step back \u2013 and the thing that you have in Consumer Healthcare is you do have ebbs and flows. We had -Johnson & Johnson was out in the market with certain products, and they came back. And so you certainly have ebbs and flows that are bigger shifts in the market. But when I step back big picture wise and say, what's expected, the dynamics in the industry in my mind still remain unchanged.","As innovators launch the products, we're in a great position to capitalize on that. The macroeconomic trends of people getting older, needing more, healthcare costs going up despite our ability or desire to control them more, continue to drive people towards retail brands. And frankly when they try them, they recognize the quality there. And so that's allowed the share to grow. And my belief is that we'll continue to allow the share to drive upward.","I'd hate to speculate right now without, again, going through our long rage plan theme, with exactly what percentages it will go, I foresee continued share growth, again, when you got product-by-product dynamics but continued share growth for our core U.S. or brand market.","Bradley Joseph - Vice President-Global Investor Relations","Sorry, operator, can we take one more question, please?","Operator","Yes. Your final question comes from Jason Gerberry with Leerink Partners.","Derek C. Archila - Leerink Partners LLC","Good morning, guys. This is Derek on for Jason. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe first, just kind of on the updated guidance, what does that imply for a new product contribution in 2016? Just trying to get a better understanding across the segments, where the new products are definitely coming from. And second for John, in the PR, you commented consumer is kind of the core of the business. I mean, how do you believe you can grow that organically and strengthen that core? Thanks.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Great, thank you. Let me start out on the new product side and the guidance there, and I'm just going to toss that to Judy because she has the exact...","Judy L. Brown - Executive Vice President, Business Operations & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Official statement made in my prepared remarks is that we had previously said, greater than $400 million, and we have moved that to greater than $300 million. So it's mixed across all three major business units in terms of product timing. So it's a little from CHC, more from BCH and some adjustments to Rx.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","On the second part of your question, when you look at Consumer Healthcare and sort of the core, so as I kind of add up all the parts, there is some base growth form our business that continues to allow that Consumer Healthcare business to grow.","Switches are certainly game-changing or category changing, depending on which kind of switch it is. And we continue to see switches as a big part of the growth of that over-the-counter market when you look out over the next few years. And as different categories, I talked about derm or others that switched. Those open bigger opportunities","Going back aways, not to get back too far, but when you look at non-sedating antihistamines, it's probably one of the clear categories you used to either go to the over-the-counter and get something that would put you to sleep when you had your allergies, or you went to a doctor and got a prescription. Now as those products switched all the over the counter, the amount of opportunity that that has created in the over-the-counter space is great. So we see that continuing for categories, and frankly, the regulatory agencies and government wanting to try and drive safe healthcare to be more affordable, and to all of those we think work in the favor of that.","Related to additional kind of add-ins, we certainly are a big part of their business, but there are still other segments, other areas that would fit well within our overall system, overall structure, adding more items to a truck that are pharmaceutically oriented that we continue to look at. And not all of them will make sense for us, but we continue to make sure that we have the sort of optimal portfolio to bring that value to our retailers, and then ultimately to consumers. So I think there is still those left that Jeff and his team are continuing to look at to see how we add those in. Thank you. Thanks, Derek.","John T. Hendrickson - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well with that, I thank everyone for joining us to the call.

We are very pleased that we were able to retain such great talent to have them join us at Perrigo.","Now let's discuss our recently concluded fiscal second quarter. On Slide 5, you can see that this was, once again, another great quarter for Perrigo, demonstrating the strength of our diversified platform. Our quarterly performance is highlighted by 3 important achievements: number one, all-time record net sales of $979 million, up 11%; number two, continued adjusted gross profit and operating margin expansion; and finally, number three, record adjusted quarterly diluted EPS.","Moving on to Slide 6. You can consolidated Perrigo grew the top line 11% driven by the outperformance in the Rx and Nutritionals business. Despite a relatively slow start to the cough\/cold\/flu season, consolidated organic revenue growth was 7% with new products contributing $53 million. These strong sales results correlated with impressive results in operating income. We also had record adjusted gross in operating margins for the business. These results allowed us to make strategic investments in our digital media, which accounted for some of the strategic increase in corporate SG&A expense. I look forward to sharing you more of these exciting initiatives at our upcoming Analyst Day on February 28. Now let's move on to the business units.","Consumer Healthcare was relatively flat this quarter as last year's second quarter was an all-time record high on the strength of an unusually early spike in the cough\/cold\/flu season. Sales for the quarter were $536 million with $17 million of new products.","Our Nutritionals sales segment grew 15%. That's the third straight quarter of double-digit growth. Consumer acceptance of the new SmarTub containers continues to gain traction. Our Rx segment once again achieved record results, growing sales 52% with an adjusted operating margin of 50%.","As you can see on Slide 7, store brand continues to gain market share versus national brands across most categories. Looking at infant formula, the category was up 1.9% with national brands up 2.9%. But store brands grew 9%.","Now let's talk about the analgesics and cough, cold, allergy, sinus categories. In analgesics, the category has grown 2.3% while national brands have outgrown store brands. The relatively strong national brand performance in the category was due to the expected return to the market of a brand's competitor that has been absent from the market for the last several years.","On Slide 8, you can see the strength in store brand market share growth in the infant formula category. Just over the past year, store brands gained 60 basis points. You can see these market share results -- gains that I've just shared with you. Now let me turn the call over to Judy.","Judy L. Brown","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first earnings conference call at Perrigo Company PLC. As you just heard, the team recorded its best financial quarter in history with record revenue, adjusted earnings and margins. We delivered solid consolidated operating results while managing through a highly dynamic consumer environment. At the same time, much effort was invested to promptly close the acquisition of Elan before the end of the calendar year, a goal that we were pleased to execute against.","Now let me review the fiscal second quarter results by business segment. Beginning on Slide 9. The change in net sales in Consumer Healthcare was due primarily to an increase in sales volumes of existing products of $19 million, primarily in the smoking cessation and gastrointestinal categories; along with new product sales of $17 million, primarily in cough\/cold and smoking cessation categories; and $5 million of incremental sales attributable to the Velcera acquisition. These increases were offset by a decline of $46 million in sales of existing products, primarily in the contract manufacturing and analgesics categories.","I'm sure you all like to understand why we saw year-over-year declines in CHC, so let me walk you through the key drivers. First, sales within our contract manufacturing business were down over 40% year-over-year. The biggest contributor of this decrease was a certain contract customer to whom we supplied significant product in the past year as they resumed production at one of their own facilities, reducing the need for products sourced from Perrigo. While we continue to supply a sizable amount of product to this customer, the volume of sales compared to last year is down significantly. Such is the nature of the contract manufacturing business. Were we to exclude this declining contract sales, Consumer Healthcare net sales would have increased approximately 4% year-over-year.","Second, as we stated, the cough\/cold\/flu season in the second fiscal quarter started later in the United States versus last year. This, combined with lower incidence of cough\/cold and flu, yielded a very difficult year-over-year sales comparison. In fact, as of today, in all of the data we've reviewed and according to IMS FAN data, the incidence of cough\/cold and flu is down double digits year-over-year versus last year's season.","And third, the expected return of product to market by a specific national brand competitor impacted year-over-year sales, particularly in the analgesics category. So after all of that, I'm happy to note that within the nicotine replacement category, sales of our store brand nicotine lozenges, notably the recently launched mini lozenges, are performing extremely well with sales up by more than 40% year-over-year.","Adjusted Consumer Healthcare gross margin expanded 50 basis points, attributable to product mix as well as the Velcera acquisition, and the adjusted operating margin was impacted by our decision to accelerate investments in new product R&D.","On Slide 10, you can see that net sales within the Nutritionals segment increased 15% year-over-year as existing product sales rose $15 million and new product sales were $4 million.","As Joe noted, consumer acceptance of the plastic tub within the infant formula category continued to increase as store brand market penetration is now above 12%. Our customers have attributed this increase to a few factors: first, the side-by-side presentation of our product next to the national brand on the shelves; second, consumer appreciation of the superior design and functionality of the powders group compared to the national brand; third, increased shelf space versus this time last year; and fourth, more effective digital promotions targeting young families.","The adjusted gross margin in the Nutritionals segment increased 270 basis points, driven by greater absorption levels in our manufacturing facilities and improved efficiencies over last year. The adjusted operating margin expanded due to DSG&A leverage on increased volume.","As you can see on Slide 11, the Rx team continues to outperform expectations on all metrics. Net sales within our Rx segment increased 52% to $247 million due to incremental net sales of $26 million from the Rosemont and Fera acquisitions, new product sales of $24 million, and product mix. Adjusted gross and operating margin increased due to acquisitions, favorable product mix versus last year and higher margins on new product sales.","Next, on Slide 12. Net sales in the API segment declined to $30 million due to a decrease in existing product sales of $17 million as a result of increased competition, partially offset by $7 million in new product sales. Gross and operating margins were impacted by the decrease in sales in existing products I just referred to, partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses.","Turning to Slide 13. I'd like to walk you through how our new Specialty Sciences segment will be reported. Specialty Sciences includes the revenue we receive from Biogen Idec sales of Tysabri, currently at 12% of their total global product sales, and which you may remember will increase to 18% on May 1, 2014. The revenues we record drop fully to the adjusted gross profit. As previously disclosed, we expect to incur operating costs in this segment consisting of R&D for the D5 Phase II clinical program and SG&A for Irish-based costs, including facilities, legal and finance, among others, in the future.","Now let's discuss our consolidated adjusted effective tax rate for this quarter, which was approximately 14%. As we have discussed in previous calls, we are required to annualize our effective tax rate in accordance with GAAP accounting rules. This GAAP accounting requirement causes benefits of the positive jurisdictional mix of earnings from Elan and the new corporate structure to be recognized in the quarter it is implemented. Since we closed Elan during the second quarter, we realized the benefit of the Elan jurisdictional mix and the new corporate structure on an annualized basis in this period. This impact significantly reduced our effective tax rate for the quarter.","Now some quick highlights on our balance sheet. Excluding cash and current investments, working capital was $718 million at the end of the quarter compared to $707 million at June 29, 2013. As of December 28, 2013, total current and long-term data on the face of the balance sheet was $3.3 billion, up $1.3 billion sequentially from last quarter due to the recently completed acquisition of Elan. Net debt -- that is gross debt less cash, cash equivalent and current securities -- was $2.7 billion, which equaled the net debt to total capital at the end of our second quarter of 24.1%.","Year-to-date, net cash flow from operations was $220 million even with the inclusion of an estimated $103 million of transaction and acquisition costs, cash flows related to Elan.","Now I'd like to discuss our updated earnings outlook for fiscal 2014. Looking to our segment on Slide 14, we continue to anticipate healthy demand for our products in our Consumer Healthcare segment. However, we are making adjustments to revenue and adjusted margins to reflect some recent developments. First, our current February 6 expectation of our ability to have our Guaifenesin 600-milligram ER available for the rest of this cough\/cold season has been further risk adjusted. Joe will discuss this in more detail momentarily.","Second, as noted earlier, the cough\/cold season began later and, despite some initial indications of an uptick in early January, has not yet surpassed the incident rates of either last year or the rolling 5-year averages of what we would normally see at this point in the season. As such, our outlook for the remainder of the cough\/cold\/flu season is down versus our original plan.","Third, our contract manufacturing business is now anticipated to be lower than our projections from the beginning of the fiscal year for the reasons I noted earlier. And lastly, we are lowering our probability weights on the launches of the broader Guaifenesin family of products based on current information from our partner.","Given the momentum in the Nutritionals segment with the continued growth of store brand infant formula and increasing manufacturing efficiencies, we are raising guidance for this segment's net sales and adjusted gross margins.","Revenue in the Rx segment is now projected to grow 26% to 30% year-over-year with a more favorable margin structure and new product launches. A deep pipeline and favorable market dynamics enable continued outperformance for this segment. Within the API segment, we are adjusting our revenue growth to reflect the increasingly competitive market dynamics of the products in our portfolio.","Looking at Slide 15, you will see the changes to our detailed consolidated guidance include the acquisition of Elan and the overall dynamics within our portfolio of businesses. We are now estimating consolidated year-over-year revenue growth to be in a range of 15% to 18% with adjusted gross and operating margin expansion. As previously discussed, due to the jurisdictional mix changes related to Elan and our new corporate structure, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 22% for this fiscal year. Also, as a reminder, we continue to expect our total shares outstanding to be approximately 134 million shares on a go-forward basis, which equates to a full year fiscal 2014 weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 116 million shares. All of this leads to a $0.10 increase in our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range for fiscal 2014. The increase in operating cash flow guidance includes an estimated $180 million to $190 million of operating cash outflows related to Elan.","The diversification of the Perrigo business model was evident this quarter as the team demonstrated its flexibility to deliver double-digit top line growth. With the closing of the Elan acquisition behind us, we remain focused on solid execution as a basis for continued growth, both organically and as we further cultivate our business development pipeline. Now let me turn it back to Joe.","Joseph C. Papa","Thank you, Judy. Now I'd like to provide some thoughts on our business going forward. The same 3 mega trends continue to drive our business. First, the movement of consumers purchasing and retailers promoting store brand products versus the national brand; second, the continued movement of prescription products switching to over-the-counter status; and third, the continued importance of new product launches.","In fact, store brands represent 35% of the OTC market in dollars and, obviously, more in volume. In addition, Rx-to-OTC switches are expected to continue with more than $10 billion in branded Rx sales likely to switch in the next 5 years. We have all seen new categories making a switch, such as overactive bladder and the nasal inhalers like Nasacort OTC.","The pipeline for 2014 looks robust as you can see on Slide #16. Highlighted by the launch of our store brand version of Children's Delsym and the expected launch of Claritin 24-hour Liqui-Gel and Advil Congestion Relief, with these 2 products, nearly $60 million in combined branded sales.","Year-to-date, we launched an impressive $107 million in new products. And as we stated in August, we anticipate launching over 75 new products across all segments, contributing more than $190 million in revenue in this current fiscal year. The launch of store brand Mucinex 600-milligram ER contributed very nicely to the quarter. However, as we had previously stated, we continue to work with one of our vendors to obtain raw materials for the products that meet our specific rigorous high-quality internal specifications. The team is working diligently to resolve this supply disruption as quickly as possible, but we acknowledge that this will have an impact on our ability to supply customers, and we have adjusted our guidance for Consumer Healthcare to reflect this.","Also, based on recent comments from our partner in terms of their current expectations for the remaining family of Mucinex-like products, we have decreased the fiscal year '14 probability of launch. In our Animal Health business, we have begun shipping our store brand version of Frontline to limited customers and expect additional customers to order in time for the flea and tick season this spring.","Turning to Slide 17. You can see that what we expect in our Nutritionals business has been driven by numerous growth drivers in the coming year, most specifically the upgraded national brand-style packaging, the SmarTub.","Moving on to the growth opportunities in our Rx segment on Slide 18. You can see that we continue to be very well positioned. Over the past few months, we have launched 5 new products with combined brand sales of more than $450 million. In January, we received final approval for the generic equivalent to VANOS Cream 0.1%. We were awarded 180 days of generic drug exclusivity and began shipping the product in the middle of January.","We have a robust pipeline of 28 ANDAs pending FDA approval, representing approximately $4.2 billion in branded sales, which includes 7 confirmed first-to-file ANDAs, including the generic version of Androgel 1.62%.","Additionally, on Slide 19, we have a healthy leadership position across multiple technologies, including the only FDA-approved generic topical foam. Additionally, we have a full year of contributions from our 2013 acquisitions of Rosemont oral liquids and Fera's ophthalmic products.","In summary, on Slide 20, Perrigo is poised for continued strong growth with a great start to the new year.","Finally, a couple of the questions that have come up during recent meetings in San Francisco I wanted to comment on relative to Tysabri. One of the questions is how and when we might consider monetizing the asset? First, let me say that we love this asset. It's a growing royalty stream on a drug with best-in-class efficacy that generates cash. That said, there has been a lot of interest in this asset, and we like the optionality that this asset brings to us. Ultimately, we will do what is best for our shareholders and for Perrigo.","On January 29, I also want to let you know that we priced an underwritten public offering of shares of Prothena, which was one of Elan's investments. This has generated approximately $79 million for Perrigo. We are monetizing this asset as part of our strategy to focus on the core strength of Perrigo.","The next most popular question we -- that has been coming forward to us was when will we be doing our next deal and how big will it be? First, we stated our desire to delever the balance sheet to approximately 2x debt-to-adjusted EBITDA in the next 18 months. We believe we can do that and still do the adjacent category bolt-on or geographic transactions that we've done in the past in the near term. Our business development pipeline is robust, and the team considers, on those types of deals that opportunities will arise in the sub-$200 million range.","Finally, I'd like to thank the entire Perrigo team for the impressive first half results. It takes a great team doing great things to achieve these results. Perrigo is very well positioned for further growth as we head into the second half of our fiscal 2014 with a more enhanced platform as we continue to execute on our mission of making quality healthcare more affordable for consumers.","Operator, let's now open up the call for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gilbert of Bank of America.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Joe, you proactively answered a part of my first question, and I was going to ask how would you, maybe I'll say, further characterize the level of interest in Tysabri you've seen from outside parties? And when might you make some decisions based on that interest? And then I'll have a follow-up.","Joseph C. Papa","Okay. Well, first of all, Greg, I think as I stated on the call, we love the asset. We think it's a great asset for us. It's got a number of important characteristics in terms of obviously being very unique in the MS category, being a highly effective product. It's a great -- we've got a great partner with Biogen. It's got an escalating royalty. The tax rate on it is approximately 1%. And we think it has a long life. Having said all that, there has been interest in this asset from some other individual companies out there in terms of this royalty, this very significant royalty. I think what I'd probably say right now is that we're evaluating those discussions, and we'll continue to have some discussions to really understand the relative pros and cons of this. As I've stated publicly, I think there's a couple of different ways one can look at a royalty and monetization of royalty. You can do a vertical slice, you can do a horizontal slice. You can do a time-based slice, but I think we're looking at all the different options in considering those. But in the long term, we certainly like the asset, and I think I probably won't say much more about any specific timing on that question.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then on the deals, the comment you made about deals and being focused on the bolt-ons in the $200 million or less range, are you saying that those are the only types of deals you're likely to do in the next 18 months? Or just that you can do those deals and still honor the deleveraging target without having to make some bigger decisions, so I guess, focused on what you would do and would not do?","Joseph C. Papa","Yes, I think it's more of the latter of what you said, Greg. I think we feel that we can still do transactions very similar to what we've done in the past. Those are really the adjacent categories where we bolt on a transaction there, or we do some type of smaller geographic expansion opportunity where it's a sub-$200 million level. Those are the things that we can because we're generating significant cash. Having said that, it is a bigger transaction, the plus-$1 billion-type transaction to where we have stated that our first priority will be to delever our debt leverage. So look for smaller ones. There are some out there but not the large transactions at this time.","Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And if I could sneak one last tax one in for Judy, I have to -- in terms of the quarterly fluctuation in the tax rate, Judy, going forward, other than that sort of annual effect issue you described, how much do you expect your tax rate to bounce around by quarter? And then at a higher level, what have you learned since closing that has made you feel either more optimistic or less so about tax savings longer term for Perrigo?","Judy L. Brown","Well, that's a very multi-part question. Thank you. So the annualization, I think, I commented in the prepared remarks that you get the impact of having to catch up. GAAP requires us to book annualized tax rates. So once we were in a position to close in the quarter, that forced us to have to make this, what appears to be a funny adjustment to the Q2 tax rate. But that gets our year-to-date tax rate in line then with what we expect for the full year, i.e., that 21% to 22-ish percent effective tax rate on an adjusted basis for the full fiscal year. How much it will bounce around in the context of the remainder of the year? On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we've given you a pretty tight range. The only thing would be if there was some very unusual swing jurisdictionally within the core business from Q3 to Q4. For example, I don't expect that much volatility when we're starting to get such an advantageous benefit in the overall rate with our new structure. That being said, post-close, is there something new or revelatory about the ongoing go-forward view of what the effective tax rate will and can look like? Of course, on -- in future years, we will have the effect of a full 12 months of this structure and the contribution from Tysabri on a go-forward basis. So that will continue to keep us in that high-teen zone that we talked about previously as we started to project what we thought the tax rate would look like in the future. There has not been anything specific that would make us deviate from that other than obviously looking at the ongoing jurisdictional mix of our underlying business, timing on new products, timing of contribution from Rx, et cetera. So no changes that I'd really comment on at this stage to deviate from the types of tax rate we've talked about in the past.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Randall Stanicky of RBC Capital Markets.","Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just on Tysabri, Joe, Judy, any change to the way you're thinking about the accretion for fiscal 2015 and beyond? And then, Joe, specifically as you're thinking about slicing or potentially slicing Tysabri, how do you -- how are you thinking about managing the P&L sensitivity from that perspective?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. So let me start with Tysabri. I don't want to give a suggestion that I know there is a specific way to slice Tysabri. And I'm not making any representations that we are going to do that as we really love this asset. So having said that part of the commentary, I really think I refer you back to what we put forth in the S-4 projections out there for Tysabri. That's really how we're looking at this asset. As Judy stated with relative to tax, the operational tax synergies that we've looked at for the Elan transaction still exists as we've previously stated. So I see no real changes there in terms of how we're looking at it. Obviously, though, one of the comments that I made was relative to some of the other assets that we acquired as a result of the Elan transaction, most notably Prothena. And we have now distracted ourselves from the Prothena asset to really focus on the things that we believe at Perrigo are core to our strategy, which is, as we've stated before, quality affordable healthcare. So there are some things that -- there are JV or other activities that we will extract ourselves from. But importantly, I'd say that the numbers that we put forth previously are continuing to what we're striving for from an operational and tax synergy point of view.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I just wanted to dive into the Elan contribution and just better understand that. So we calculated that the Elan contribution for about 2 weeks in December was $0.03 per share after tax, and I just wanted to confirm that that's correct. And then also, I just wanted to understand why for the next 6 months there would just be a $0.07 per share after-tax benefit. So if you could just help us better understand that and walk us through that, Judy, that would be great.","Judy L. Brown","Sure. So thank you all for patiently letting me walk through this because this is one of those -- as messy as it gets from an ins and outs perspective on the P&L. So rolling it forward, this quarter, hopefully, we roll it forward and then ongoing, we'll all be level set with the same assumptions. So you are operationally, directionally accurate when you do the math on what the Specialty Sciences segment contributed to earnings before tax. But step back for a minute, and think about the other ins and outs that comes through the P&L this quarter and as we forecast the full year guidance to think about what's going on. First of all, obviously, you have share issuance. So if you start to think about what that impact is, it will be 100 -- approximately 116 million shares, weighted average shares outstanding for the full year or an incremental 21 -- 20,658,000 shares that come through this quarter. So that has, obviously, right off the bat, a negative impact north of $1 of EPS just going through on the sheer calculation of incremental shares outstanding. You do get the incremental income that comes from, to your point, the 10 days in Q2 of the Elan operating contribution, Specialty Sciences contribution that will go on through the rest of the year. That does top through. And you can look at the estimated modeling that came through in the S-4. We are not specifically quoting that number, but that is a healthy contribution for the full remaining 6 months of the year. You have an incremental negative interest expense. Now it's -- that technically is only a few cents negative because we were able to get new financing on an ongoing basis. The outstanding debt number is larger, but the type of financing that we were able to raise, it raises total interest expense for the year about $8 million. You get a negative impact of several cents on the interest expense line. And lastly, you get the positive contribution of the ongoing new tax structure. So as you're looking at revising and updating your model to look at the full year, obviously, we have been guiding to a tax rate, give or take, 31%. And now we're telling you, 21%, 22%, that has a good guy [ph]. Net-net, fully loaded here, you come back around to the contribution of the acquisition of Elan. We had told you, expect approximately $0.10 accretion for fiscal year '14. Our number is slightly north of that, offset by the fact that we did comment that the basket of our portfolio for the, I'll call it, legacy -- the outstanding business pre-close of Elan is slightly negative. There's some good guys [ph]. We talked about Rx and Nutritionals being guided up, consumer Healthcare and API being guided slightly down. The net-net of all of that ends up coming back to the $0.10 accretion number for our overall EPS guidance range. So hence, my -- when I talk $0.10, you're trying to go from $0.03, add $0.07 in the back half of the year, and the curiosity of why it's only that $0.07. But it is all the ups and the downs, really, of the shares, interest, tax.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Judy, you beat this quarter by $0.27 but only raised the full year by $0.10. So I'm assuming the $0.16 shortfall in the back half of the year is explained by Consumer and API even though you also raised Nutritionals and Rx? Just trying to understand where the real shortfalls are because at the same time you're raising guidance for 2 very important divisions. And also, Joe, if you can give us an update on your thoughts on Nasacort AQ? It would appear that you are not including that in your numbers, and I would expect that, that would have a material impact later this spring for your Consumer Healthcare business.","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Let me start with just some comments, and I'll talk --- then I'll get to Nasacort, and I'll turn it back to Judy on that just for continuity here. So let me start on -- first of all, on the general question there, as Judy stated, there's a lot of moving pieces as we go forward. We did, as you stated, we did the quarter relative to the numbers on the adjusted earnings per share. Having said that, we did feel it would be appropriate to, with all the moving pieces in and out, to just try to continue to digest all of the activities and just try to come forth with a number that we felt was something that we could accomplish and be confident in that number. Having said all that, is there some piece of that going up? Yes. Are there some pieces that we've been more conservative about? Yes. That is also true. So it's really a reflection of trying to look and manage and understand how each of those pieces will impact the future for us as a company. But the only thing I wanted to say was I think it's just critically important is that, number one, we're still seeing very strong revenue growth up 11% across the total business this quarter. We've got record operating margins at 24.3%. And importantly, I think what really is the major part of this answer is that we have a diversified platform of business units that's allowing us to generate consistent long-term growth despite, as Judy said before, the weak cough\/cold\/flu season, the return of a branded competitor. So I think it is those pieces that allow us to still have the confidence to raise the numbers. Going back to the Nasacort, what I would say about Nasacort at this time, first of all, we're excited by the approval of Nasacort OTC and what that means for the entire category of nasal inhalers and other products that could potentially switch out [ph] at some future time period for the nasal inhalers. Number two, I'd say, it's great to see the Nasacort OTC product get out into the market this week. It appears Sanofi is spending behind this product. Having said that, we are working with our partner, Teva, and there still is a number of things we need to do to work through the issues with Teva to get our product into the marketplace. So I'm probably going to stop at that point because we still have a number of things that has to happen between ourselves and Teva.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Is it in your guidance, Joe? Is Nasacort in your guidance this year, risk-adjusted?","Joseph C. Papa","We have reduced the probability weighting significantly on this product at this time, and that's why we don't want to say much more than that at this time.","Judy L. Brown","Well, I was just comment, Jami, to your point on the back half of the year. As we look at the landscape of the second half of the year, I walked through the big factors that led us to take the CHC number down, which is never something we take lightly. And we commented on those moving parts. And to Joe's point, dramatically changing some of those probability weights, he just commented on one product in particular, but I commented on the Guaifenesin entire family of products in-house and partners. And we talked about what appears to be a weak cough\/cold\/flu season that -- where the retailers are doing a good job of managing their inventory very efficiently for their own balance sheets, and a very low incidence gave us pause to think about, to your point, where is the $0.27 and being conservative as we think about that second half of the year with all of the moving parts and a lot of variables. So hence, the number where we are right now knowing that there are several things that can still happen but wanted to get to a place where rolling you [ph] forward to the second half of the year and giving you visibility on the whys we've changed those numbers.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jason Gerberry of Leerink Partners.","Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question on Mucinex family and the regulatory issue there. Could you comment at all whether those are major or minor deficiencies? And if you can't answer that question, my backup is on infant Nutritionals, it looks like you're kind of grinding up your market share in an upward direction. How should we be thinking about the container conversion opportunity? Is this kind of going to be driven more by category growth? Or do you expect a kind of more meaningful share capture going forward?","Joseph C. Papa","Well I'll try to hit the highlights on the Mucinex question, and then I'll get to the answer on the -- kind of the rest of it. So as I stated on the call, we have a partner for the Mucinex family of products. We've had conversations with that partner. Based on the comments from our partner, we felt that the right thing to do is to reduce the probability of our launch in fiscal '14. We just -- we always -- every new product we have, we look at it, we put probability weighting on that, and depending on our progress for how things move because if things go better, we're going to expect -- sometimes they go worse than expected. We just adjust probability weighting. In this particular category, as I stated on the call, we felt the right thing to do was to reduce the probability weighting based on what we heard from our partner on this particular product. It's actually a family of products. On the second part of your question, on infant formula, the gains in the infant formula market share that we talked about, the 60 basis point improvement, really are a reflection, we believe, of the SmarTub plastic container that we've launched into the marketplace. We believe that anytime that Perrigo has launched a product that made that product look more like the national brand, we do well. And this particular product are -- the infant formula plastic container looks very similar to the national brand. When we make our product look similar to national brand, it invites comparison. When we invite comparison, consumers are more likely to select the store brand private label product, and that's what we are seeing the gains in the formula, infant formula market share gains. So we do expect to see infant formula continue to gain market share, and that was some of the reasons that we felt comfortable in raising our guidance from the previously stated 8% to 12% to the current guidance for this call at 10% to 14% revenue growth based on the strength of what we see in the private label business. Only other comment I would make there is that we also see, as illustrated in our handout materials, some other categories that are going to help us to grow -- for other products in the category that are going to help us to grow within the Nutritional business.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Louise Chen of Guggenheim Securities.","Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So I just had a question on 2 growth opportunities that you have, which is, one, being the Rx-to-OTC switch and any updated thoughts on Lipitor, Nexium and additional OAB products that may switch over the counter? And then, secondly, on Animal Health, where are you with the Rx products and making generic versions of those?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Well, I think going back to the first part of the question, the Rx-to-OTC, as I stated on the call, we are very excited about the switch of the different categories or new categories starting with the Oxytrol, as an example. Oxytrol went over-the-counter, which is we think is great news. Oxytrol by itself is not a large product from a prescription point of view, but importantly, it has -- being the first in the category of overactive bladder, it may open up opportunities for additional overactive bladder products to move from prescription to OTC. Obviously, we're going to continue to monitor those very closely. As I mentioned just previously on the nasal inhalers, the Nasacort move is an exciting move. It's now actually in the marketplace this week. I think though it opens up other opportunities for nasal inhalers beyond just the Nasacort product. And I think you know that our portfolio in the Rx side has already always been looking at those kind of opportunities with the belief that someday, they may switch from prescription-only status to OTC. So we think we're well positioned in the category for other products that may switch into the category of nasal inhalers. On the question of Nexium, we think Nexium is a spring 2014-possible event. It may get pushed off slightly. But we think somewhere in that spring 2014 timeframe is when we would see the national brand switch. But as I said, it could be 6 months later, but it's somewhere in the 2014 timeframe based on at least our current information. As to other products like Lipitor, I think you may have seen in the news that Pfizer made some comments about their pursuit of an oral over-the-counter opportunity, and we're just continuing to monitor that. I think it's still -- it's not 100% probability. I think it's, as I've said publicly, I think it's more like a 60-40 probability, but I probably don't want to say much more on it. Obviously, we wish Pfizer well on their pursuit of that particular product. It's really important for us really always to be in the position of being a fast follower for any opportunity that does go over-the-counter. On the Animal Health in the generic side, I'm probably going to just really say, Animal Health, our primary focus at this time is looking at Animal Health products that are over-the-counter or available without a prescription. And that really is our focus with -- starting with the flea and tick products. But we do believe that there is a great opportunity in the Animal Health for companion animals, as we've stated previously. So we're going to continue to follow that track and see what other adjacent category bolt-ons would help us with Animal Health.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Harold Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","In the Consumer business, you went through in nice detail just why it was weak. I was curious on the brands -- the brand coming back, J&J coming back with their analgesics. Obviously, this has been something that we've been watching now for quite a few quarters. So I was curious why all of a sudden is that an impact now, or has it been an impact before, it just wasn't as much? And I was curious how much of that is the reason versus the cough\/cold versus the concept [ph] manufacturing. If you could just maybe give us percentages of the weakness in consumer was mostly this but partly that. And then, no one has asked about API, but API seems to be a little bit weaker than before you even launched Temodar, which has obviously been a great product, especially last quarter. So I was curious what is going on in the base business of API that seems to be pushing that to be a little weaker than where we were before Temodar.","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Let me start with the first part of the question of what we are seeing in Consumer Healthcare. The expectation of the return to one of the large branded companies was something we fully expected, and that's really not something that has been a surprise. We all felt that. I think I would say the return to that product category has gone well for the brand. But we still believe that, as we've stated, probably we would still retain a portion of that business that we have picked up while the brand has been absent from the market. So that really has not changed our impacts or how we've looked at our Consumer Healthcare business. The real change, as Judy mentioned, was the weak cough\/cold\/flu season being down double digit. It is the Mucinex supply disruption that continues on the single-entity Guaifenesin 600-milligram product and then as well us lowering our probability weighting on launching the remaining family members for the business and, of course, what Judy mentioned on the contract business. Now going back to the question of the API business. Here's what I would say on API: API, the temozolomide product launch is going well. The generic is picking up a significant share of that business. But we also want to be cautious about the Day 181 when potentially other competitors could come into this business. So we don't want to get too far over our skis, as they say, relative to what's happening there. But the other part of the business on -- beyond temozolomide, we have seen some weakness in that business. As we said a year ago, we had a wonderful opportunity to monetize and receive some value for a product that was somewhat getting a 180-day exclusivity on the product was somewhat unexpected. So that was a positive last year. That's going away. So that's why you're seeing some lumpiness in the API business. The only other comment I would say is I would remind everyone the API business for us is strategic for a couple of reasons. Number one, it's a chance to launch some products like a temozolomide that are unique into the marketplace. But the other important reason, as we've stated publicly, we intend to use this for vertical integration as well as to have a credible threat that if we cannot get lower raw material prices from our suppliers, we could choose to make our own raw materials. And I think that's partially why you see us seeing some very significant operating margin improvements in our business, and getting to a record operating margin of 24.3% for the quarter, I think, goes back to some of the value that the API business has added to it. So yes, lumpy business, no doubt about it but still drives some significant synergistic value for us as a company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Annabel Samimy of Stifel.","Joshua Riegelhaupt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","This is Josh Riegelhaupt in for Annabel. To the extent that flu and the cough\/cold segment has kind of surprised to the downside, how much room do you guys think you have on the upside come the other seasonal products for flea and tick? And then also can you comment a bit on your operating margins? And since they seem to have expanded particularly in Nutritionals, how much more room you have just to continue that trend?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Well, I mean I guess, one of the things I always say on how we look at both the cough\/cold\/flu season and the flea and tick, which candidly is a -- relatively, we've only got one year flea and tick under our belt, so to speak. I would say we always try to look at what we think would be an average season. The tough part of the cough\/cold\/flu season this year is last year was just a really tough comp to compare with that it was a very early and very significant season. And that's really caused some of the decrease that Judy mentioned relative to our cough\/cold\/flu comp versus a year ago. On the question of flea and tick, really, we always have to try to put in an average year on things like flea and tick, on things like allergy season, on things like cough\/cold\/flu because you can't ever really know exactly what's going to happen. We look at the community levels of things that help drive something like the flea and tick season, but from a forecast point of view, what the way -- because we have things that go up [indiscernible] to go down, we always have to just put it on a probability weighting for all our products. And so I would just say that we'll continue to look at average seasons accounts for both allergy and flea and tick where there such unknown variables until we get to the seasons. On the question of the operating margins on Nutritionals side, we do like that business and what the team has done. They've worked around the clock to make sure that we continue to improve our operational efficiency as we went from a previously composite metal can to the new plastic container. So it's been just great work by the team. And I think we're just getting better and better, the efficiency that comes out of the business. So I probably don't want to say anything further on the operating margin. We kept the nutritional operating margin at that 12% to 16%, which was consistent with where we've been all year. I'll probably just leave it at that relative to where we expect to go. But I do think that opportunity is there with our infant formula business to continue to drive the top line based on gaining share and then continuing to look at what we'll do with the operating margin as if we get more efficient in the manufacturing process required for the plastic container.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Schott of JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Coming back to business development, I know your priority is to delever in the near term. But when we look at those larger transactions, the $1 billion-plus type of deals, in broad strokes, can you just talk about the priorities and focus there? And are those different from some of the adjacent category opportunities you've highlighted in the past? The second question, and sorry to come back to this tax issue. You guys keep getting questions here. If we've been previously modeling Perrigo with a 30%-or-so tax rate the first half of the year and something more in the range of 17% the second half of the year once Elan closed. With this accounting you're laying out today, should I be basically raising my second half tax rates into that 21%, 22% range, which might help explain some of this kind of big quarterly beat and more modest kind of guidance bump that we're getting with the annual numbers?","Arthur J. Shannon","Do you want me to grab the tax one first?","Joseph C. Papa","I'll do business development, then you do the tax. So on the business development side, there's really no significant changes in what we've said. We think we can do the smaller bolt-on transactions now and those would be the adjacent categories or the geographic opportunities. We're then looking at the larger transactions -- the opportunities would be the -- in terms of what targets we're after. It really is all the things we said before. It's what can we do in adult nutrition, what can we do in diabetes, what can we do in ophthalmics, and what can we do in pet care as the larger type of transactions from an adjacent category point of view are the ones that we are very interested in. So no specific major change with that. I would obviously have to add to what I just said that there are larger transactions geographically as well that we think would help our business and help bring our comps [ph] as a quality, affordable healthcare in a more global configuration. So same basic categories of looking at what we're trying to accomplish with adult nutritions, ophthalmics, diabetes and pet care type products is what we're looking at as well as geographic expansion. Judy, do you want us to take the second part of the question was really this question on tax.","Judy L. Brown","I love to talk about tax.","Joseph C. Papa","Good.","Judy L. Brown","As we talk about the way to think about the tax rate for the full year and all of our lead-up discussions since the announcement on July 29, it was always around and expected the first 12 months after the deal of being approximately 17% high teens. Now we get into the reality of our fiscal year and the closing of the transaction, which we had started to estimate, assume December 31 for easy modeling. One half of the year is at one rate. Second half of the year is at the other rate. And we said, \"You start to blend those out, we'll let you know, but it should be in the low 20s blended for the year.\" So here we are today. And this is just, again, the uniqueness of the requirements under U.S. GAAP. Because we closed in the month of December, we have to book in the quarter a blend for the full year. So you get caught up now in Q2. So that very low 14% rate in Q2 reflects this catching up. So as you're building your model for the period of January to June, you should now book an effective tax rate of approximately 21%, 22% because you've gotten caught up now. You're caught up. So the blend for the full year and how you should book the second half of the year should be 21%, 22%, as we've guided in the document that you see on the WebEx. So that's the rate that you should have in the second half of the year model because that's what we'll have in our second half of the year model because we did the catch-up in fiscal second quarter. And just also, as you're doing your model, I'm going to come back to shares for a second. Same concept. Think of it this way. On the face of the income statements, you have shares today outstanding. On December 28, 98.7 million weighted average shares first half. Second half, 134 million shares will be outstanding in the second half of the year. I made -- we made the comment on WebEx that the blend for the full year, weighted average shares for the 12 months is 116 million shares. But again, smaller amount in first half, 134 million in the second half. So make sure that if you're laying out your models that you reflect actual shares outstanding in those 2 quarters remaining will be north of 134 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Linda Weiser of B. Riley.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","Just a question on the Nutritionals segment and the increase in your guidance. And you start to get up against your harder comps in the next quarter, in the fiscal third quarter. You don't have the declines in the prior year. So I'm kind of wondering if we're going to see growth drop down much lower into the single digits and then how that kind of goes along with your increase in the guidance there? And then secondly, Prestige Brands this morning reported in the branded OTC space, and they're having similar issues as you with J&J's return and inventory reductions by retailers as well. They said there was a 4 percentage point gap for them year-to-date in their fiscal year through 3 quarters between sell-in and sell-through. Can you comment on, like, the magnitude for you of the difference between your shipments and the consumption and what that says about the level of retail inventory now?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. So let me get to the first part of your question on the Nutritional guidance. And I would say we certainly are aware of some of the changes in the numbers from last year and what that means from our comp. So relative to where the Nutritional business is at being up 14.6% in the second quarter and -- but we're suggesting our guidance for the full year being that 10% to 14% range. So by definition, that would mean that we know we expect that the percentage gains off of last -- second half of last year are going to be less. So we acknowledge that comment, Linda, relative to what's happening. But I always step back from any individual quarter and say, \"What's happening with the mega trends?\" And I continue to believe that more and more consumers are moving from national brand product to the store brand private label. And that's evidenced by what we're seeing in terms of the gain in the basis points in terms of market share gains for our infant formula. I think that's what's the most exciting part of what we are seeing out in the marketplace is more and more consumers using the store brand private label product versus national brand, albeit still only at 12-plus percent, but still growth for the future there. On the second part of the question, we did make mention in this call about what's happening with the specific inventory positions. So we do look at that. We look at it a little differently than what you talked about the other company doing. What we look at is days sales on hand, so we understand what's happening out there. There is -- has been some slight reductions. This is just really a normal pattern as we see at the end of customers' fiscal year changes. So there is some reductions going on. We don't see anything as a continuing trend there, but it is something we keep a close eye on relative to where that's going to go in our expectation. There is no doubt that the supply chain efficiency that has occurred between Perrigo and some of our large retailers has gotten more efficient all the time. It's good for the retailer. It's good for Perrigo, albeit there is some end-quarter results. But on balance, we think that's a good thing to happen as we get more efficient with our large customers. So I don't really -- probably wouldn't say any more of that in terms of that specific gap. We -- our primary method of tracking this what we would refer to as days sales on hand, and we're looking at that and continuing to monitor it. And there's really I don't think any real surprises there.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Elliot Wilbur of Needham & Company.","Elliot Wilbur - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just real quickly for Judy, I know it's not as exciting a topic as taxes, but maybe just walk us through the current components of the debt side of the capital structure and what we should be thinking about on an annualized basis going forward in terms of interest expense? And just for you, Joe, very strong sequential performance, obviously, in Rx generics, and that's certainly an organic growth number. Can't really think of specific items that would've accounted for that. Maybe you could talk a little bit about that in more detail. Maybe it's just the difference between approval timing and actual launches, but just a little bit more color there would be helpful.","Joseph C. Papa","Judy, why don't you just take the debt part...","Judy L. Brown","Sure. Your 10-Q is going to be coming out in the next hour or so. And as always, there'll be the extremely detailed footnotes that will walk you through the components of that down to the basis point for interest rates that's high level. We now have outstanding $1 billion of term loans. And so those are at very attractive interest rates tied to LIBOR. We then have senior notes. As you know, the remainder of the capital structure is made up of public debt, so we have notes that are due in 2016 that are 1.3%. We have $0.5 billion of 1.3% notes. We have another $600 million of 2.3% notes, $797 million of 4% notes and just shy of $400 million in 5.3% notes. So round numbers, you're looking at interest expense annually, on an annualized basis, give or take, $95 million. So while we have more debt outstanding on the balance sheet than we did pre-transaction, given the success of our public debt offering, net-net, the weighted average cost of debt is lower and the interest rate expense dollar basis is only slightly above where it had been in previous years. So hopefully, that's helpful. If you didn't catch it all, just wait for your Q to come out. It's about Page 21 when you get your Q up.","Joseph C. Papa","So the second part of your question was the strong performance of the -- our Perrigo generic Rx business. And I would agree that anytime we came to generate a 50-plus percent increase in revenue and approximately almost a 50% operating margin for that business, that's a good result. And I think it really comes from a couple of factors. It's very same -- similar to what I've said in the past. It's being first with new products. We've got a unique set of assets where we are going after the products that I referred to as extended topicals, products that absorb topically both dermatology, respiratory, nasal, ophthalmic-type products and those are things that we're focusing on. We have had the ability to be out there first. And I remind you that, that 50-plus percent growth occurred in a timeframe when even before we launched the Vanos product that did not actually launch until January. So new product has clearly been an important driver. The second part of what we've done is to make sure that we continue with our products to be the last company to exit the market with the products as well. So first in with new products and the last one still making the products. We've got a very wide range of generic dermatology products. We're the last player there still making them or the second to the last player still there. And the reality is that, that also generates some significant opportunity for those particular products in our category. So get there first and stay there for a long time. It's really the simple structure that we have in our Rx product portfolio. And I clearly have to add before I conclude this comment, just great execution by the generic Rx team from everything, every facet of product selection, the selling efforts, the marketing efforts, all the things that go into making a great business unit. Our team has continued to perform incredibly well, and I'm very proud of the results they have accomplished.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Buck of Buckingham Research.","David G. Buck - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","First, on the Nasacort OTC opportunity for generics. Can you talk about what the swing might be from? I believe you have that still as in Rx products. So is this something that's actually incremental? Or it's just basically switching from the Rx channel with some pipeline fill potentially? I know you talked about the difficulties in getting it to the channel, but it seems like there may be a loss in the March quarter of sales there. And secondly, for Judy, the contract manufacturing issue analgesics, you called out another $46 million revenue hit, which was most of the shortfall in Consumer Health versus our model. I guess, why didn't we know about the contract manufacturing issue last quarter? I believe it may be J&J who actually took it back in-house, but the cough\/cold issue comps. I think knew about analgesic competition. With the contract manufacturing, I'm surprised we didn't hear a commentary about that last quarter.","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. First, let me start in Nasacort, and then Judy can address the contract manufacturing question that David asked. So and if I -- I think I said some of the things that we're going to be able to say on Nasacort is it's great that the product's approved. It's great the product launched. It appears Sanofi's spending behind it. Our -- we have the product with a partner. Our partner is Teva, as we've stated publicly. We still need to work on a number of issues with our partner. Over time though, I do expect the product to be consolidated into the OTC channel because once the product switches from prescription to OTC, often it gets consolidated into the OTC channel. There are still some questions about the exact timing on that issue relative to the actual label and things that we've previously discussed. But there is a number of issues that we are still working our way through on this Nasacort question. And probably I'm going to stop, David, with that as my comment there. But importantly, it really opens up a category of nasal inhalers that we think are really exciting for things like Flonase, Astepro and Nasonex, things like that, that could mean things for the future. Judy?","Judy L. Brown","Yes, sure [indiscernible]. So good question. Our \"contract,\" we call it -- I'm using air quotes -- our contract business is, actually -- think about it as a channel. So we always talk in our disclosures in detail about sales by product category. You'll see it broken down in the 10-K by product category. And included in that is \"contract.\" So it's a channel online selling or rights selling to retailer A, B and C. We have customers for whom we do contract manufacturing of the full basket of certain product categories. That being said, we are also involved in confidential relationships with them and are not at liberty to get into individual sales to individual customers in that contract channel for confidentiality reasons, just like we don't give you sales by specific store retailers either -- brick-and-mortar store retailers. So what does this mean? Why did we not give you an indication of the movement in that channel? Because frankly, those sales are very dependent also on the needs of those customers on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We stand ready to be flexible and provide them products on an as-needed basis as we do for our retail customers. So it is not always -- we can't go through VMI inventory like we can for our retailers and see what's on the shelf in different stores. We take those orders and process them quickly to service our contract customers. And we, ourselves, don't always have a clear line of sight on a quarter-by-quarter basis on what the demands are going to be. So those contract customers are seeing their own dynamics from a competitive landscape change on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Their orders [indiscernible] will change as well. So that is -- we try to always make sure we tell you what's going on in contract, even though it is a channel, and we comment every quarter in the MD&A on those pieces.","Joseph C. Papa","Yes, maybe I'd add, David, is that, obviously, our contract customers are also experiencing a weak cough\/cold\/flu season as well. I mean, that's to building...","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Tim Chiang of CRT.","Timothy Chiang - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Joe, I didn't want to finish the call with a Tysabri question, but, I guess I might as well. Assuming you keep Tysabri, your tax rate is going to stay in this high-tax or high-teens rate. But in the case that you divested Tysabri, would that have any impact on your going-forward cash tax rate?","Joseph C. Papa","Sure. Well, the answer is yes. Going back to the commentary, we like Tysabri, as I stated. But if Tysabri is at a 1% tax rate, so all things being considered, if you take an asset that has a 1% tax rate out of the mix effectively, the weighted average tax rate would go up. There's no question about that. But I don't want to get ahead of ourselves there on that particular question. If anything comes about there, we'll obviously have a lot to say -- more to say about it. For right now, we really like the Tysabri asset for all the reasons that I've said. It's a good asset and a great category of MS. We've got a great partner with Biogen. It's got an escalating royalty, and we do think it has a very long life as a product category. So for those reasons, I'll probably stop there. But the answer is that if we sold part of that or monetize part of that, it would have an effect on our tax rate.","Timothy Chiang - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","And Joe, I just had one follow-up, maybe it's for Nancy. The D5 R&D spend, I know you guys included it in your guidance. Is that more front-end-loaded to the back half of your fiscal year in '14 than fiscal '15?","Joseph C. Papa","The D5 spend, as we have currently laid it out in our expectations, would be for the full calendar year 2014. So it would be through the calendar year. Obviously, that means both in our fiscal year '14 through June 30, and then obviously, the 6 months going into the start of fiscal year '15. So it would be for a full calendar year 2014 as it currently is envisioned.","Let me conclude with that and just make a general comment then. First of all, thank you very much in your interest in Perrigo. It really was -- it was a great quarter. Great execution across the business. I mean, if you think about -- we sometimes forget that we're still making over 45 billion tablets -- doses per year, closing Elan transaction. It takes a great team of people to get the great results that we did achieve during the quarter. And I just like to say thank you for the -- to the entire team for the all the great results that occurred. Thank you very much for your interest in Perrigo.

I'm pleased to share with you Perrigo's strong second quarter performance and results, driven by sound execution of our differentiated business model and the reasons why we have raised our guidance today.","Turning to Slide 5. You can see the margin trends in our businesses for the last 12 months. This is a direct result of our continued focus on operational excellence and being action oriented. These principles have driven our business results and fostered sustainable margin performance and consistent operating cash flow. Slide 5 shows the durability of our business model, which includes our consumer facing businesses that comprise approximately 80% of our net sales.","In CHC Americas, adjusted operating margins remain strong at over 20% for six quarters in a row. Consumer acceptance of store brand products continues to increase. And our new product pipeline continues to deliver additional growth.","In CHC International, our operating margin profile has increased from the low to mid-teens, as evidenced by this quarter's adjusted operating margin of approximately 15%. The team's concentration on our OTC portfolio, continued execution of product insourcing, and disciplined ROI based approach to advertising and promotion have resulted in the second consecutive quarter of meaningful year over year operating margin improvement. I remain excited about prospects for this business.","In RX, the adjusted operating margin has consistently remained above 40% as a result of our differentiated extended topical strategy and a dynamic pricing environment. The RX team's focused execution drove sell through of higher margin products in the second quarter and improved the timing of new product launches, both of which helped the business achieve an adjusted operating margin of approximately 47%.","Overall, our business remains well positioned to benefit from the fact that consumers and healthcare systems around the world continue to search for more affordable alternatives for their healthcare needs. Healthcare costs continue to be a focus around the globe. And Perrigo's ability to provide quality, affordable healthcare products makes us a key part of that healthcare cost solution.","Turning to Slide 6. New products are the growth engine for Perrigo. As is our practice, we risk adjust all potential new product launches in our guidance. Given the earlier than anticipated launches, particularly within the RX business, we are now upgrading our 2017 new product guidance to greater than $225 million, up from our previous guidance of more than $200 million. We continue to expect to launch almost two products per week across all of our businesses, including the anticipated store brand launch of Nexium in the second half of this year.","Turning to Slide 7. I'd like to provide some highlights on the quarter. Our focus on operational execution has produced several positive results across our businesses.","As one, CHC Americas adjusted net sales grew 3% versus the prior year, and store brands again gained share versus national brands. Over the last 12 months CHC Americas adjusted net sales also grew approximately 3%, which is in line with our long term growth framework of 2% to 4%.","Second, CHC International constant currency net sales grew a solid 4%, excluding the $39 million in the prior year from the exited unprofitable European distribution businesses.","And third, the RX team executed extremely well and delivered solid results this quarter by leveraging our extended topical portfolio and driving our long-term strategy.","Additionally, we continue to take actions to enhance the value for our owners, as we largely completed the cost improvement initiatives announced in February this year and remain on track to meet our run rate goal of greater than $130 million of savings by the middle of 2018.","Second, with the completion of $2.2 billion of debt pay down in the second quarter, we have created greater optionality and flexibility to use our strengthened balance sheet, as evidenced by the repurchase of $58 million of shares in the second quarter.","And three, this morning we announced the sale of our Israel API and Russian businesses. These transactions exemplify the strategy of simplifying our core offerings and focusing on long term value and profitability.","These actions, along with this quarter's strong business performance and enhanced visibility for the remainder of the year, have led us to increase and raise our 2017 guidance, which Ron will cover in more detail. Ron?","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Great. Thanks, John. Before walking through my detailed comments for each of our businesses, I would like to take a minute to reflect on our performance results for the quarter. I characterize our performance for the past three months as converting opportunities into bottom line results. Each of our businesses with a keen focus on execution, action, and capitalizing on opportunities turned in strong performance results for the quarter.","Now let's turn to Slide 9, where you can see our GAAP reported results for the second quarter. Let me walk you through the primary adjustments, which are included in the appendix of this presentation, that reconcile our GAAP financial statements to our adjusted performance results.","Adjusted non-GAAP results exclude $135 million of debt extinguishment fees related to our debt pay down strategy that was executed the second quarter, $89 million of non-cash amortization expense, $39 million related to the fair market value adjustment on the contingent consideration payments for Tysabri, and $27 million of impairment charges primarily related to certain definite live intangible assets in our RX segment.","GAAP tax expense as a percent of pre-tax income was 0.5% in the quarter, compared to a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20.9%. The difference primarily is due to the tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments and the effect of deferred tax assets and liabilities consistent with the adjusted pre-tax income.","Now, I will discuss the strong performance results for each of our segments. Turning to CHC Americas results on Slide 10, you can see that segment net sales in the quarter were $605 million, compared to adjusted net sales of $588 million in the prior year, an increase of 3% year over year on a constant currency basis. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales in the smoking cessation and dermatologic categories and stronger performance in our Mexico business compared to the prior year. New product sales in the quarter were $13 million, primarily driven by the store brand launch of Flonase, which annualized during the quarter, in addition to the launch of new nicotine replacement gum products.","Offsetting these benefits were lower sales primarily in the animal health, analgesics, and cough\/cold categories compared to the prior year.","Including the 3% net sales growth this quarter, CHC Americas has now realized a 3% net sales growth over the last 12 months, which is directly within our long term growth framework of 2% to 4%. The fundamentals in that business remain strong, led by our team's focus on new products, customer channel opportunities, and increase in consumer acceptance of store brand products.","For the quarter adjusted gross margin was 35.7%. As a reminder, last year this segment realized record adjusted gross margin due to the sell through of higher margin products. Current year adjusted gross margin includes the effect of year-over-year price erosion in certain categories, partially offset by positive contributions from supply chain and manufacturing efficiencies.","CHC Americas adjusted operating margin was 20% for the sixth consecutive quarter in a row, illustrating the durability of this business.","Turning now to Slide 11, you can see that net sales in the CHC International segment were $377 million. Net sales grew approximately 4%, excluding $39 million from the exited European distribution businesses and unfavorable foreign currency movement of $16 million. This increase was led by new product sales of $19 million and higher net sales in the allergy, analgesic, and cough\/cold categories. The CHCI team delivered strong sales during the relatively higher cold, cough, and allergy season compared to the prior year.","Adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 51.7%, a 230 basis point improvement over the prior year, primarily due to the cancellation of the distribution businesses. The segment also benefited from our strategy to insource more production of our branded OTC products. Offsetting these benefits were unfavorable effects from currency movements and lower margin in our UK store brand business.","Adjusted operating margin of 14.6% was driven primarily by gross margin flow through, combined with the benefits realized from our cost optimization program. Year-over-year adjusted operating margin improvement included higher advertising and promotional expenses as a percentage of net sales.","Overall, the CHC International segment realized strong performance in the quarter, as the team continued to actively integrate sales strategies with promotional programs, which are yielding positive results, as evidenced by the net sales growth in the quarter and the upward shift in adjusted operating margin to the low to mid-teens.","Turning now to RX on Slide 12, excluding the $26 million year-over-year impact of Entocort, net sales in this segment were lowered by approximately 4%. Sales volume growth in the quarter of 4% and new product sales of $6 million, driven by the launch of three new products late in the quarter, were offset by price erosion, which was in line with our expectations.","Adjusted gross margin was 58.8% or 200 basis points higher than in prior year, as a favorable product mix and a reduced level of floor stock adjustments compared to the prior year offset the effect of Entocort competition and year-over-year price erosion.","Adjusted operating margin for the segment was 46.5%, 370 basis points higher than the same quarter last year, primarily due to the strong gross margin performance in the quarter, the restructuring of the specialty pharma sales force, and timing of R&D investments.","Perhaps most impressive, adjusted operating income grew by 21% or $19 million excluding the effect of Entocort. The benefits of our diversified extended topical portfolio were realized this quarter with the sell through of higher margin products, yet again another example of converting opportunities to bottom line results. This was a great quarter for the RX team.","Now turning to Slide 13, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet. As of July 1, 2017, total cash on the balance sheet was $761 million and total debt outstanding of approximately $3.7 billion. This reflects the actions we took to significantly strengthen our balance sheet during the quarter by successfully executing on our debt pay down strategy, utilizing the proceeds from the sale of Tysabri. In total year to date, we have reduced debt by approximately $2.2 billion or nearly 40% of our total debt outstanding at the beginning of the year.","Further, as discussed in our previous calls, we intend to repay approximately $370 million of our remaining 2017 maturities from operating cash flow or cash on our balance sheet. These combined actions result in an estimated total debt pay down of $2.6 billion by the end of the year.","In addition, actions taken during 2017 have reduced our debt maturities over the next several years. The total remaining debt maturities for 2018, 2019 and 2020 are approximately $500 million. Our debt pay down actions have increased our financial flexibility, enabling the majority of future free cash flows to be available for strategic purposes and\/or returning capital to shareholders.","Our financial policy of operating within an investment grade credit profile remains steadfast. Within this framework, we will deploy a disciplined balanced capital allocation strategy to drive total shareholder returns. In the second quarter, we completed $58 million of share repurchases and we will continue to evaluate market dynamics against the fundamental value of Perrigo relative to other investment choices. In short, our capital allocation decisions are always focused on total shareholder returns within the context of our investment grade financial policy.","Turning now to operating cash flow, in the first six months of the year we generated $285 million of cash from operations. As a reminder, the $285 million includes two unique items totaling $105 million, an unusual tax payment for $74 million and cash restructuring payments of approximately $31 million. Our team continues to focus on cash flow generation, and we expect the strength of our business model to convert 100% of adjusted net income to cash. Operating cash flow conversion as a percentage to adjusted net income for the first half of the year was 120% excluding these two unique items.","Shifting now to discuss the remainder of 2017, on Slide 14 you can see the bridge that walks our adjusted EPS guidance, provided on May 23, to the increase in adjusted EPS guidance provided this morning. There are three primary drivers of this raise in guidance that I would like to discuss.","First, given our strong execution across our segments in the second quarter, we are raising our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance by approximately $0.20 per share. Specifically, within RX, performance of new product launches are expected to exceed our previous forecast. And as John previously mentioned, we have updated our new product guidance by approximately $25 million. Within CHCI, due to the strong execution in the second quarter and favorable currency movements compared to the forecast provided May 23, we are increasing our sales forecast in this segment by $50 million.","Second, we are already benefiting from our strategy of strengthening our balance sheet. Our forecasted 2017 interest expense is approximately 25% below the prior year. And we used our strong cash flow position to repurchase $58 million or approximately 812,000 shares in the quarter, which represents a benefit of approximately $0.03 per share in 2017. These completed share repurchases are reflected in our 2017 share count guidance of 143 million shares.","And third, this morning we announced the sale of the Israeli API and CHCI Russia businesses. Our portfolio review process led us to the conclusion that these businesses will better thrive under new management that will dedicate the resources needed to grow their platforms. We expect to close the API transaction in the second half of 2017. Consistent with our historical practices, we are removing forecasted second half adjusted operating income of $10 million, or $0.05 per share, from our guidance.","As a result of these combined factors, we are raising our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to $4.45 to $4.70 per share, a $0.25 midpoint improvement from the previous range. Our continued emphasis on operational excellence, actions to focus and simplify our business model, building balance sheet flexibility, and driving our new product pipeline continue to strengthen our performance outlook.","On Slide 15, you can see our 2017 segment guidance, which has been updated to reflect our stronger than expected first half performance across all of our segments. Walking down the slide, you can see that in CHC Americas, we continue to expect approximately $2.4 billion in net sales and adjusted operating margin in the low 20% range.","In CHC International, we have increased our expected net sales guidance by approximately $50 million to approximately $1.45 billion due to the execution of our forecasted sales strategies combined with favorable currency movements compared to our previous guidance. We continue to expect an adjusted operating margin in the low to mid-teens for this segment.","In RX, we have increased our expected net sales guidance to approximately $950 million due to earlier than expected launch of new products. Strong second quarter performance has led us to increase our adjusted operating margin expectations from the high 30% range to slightly greater than 40% for the year.","I would like to provide a few modeling assumptions for the second half of the year. As a reminder, in CHC Americas we are including the store brand launch of Nexium in the second half of 2017. Our CHC International segment delivered stronger than expected net sales in the first half of 2017, primarily due to relatively stronger cough\/cold allergy season. Other than the effects of foreign currency movement, our second half sales forecast for this segment is unchanged from our previous guidance.","In the RX segment, as previously mentioned, second quarter R&D investments were lower due to the timing of clinical trial spending. In the first half of 2017, R&D in this segment as a percent of net sales averaged approximately 5%. In the second half of 2017, we expect R&D in this segment to increase to approximately 7% of net sales. Finally, in the RX segment, our year-over-year price erosion assumption remains at 9% to 11%.","On Slide 16, you can see our consolidated 2017 guidance metrics updated to reflect the factors I just discussed. We've increased our full year net sales guidance range to approximately $4.7 billion to $4.85 billion, which reflects improved visibility within our business and, mathematically, a midpoint upgrade of approximately $75 million.","Adjusted operating income guidance has been upgraded to $960 million to $1 billion to reflect the flow through of new product launches and operational improvements. As I stated earlier, our guidance now excludes approximately $10 million of adjusted operating income contribution from the Israel API business in the second half of 2017. Our interest expense guidance has been updated to reflect the added savings driven by the favorable execution of our recently completed tender. You can also see that our expected tax rate for the year has been updated to reflect an improvement of approximately 100 basis points.","Regarding operational cash flow, as you likely recall, our original 2017 guidance back in February was to achieve greater than $550 million. On April 25 we increased this guidance to greater than $575 million. Consistent with our earnings guidance upgrade today, we have also increased our operating cash flow guidance to approximately $600 million. As a reminder, this number includes $74 million tax payment and total estimated cash restructuring payments of $60 million for year. When accounting for these two items, our 2017 operating cash flow conversion is forecasted to be over 100% to adjusted net income.","Before turning the call back to John, I would like to congratulate the Perrigo team for the strong performance result. It's exciting to see the CHC Americas team deliver 3% LTM growth with sustained 20% adjusted operating margin. Our CHC International team has shifted the baseline in this business to low to mid-teens adjusted operating margin. And as mentioned, the RX team had a great quarter and continues to deliver our focused extended topical strategy, which led to results above our expectations. These fundamentals, combined with a strength balance sheet, build a foundation for Perrigo to drive our strategic growth initiatives and quality affordable healthcare. I will now turn the call back to John.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you, Ron. As you can see on Slide 18, store brand growth continues to outpace national brand growth in almost every major category. This is really driven by continued consumer acceptance of store brand products and the launch of store brand products in categories where national brands previously held exclusive share. Over the past three months the growth of store brand is particularly prominent in the cough, cold, allergy, and sinus category, which is driven by store brand Fluticasone among other products. In addition, new products are continuing to drive growth in the smoking cessation categories.","Let me touch briefly on e-commerce. The strength of our business model, the diversity of our product portfolio, and the ability to provide an end-to-end solution make us a natural partner in this important and growing channel. As an example of this, our investments in digital marketing and promotions create a more efficient medium to educate consumers on the benefit of store branded products. And I believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this channel, partnering with all of our customers.","Turning to Slide 19, I remain excited about our CHC International business, as I have been over the last couple of years. We have now produced meaningful margin improvements over the past two quarters, as we continue to focus on our OTC branded portfolio. The team is continuing to invest in innovative new products and line extensions that will leverage our well-known brands and remain dedicated to ROI based advertising and promotion investments to drive our unique product portfolio. This segment is on a path to long term margin expansion, led by these growth initiatives, combined with our focus on operational improvement.","On Slide 20, you can see our updated RX pipeline metrics. We are continuing to execute to manage this business for the long term. To date in 2017 we have launched five new products. And we expect our product pipeline to drive growth in this segment in 2018. Also on this slide you can see the market side of additional opportunities that remain for this business. The RX team is continuing to develop and bring to market difficult to manufacturer extended topical products across these categories.","In closing, on Slide 21, we did perform well against our first half in 2017, with all segments outperforming our expectation. And the team remains focused on achieving our updated full year 2017 plan. We have set the foundation for a strong future. Our product pipeline, channel, and customer opportunities position us well for growth. Our cost savings initiatives have created a more efficient organization, allowing us to capture a greater contribution from every product that we launch. And our enhanced balance sheet flexibility create optionality for driving total shareholder returns.","Before turning the call over for Q&A, I'd like to briefly comment on my pending retirement. I want to reiterate my confidence in the strength of Perrigo's unique business model and our leadership team. We have executed against the key initiatives and are better positioned for long term success. The board is working diligently in its search process to identify the next CEO. And I'm excited by the level of interest received from many high quality candidates. Given the ongoing search process, we will not plan to hold an Analyst Day until a new CEO is on boarded. In the meantime, Ron and I will remain fully committed and excited to continue our open dialogue with all of our investors.","I'm very proud of all that we have done to focus our business over the last five quarters. We've made many tough decisions during this time, but I believe the actions we've taken will enhance our long term shareholder value for our investors, while providing quality affordable healthcare options for customers, consumers, and families across the globe. Thank you very much. Brad?","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, John. Operator, we'd now like to open the call for questions. We ask that all participants please limit yourself to one question only.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Annabel Samimy with Stifel.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a good quarter.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So now that things seem somewhat stable and you have \u2013 with the sale of Tysabri you have some good balance sheet flexibility, are you starting to consider some new strategic initiatives, some bolt-on acquisitions to bolster sustainability of growth in some of these franchises? And I guess that was my one question. Thanks.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, thank you, Annabel. Appreciate it. So I would say, yes, we feel like we've got \u2013 are in a good position with all of our businesses, operating on a good platform. And our balance sheet does give us that optionality. I think we are very open to enhancing those business platforms through bolt-on acquisitions, other parts that would enhance those businesses, as well as using our balance sheet for other ways of returning capital potentially to shareholders.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I guess to that point, what areas do you think would be most suitable for that bolt-on? And what areas do you think still require some expansion, let's just say?","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, so I think I feel very good about all of our business segments and the actions that we've taken I would say over the last year or so to make sure that we have a foundational solid structure under them. I think our CHC Americas business, our CHC International, and even specific products that might fit within our RX business are clearly fair game for bolt-on acquisitions.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Great. Thank you very much, Annabel.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Annabel.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS Investment (sic) [UBS Securities].","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, I was hoping you could just come back to the overseas consumer business, which seems to just be turning much quicker than we would have thought. If you could just give us \u2013 talk about the top line a little bit? And where \u2013 I mean was there a lot of strength in any particular geographies? Were there new launches that did really well and that gives you the confidence that those new products are going to continue to do well throughout the year? Just give us a sense of what's going on there, because clearly it's turning quicker than we thought.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, and I'd say if I step back, Marc, we're still on what I consider to be a broader strategy of enhancing that business. So if I can step back a minute on you.","It was sort of making sure that we had the right business structure. So we got out of some things that didn't make sense. We've spent a fair amount of time sort of massaging our portfolio to make sure it was the right value add. We started, back when, doing a number of things to enhance our margin profiles, insourcing products into our site from a global perspective.","We still have a ways to go on those things. We've taken good action. We can see the results. But as I said on previously calls, this isn't a next three-month thing. This will continue to evolve over the next couple years as we continue to enhance the margin.","I think the growth if you look at the quarter was a strong cost hold execution within those regions. There were a fair number of regions that did execute well against the products and provided strong growth. When we look forward, if I look into what continues to drive it, we continue to put the right advertising and promotion against those core categories and businesses for us and drive those, as opposed to peanut butter spreading our A&P. So the team is doing a good job of saying, these are key items to drive. How do we make sure that we're dedicating our investment dollars against those key return areas? And that has paid dividends. Ron, do you have anything else to add to that some?","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","No. No, it's very, very well said. And I don't really have much to add. I mean if you look at the models and guidance we've given to you, we had the 4% growth in Q2. You will see growth in the second half the year. I think you've seen those models that are out there. Hopefully you've seen that. But we are expecting the growth trend and momentum to continue against the base from last year. So we're pretty excited about the future of this business.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Great. Thanks, Marc.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Marc.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Morning, David.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning and congrats on the results. I just wanted to ask a high level question about the sustainability of operating margins in the U.S. consumer healthcare and the RX business. It seems like you're guiding for margins to expand in 2018 because of cost efficiency initiatives that will continue to benefit the margins. But since the two segments are close to all-time highs, how should we think about the sustainability of those margins longer term, as more competitors compete in those areas?","And then I know that you asked for only one question. But could you just comment on the second half guidance? When we subtract the beat, the second half guidance is in line with consensus. If you could just comment on that. Thanks.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Great. Thanks, David. And like all good people, you kind of carved those questions together, so I thought that was good. Let me kind of take them separately.","So first of all, on the sort of how do we think about sustainability of margins and those kinds of things. I would say it is driven by a few different things. In both the consumer side as well as the RX side within the U.S., one is you got to keep launching products. Right? You got to keep the pipeline fruition, you've got to keep adding, especially on the consumer side, new line extensions.","It is a business that needs to you feed it and continue to grow that. And that is part of the margin sustainability platform. The costs do play in there. We need to continue to be one of the best, most cost efficient players out there, so that we can make sure that those all flow to the bottom and drive that.","In both businesses, even in the model we laid out for our consumer side as well as RX, we have planned in price erosion. So if you said \u2013 if you look at the back half of the year or continue for the whole year in RX to talk about 9% to 11% core business erosion, we still have price erosion in the consumer side, as we laid out in our 2% to 4% normal guidance. That means our volume is growing faster than that in consumer, but some of it does get offset by that.","So we've included in what we think is a competitive environment and a competitive pricing environment. At the same time between new products, between share gain, between launching our cost efficiencies, we feel we can continue to grow over and above what we're seeing from a pricing competitive standpoint.","Ron, do you want to take the second half question?","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. Yeah, it's a tough question, John. So when we started the year, you go all the way back to February now, one of the things we communicated was the back end plans. If you can look at the modeling construction. And we were kind of guiding to \u2013 we didn't give quarterly guidance, but we said, clearly, it's going to be a lower first half versus second half. So what the scene that's now kind of moved forward is we've taken advantage with the strategies we've put in place. Again, John talk through those very well. Our diversified portfolio pulled through great margin products in Q2, and we've capitalized on that.","John talked about aligning sales strategies with promotional activities in CHCI. The reason we capitalized on things like the strong cough cold season in Q2 and even Q1 is because of those foundations that were set.","So if you look at model now, to your point, we're more balanced. That's great. So we've derisked, I'll call it, the year. We've upgraded guidance. But we're sitting now about, let's call it, 49% H1 at an EPS level if you use the midpoint as the kind of balance for our framework, 51% then H2.","So we're excited, yet we're also pragmatic. Right? We want to make sure we're prudent in our approach going forward. If you look at the business segments and let's think about what are you seeing in the lens of the H2 kind of model? So first of all, CHC Americas are seeing clear growth, clear operating leverage. Why? Nexium, right? So we have a great new product. Launch is coming through in H2.","In RX we tried to make sure we're very open about what's happening in RX. You have again pricing. We're still modeling that 9% to 11%, so pragmatic. We kind of call it the unknown's unknowns. We're trying to make sure we take a risk based approach. I think that seems to work right. For the last four quarters we've kind of met our expectations on pricing.","R&D has shifted a little bit. We had some clinical trials. So if you model out, you're going to see again around 5% of R&D percent to net sales in RX in the first half, 7% in the second half. So you've got some margin. Obviously lower margins because of that in H2. But when you look at the RX volume in H2, it's strong. So take a look at that as you model out your performance.","And H1, listen \u2013 or CHC, listen, again as I commented earlier, that 4% growth you saw in Q2, you look at the models. We may not have changed guidance, but you'll still see that 4% growth in H2. So that carries \u2013 that momentum carries into the year. But we're not changing the modeling guidance, because we're sticking on that 4% OTC growth, excluding things like currency and the distribution businesses.","So through that lens, again, very excited about H2, but also pragmatic in how we're trying to look at the business in the second half of the year.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Great. Thanks, David.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, David.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Hi, Jami.","Candace Richardson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, this is Candace Richardson on behalf of Jami Rubin. Given data points across the industry call for further worsening of generic margins and competitors with similar dermatology portfolios are seeing worsening results, can you just speak to how confident you are that you can sustain operating margins in the 40% range?","And then, related to that, many of your peers are also expecting accelerating price erosion going forward. Can you speak to why you're confident you still see stable erosion for the rest of the year? What differentiates your portfolio? Thank you.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, thank you. I will give my perspective; also, going to ask Ron to jump in on this, also. I think we had to look very hard at our process. If I go back six quarters ago, five quarters ago, very hard in our process of what we were looking at from a pricing standpoint, how we went through our process. Many of you remember those calls where we talked about deep dive into what we know, what we think we know, and then what we don't know and how we balance all of those things. And I will say that over that period, we gained confidence in our process as far as how we work through those and what we know.","And so, we feel like the last four quarters or so, we've been able to be in the ballpark of predicting what we thought we would see. And our models have proved out. It doesn't mean we know every piece, because we do plug in some unknown variability.","But using that process, using our broader looks with our portfolio seems to be playing out and giving us some decent visibility into what's there. So look, I don't \u2013 9% to 11% is still a big price erosion on base. So we are not forecasting that it's going to get any easier at this point. We're saying there's still a big number in there. We feel good about our process of doing it, and we feel good about our new product pipeline, getting those launched now and what we see going forward to offset that.","Ron, you have anything to add to that?","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, the only thing I'd add to support it is kind of \u2013 is our diversified portfolio. And we talked about this a great deal, and we want to keep that. Where we think we are different is we don't have any product greater than 5% of any \u2013 of the sales distribution within RX. I mean, let's talk case studies. I think that's the best way to think about it. And we have a product family that requires nine clinicals to attack that product. And each of those clinicals are topical, each of those clinicals are expensive, and each of the manufacturing value streams are complicated.","So look, not every product ends up seeing competitive landscape. But that's an example of where we can pull those products through. And John and his team did a great job in Q2. And this is an example of a product that sold through in Q2 with higher margins. We benefit from that. We bring that to the bottom line.","So again, you can look at our portfolio against others. Listen, obviously we're subject to the same competitive environment as anybody else, but that diversification is something that we think we benefit from. It's a good part of our extended topical strategy and why we can hold those margins within a tight, tight zone as we look at it at this point.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Ron.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you.","Candace Richardson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald","Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So the question I had here is how should we think about sales growth and margins for your store brand business over the longer term? Is there still meaningful growth left here for this business? And then, also, in terms of the pipeline, are there any RX OTC switches or larger products that you would highlight? Thank you.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, thanks, Louise. So I would stay with the same framework that I tried to give over the last couple quarters of how I think about it. And it hasn't changed. And frankly, it's come to \u2013 been reinforced, I think, by what we've been saying; which is, look, I believe our U.S. business \u2013 our U.S. consumer healthcare business can grow through a number of avenues. One is we have the acceptance of store brands. While we thought we hit a \u2013 you may have thought we hit a cliff, continues to grow.","So if you look at it, we continue to gain share in categories, store brand, consumer (40:38) a lot of good value. We understand the difference, now. I believe that kind of growth can continue. I believe bringing new products to market that we haven't been able to be in, the line extensions, all of those things that we do add growth to that. And frankly, the overall market had some growth.","And so, as I think of CHC Americas, we laid out a framework of in that 2% to 4%. It's higher than that from a volume standpoint, but we did add in some pricing to make sure to get to that 2% to 4%. In my mind, that's 1.5 times to 2 times market growth in the U.S. And I think that's the \u2013 what we should be held accountable for, frankly. That we should be able to grow this business at those kind of rates over the long run.","Consumer healthcare international, we had a couple of things going on. One was making sure that our infrastructure was right to support the growth of the business, that we had the right portfolio, that we had the right, I'll call it, cost of goods as well as operating expenses. We're still on that path, but making progress.","And then, I said the businesses, the brands we have, our ability to leverage those should have growth. In our mind, even in that segment, given the challenges we have, we should able to grow that at 1.5 times the market growth in those Europe countries. So without giving an exact number, I believe with the portfolio and the actions we're taking, we should be a faster grower within those segments than the markets that we compete in.","Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","And then, just on Nexium, can you comment whether or not you've included an additional competitor in your guidance for this year for that product?","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah. So I would say we've guided in the back half of the year for that. We do, in our kind of guidance, don't have us being alone in that when we think about the guidance in there. So it's risk adjusted, as we always do with new products, but we are not planning on being alone in that Nexium market.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Great. Thanks, Louise. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Great, thanks very much. Just a two part question on the RX business. First, just on these 2Q margins, I know you touched on some of these issues. But just to help us understand a little bit more about this strong margin performance, if we look at about a 500 basis point bump from 1Q to 2Q. Sounds like there wasn't a huge amount of new product flow necessarily in this quarter, as launches were late. I know R&D timing was light. And I'm just trying to understand a little bit more how we saw this type of sequential jump in margins.","And then the second question was on the same RX theme. I know you're still looking for down 9% to 11% the second half of this year. Any just preliminary looks as we think about 2018? Is that 9% to 11% a decent range to think about going forward? Or do you see a level of erosion starting to ease a bit as we start to think out to next year? Thank you.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Ron, why don't you cover the first part. And I'll give my perspective on the broader picture?","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, I know this sounds like a too simplified answer, but it's factually, to your point, sequentially what happened in the business. It is strong margin pull through. And again you'll have different distribution of margins based on customer mix within a product group. And John and his team did a great job kind of looking at where can the product be positioned with customer A versus customer B, or channel A versus channel B. And really that's the story.","There's not much more than really the business from the portfolio had opportunities with the strong margins. Of certain \u2013 again certain \u2013 a product that left competition, that pull through came through in Q2. You'll see in the modeling, we're not modeling 46% in Q3. So you'll see that we've normalized the portfolio from a margin standpoint going forward the second half of the year. And again it sounds simple, but it is that simple. Given diversified portfolio, the stratification of products that sold through were the higher margin products in the second quarter versus the sequential Q1.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Great. And I would say if you think about it, and we said this year as we looked at it, 9% to 11%, again we're continuing to stay with that and think that it falls within sort of the guidance we gave and what we're expecting. As I look forward, I do eventually expect the market to, I'll call it, more normalize. When I say normalize that still is a decline of kind of core, but in the 3% to 5% range if you look out a ways. Getting back to a more normalized space from what we've been experiencing.","At the same token when I look at 2018 \u2013 and we know I'm not giving you guidance or anything, because we don't have any of those out there \u2013 I don't see it softening quite yet. I don't see it tailing away as you'd want to see if it was going to drop to 3% to 5% soon. So I think we're going to continue to experience a tough pricing environment at least going forward here for a little while. I think ultimately it has to balance back down to a more normalized number, because the whole industry won't sustain at these kind of levels.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Morning.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","It becomes a little bit more difficult to let go of the RX business if you keep performing like this.","Going back to some of your earlier commentary on some of the specifics around price deflation, I guess those expectations aside. I mean clearly I think you've probably experienced heightened deflation earlier in the cycle than others, so maybe not so surprising that you continue to sort of maintain your expectation.","But I guess where a lot of other companies have been surprised or at least claimed to have been surprised, it just relates to the evolution of these consortium purchasing dynamics. And while perhaps that may have not played out in price, certainly seems to have played out in fairly significant negative volume impact for a lot of the players in this space.","So just kind of want to ask you a little bit \u2013 in a little bit more detail sort of how the evolution of these consortium dynamics has played out recently, particularly the Claris One. I'm not really sure, frankly, how important that combination is to your business historically. But just wondering if that's still something that is evolving and where you see potentially risk? Or you think we're sort of largely past that process with respect to your business? Thanks.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, thanks, Elliot. And I think what you said at the beginning of your question, I think is frankly, apropos of \u2013 we took a relatively big and strong look at this about a year ago. And we had to adjust our guidance way back then. We had to say, look, we're not at the same level. Here's where we're at based on what we see. And then going forward from there at a different process of saying where we're at.","And so I do think we took a big adjustment. We just took it a year ago, if you will, when we said, hey, this business isn't where we think. Here's where it's at. And then here's what we see going forward. And I think we were prudent at the time in doing that. And the data has played out at least so far to what we expected and saw.","When I talk about the 9% to 11%, without going into any agreement or anything specifically, as we look at it, that 9% to 11% in our minds includes those broader buying consortiums and new entrants into those, et cetera, includes that in that number.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thanks, Elliot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao with Barclays.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just if you could maybe help us in terms of the consumer business, I think you noted some softer results from the cough cold category. Could you maybe provide some update on the competitive dynamics? I know over the last couple years you've been affected by the re-entry of a large national brand. Is that still playing through in a little bit of a headwind?","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, Doug, thanks. Good question. I would say when it comes to those kind of things, where they had some other quality issues and things that kind of came back into the market, that is 95%, 98% through. I mean there's still some items out there that aren't stocked. I'm not sure if they're ever going to be stocked again, that there were \u2013 if that was one they discontinued. But it's mostly back out there, and they're operating on a more normalized plane from a national brand standpoint.","There were other products that were launched from a ANDA switch standpoint or those kinds of things that were not in the market. We've gotten out there with Fluticasone. Nexium is probably the other one where when you look at the PPI category, it's been three years without having a store brand equivalent to Nexium. We have the other PPIs in our portfolio but not that. So that's one that's a decent type category that once we get out there at least we'll be sort of more fully represented on the shelves. So on the national brands coming back, I'd say they're towards the end of that re-entrance.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then, just also in terms of the price erosion factor is that \u2013 in CHCA is that pretty much across the board? Or are there particular categories where competition has been a little bit \u2013 a little greater?","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, thanks, Doug. I would say this shifts around. We have competitors across all the portfolio. I mean there's \u2013 again we've got great share as you know. Our broad portfolio, the way we attack it is kind of a full solution that we bring to grow share for retailers. All good things.","We do have competitors kind of in a broad array of the products. And they will come and grow across those products.","So again when we look at the framework, we said we expect volume growth, share growth, all those things to be higher. We've built in some amount of just price competition on base things and still get to that 3%, 4% kind of a growth number given that. So there is competition out there. There always has been. We think they're good competitors. So they're not \u2013 they're good competitors. We just have a broad solution that brings to it. So it's kind of included in that growth pull slide (51:02) we have.","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","And one of the things that...","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I guess...","Ron L. Winowiecki - Perrigo Co. Plc","If I can add to that comment, you look at the margins of this business, it's sustained at 20%. When you think about it, when we talk about price erosion, so it's a multi-source business. We want our customers to participate in our value we create in our supply chaplain. We have one of the best supply chains in the world. Our productivity is very strong. So we're going to partner with our programs on those improvements, and therefore that's a win-win and a moat to keep competition out.","So I don't want to think of \u2013 you shouldn't think of the pricing as always a bad thing. Price is a trade off with our partners to ensure we're participating in the productivity gains throughout our supply chains. That's a good thing, because it helps us keep competition out as well.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Great, thanks for the questions, Doug.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Maris with Wells Fargo.","Patrick Trucchio - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. This is Patrick Trucchio on actually for David Maris. My question is on the CHCI business. Has the margin turnaround been driven primarily by the culling of unprofitable SKUs and mix benefit from new products? Or are you also realizing some benefits from the restructuring? And can you update us on the progress of the restructuring? And how we should be thinking about savings driven from it in the second half and in 2018? Thank you.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, so thanks, Patrick, and I appreciate you joining us. I would say in general when you think about the margins broadly as opposed to what happened in a month or what happened there, it really does come from the three kind of things that we talk about. There were unprofitable items, low growth, looked good on the sales line but did nothing. So that we've been moved out of that helped. Right? It kind of got rid of some of the dead wood.","Frankly, what that also does, if you think about my mantra has been, once you simplify, it creates a focus and creates better execution. And so by doing that, you didn't have the noise out there. And people were able to execute better, be more cost efficient, drive those. All of those are in there. Your \u2013 the A&P dollars get more focused on driving that core, those kind of things.","And the third one is the insourcing and restructuring. We've certainly restructured sales forces in some countries where we thought it was right. We also had the insourcing of products. And so all of those were part of that continued margin improvement.","As we go forward, there's still insourcing to go. So we're on the path, but it takes a while. You've got contracts, you got approvals, you got all those things. When we laid it out, that was originally from the acquisition time a three- or four-year process. We're a couple years in, but it still is a couple more years to get that full to fruition.","And then we also have work to do still on our \u2013 what I'll call our operating structure. So our operating expense structure, sales force, finance, IT, those kind of things, that operating structure that enabled the business. We're making progress there. But we still have a fair amount of ways to go on that part of the cost and efficiency and focus initiatives.","And again I think by creating that simplified operating structure, simplified focus, it does deliver efficiencies over and above what just the math would say, because you're doing that. So on the cost side we're still progressing down that path. I won't say we're early on, but we still have a ways to go on those parts to make sure that we have the right cost structure that continues to drop more to the bottom line. And that's why I talked about a \u2013 this isn't a next month they're going to be through the roof. It is a couple more years from now to get to those mid to upper teens where we expect to operate.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Great. Thanks, Patrick.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Morning, Gregg.","Unknown Speaker","Hi there, this is \u2013 morning. This is (55:05) for Gregg Gilbert. I wanted to ask you if you can maybe talk about your priorities among the various shareholder return levers, dividends, repurchases, versus BD?","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, so I'm not going to give you that one goes from the other, because as we think about strategic alternatives and different decisions at a board level, all of those are certainly on the table. I do think the add-on, bolt-on acquisitions, when we find those good value products we can quickly turn those into good returns. So we continue to look for those kind of opportunities.","In this last quarter I was very excited and happy to buy our stock at the price we did. I think it was a great value, so was happy to do that and use some of our cash that we've generated off our balance sheet, off some of these business dispositions to do that. I think it was a great time to do it.","But I can't \u2013 we will continue to look at dividend policies, stock buyback, other ways of returning it in addition to those. And I don't want to prioritize them aside from saying as we find inorganic things, we want to make sure we jump on those, especially that bolt into our \u2013 what I think is a very solid infrastructure.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you.","Bradley Joseph - Perrigo Co. Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Chiang with BTIG.","Timothy Chiang - BTIG LLC","Hi, thanks. A surprisingly good quarter for you guys, so congrats on that. John, I wanted to sort of ask you, one question is just the timing of your retirement. Certainly, it seems like a lot of the labor and time and energy that you've put into sort of stabilizing the business is starting to pay off. Is there any way the board could convince you to stay at the company? Or is this really \u2013 this is it for you?","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","Yeah, thanks for the question. And I do appreciate the comment. First of all, I would like to say I think if you go back to the last four quarters \u2013 and this isn't me. This is the business leaders, the company. We have said what we were going to do. We did it. We delivered on the results. We've kind of had that mantra of, hey, we're going to not over-promise. We're going to say what we're going to do. We're going to do that and move on. I think the team has done a great job over that, given all the noise, to make sure that we delivered. So I'm very proud of them for that.","From my standpoint, there's a personal part of this that I've had some family situations to deal with. And it's just time for me to step away for a while to be a little bit more present with my family, given some of the personal circumstances that we've gone through over the last six to eight months, here.","Timothy Chiang - BTIG LLC","Thank you.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","But thank you for your sentiment. I appreciate it.","Timothy Chiang - BTIG LLC","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Steinberg with Jefferies.","David Michael Steinberg - Jefferies LLC","Thanks and good morning. Wanted to ask about Nexium. Wondering if you could more size up that opportunity for us? And more specifically, when you launched Prilosec a couple years ago, it became one of your biggest products. And do you think Nexium will reach similar size to Prilosec?","And then, just looking at your product categories from a broader perspective, historically the company's done a great job in extracting multiple opportunities from a therapeutic class. So allergy, sort of been played out, Zyrtec and Allegra and Claritin. Now with Nexium, I believe it's your last PTI that you can launch from that class. And you recently launched some of the nasal corticosteroids. But as we look out medium term for big opportunities, what are the therapeutic classes that you think will go RX to OTC and be able to hit your P&L in the next few years to make meaningful impact? Thanks.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","No, thanks, appreciate the question. So can't give you an exact opportunity for Nexium, because there's \u2013 it's the last of the PPIs, really, if you want to think about it that are out there and doing it.","The way I typically think about the store brand market with a product like this is national brand \u2013 and Brad will probably correct me \u2013 is $350 million (59:29) or so, is the national brands at this stage; somewhere in that ballpark. That usually means a store brand at our sell price kind of opportunity in some ways is $70 million (59:40). So, that's a one player. You get a couple players in there, you get two or three, it carves up at some percent. But that's sort of the size of the opportunity in our minds.","I will say from Perrigo's standpoint, we do a solid job because we have such a broad portfolio of cross merchandising driving, driving retailer share, doing a fair amount to make sure that we capitalize on those sales, that we let the retailers capitalize and the consumers benefit. So that's one of the broader offerings we bring. So it's that kind of a size and opportunity, if you will, when you think about the Nexium store brand version.","RX-OTC switches, there's a \u2013 in my mind, the talk that's going on on the RX pricing, you think about that, you think about the talk that's going on in government about, boy, we're paying too much here, all of those things, it's created this stir in the RX side, which we deal with and we talk about. It also creates an impetus to say, how do we manage that cost? You bring products over the counter. And so, it really gets the FDA starting to think not just about getting products approved for an RX market, but also which categories make sense to switch? How do we put these in consumer choice versus government or private pay? What do we need to do? And so, I think that sentiment does play into if there are products that are safe and effective, we should help drive those.","I can't tell you exactly what the next one will be. But I do know if you think about, first of all, our derm category, many of those are natural products to switch. They're not billion dollar categories, but they're natural products that are safe, effective, could be self-prescribed, could be over the counter.","The probably one that won't be immediate, but there's certainly some partnerships out there looking at Cialis from the erectile dysfunction categories. And doing those, will those come over by themselves? Will there have to be a pharmacist saying, hey, do you have a heart condition? Okay. You can take this. Who knows what intervention there will be? But I believe that those kind of categories that are pretty expensive categories on the RX side will continue to switch.","Migraine, another one. We have certain migraine products over the counter now, but certainly switching some of those are also kind of key ones. But probably the biggest that I go a little bit back and forth on, to be honest, is the statins. I think they belong over the counter. I think some kind of pharmacy intervention could make them out over the counter, almost like a third class, do that to help. But that certainly has been tried; not quite there, yet.","But I think even those will evolve that way if you look over the next three or four years at big categories that could have an impact at a consumer choice level. Thank you.","Operator","We have reached the allotted time for questions. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing remarks.","John T. Hendrickson - Perrigo Co. Plc","I really appreciate everyone joining us this morning. Again, I'm proud of the team, what they delivered, how they focused on not only results for the quarter, but driving each of our business segments to good profitability, good levels.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Bradley Joseph, Vice President of Global Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.","Bradley Joseph","Thank you very much. Good afternoon and welcome to Perrigo's calendar year 2016 preliminary unaudited earnings conference call. I hope you all have had a chance to review the press releases we issued early this morning. Copies of the releases are available on our website, as is the slide presentation for this call. Leading today's call are John Hendrickson, Perrigo's Chief Executive Officer, and Ron Winowiecki, Perrigo's acting Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, participants will make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for investors and shareholders and Safe Harbor language regarding these statements in our press releases issued this afternoon. In addition, in the appendix for today's presentation, we have provided reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures presented.","Please note that today we'll be discussing certain preliminary unaudited calendar year 2016 financial results and initial calendar year 2017 guidance. However, we cannot assure you that our audited 2016 results or initial 2017 guidance will not be materially different.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to John Hendrickson.","John Hendrickson","Thank you, Brad and welcome everyone to Perrigo's calendar year 2016 preliminary earnings call. Before discussing our performance, I want to comment on the internal transition we announced in our press releases earlier today. Effective immediately, Ron Winowiecki Senior Vice President of Business Finance will assume the role of Acting Chief Financial Officer following the departure of Judy Brown, Executive Vice President of Business Operations and Chief Financial Officer. Judy is leaving Perrigo to take a position with another company in the pharmaceutical industry beginning on April 1, 2017. We thank her for her contributions, and wish her best in her future endeavors.","As our acting CFO, Ron brings almost three decades of financial and accounting experience to his position. He has the industry knowledge and technical expertise to successfully lead our finance team. I worked closely with Ron during much of his tenure at Perrigo, and I can test to his leadership skills, financial expertise, and strategic acumen. I believe that he is the right person to take on this role, as we conduct a thorough search for a permanent CFO, which will include Ron as a key candidate. I have full confidence in Ron, and look forward to working with him as our CFO.","As you've likely seen in our press release earlier today, we filed the Form 10b\u201325 notification of late filing with the SEC regarding our Annual Report on Form 10K for the period ended December 31, 2016. We currently expect to file our Form 10-K on or before March 16, 2017. Ron will provide you more detail regarding this matter shortly, but I would like to comment upfront that while this delay is unfortunate, we remain committed to providing timely, accurate and transparent communication to all of our stakeholders.","Now I want to talk about our business. I will begin by providing an update on the progress we have made against our strategic and operational action plan and I laid out in my initial 30 days. Next, I will provide perspective on our preliminary calendar year 2016 results, as well as my top priorities for 2017. Ron will then provide the detail regarding our delayed 10-K filing, the preliminary calendar year financial results and provide our initial 2017 guidance. I will then conclude with final comments before taking your questions.","Turning to slide six; you can see that we continue to make progress on our action plan to create value which is underpinned by our strategic portfolio review. I have a number of updates that I would like to share with you today. First, corporate governance continues to be a priority for the Perrigo Board of Directors. On February 7, we announced the appointment of three highly qualified and experienced professionals to the Board. I will discuss these individuals in more detail on next slide as we look forward to leveraging their industry expertise.","Second, as you likely saw in a separate press release we issued this afternoon, Perrigo has announced an arrangement to sell the rights to Tysabri Royalty Stream to an affiliate of Royalty Pharma, which I will discuss in greater detail in a moment. Further after extensive review, Perrigo's Board of Directors has approved a review of strategic alternatives for our active pharmaceutical ingredient business based in Israel. We believe a potential divestiture of this business allows Perrigo to give greater focus to our consumer facing OTC and Rx businesses.","Third, we previously stated that we are conducting a review to optimize our cost structure in order to better align expenses with our current and future market dynamics. Today, we are announcing a restructuring program that is expected to yield greater than $130 million in savings per annum by mid-2018. This is in addition to the strong contribution that our supply chain organization continues to generate for both our North America and International segments. Again, I'll provide details in just a few minutes.","Fourth, our Consumer Healthcare International profitability improvement program, which I will discuss in a moment includes three components; exiting unprofitable businesses, structural enhancement, and launching new products all of which remain core to our value proposition. And lastly, we continue to make progress on several other initiatives including the enhanced review of our Rx business.","Turning to slide seven; Perrigo has recently added five new highly qualified and experienced directors to our Board reinforcing our commitment to bringing fresh perspectives and new energy to the Board and Leadership. I would like to formally welcome Jeff Smith, CEO and CIO Starboard Value LP; Brad Alford, former Chairman and CEO of Nestle USA and Jeff Kindler the CEO of Centrexion and former Chairman and CEO of Pfizer to our Board. These appointments along with our recent additions of Geoff Parker and Ted Samuels will be beneficial for Perrigo and its shareholders as these individuals bring a strong mix of healthcare, consumer, and investor experience that align with Perrigo's unique business model.","Further, we will continue to seek out fresh perspectives that will contribute to Perrigo's mission of providing quality affordable healthcare products and expect to appoint two additional Board members, who will be recommended by Starboard and ultimately approved by the Board. Within the past few weeks, our new directors have been working diligently to master the company's business objectives, and curb market dynamics. It's clear from our recent discussions, that all of our board members understand the strength of our unique business model including Perrigo's highly valuable portfolio businesses. The Board continues its strategic portfolio review including an enhanced review the Rx business; as always, I promise to keep you updated as we make progress.","Turning to slide eight; I'll now discuss the agreement to sell the Tysabri Royalty Stream to Royalty Pharma for up to $2.85 billion, which consists of $2.2 billion in cash and up to $650 million in royalties earned if net sales of Tysabri meet specific threshold in 2018 and 2020. This sale enabled Perrigo to continue to focus on our other businesses while de-levering the balance sheet creating more flexibility for growth. We are committed to be a good steward of capital and maintain investment-grade status as one of our long-term status objectives.","Turning to slide nine; quality continues to be the cornerstone of our organization and our customers rely on Perrigo to manufacture safe and effective products that provide real value to consumers. We remain focused on maintaining our high standard amid increasing volume demands for our products. At this time, while I believe Perrigo has maintained a lean cost base there are always ways to be more efficient. In order to help offset significant industry price challenges, we have initiated a cost optimization strategy across the company. The core thesis of this initiative is to ensure that the needs of the individual business units are balanced against the benefits of scale, empowering our businesses unit leaders, and better positioning us to deliver on our mission.","As a result, it became clear to us that there were more opportunities to streamline and focus processes, people and organizational priorities on business-critical activities. Specifically, our global cost optimization program includes the following; one, manufacturing cost infrastructure improvements; two, integrating corporate services in the business unit function; and three, improving our go-to-market sales strategy in our Rx and Consumer Healthcare International segments that totally impacted these global changes some of which have already occurred is expected to generate an annual savings of more than $130 million by mid-2018. This will impact approximately 750 employees globally, or 14% of our nonproduction workforce. This is on top of previously announced initiatives which my team continues to execute again. These decisive actions while difficult decisions for our board and management are critical to our ability to drive our business forward.","Turning to slide 10; we are making significant progress in our CHC International business, and I believe we are on a path to capture substantial value by growing our OTC portfolio while enhancing margins over time. With these goals in mind, I would like to highlight some important developments. First, and we continue to enhance leadership across this business, I'm excited to announce the appointment of Svend Anderson to the position of Executive Vice President and President Consumer Healthcare International to enhance this business.","Over the last 10 years, Svend has been working with consumer and Pharma businesses running their European division. He has done this for LEO-Pharma, Hospira, and Actavis. As we continue to build and innovate our branded consumer healthcare OTC portfolio, Svend will play a critical role along with our strong international leadership team in driving profitability across Europe. I am confident that he has the skills and expertise to assist in our endeavors and look forward to working closely with Svend to grow this business during the next phase of our transformation.","The executive committee and I appreciate Sharon on providing leadership to the branded healthcare team during our critical period. His efforts to enhance the segment's leadership team, instill process discipline and drive execution have prepared the team to thrive under the new leaders - under a new leader such as Svend who has deep experience in growing branded products and driving a pan-European platform. As Svend transitions into his role, Sharon will continue to be a key executive for our company and businesses in Australia and Israel.","Second, during the fourth quarter of 2016 we announced a restructuring program in Belgium. Today we're announcing that we have proactively canceled additional unprofitable distribution contracts in the CHC International segment in order to focus exclusively on the development, marketing, and sales of our own brand OTC product portfolio. The exit of these unprofitable distribution contracts in the segment is now expected to have a year-over-year negative impact to our net sales line of approximately $220 million in calendar year 2017 with no impact on profits.","Third, in addition to these organizational changes, we continue to optimize our supply chain and infrastructure. The team is making great progress on enforcing and optimization of our overall supply chain. And forth, the new Head of our Branded Innovation and his team are hard at work driving the new product development process in this business. We're focused on expanding our product offerings, launching new line extensions under our well-known brand names and leveraging our products within our OTC categories. We believe this strategy will further enhance our brand equity and customer loyalty. Furthermore this long-term strategy is supported by a substantial increase in R&D for the CHC International segment in 2017 versus 2016.","Now I would like to discuss our preliminary 2016 highlights in more detail on slide 11. 2016 was a transitional year for the organization, our employees and our shareholders. Before I move on, I would like to thank Perrigo's thousands of employees around the world who work diligently to ensure our strong fourth-quarter finish. Today we announced preliminary unaudited calendar year 2016 record net sales of $5.5 billion and more than $1 billion as expected operating cash flow. Within CHC Americas we achieved record performance in the infant nutrition category, which we expect to be a key long-term driver, in addition to solid performance in the smoking cessation category.","We will launch a number of important new products, such as store brand versions of Flonase and certain products within the Mucinex family. We continue to deliver strong operating margins in this segment enhanced by strong supply chain performance. Within Rx while pricing erosion for the year was greater than expected, it was in line with our updated forecast in the second half of the year. We continue to manage the business for long-term profitability with strong R&D investments, and our recently announced partnership for our branded women health business.","I now want to talk about my perspectives on 2017. Our primary objective as an organization in 2017 is to continue to simplify, focus, and execute on the fundamentals of our business. First, focus on operational execution, including investing and innovating for growth. Second, align our businesses and structures to better meet the demand of our customers. And third, complete our strategic portfolio review to ensure that we have the right model in place to drive both top and bottom line growth. Balance against these priorities are two main headwinds we anticipate in 2017 for our Rx segment.","First, calendar 2015 performance benefited from $80 million in operating income from Entocort. This one time in fact is not expected to repeat at this level in 2017. In the past that was purchased in December 2015, the company did not anticipate all the increased market competition the product now faces resulting in significantly less operating income contribution from Entocort going forward. Second, in addition to the impact from Entocort, we expect 2017 price erosion in the rest of our Rx segment to be approximately 9% to 11%.","We have a strong private label business that leads the industry and we expect to continue to develop this market. As you can see on this slide, over the last 13 weeks market dynamics are favorable and retail brands as a whole are continuing to grow. Looking at the category components of the data, you can see that store brand Infant Formula category continues to outpace National Brand growth wherein a leading store brand player and on the yields of a record 2016, we expect this category to drive long-term growth. This year's January, this year's cold season was more severe than last year's particularly in January although the season has slowed recently.","In addition, store brand growth in this category outpaced national brand growth. We have long [indiscernible] Perrigo's unique business model and the data exemplifies the fact that consumers and the healthcare system in general continue to search for more affordable alternatives for their healthcare needs. Moving to slide 14, we've outlined a framework to continue to drive growth in CHC Americas, which we expect to grow at or above current market OTC growth rates. To be more specific, we believe this business can durably grow 2% to 4% organically over the long-term.","Despite pricing headwinds, OTC and store brand growth remained strong. Consumer dynamics are favorable and national brands are driving new product innovation. All of these factors give a confident in this framework.","Moving on to slide 15; the Rx segment continues to be one of our premier top - one of the premier topical businesses in the industry. We currently have 24 ANDAs pending FDA approval, six of which are first to file representing approximately $3.1 billion in branded sales. Further we expect to launch more than five products issue with branded sales of greater than $800 million.","Now I want to take a minute to discuss our expectations for ProAir. We are not including contribution from the product in our 2017 guidance. We continue to respond the FDA's questions on this product. Currently we are working with our partner on a rigorous set of tests to ensure that our product performance matches that of the references for drug. We plan to be in a position to fully respond to the FDA's remaining questions in the second quarter of 2017 and will work closely with the agency towards approving this first-in-class generic product.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Ron. Ron, welcome to call. I appreciate your support.","Ron Winowiecki","You bet, thanks John, good afternoon everybody, I look forward to meeting you in the near future. I also look forward to continuing working with John, the rest of the Perrigo leadership team in the coming months as we continue to focus our previously stated action plan. I'd also like to take a moment and think Judy Brown for her support, guidance and leadership during our time together at Perrigo, as a friend and a colleague I certainly wish Judy the best in her new position.","Moving now onto our results. I first want to discuss the notification that we filed with the STC to delay our 10-K filing. The scope of work that is still required the finalize Perrigo financial statements, included the final payment calculations related to the announced sales of Tysabri, and deferred tax assets and other related effects Omega Pharma NV.","Let me provide some detail. As you saw on recent press release prepared a business development team finalized an agreement to announce the sale of the Tysabri royalty today. The accounting team taken this development and updated facts and circumstances that led to this announcement and is running a process to calculate the final impaired of value of the milestones associated with the Tysabri asset. Well, it may sound easy, the calculations are complicated and we need to have our calculations and procedures reviewed by our auditors.","We provided our current estimated calculation in unaudited GAAP preliminary financial results reported today. In addition, certain deferred tax assets were identified that existed at the time of the acquisition of Omega, we are quantifying the result of these assets, which will be a non-cash re classification between goodwill and deferred taxes.","Completing our procedures also require us to evaluate the related effects of this re classification. Further, in preparing the accounting treatment for today's announced sales of Tysabri and in completing the 10-K this quarter language associated with the new revenue recognition standard AFC-606, which goes into effect in 2018, late Wednesday, February 22, Ernst & Young, our independent auditors notified us that they are evaluating the historical revenue recognition practices associated with Tysabri.","So let's go back and provide some color on this disclosure. For those of you who have followed the company since 2013, you will recall that the Tysabri royalty stream was a part of the Elan pharmaceutical acquisition which closed on December 18, 2013. The business operation of Elan including many assets in addition to the Tysabri Royalty Stream such as several equity joint ventures, a number pipeline products, as well as R&D, regulatory affairs and administrative functions. The Tysabri royalty was recognized as revenue in the non-financial statements filed with the SEC.","I will review the accounting application at the time of the acquisition parable also independently concluded that the royalty stream from Biogen will be recognized as revenue in the financial statement at Perrigo. This accounting treatment was review with the NY, and agreed to under their audit opinions for fiscal year 2014, fiscal year 2015 and sub year 2015 as well. The reform 10-ks was unqualified audit opinion.","In addition, as you know we have reported the Tysabri royalty stream and related results as a separate segment in our financial statements. As the timing of this review is unfortunately overlapping our earnings release today, we felt it important to provide you with a status update as well. There's one critical point I have to underscore for everyone. The final determination irrespective of how our independent auditors conclude that expected to have no impact on a historical or future expected net cash flows generated by the company, cash is always still cash.","As John stated, we currently expect to file our form 10-K on or before March 16, 2017 within the 15 calendar dates extension period. We'll keep you updated in the event these expectations change.","Now I will turn to Slide 18. You can see the preliminary unaudited 2026 performances results we provided in our press release. Net sales for the accountable year was $5.6 billion, with adjusted net sales of $5.5 billion. As a result the adjusted net sales exclude contributions some assets held for sale.","Preliminary calendar year 2016 reporting operating loss, within a range of $4.65 billion to $4.68 billion with an adjusted operating income of $1.42 billion to $1.44 billion. I like to discuss the two main fourth quarter adjustments that impacted our calendar year reported operating income. First, we realized a tangible asset payment of $2.6 billion in a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $201 million in especially science segment associated with the announced sales of Tysabri.","Second, we identified impairment indicators for the Entocort intangible asset due to new entrance of new competition for this product, and that's reported an impairment charge of $336 million in the quarter. These non-cash effects combine with our other non-GAAP adjustments record in the fourth quarter and for the first nine months of the year resulted in a calendar year 2016 preliminary adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $7.10 to $7.25.","Now I would like to turn to our 2017 guidance on Slide 19. There are a number of key assumptions I would like to take a moment to highlight. Within the CHC America segment we expect 2017 net sales of approximately $2.4 billion with an adjusted rating operating margin percentage in the low 20s. We assume a mid-year launch of the store brand version of NAXM [ph] and a number of smaller store brand OTC launches during the year. Also included in our guidance, are the recent cough\/cold season dynamic John mentioned, which saw an increase in the incidence of cough\/cold harbor since last year, as well to assumptions for average allergy and fluticasone seasons.","In CHC international segment, or CACI, we expect the price of $1.4 billion in 2017 net sales. Segment net sales are impacted by two fundamental shifts in 2017. First; topline sales in the segment are unfavorably impacted by approximately $90 million due to the translation of foreign currencies. Second as John stated earlier, 2017 net sales to exclude $220 million due to the exit of certain distribution agreement in the segment.","To help in your modeling, the quarter net sales effects of excluding these distribution agreements is included in Table 1 of this presentation. I'd also like to note that with announced cost savings in the removal of the profitable distribution businesses, we expect operating margin percentage in the segment in the low teens. And I would like to note that this includes increased investments in new products, supported by advertising and promotion spending, which is more heavily weighted toward the first half of 2017.","Additionally, the timely cost improvement program, will be phased in over the course of the year. We expect that these combined effects will generate approximately 60% of segment operating income results in the second half of the year.","Now let me take a minute to discuss the Rx net sales guidance of approximately $925 million in 2017. First, as previously discussed, we expect the negative year-over-year headwind to the topline of approximately $70 million, related to the increased competition in the Entocort market. In addition, our 2017 modeling assumptions, year-over-year price erosion on like-for-like products are approximately 9% to 11%. Netted against these challenges is the positive contribution from our expected launch of more than five products with brand sales of greater than $800 million.","Let me reiterate again, John's earlier comment that Proera [ph] is not included in our guidance, there's no contribution from this product in our model. As you may recall at the JPMorgan conference earlier this year, we announce a partnership for our brand named Women's Health Business, which significantly reduces excelling costs in the Rx segment. This action combined with the Morgan contribution from new product launches, and the effective of our costs improvement program, enabled us to maintain adjusted operating margins of approximately - approaching 40% in 2017 for this segment.","As the management team, we are committed to long-term growth of our generic prescription business as we continue to make R&D - continue to invest R&D investments for new product that fit our growth strategy. Slide 20, aggregate effect of my segment comments, and illustrate the key year-over-year drivers.","Let me first start with the head winds we are facing. First, Entocort alone is expected to have a 42% unfavorable impact to year-over-year adjusted EPS. Second, the impact of FX headwinds related to Brexit, and a strong dollar in an addition to jurisdictional composition included in our tax expense produced an additional head wind.","On the operating flipside, we expect positive net sales and profit contribution, from our CHC Americas and CHC International businesses, approximately $200 million from new product launches in 2017, and a favorable impact from a cost improvement program as John outlined earlier. These combined factors, are expected offset the price erosion in 2017, and support our guidance range for adjusted EPS between $6.30 to $6.65 per diluted share. To be clear, without the pricing dynamics in the Rx business, and effective Entocort, our consumer facing businesses are forecast to achieve higher year-over-year profitability.","The guides in our press released this afternoon, includes the Tysabri and our API business. Staying with the company's historical practices, we do not change guidance until a transaction closes.","I would like to provide some modeling information to help you understand the effect of the Tysabri sale, on calendar 2017 guidance. As allied in the release, we expect the sales to close in 20 days. Assuming then, that if Tysabri were to be excluded for the entire year, and that we're to complete our debt paid on strategy by mid-year, the expected impact would be to lower calendar 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of $2.12 to $2.18 per diluted share. Again to avoid confusion, Tysabri is currently in our guidance, we will update you the transaction closes and we complete our capital structure action plans.","Now will turn to Slide 21. I would like to provide a brief update on our balance sheet and share our views for Q4 2017. As of December 31, 2016 total cash in the balance sheet was $622 million and total of that was approximately $20 billion. Expected cash from operating activities for calendar year 2016, is anticipated to be over $1 billion exceeding our previously revised guidance. On the right hand of the slide, you can see our cash flow and balance sheet priorities for 2017.","First, we expect operating cash flow 2017 of greater than $850 million which includes the cash flow headwind impact of approximately $60 billion of payments related to our cost reduction program and higher tax payment on a year-over-year basis. They $850 million, the healthy cash flow generation will enable us to drive our capital allocation strategy. Our current operating plans to use this cash flow to pay down debt maturities which are coming due in 2017.","When I was corporate treasure Perrigo, I had the pleasure launching our first investor grand bond offering in 2013, and the philosophies and principal outlined at that time remain today. We remain committed to investing rating, upon the closing of the average transaction we expect to move forward with the debt paid out strategy, consistent with our financial policies.","I should also like to mention, we have good support from aboard for our investment rates and great financial policy.","I'd like to now turn the call back to, John.","John Hendrickson","Thanks Ron, appreciate that. In Closing on Slide 23; I would like to reiterate the strength of our unique business model. Pharmaceutical company coupled with a fast moving consumer goods organization, layered on a world class complex supply chain. We made significant headway in the finding a path to enhance the value, and strength our business going forward.","Our 2016 review of transition, I anticipate 2017 will be the year of execution. There we build upon that foundation and strive toward consolidating growth in 2018. We have the right team and the action plan in place to able us to capitalize on our business model and focus on payroll strength and providing quality affordable healthcare products to consumers and patients around the globe.","Thank you. Brad?","Bradley Joseph","Thanks, John. As I said on the out sit of this call covered certain preliminary unaudited calendar year 2016 financial results. Given that these are preliminary unaudited results, we limit your questions today to 2017 financial guidance, leadership changes and our business and strategies. Specifically we are not going to take questions regarding the 2016 preliminary unaudited financial results.","Operator we now like to open the call for questions and I ask everyone please limit yourself to one question only, thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Marc Goodman from UBS.","Marc Goodman","Okay one question maybe you can focus on the U.S consumer business. And talk about the pricing pressure that you were talking about that was 2% to 4%, what - what categories are you seeing in that pricing pressure and just give us a sense of what that pricing was in 2016, thanks.","Bradley Joseph","In the consumer Healthcare business, Marc, we have always seen certain pricing pressure in all launched new products, a number of competitors. I would say across the categories we compete in we have competitive pricing. We've done a good job of having costs, I mean cost savings, lying driving over these cost of goods, or operating strategies. So when we look at the growth of the business we expect the 2% to 4% to be after price - after pricing for solid growth. After the pricing challenges we expect off set a number of those with our cost initiative. Will say cough\/cold, allergy some of those categories tend to be more hit by some of these pricing things, there are a lot of players within those categories.","Marc Goodman","But is it safe to say the cough\/cold, allergy pricing. You're expecting to be a little worse in 2017 than 2016 or is it just a continuation of what we've seen.","Bradley Joseph","I would say we continue to experience some price challenges it not a new phenomenon, we continue to always have pricing in the consumer space, we expected to continue in different segments of pricing we have seen. Again, given the growth in the new products and everything we expect to be able to overcome that pricing challenge.","Marc Goodman","But like in infant [ph] formula and smoking cessation, are we seeing pricing pressure there or is it really just in those other spaces you mentioned.","Bradley Joseph","I would say we see it in all different segments comes differently across the board, but it certainly had so there's not just price compression from competitors, but making sure we are maximizing our promotion in those kinds in the market too. Retailers want to drive these brands and so we continue to help them try and drive profitability across the portfolio, which can impact some price compression and things that we get to drive that business.","Marc Goodman","I'm sorry just.","Bradley Joseph","Thanks, Marc.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Risinger.","David Risinger","Hi, good evening. My question relates to CHC Americas. I guess could you just tell us within your EPS guidance for 2017, are you forecasting CHC America's operating income flat or down the rising in 2017, thank you.","Ron Winowiecki","David, this is Ron, thanks for the question. In my prepared remarks I commented on CHC America's, we do expect topline growth in the segment as we talked about we did expect operating margins in the low 20s. Again because we have not published 2016 information it's difficult for me to give you a relative compared year-over-year margin number but again the modeling we're using for the segment in 3017 is in low 20s, low 20% margin.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert.","Gregg Gilbert","Yes, thanks. John can you comment on where the Rx review is what you know and what you don't know, when you my complete that and mature overall philosophy, will that you and the boards willingness to take an offer versus the right offer, thanks.","John Hendrickson","Yes, thanks Gregg, appreciate the question. So first of all the new board assembled a good robust discussion and I would say all the business segments understanding whether add profitability to strategy with them, as you can imagine all the board getting engaged, given the new many members and so not trying to make any ultimate decision, and try and understand how they all fit together and what they do. So they continued on the path we have not clearly sit a ultimate date of decision must be made by X. and looking at that, I will say the directed to meet the board to keep driving this business, we would like to profitability, we'd be investments in R&D, deliver good operating margin, keep driving up the long term growth and profitability. So we are operating the business for the long term, not for just short term profitability. So I like their direction and I think as a board they will continue to evaluate it and see what it may sounds.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky from RBC capital.","Randall Stanicky","Great, thanks. I just had - I want to follow-up on the last question. John, can you talk about the hurdles, the specific hurdles in separating the Rx business out, both from a tax and cost perspective. And then the - attached from that question would be would you consider alternative ways of divesting this business, if you cannot find a buyer would you look at spinning it out or other creative structure to pursue that breakup? Thanks.","John Hendrickson","Yes, you got it Randall. So first of all, I just got to step back and - I've said this every time I know and everyone is probably getting tired of it. But this is a good, it's a good return business, high margin even with the pricing we were talking about, as Ron said still at a 40% kind of margin level. It's still a very good profitable business, good pipeline that we feel good about. All of those dynamics very favorable and I think the board themselves were liked what that looked like. When you think of all the potential possibilities from running it, keeping drive the profitability in [indiscernible] to separating. We are certainly not locked into any one option as far as what to do and how to do it. And again, keeping running it, keeping it integrated, keeping it as the core part of the business.","There are as we look at cost of separation, there are tax issues related to separation. There are operating issues related to separation, that all come in the play in that strategy, but I would say everyone is in a fact gathering, understanding mode, at the board level to look at all the potential options.","Randall Stanicky","And there is no timeline in terms of how long should you - to go into I know there are some new board members that came on who I assume are going to take an active role in that process?","John Hendrickson","Yes, correct. All the board members are taking up very active roles in all the segments, but certainly in this. There is no timeline set, that we've said that we must have a decision by here or else. Again the Board has directed to me as to keep running the business to grow it and drive the profitability of it and that's where we are taking it right now.","Randall Stanicky","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin","Thank you. I have to say I'm still very confused by this 2017 guidance related to Tysabri. So when you're saying that when you close the Tysabri deal in 20 days, we have to take out $2.12 to $2.18. So that really assumes no offset? So I guess a couple questions. Number one, what are you going to do with that $2.2 billion in cash? Is that already incorporated in your debt pay-down guidance for the year and maybe if you could just be more specific, how much debt do you plan to pay down this year?","Ron Winowiecki","Hi Jami, this is Ron. Thanks again for the question. So again our earnings guidance is $6.30 to $6.65 for the year. So you made a comment that our Tysabri affected $2.12 per share to $2.18 is not a clear offset. That's actually not true. Again, we have to take a look at what is the Tysabri Royalty Stream and again you have to work with your models and I certainly\u2026","Jami Rubin","But we have a number that's higher than the $2.12 to $2.18 so maybe that's part of it. Can you - how did you get to $2.12 to $2.18?","Ron Winowiecki","So again, let me just walk you through this. So you got to take the effect of Tysabri. We are not, we cannot provide our guidance for Tysabri. So you got to take your model, look at what you have allotted for the Royalty Stream. You have to take that on an after effect basis. So as you know this is an Irish held asset, it's in an efficient tax jurisdiction. Then you have to say okay, let's step back look at the debt pay down. Again we're reflecting $2.2 million and again we have [indiscernible] from our Board to continue our investment-grade financial policy. You can assume we're pointed at paying down debt. So you have to go through now, okay here's a various range the debt, the senior notes, what is the average interest rate on those senior notes over the curb, we're going to be smart from a P&L and from a future liquidity standpoint. And then you calculate that effect after-tax, because then you'll have again tax has as a deductibility in various jurisdiction and that results in the $2.12 and $2.18. You probably have a higher number.","Jami Rubin","I do.","Ron Winowiecki","My explanation is, one; I can't guess your model for Tysabri. Number two, again this is a mid-year debt pay down so is assuming midyear. So you may have some other assumption for the debt pay down. I can't interpolate that and\u2026","Jami Rubin","You can't tell me how much debt you are going to pay down this year?","Ron Winowiecki","Well so, for this item. Again you say pay down as a share. So let's take that in two parts. So the one part is I communicated with our operating cash flow, we do expect to pay down debt maturities this year. Let's keep it [indiscernible] decide that's our guidance model. Now let's talk about that $2.12 and $2.18. We received $2.2 million in cash, you can assume that that cash is focused on debt pay down.","Jami Rubin","Okay. So at the end of the year, how much cash will you have at the end of 2017, after you paid down debt, how much cash will you have?","Ron Winowiecki","So we are not providing guidance on cash on balance sheet. So I am not going to provide that number right now Jami, if that's fair.","Jami Rubin","I am sorry. Can I just ask one more question? Did you guidance include - you did say OTC next, I think you said middle of the year. Is that right?","John Hendrickson","Right. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen from Guggenheim.","Louise Chen","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So just curious if you strategic review ever considered divestiture of Omega and why not? And then just any update on this Amazon opportunity, is it still something you are interested to pursue? Thanks.","John Hendrickson","Yes, thanks. Yes, I would say the strategic review included everything. So the good thing again is we kind of looked at every business and say why do we love, what don't we like about it, what things we change, where we not executing as well as can so it was a broad and is a broad strategic review. We certainly looked at the performance we've had in the Consumer Healthcare International. But when we looked at the market dynamics, when we looked at the home are executional plans and what we thought we could drive or continuing to try and drive that platform for growth both top and bottom. And we believe that being in Europe with the consumer business that includes brands, value brand, store brand as well as some specialty products is a great platform to have.","We've got to execute with it and deliver that value. So we continue to look at all those segments and not just pick on Rx, but continue look at all and make sure they're good, fir for us. I'd like to go back to Ron, I believe he said in his comments which is when we look at next year we've got a lot of Rx headwinds and certainly Tysabri moving on from it. So when you look at our consumer facing businesses they have some good strength year-over-year.","Ron Winowiecki","And Amazon.","John Hendrickson","And Amazon, sorry about the Amazon. We continue to think Amazon is a good opportunity, certainly the products especially as they get more and more efficient and real-time delivery. When you have a headache and you want your product now, not necessarily tomorrow. So we'll get much more efficient, I think it starts taking off. We are working with them, working with other players or the retailers have online aspect to most of their businesses, we work with those in marketing and driving our online business as well as Amazon. And we think, going forwards over the next 2, 3, 4, 5 years I will continue to be a growth vehicle for us. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Maris with Wells Fargo Securities.","David Maris","Hi. One question and one definition. So first on the question. When the teacher says that students are energetic, they usually mean that the students are troublemaker. So when you said that the Board Meeting, the first meeting was I forgot that are invigorating or something\u2026","John Hendrickson","Engaging maybe.","David Maris","Yes, engaging. So that everyone knows that's code for people have differences and we're debating it and they are new members. Can you just describe where there is agreement and where there may be differences of opinion of the direction of the company? And separately just as a definition you had mentioned that you're improving your go to market sales strategy. I just wanted to know what that means.","John Hendrickson","Sure. So first of all, I would not take anything I have said with the Board to in that way. We have had great board interactions, the Board members have worked well with each other trying to challenge management, think with each other, I would say very, again when I say invigorating, I mean very good breadths and depths of discussions. The new Board members bring different angles at things which has been very good for the whole Board. So I think it's been a good interaction clearly with Jeff Parker and Ted, who joined a little bit earlier. But then went with Jeff and Jeff Kindler as well as Brad just brings good angles to helping us think about things, helping us think about strategies. So it's been a very good productive engagement with the new board member so far and their cooperation with the existing board member. So very positive from my standpoint, can't speak highly enough for those interactions.","On the second part of the question\u2026","David Maris","Go to market sales strategy.","John Hendrickson","Go to market sales strategy, and I believe we're talking about the Rx side of the business is one of those. We basically had a branded portfolio of products that we [indiscernible] with someone. So we had a whole detailed salesforce that were driving those brands. They were good brands, we own them. We like the products but we did not have the scale nor did we want to invest in a number of new branded product in the Rx space. We partnered with another company to be our go to market arm where we fill on the product manufacture them actually take the orders et cetera. But they do the detailing and selling and it was a good way to still leverage the product portfolio and not have the broader complexities, expenses et cetera with a sales force. They have a sales force and even more products in their basket. So it was a very good collaboration to drive, its showing good results so far.","David Maris","Thank you very much.","John Hendrickson","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question come from the line of Dewey Steadman from Canaccord.","Dewey Steadman","Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Just a really quick one on CHCI. Following the strategy changes and sort of the return of revenues there and new good leadership for that division other opportunities to synergize between CHCA and CHCI going forward? Thanks.","John Hendrickson","Great question. So we do have a fair amount of synergies on quality, cost of goods and operating side. So I'll start there, we put a team in place early on. And then we got to figure out what we can do, they had a lot of outsourced products and number of plants as we do. And our team there, we put people on the ground headed under Ron Winowiecki whole Irish operating supply team and they have been delivering great synergies between the businesses. Doing in forcing across our plants, making sure we deliver a high value across the products that part has been going well and we continue to try and expand what we can do there to help their cost of goods as well as their operating costs.","The other side is we have a platform in Ireland and we continue to combine our Irish platform there with the platform of the operations in Nazareth, Belgium and continue to get the benefit out of doing that. On the sales side, there are some synergies not as much or as quick as we had originally expected. We originally expected to be able to launch more products. We are launching some products that tie into their value chain there. We are launching products here eventually that we think we can launch as good brands or control brand. But it's not as much early on as we expected, we continue to want to drive more value there.","One of our good wins has been we had developed in the States with our partner in Denmark a nicotine gum, that was sort of best in class and with the purchase of the nicotine products that we did in our international CHC business, we're able to bring that innovation to them and actually launch that product here over the last month and a half or two months and are seeing good results. So we feel that franchise as smoking cessation and those kind of things continue to grow in Europe that can be a good franchise force there. As a global player we have a good supply chain to back that up.","So that's a good example where working together has proven to be a beneficial thing.","Dewey Steadman","Thanks.","John Hendrickson","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JP Morgan.","Christopher Schott","Great. Thanks very much. Can you just come back to the US CHC business, I think you used to talk about that as a mid to high single-digit growth business. Obviously different environment now, but when we compare the 2% to 4% versus the prior guidance is this all price or is there an assumption you're making about new launches in there as well that might have changed? I'd just like a little bit more color on bridging between the old and the new.","And then just a very quick follow-up on this issue of just debt pay down from here. Just might be helpful is there a target leverage ratio you need to get to post the Tysabri divestiture in order to keep investment grade rating? I think this might help us a little bit better under capital allocation priorities we just knew and where do you need to go on leverage at least in the near term? Thanks very much.","John Hendrickson","No, thank you. So I'll take the first part, and then Ron I think I'll pass the second part over to you if that's fair.","Ron Winowiecki","Yes.","John Hendrickson","So the first part. On the business side, I would say when we look at the markets today the switch products the categories all of that we feel are very optimistic on our CHC business and feel good about that. But when we look at all the components that we try to lay out with store brand growing favorable consumer dynamics, new products. You can see pretty strong volume growth across the segment and that's close to 5% to 6%. So good volume growth. The plants are running well and those kind of things, we do expect when we put in year pricing headwinds and so we build into our model we expect pricing and make sure that we have the costs and other initiatives to do that for net growth 2% to 4%. So rather than bridging back there were certainly switching and that was also an old models in the past from big switches, as well as general growth dynamic depending on the time period that we were in, but as we look forward for the next few years we are looking to be able to grow, which I think in general will be out above the pace of the normal U.S consumer business within the pharmaceutical and healthcare we know that we operate.","Ron Winowiecki","Yes, I think I will take the question. I think you phrase that as the target kind a leverage metric, so you look - 2016 information but if you look at the LTM metrics as the you know 9-30 you can see the company's running somewhere called the high tree support range relative to debt-to-EBITDA. So you can sit back and say what are the companies policies, priorities, we talked about those, so again if you look at next year, we are looking at $560 million, I think the exact number is 557 million of maturity, again we talk about how we're using operating cash flow is our intense to pay that debt down, so to your question is to take up the balance sheet. So we're looking at close Tysabri by $2.2 billion in 20 days that we mentioned at our remarks.","Now again, at the [indiscernible] this in structure as we always look at the tax effect of the of the sale, look at what is the cost to pay debt down, you can run the models based on what debt is trading on today, do your own estimates but assume again for sake of discussion they're somewhere in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion there right, just to you kind of range. So what does that mean again I don't want to say every nickel and dime, goes the debt paid unless they were continuing to commit investment grade, we're continuing to work with agencies on our credit profile to ensure we continue marching down that path. If you take those numbers we are talking some more in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion of debt that would be paid out over the course of the year, you can run the leverage metrics, I don't think I need to do the math for you, so you can take the guidance, run off an EBITDA model, and then start saying what that metric come out to.","Christopher Schott","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from a line of Douglas with Barclays.","Douglas Tsao","Hi, good morning - good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. It feels like morning maybe, but I'm - just you know maybe going back to Chris's question then again you know I think in that sort of megatrends waymarked [ph] you used to put out he's got sort of highlights of the like population demographics, as well as the store brand penetration growth of 2% to 3%, which now seems to be you know 1%. You know again to sort of curious in terms of expectations in terms of store brand conversion, what it's sort of like to that change - I mean it is sort of new product introduction or it is just simply a reflection of where we are and cycle in terms of the economy and that perhaps consumers are feeling better there perhaps looking for to more or sort of more biased toward purchasing national brands.","John Hendrickson","Yes, I think again I'm trying to not down hold - downplay 2% to 4%, I realize we're going on the 5%, but 2% to 4% means with all of that volume going 5% to 6%, Store brand gaining certainly volume share, profitability being offset somewhere, just pricing go on what happened there but still good volume growth could share growth when you look overall at what we're doing. There are some consumer dynamic, we believe continue to go that way, those mega trends you talk about in my mind are still very much at work. You know we're all getting older healthcare costs are doing nothing but go up no matter what we want to talk about, having a value proposition for consumers when they go to get it, is a great thing, we believe all those work in our favor. At this point when we look at all of those balance together and say organically again organically with a portfolio of the R&D that we're doing, what we see we believe a thing that realm, that does not mean that there are other inorganic opportunities there to rise additional growth but we're talking about here just base organic growth would be portfolio and R&D, more cost per segment that we're operating in.","Douglas Tsao","Okay. I guess John, in particularly focused on just why the OTC Store brand growth can be a little bit slower than what you had spoken about in the past, the company spoken about in the past.","John Hendrickson","Yes, so I think you know it all going back a couple years ago and saying here's what those dynamic were, I do good in laying out here is the dynamics today and got a lot organic growth I see and again there's still a fair amount of volume share, I do think be all the dynamics of growth, products switches all of those things lead us with this guidance, which again I feel is a very strong growing faster than segment, driving shares, doing those things performance. You can add on that [indiscernible], had some very good strong business.","Douglas Tsao","Okay, great. Thank you.","Bradley Joseph","Thanks, Doug. Last question, please.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur from Raymond James.","Elliot Wilbur","Thanks, good afternoon, appreciate your squeezing me in. Just want to come back to the Tysabri announcement, specifically question for Ron, is there anything you can say about the additional sales levels that would trigger the - The incremental step up in sales value there in terms of you know what those levels are. And then just a follow up to that in thinking about or try to model the company on a go forward basis new co obviously without the savage could have much higher effective tax rate, and looking at so the metrics you provided today coming up with an adjusted effective tax rate, excluding Tysabri royalty stream somewhere around 19% to 20% and just kind of a rough ballpark number one throughout out there and get some feedback on that, thanks.","Ron Winowiecki","Yes, you sure, you bet. So first the service - the effective tax rate; Elliot, you're in a stalling throw, I'm not going to say it right or wrong but take you in the window of acceptability, a relative to tax rate, we are not providing guidance on that today, we will certainly update our models to get that more details once we do close the transactions. So again within a stone's throw, listen we work with a partner were not disclosed in those terms and conditions, and we are not obligated to until we close, we like with all that that count until we get to that point, I think we will find is that a natural curve relative to Tysabri sales, it is always a bit outspread as you always know relative to any organic street model, so I don't want to predispose what's street numbers verses another, so it doesn't provide guidance so for me to go out there and start providing estimated revenues for the milestone now I don't this it is appropriate. So again we look at those, we understand what the metrics are, we worked our partner kind of what is the appropriate milestone for those sales thresholds, and again once that agreement becomes public we will provide more discussion at that point.","John Hendrickson","And again that's $250 million 2018, and $400 million in 2020, so as we discussed, so when they're due it's just the terms we will get once closed. Thank you everyone, I really appreciate your time and consideration, I appreciate it, thank you.","Operator","This concludes this conference call, you may now disconnect."],"16857":["Perrigo Co.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Perrigo's Calendar 2015 Fourth Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been muted to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I'll now turn today's conference over to Art Shannon, Vice President of Corporate Affairs and European Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Arthur J. Shannon - Vice President-Global Corporate Affairs and European Investor Relations","Welcome to \u2013 thank you, Holly. Welcome to Perrigo's fourth quarter and calendar 2015 earnings conference call. I hope you all had a chance to review our press release which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the release is available on our website, and also on the website is the slide presentation for this call.","Before we proceed with the call, I'd like to remind everyone that during this call, management will make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for investors and shareholders and Safe Harbor language regarding these statements in our press release issued this morning.","In addition, in the appendix for today's presentation, we have provided reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures presented. I'd also like to note that calendar year data for 2015 was derived from the company's audited results for the six-month period ended December 31, 2015 and unaudited results for the fiscal quarters ended March 28, 2015 and June 27, 2015. Calendar year data for 2014 was derived from the company's unaudited results for the fiscal quarters ended March 29, 2014, June 28, 2014, September 27, 2014 and December 27, 2014.","Following management's review of the presentation, we'll open up the call for questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Perrigo's Chairman and CEO, Joe Papa.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Art, and welcome everyone to Perrigo's Fourth Quarter and Calendar Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today is Judy Brown, Perrigo's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Now here's the agenda for today's call. First, I will walk through some of the key financial highlights for calendar 2015, then I'll highlight the advantages of our focus strategy within our consumer-facing OTC global platform, which, when coupled with the earnings power of our Prescription Pharmaceutical businesses, creates a truly unique, diversified and sustainable business. After that, Judy will go through the details of the fourth quarter results and guidance for calendar 2016. Then, we'll close with an opportunity for Q&A.","Before starting into the call, I'd like to take a moment to highlight some changes in our Investor Relations group. As part of previously announced consolidation of certain functions in Ireland, Art Shannon will relocate to Ireland and will be assuming the role of Vice President of Global Corporate Affairs and European Investor Relationship. Art will continue to oversee both internal and external global communications, and will continue to be the lead point of contact for media and government relations.","In addition, he will now be responsible for establishing a global government relations based in Dublin, and expanding Perrigo's shareholder-focused Investors Relation program in Europe. I hope you can join me in congratulating both of them.","On slide 5, you can see this was a record year for Perrigo across all key metrics, from record net sales to record adjusted operating income. This highlights our continued growth from a combination of our durable Consumer Healthcare model to our diversified Rx portfolio in inorganic acquisition strategy.","Overall, 2015 was another great year. Perrigo achieved record net sales for the year of $5.4 billion, a 28% increase, with record adjusted operating margins. We expanded adjusted gross margin by 400 basis points to 48% driven by strong business mix, including the addition of our new Branded Consumer Healthcare, our Omega business, and of course, supply chain efficiencies. Adjusted operating income increased 29% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. Finally, as you see here, our net operating cash flow for the full year increased to $1.05 billion, also another record for Perrigo.","2015 included a number of key growth drivers. We introduced over 160 new products in key categories, including the store brand version of Mucinex D and the generic prescription version of Clobex Spray. We also expanded our business by completing seven acquisitions including five focused on building geographic scale and capabilities within our Consumer Healthcare platform.","We've created our pan-European platform with the acquisition of Omega. We added softgel capabilities from the acquisition from Patheon in Mexico. We acquired a new portfolio of leading OTC brands from GSK. We added the Yokebe product line to our BCH portfolio. And we added our first U.S. Branded Consumer Healthcare product, ScarAway.","I'd like to take a moment to thank the dedicated Perrigo employees, who, amid some uncertainty last year, weathered a demanding year. Your unwavering commitment to delivering quality, affordable healthcare product to customers and patients across the globe was truly outstanding. And you did it all while delivering record financial performance for the year. Thank you for all your dedication and great work.","You can see on slide 6 the operational achievements by segment on slide 6. CHC experienced a 3% growth in net sales on a constant currency basis. Meanwhile, operating and manufacturing efficiencies enhanced operating margins, which were a record in 2015. This equated to an impressive adjusted operating income for Consumer Healthcare, which represented a 22% increase from calendar 2014. To put this in context, adjusted operating margin increased by 330 basis points. Our store brand business is doing great and without the benefit of a normal cough\/cold\/flu season.","Another key highlight for Consumer Healthcare was the strength of our infant formula category. We have continued to invest in this business, implementing key strategies including increasing our direct-to-consumer and doctor marketing efforts. These and other efforts have led to infant nutrition business growing 6% in 2015. I am confident we can translate the learning from this business to other areas of our global consumer-facing platform. Congratulations to the entire CHC team for another great year of record earnings.","The Perrigo Rx pharmaceutical business had another great year, delivering net sales growth of 14% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. We continue to have the best Rx pipeline in our company's history and remain excited about the future of this segment. Thanks to the entire Rx team for a great performance they delivered this year. Further, you can see in our Specialty segment net sales increased 12% compared to last year on a constant currency basis.","Now, let me turn to Branded Consumer Healthcare segment. This segment had a number of achievements in 2015. First, our Top 20 Brands grew 7% on a constant currency basis during 2015 since our ownership in April. Second, our new product launch, Bronchostop, became the fastest-growing cough\/cold product in the U.K. market. Third, we acquired the NiQuitin family of products from GlaxoSmithKline, which performed above our expectations as we relaunched this product in key markets in the Branded Consumer Healthcare platform.","We have a great European platform in place, which provides a broad distribution network, highlighted by unique access to the greater than $30 billion OTC European space, representing a great opportunity in a number of markets with high barriers to entry. Many of our branded products rank first or second in net sales in their respective markets. They are growing organically through line extensions and by launching existing products into other European markets. We also plan to continue growing inorganically through strategic product acquisitions in our European platform.","Perrigo is in a unique position as a top five OTC company by revenue in Europe contributing to our geographic diversification within the global OTC marketplace. And due to the reasons outlined, we continue to expect the BCH OTC platform to have a growth rate higher than the market averages.","Now, notwithstanding these comments, the fourth quarter results in our BCH segment were below our expectations. Let me review a few factors that contributed to the underperformance.","First, as you're likely aware, we did not get the benefits of a normal cough\/cold\/flu season in Europe. Second, the Branded Consumer Healthcare segment continued to experience lower net sales due to channel dynamics with the generic distribution that I discussed last quarter. These dynamics accounted for approximately 25% of the Branded Consumer Healthcare's net sales miss against our expectations.","Third, and additionally, in December, the Branded Consumer Healthcare team made considerable A&P investments \u2013 advertising and promotion investments \u2013 to grow certain branded lifestyle products, including a weight-loss product, which typically peak during summer months. They did so with the expectation of converting these products into a full-year maintenance product. Unfortunately, these investments did not generate the desired sales in the quarter even though they may still prove useful for longer-term perspective. In any event, it is clear that this large A&P investment adversely affected the adjusted operating margin this quarter.","Finally, in certain end markets we have some challenges, including most notably Spain and Germany, which accounted for nearly 60% of the sales miss to our internal expectations. We are taking actions to restructure our business in these locations.","As outlined in this morning's release, we've realized a pre-tax noncash impairment charge of approximately $185 million related to intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the $4.5 billion Omega acquisition, or approximately 4% of the acquisition price. To be clear, we incurred this impairment because the fair value of certain acquired Branded Consumer Healthcare brands was below the carrying value. However, the fair value of other acquired intangibles improved, but these increases are not recognized under accounting rules.","Let me now spend a few minutes to detail our plan to drive performance in the BCH business. Overall, the plan will focus on improvements in organizational design or people, business processes and product resource allocation. First, from a people point of view, we are changing the management structure of the BCH segment by expanding the BCH executive committee. Also, we are putting Perrigo's matrix leadership model in place, which we believe will deliver better transparency and accountability and ensure continuing concentration on return on investment.","Also, in order to address these factors at certain geographies in fourth quarter results, we are going to take specific actions in select countries to right-size the business, streamline and restructure sales organizations in the affected geographies including Spain and Germany. As part of this leadership change, President John Hendrickson of Perrigo has joined the BCH executive team as part of their team.","Second, from a process point of view, we are strengthening the alignment of connectivity and functional accountability of the BCH business with Perrigo standards. We are implementing four key process improvements. Number one, sales forecasting, inventory control, and operations planning. Number two, financial forecasting, planning, and analysis. Number three, supply chain integration. And number four, an incentive-based compensation that is focused on adjusted operating income and return on invested capital similar to the existing Perrigo system.","From a product standpoint, we have a conducted a portfolio review and are taking actions in BCH to exit slower growing or underperforming brands such as Etixx sports drink product, which does not meet our internal return on investment hurdle, and this will allow us to reallocate these resources to higher growth products.","The Branded Consumer Healthcare business results in the fourth quarter were a personal disappointment to me. I recognize my actions will speak louder than my words so I am committing a significant allocation of my time over the six months to be in Europe, where I will actively work with the BCH executive team and country general managers to drive these initiatives forward. I'm confident that all these actions, when taken together, will accelerate the BCH segment growth. I again want to stress our commitment and conviction around the long-term prospects of the BCH business and the European OTC marketplace as a whole.","Now, with that said, let me step back and talk about and discuss our overall strategy within OTC and why we continue to be excited about building our Perrigo's position as a global OTC leader. In fact, it is clear we are a top five player with approximately 70% of our sales delivered on the consumer OTC platform.","Turning to slide 11, you can see our strong market position in OTC healthcare will be driven by megatrends within global healthcare. The efficiency and affordability of OTC products versus prescription pharmaceuticals appeal to the strong, growing, aging population and shift in healthcare trends. Further, new OTC innovation and Rx-to-OTC switches provide us with numerous opportunities to continually launch new products. All this contributes to our 2016 top line organic growth framework of approximately 5% to 10%.","As you can see, slide 12, in 2015 based on IRI MULO data, the store brand OTC dollar growth rate was over 3% as the data beginning to lap the impact from 2013 return of a prominent national brand competitor. In 2016, we believe the growth in store brands will accelerate, highlighted by the store brand launches of Nasacort, Flonase, and the entire Mucinex family of products.","Slide 13 depicts the stress in our infant formula business. We have focused much attention on accelerating the growth in this category and the great performance we are now seeing as a result of solid execution. The infant formula category has a meaningful contributor to our overall growth, with Perrigo realizing an even larger share of the category.","We have implemented a number of key strategies over the years including enhanced labels and a refresh of the store brand packaging, and now, we are achieving the return on these investments evidenced by the increasing market penetration. We have done this by leveraging Perrigo's world-class operating model, building cross-functional leadership and investing in infrastructure and marketing. As a result of these investments, we have been able to capture over 13% of the overall market.","As we look ahead over the next three years, we see promising opportunities within our new product pipeline. We expect to launch greater than $1.2 billion in our new products by 2018 across all segments, and the majority of these will enhance our durable consumer-facing revenue stream with about 70% (15:10) of these new product sales over the next three years being the \u2013 in the consumer-facing segments.","Turning to slide 14, our Rx pipeline is strong, new product opportunities ahead, equating to greater than $5.5 billion in prescription brand sales over the next three years. In addition, we have 25 ANDAs pending FDA approval, five Paragraph IV litigations, and six projects in clinical studies.","I also want to take a moment to highlight the record-breaking promotion that was executed by our Consumer Healthcare team, which led to the shipment of over 300 million tablets across the country to a single customer on slide 15. This is a testament to our store brand team and the value of our partnerships with our retail customers. I want to pass along my congratulations to the team. Great job.","Now, let me turn it over to Judy.","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. As Joe previewed, we closed 2015 delivering record financial results in an extremely busy year. Every year since 2010, the team has posted record consolidated calendar year net sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted margins.","While this is quite an accomplishment, it is also quite clear to this team: we did not meet our calendar 2015 guidance for adjusted earnings per share due to a few factors in BCH, which Joe has already discussed in detail. Looking ahead, the team has outlined a path forward for year-over-year adjusted earnings growth of 25% to 29% in 2016, and I'll discuss the details incorporated in the updated guidance later in the presentation.","But first, as you can see on slide 19, consolidated results for Q4 were driven by the strength of our durable business portfolio, highlighted by net sales growth of an impressive 34% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, with record adjusted gross margin. Obviously, the year-over-year metrics for Q4 include the incremental contribution from BCH, which was not a part of our business this time last year.","Turning to CHC on slide 20. In the quarter, net sales grew by 6% on a constant currency basis, led by strength in sales of allergy products, namely cetirizine D and loratadine, our nicotine replacement franchise, benefiting from the year-over-year absence of a national brand competitor, and continued store brand penetration and contract sales within the infant formula category, which Joe touched on earlier.","In addition, we recognized $60 million in new product sales, led by strong consumer demand for store brand versions of easily digestible infant formulas. This was offset by a net sales decline of $19 million in existing products, primarily in the diabetes category, as well as the analgesics category, which was impacted by the extremely mild cough\/cold season in the U.S. and the U.K.","Greater sales of higher margin products versus last year, high level of production volumes and plant efficiencies, and improved commodity costs compared to the prior year led to record adjusted gross margin, which expanded 140 basis points year-over-year.","On slide 21, net sales in BCH were led by Top 20 Brands, which achieved 6% growth year-over-year on a constant currency basis. New products, including the GSK portfolio and the Yokebe brand, both of which we acquired in 2015, collectively contributed $65 million to the BCH total net sales.","Adjusted gross margin varied from our expectations due to several factors, including slightly unfavorable brand mix and the impact of costs associated with excess and obsolete inventory charges in the quarter. Additionally, as Joe noted, fourth quarter brand advertising and promotion investments to support certain sales initiatives were larger than anticipated. These were the primary factors in BCH, which drove Perrigo's bottom line mix.","Turning to slide 22. The Rx segment net sales were highlighted by new product sales of $25 million, consisting primarily of the launches of clobetasol spray and the generic version of BenzaClin. These volume increases were offset by a decline in net sales of the generic version of AndroGel 1% as new competition entered the market.","Turning to slide 23, Specialty Sciences net sales were $84 million in the quarter, up 2% on a constant currency basis.","Before I turn to the forecast, a quick comment on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2015, total cash on the face of the balance sheet was $418 million and total debt was $6 billion. While the process of our deleveraging plan slowed due to acquisitions and share repurchases in the fourth quarter, we are fully committed to delevering our balance sheet and to our mid-BBB investment grade ratings. It is our intention to fund our share repurchase program out of ongoing cash flows. And to the extent the use of those cash flows for share repurchases would impede our M&A strategy or our delevering goals, we would slow or suspend the program for a period of time. As a reminder, our share repurchase program is for 36 months until late calendar 2018. Quarterly, given our cash flows generated and our commitment to delever, we will evaluate cash available for M&A and\/or share repurchases.","Now, turning to slide 24, you can see our updated guidance for calendar 2016 of $9.50 to $9.80 per share. This guidance reflects EPS growth of approximately 25% to 29%, compared to 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $7.59 per share. As background, on October 22, 2015, we provided our original guidance for 2016. In January, we provided an update to this 2016 guidance. I'd like to point out that we are not changing the expected baseline performance of $9.50 adjusted diluted earnings per share or the expected EPS growth rate.","What has changed, however, and we're very open about this, is that we now believe the top end of the range is $9.80 adjusted diluted EPS. Let me explain. Our upside growth drivers remain unchanged: over $400 million in new product launches; continued supply chain efficiencies across segments; the contribution from the closed acquisitions, including the most recent tretinoin family of products; and finally, the transformation of our supply chain structure into our global center of excellence headquarters in Ireland.","What has changed in our guidance, however, are the BCH dynamics previously discussed. It will take time to benefit from the people, process and product changes that Joe described earlier. While these items will reduce our ability to capture the upside originally expected in 2016 in BCH, we expect to continue to drive strong earnings growth for the entire company.","Looking at the full P&L, we expect net sales in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.2 billion. Moving down this slide, we forecast adjusted DSG&A to be approximately 17.5% of net sales and R&D at around 3%. This leads to our expected adjusted operating margin for 2016 of between 29% and 30%, which would represent solid expansion. Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 14%, which is a much lower rate in the P&L than just three short years ago.","Please note that 2016 guidance does not include contributions from the VMS business and we are actively marketing the sale of our India API business as well. Both of these operations are now classified as assets held for sale. For comparison purposes, please remove net sales of approximately $40 million per quarter for VMS from the Consumer Healthcare net sales line in 2015 from your models.","In addition, we anticipate that approximately 40% of our adjusted EPS contribution will be weighted to the first half of 2016 and 60% to the second half of the year. Let me walk you through the key building blocks of this first half\/second half dynamic.","First, we expect our CHC business to experience a shift in product mix due in part to the return of a branded competitor in the smoking cessation category, and in part to the previously announced suspension of sales of the guaifenesin 600mg ER product, which I will remind you is 100% owned by Perrigo. We expect this product to return to market in the second half of 2016. Looking to the rest of the Mucinex family, we expect volumes to grow, though these products are at lower margins as they are partnered products.","Second, we are now in the midst of a lackluster cough\/cold season. However, as always, we are planning for a normal season next fall and therefore our cough\/cold categories are more heavily weighted to the second half of the calendar year.","Third, R&D investments are expected to be higher in our legacy CHC and Rx segment in the first half of 2016 compared to the prior year, due to commitments to launching new products. And fourth, new products are expected to be a sizeable driver for the year with greater than $400 million in new product sales expected to phase in over the course of 2016. As an example, ProAir will launch late in the year, and given these dynamics, timing of new product launches are expected to have a more sizeable impact on the 60% earnings weighting to the second half of the calendar year.","In addition to the items just discussed, I'd like to make a few comments on the first quarter. First, I'd like to highlight the year-over-year inclusion of shares outstanding and interest expense for the Omega acquisition in the first quarter, which will impact the year-over-year EPS comparison. Second, due to seasonal sell-ins, BCH allocates approximately 27% to 30% of their annual advertising and promotion spending to the first quarter. The BCH team has been and will continue to be focused on ROI for A&P, so the investments are not always linear with sales patterns.","While we expected adjusted operating income to grow in the first quarter in the mid-teens, with the impact of interest and shares noted a moment ago, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to only grow in the low single digits in the first quarter of calendar 2016 compared to 2015.","Turning to slide 25. You can see we are providing segment guidance as an approximate percentage of total net sales with our consumer-facing businesses still expected to comprise approximately 70% of net sales in 2016.","Slide 26 highlights our global OTC platform new product sales. We expect new product sales to be approximately 70% weighted towards OTC in 2016, including the launches of the store brand version of Flonase in the U.S. and Bronchostop throughout the rest of EU.","Looking at Slide 27, given the large number Rx products pending FDA approval, recent and expected new product launches, such as the generic version of ProAir in mid-December and continued positive momentum in the Rx base business, we expect this segment to drive greater than 20% of consolidated 2016 net sales.","In summary, there are clear action items to deliver results in 2016. We're excited about the deep pipeline of new product launches and remain focused on solid execution in operating efficiency as a basis for our continued growth. We will continue to refine and improve our operating model across all segments of the business to drive consistent returns. At the same time, we will continue to leverage our core competitive advantages and seek the right opportunities for inorganic investments that create sustained growth and meet our stringent investment criteria while still maintaining our investment grade rating.","Now I'll turn the call back to Joe.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Judy. Let me provide a few comments on our 2016 and beyond. We see immense promise as we look forward into 2016. Slide 29, these are key growth drivers for 2016 and beyond. What are they? They talk all about building our global Branded Consumer Healthcare platform. It's all about delivering $1.2 billion of new products over the next three years, and it's about M&A, taking a disciplined M&A strategy and focusing on adjacent OTC categories of ophthalmic, pet health, diabetes, adult nutrition and looking at geographic expansion as opportunities in M&A; and finally continuing to build moats around our durable business model, including the globalization of our supply chain in Ireland.","In summary, we believe the Perrigo Company is a very unique asset. It's a top five global OTC player with an industry-leading growth rate. We are building off a record year with expected 2016 top line growth of 10% to 16% and expect a 2016 bottom line growth of 25% to 29%, with over 70% of our net sales coming from the consumer products.","I'll now open it up to Q&A operator, so we'll take our first call.","Arthur J. Shannon - Vice President-Global Corporate Affairs and European Investor Relations","And, Holly, can you please that we keep it to one question per analyst. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James","Thanks. Good morning. Sure there'll be a lot of question on BCH, or maybe I'll actually start off and ask a question on the Rx generics segment. Judy, if you have the numbers available, could you give us a sense of what the full year contribution was from new products versus decline in the base? Just looking at fourth quarter and it looks like there was about a 10% rate of decline in the base, which maybe seems a little bit higher than average, which kind of leads me into part of my question here. It just seems like at the margin, certain segments within the generic area are seeing more pricing erosion, particularly dermatologics, and just kind of wondering how you're thinking about potential headwinds there in terms of accelerated pricing erosion in 2016. Obviously, it's been a very strong tailwind the past couple of years. Thanks.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Judy, why don't you take the first part of it and I'll take that latter part.","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So were you to go through and accumulate the comments we made each quarter throughout calendar 2015 on new products in Rx, new product contributed approximately $121 million over the course of those four quarters. And pricing wise, we did see some pressure, give or take, in the total portfolio over the course of the year, approximately 1%.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And the latter part of your question really talks about the pricing dynamics and what we're thinking about and looking at for the future. And I'd say the following. Are there some incremental product competition that we're going to face? The answer is yes. However, what we've tried to do at the Perrigo Group is not just stay focused only on dermatology, as you know, we've moved into what I would refer to as extended topicals. So those are things beyond just certainly dermatology, but respiratory, nasal, ophthalmic.","And with those product categories, for example, at the end of the year, we'll launch our ProAir product in terms of a metered dose inhaler for respiratory, those are the things that are giving us great strength in our Rx category. And as we believe, that will give us a very high gross margin and operating margin, certainly as we think about the 2016 and beyond. So we like what we see in terms of our ability to launch these new products and what they mean for gross margin and operating margin.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Louise Chen with Guggenheim.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to dig into a little bit more on BCH. And curious on two things here. Number one, as you mentioned, you did give guidance in January, so curious, when did you actually see a change relative to your expectations on the top end of the range? And then secondly, just curious how much, if any, of the lower sales in Omega than you had originally forecasted were results of Perrigo spending more time defending itself against the hostile last year, or if it was something else? Thank you.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. On the first question, on the question of when did we become aware of some of the challenges with the BCH business. It was really in the middle of January as we were consolidating our business doing the close. Really, it wasn't till that middle part of January that we became aware of some of the issues specifically with the BCH business. Now there's clearly \u2013 you get some revenue numbers ahead of time \u2013 but you don't get to the full bottom line and the consolidated income as a company until we close out our full auditing process and look at everything. So it was really very late in the January timeframe as we looked at the full consolidated part of it.","The second part with the Branded Consumer Healthcare and it was relative to the Mylan question, I think, if I recall?","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes. Yes. That's correct, yeah.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So there's no doubt that the events that occurred when we closed the Omega or Branded Consumer Healthcare transaction on March 30, 2015 and followed by a hostile attempt at a takeover starting in around April 8. Did that cause some challenges for us as we focused on the business? Yeah, it did. I mean did \u2013 clearly, you see though through that time period, the latter half of 2015, we had strong business performance in our Rx team. We had strong business performance in our OTC or store brand business.","As we are trying to put resources towards Branded Consumer Healthcare, there were some challenges, and as I said, it's a personal disappointment but clearly it's something we know we can fix. And we're going to take every effort that we can go forward and put the initiatives that I outlined before by improving the sales and operation planning, improving the financial planning analysis, making the globalized supply chain, things that we know how to do because they fit right into what Perrigo does really well.","So we'll take that on and get that focused and get that righted, but make no mistake, we still believe this was a great opportunity for us. It was an opportunity to move our business from competing in six countries around the world to 39 countries. So we are really excited about what that means for our future and continue to be very excited about the Omega business.","Operator, next question?","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.","Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC","Joe, good morning. You went through some of the changes that you're going to do with the Omega business. They all seem like blocking and tackling issues, I mean things that I guess we'd expected you to do kind of from day one. Why not take these actions earlier with this basically, we bought a company, it was functioning well, let's not fix it, it's everything's operating well, then all of a sudden it just started to slow? Or maybe you can give us a flavor for that.","And I'm sorry, I have a second question, which is the Rx sales guidance, seems like $1.2 billion-ish or something, you had guided for a higher number than that before, and now you've made some recent acquisitions. I'm guess I'm curious what's changed to offset the acquisitions such that the guidance changed so much in that business? Thanks.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Let's start out on the first part of your question, Branded Consumer Healthcare, question of the timing of any changes. I think that you said it well. We acquired what we thought is clearly a great business and we continue to believe it is a great business. As we found though, there's some things that happened in a \u2013 it's a private company and some things in private companies we think we can improve on.","Basically as we think about the Perrigo process that we go through, whether it be the sales forecasting, the supply chain integration on all the things that we do really well, the financial planning and analysis, all those things are process things that we can do better. And clearly, that was why, when I made my comments, it was partially on the people side, partially on the process side and clearly something on the product side. For example, there's some products that just do not meet our return on invested capital hurdles and we're going to make some decisions about those particular products.","Could we have tried to do this earlier? I'd say that the original business performance was very strong. We felt it was moving in the right direction. I still believe it's going to move in the right direction, but I do think there's some things that we can improve on and that's really the purpose of my comments, and certainly the direct involvement that I plan to take over the next six months to 12 months.","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the revenue growth, Marc, maybe I misinterpreted your question because when we've announced the two acquisitions near the end of 2015 with respect to Rx, we said we anticipated they would contribute approximately $150 million of revenue in the course of 2016. That still stands. And with the organic growth that we still plan, it adds to whether we're going to grow more than 20% and that still is the case. So we are targeting growth for this segment well ahead of 20% in total. Even with the inclusion of the $150 million from acquisitions, there is still organic growth planned in the Rx portfolio.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think, Marc, you might have misunderstood Judy's comment because Judy made the comment that the Rx portfolio...","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Will represent 20% of consolidated, not net sales.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Will represent 20% of consolidated.","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Not downgrading their growth rate.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Operator, next question.","Operator","Your next question is going to come from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. So my question is related to Branded Consumer. Could you just talk about the management changes there and the leadership changes? And just explain how that structure is evolving and whether the leadership that was running the business a few months ago is still in place or how that's been altered. Thank you.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, David. Yeah, the people side of our changes are really a couple of different factors. Number one, the management of the Omega business, or Branded Consumer Healthcare, was led by an executive committee of three individuals. Two of those three individuals are still with us right now; however, we are going to expand the size of that executive committee to a larger executive committee. One of the individuals has departed from the company.","Relative \u2013 so we're going to expand the size of the executive committee to just make sure we have more inputs into the process. As I said, in addition, we'll have John Hendrickson, our Perrigo President of the business, to go over there and help them with some of the issues and opportunities to improve the functional or process opportunities.","Final comment on the people side of it would be simply related to some of the restructuring that we're planning to do in a couple of the key markets, specifically country markets that we're planning on. But that's really the full extent of it. And then final comment is just simply on the people side. I clearly expect to devote some significant attention to this business over the next six months to 12 months from a personal point of view for me too.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Operator, next question?","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just on BCH, how long are you anticipating until these initiatives take hold and we should see improved growth trends? I'm just trying to get a handle on what the near-term outlook for BCH looks like. And then there's a second question on this, just on margins for that division as well. I know you talked about some quarterly spend dynamics, but just where should we think about the BCH margins for the year? And what's the longer term range we should think about for margins for this business? Thanks very much.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well, Judy, I'll take the first part of the question of how long some of this will take and then you could take that margin question. On the initiatives that we have in mind, I just was going to remind everyone it's all about people, processes and products. Some of the people things, those can happen very quickly and are in place and happening as we speak. So people are underway. There is some restructuring. As with any restructuring, it takes a certain amount of time to do that.","I would say that the improvement on process is really, by definition, a longer timeframe. As you put in a new sales and operation planning process and as you put a new financial planning and analysis process, as you integrate the supply chain, some of those things just take a little bit longer in terms of timeframe. Having said that, though, we continue to believe that from the product point of view, they're launching \u2013 the Omega team or Branded Consumer Healthcare team is launching a number of important products. We do believe with the addition of the GSK products that I mentioned, from the nicotine replacement therapy, we do think there's some very exciting opportunities for us in 2016.","Judy, that's probably on the product side. On the margin side, Chris asked about margins. You want to take that?","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So on the adjusted gross margin perspective, as we look at the course of the year, there's not a lot of change rolling off of 2015 as you think about modeling 2016. Adjusted gross margins was in a reasonable band, stay in the lower 50%s \u2013 lower 50% zone. Now think about adjusted operating margin and the expansion of growth on the bottom line, that does evolve. I made the comments about the first half, second half dynamics for the company, a portion of that is driven by investments in BCH, ramping up and getting profitability returning to more of the high-teens level over the course of the year.","So, if you're looking at modeling the first half of the year, you would see softer operating income \u2013 adjusted operating income in the first half \u2013 and then growing and working to recover back to, as I said, adjusted operating margins at a higher level in the second half of the year. And that's a dynamic of, combination, timing on advertising and promotion spend and the restructuring activities that Joe mentioned earlier, taking hold and getting to see some additional profitability in the back half of the year.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. I'll keep it to one maybe philosophical question. Joe, to the extent there's a crisis of confidence here \u2013 hopefully a short term one after stiff-arming Mylan, lowering your outlook and having significant structural issues with your latest deal \u2013 maybe you could talk about how aggressive the company, or maybe more appropriately the board, is prepared to be in allocating capital for buybacks as opposed to additional M&A. Of course, in parallel with you getting operations back on track. Thanks.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me \u2013 I've got to take your question into pieces, Gregg. I mean, on the question of, is there some challenges we have with our Branded Consumer Healthcare business, the answer is yes. And that's some things that I mentioned, Judy mentioned, and we're going to take that on. And we feel absolutely confident we will overcome those challenges. And clearly, we still believe this is a great business opportunity for us. As I said, it took us from competing in six countries around the world to 39. We think that expansion in geographic footprint is very, very important to us for the future. So on that question, yeah, there's some challenges that we're going to work our way through but it's nothing that we haven't experienced before.","And the good news is that many of the things that we need to get improved are things that we think Perrigo does very well in terms of our world-class approach to the supply chain, the world-class approach to what we plan to do with just our sales forecasting and optimization. Remember, we manage over somewhere around 20,000 SKUs from a sales and operations planning point of view from forecasting. So, we believe that those things are things that we do very well. We'll put that into the Omega process and we think we'll have, once again, a world-class branded OTC business based on some of the improvements.","Make no mistake about it, some of the marketing activities that Omega has done has been absolutely delivering great returns. As we've taken over the GSK brands, we've shown accelerated growth in the NiQuitin franchise from where they were before. So we think we're in good shape with that portion of the business in terms of the plan, but we do have some challenges; I don't want to mix words there.","On the rest of the business, though, we're excited about it. If you think about what we've talked about as a business in 2015, revenue up 28%, operating income up 29%, earnings per share up 21%, EBITDA now at somewhere around $1.5 billion, I mean there's a lot of great things that have happened with this business in terms of even just within OTC, a significant \u2013 our store brand OTC business \u2013 a significant margin expansion. So, we're in good shape with our total business as we think about it, but I do take the comment that we've got some things to deal with on Branded Consumer Healthcare.","On the question of the share repurchase or capital allocation, yeah, that's something that Judy mentioned, and we'll continue to look at that. As you know, we did a share repurchase in the fourth quarter. As we think about share repurchase in the future, we'll continue to look at that, as Judy said, as there is available free cash flow for us to do that. So, that's something that we are contemplating. I will make a comment though, just to reflect or magnify what Judy said, is that we're going to look at that relative to not only the share repurchase but also the other M&A opportunities that we have as a company. Operator, next question?","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Linda Bolton with B. Riley.","Linda Bolton Weiser - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Hi. Just first like a small kind of housekeeping thing, I guess. Judy, when you talked about new products in BCH, you said it was $65 million including acquisitions. So does the $400 million of new product sales for 2016 include acquisitions? So could you just clarify that?","And then secondly, on a bigger picture, in terms of the restructuring and cost savings you had outlined when you were fighting the hostile takeover, my understanding was a lot of that was actually taking place in the U.S. business and that you had a specific targeted amount of savings for 2016. Can you remind us what all that is? Is that getting lost in the shuffle or are you still pursuing those savings? And will you be reporting on how much of those restructuring savings you'll be getting each quarter as we progress through 2016 so we can monitor progress? Thanks.","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. This is a JV section. So let me first off comment on the BCH question, new products. You are spot on that for the first time ever, there was a mixture in that comment, $65 million of new products, which included Yokebe and GSK acquired products. It's an anomaly here because we have an acquisition in a period where we don't have a comparable to last year. So, the acquired products were approximately half of that $65 million and the new products that the BCH team deemed as new in their calendar year, in the normal kind of metrics that we would use here in the company as launching something within the first 12 months, is the other half.","So going forward, on a like-for-like basis, we will pull out acquired products from GSK and Yokebe until they hit the 12-month acquisition anniversary. And the $400 million in total company new products does not include those two. But you're right, that is a very good callout, Linda, because it's \u2013 we've rarely had an acquired company with a new acquisition on top of it within that window. So going forward, $400 million, no acquired products within that total.","Rolling back to the October 22 announcement and the savings that we expected as a company to achieve overall, those are included in our 2016 plan, still. You'll remember that a portion of that announcement related to structural cost savings within the company and for all intents and purposes, those activities are complete. The migration of our global supply chain center of excellence to our corporate headquarters in Ireland is actively underway as we speak. We mentioned Art will be moving; many people are building up their competencies and getting the business up and running in Ireland. So, those savings are going to be reflected in our 2016 numbers.","And we also made the comment that the sales process for our API location, API factory in India as well as our VMS business, are actively underway and expected to be closed in the not too distant future. So you can consider, essentially, the XLS, the implementation of a streamlining of our operating structure is built in. We're not necessarily calling those out on a line-by-line basis, but suffice it to say, we'll keep you posted on the sales process for VMS. We'll keep you posted on our ongoing buildout within Ireland, as more and more of our business is operated in our corporate headquarters directly with Europe. And we'll call out any incremental actions that could take place over the course of the year within BCH, specifically restructuring initiatives and the dollars related to those.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Douglas Tsao with Barclays.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe turning to the Consumer Healthcare business. Judy, if we look at the 45% guidance relative to \u2013 percentage of sales for Consumer Healthcare relative to the sort of consolidated revenue guidance for the company, it sort of implies Consumer Healthcare to be sort of down a touch relative to this year. Given the progress we've seen in the last couple quarters, it's a little surprising to me. Just curious if we're sort of interpreting that the right way.","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I'm looking at my Consumer Healthcare segment-specific information, and we definitely have Consumer Healthcare growing in 2016. There we do generally break out revenues for you in total, 45%-25%-20%, but these are approximates. So what I can tell you is that within our own breakdown segment by segment, we see the Consumer Healthcare business continuing to grow, and both on the sales and on the operating income line for the full year.","So remember, those breakdowns in order to give you a feel for how the business is progressing, those items presented on page 25, again, are approximates, just to give you the continued information that our consumer-facing business continues to generate approximately 7% of our expected sales.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much. That's helpful clarity.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. But to be clear, the only thing I'd add \u2013 I think Judy said it exactly right \u2013 the only thing I'd add is that we continue to look at our business in terms of growing the consumer-facing business in that 5% to 10% range. I mean, that's what our mindset continues to be as a company.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Annabel Samimy with Stifel.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I know there's been a lot of discussion about BCH, but within generics, even though it's at the highest level ever, the growth seemed to slow pretty meaningfully. So you already talked about price erosion. I guess I want to gauge your confidence about the new product introductions outside of the Entocort and Retin-A programs, and how do you feel about the base business? How confident do you feel about the other product introductions within the group, as well as any competition on the horizon that could erode your product opportunities of the base business? Thanks.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So let me start with your first kind of assumption. It is correct. We did expect the generic Rx business to slow down. The reason expected it to slow down was because at the end of 2014, we launched a very significant new product, it was the Androgel 1% or testosterone 1% gel. That was a very important launch for us and one which did incredibly well. We were the only company out there with a generic equivalent to the 1%, so therefore this was all things that we expected. We always knew the comp for the year-over-year was going to be significant for the fourth quarter, and all of that has transpired exactly as what was stated.","I remind you, as Judy was talking about, the opportunities in our Rx business, one of the things we've mentioned was the opportunity to launch a generic equivalent of ProAir. That generic equivalent is, we think, a very exciting opportunity. To our knowledge, no one else has even challenged the patent. So we challenged the patent, we prevailed and we're at a point where we think it's a very exciting launch for us that will represent a significant upside to us in the later part of 2016, so we're very comfortable with that. As Judy has talked about in terms of \u2013 as we think about the margin opportunities, both on the gross and operating line \u2013 we do see calendar year 2016 improving on both of the operating and the gross margins for that business as we continue to show very significant growth even without the equivalent to the Entocort and the Retin-A generic.","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So just to clarify, and this probably builds off of perhaps we created a little confusion when we heard Marc's question, too, our plan for Rx reflects, excluding the acquired products, excluding the tretinoin family and the Entocort transaction, is still at the high end of our 8% to 12% growth guidance that we've provided in the past. So any \"slowing\" in Q4 relative to that type of a range reflects the fact, to Joe's point, that Q4 2014 was the highest Q4 on record. So relatively, that quarter was outside of our stated 8% to 12% range, but we are at the high end of that range within our 2016 guidance plan for next year.","Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks for clarifying.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Tim Chiang with BTIG.","Tim Chiang - BTIG LLC","Hi, Joe. You talked a little bit about \u2013 at least you highlighted the over-the-counter Flonase product to launch in 2016. Could you talk a little bit about what your expectations for the timing of the launch is and sort of how significant you think that product could be here in the states this year?","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well, it's currently at the FDA. So we have to await FDA's approval process. But do I believe that the Flonase product will happen sometime in the next 30 days to 90 days, I think that that is a very reasonable assumption. I obviously can't guarantee anything. It's up to the FDA to make their decision. But I do think that somewhere in that next 30 days to 90 days that we'll see the introduction of a store brand private label of Flonase.","On the question of the opportunity, we think Flonase is doing very well so far in terms of the brand. You see a lot of advertising for it, a lot of promotion for it. They're doing very well with it. Our expectation is that there is a significant store brand opportunity. It's, ball park, it's on track for $300 million for Flonase and rising as a brand. So we think the store brand opportunity is significant.","Tim Chiang - BTIG LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Operator, next question.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Joe, Perrigo's business model has become increasingly dependent on M&A for growth. And even you are spending more of your time with external business development activities. Does this experience with Omega give you pause on M&A generally? Will it cause you to reassess your desire to expand globally? Is this a European thing? How does this experience \u2013 how does this change your priorities in terms of M&A? And should we continue for you to do M&A over the course of the year in terms of size of deals, types of deals? Does it even make sense for Perrigo to continue along that path just given the setbacks with Omega? Thanks very much.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thank you for the question, Jami. I would say a couple comments. Number one, I've had the pleasure of working with the Perrigo team for almost 10 years now, and I would say that through those 10 years, we've done 29, 30 different transactions. And so I accept that there's some challenges that we have to work with on the Omega business? Yeah, absolutely. But that's nothing different than every other acquisition we've been a part of. Some go faster, some go a little slower.","The European market is one right now that is a little bit slower in terms of \u2013 we don't take \u2013 we don't blame it on it but certainly we knew that the FX for the euro was coming down. I mean there's a lot of things that were moving on it, but it makes me still believe, though, that this is a phenomenal future opportunity for us from the point of view of giving us this geographic expansion opportunity, allowing us to move from six countries, where we compete before Omega, to 39 countries. So we are still very excited about what Omega brings to us.","On the question though \u2013 or part of your hypothesis, I want to make sure I'm very clear, we still believe that the Perrigo organic growth rate, without any acquisitions, still in that 5% to 10% range. And I know you know that with many different companies, I think that you'll find that a 5% to 10% growth rate in a business that is 70% of our sales are in the consumer side is a very good consumer-facing business, because you don't find many there growing at that rate. So we're still very optimistic about our organic growth rate in the consumer-facing part of our business.","Do I still believe though there's a chance to do a growth rate that is about half of the business in organic growth rate and then half of the growth being inorganic? I still believe that makes a lot of sense for us because there's so many more things we could put on the back of our truck that's at Perrigo today going to these large retailers and\/or in Europe that we're going to continue to look at them. And I've said them before to you, I think that for us, we can continue to look to expand in animal health. We can continue to expand ophthalmics, pet care, diabetes, adult nutrition. We do think there's some additional geographic expansion especially in Europe where we think we can bolt on some additional products to our current Omega infrastructure.","So I don't think it changes my view at all. We think we still got a tremendous opportunity with Omega and, importantly, good opportunities with M&A. Thank you. Operator, next question.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jason Gerberry with Leerink Partners.","Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Jumped on the call late so apologies if I missed this, but could you provide a little more explanation of what's happening at the tax line? 14% on the quarter is the guidance; I guess 14% was a couple hundred basis points lower than we were forecasting. Just wanted to get your views in terms of the sustainability of that as a lower tax rate? Thanks.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Judy, you want to speak to that?","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Absolutely. So the quarter was slightly below our own expectations. We had been anticipating a rate more in the 16% zone. In the quarter just ended December, there was a mix shift. We were not where we expected to be with earnings before tax in Europe where our jurisdictional rates are relatively higher and therefore you see the overall rate lower in Q4.","Looking forward, though, the approximately 14% effective tax rate \u2013 adjusted effective tax rate that we're targeting for the full year is a component of jurisdictional mix of our businesses, as well as the programs put in place that we announced on October 22, 2015, with respect to capturing better value and optimizing our tax line through the global supply chain initiatives that have enormous operational activity behind them at the moment. So those will contribute to an approximately 400 basis point improvement in our tax rate versus our previous run rate tax rate in the past.","Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Partners LLC","Should we be thinking about sort of 2017\/2018 reverting back to that kind of historical 17%-ish rate?","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. So think of it this way. We were \u2013 post-Elan, we were talking about a rate in the high-teens, so 17%, 18%. With the implementation of the global supply chain optimization, we said we should now be targeting more like a 14% to 15% run rate, all other things equal. So I can never comment on jurisdictional mix changes if we do acquisitions or jurisdictional mix changes with a swing, one country versus another in terms of new product timing. But the new run rate should be more mid-teens versus high-teens because of these global supply chain initiatives. So those initiatives are not one-off, it's changing the way we do business. It's changing our operating model to truly make our global supply chain universal.","So all of our operations being run from that one center of excellence, it doesn't revert back, not like a restructuring plan where you lose the year-over-year basis. It really is a change in the way the company operates, and therefore, you have a sustainable base to build off of for the future.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of David Steinberg with Jefferies.","David Michael Steinberg - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Ever since you bought Elan, there's been some discussion about whether the TYSABRI royalty stream fits for the long-term plans of the company. Just curious what your current thinking is on the subject. Are you intent on keeping it at this point? Are you looking to divest, and if so, would you only divest it as a whole entity or in pieces? And if you are looking to divest it, what sort of interest is there in the marketplace, particularly given the looming competition down the road from Roche? Thanks.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Let me probably restate a couple things and then just go forward. We, as we look at TYSABRI, still believe it's a great product. We believe we've got a great partner. We believe it's a product that's very important, and the category of highly-effective drugs is even going to be more important for patients with MS. So we like what we set \u2013 where we sit with it.","We also believe it's got a very long life. I mean because of the fact that it's a biologic with a REMS program, we think it's going \u2013 it will be very difficult to genericize. Having said that, I would say that we will continue to assess what's the right thing to do with this product. I would only say that right now, as we think about this from a point of view of strategy, as we think about any potential to monetize part or all of it, we can do part or we could do all of it to part answer one of your questions. I would say, though, that we're only going to do something like that if it's in association with what we think is a significant transaction. We just don't want to obviously just put it on our balance sheet \u2013 cash on our balance sheet.","I think if we do something, look to us to do that relative to some other transaction as a company. But we sit here today, we clearly are aware of the Roche product but we think we've got a great partner in Biogen, and importantly, we think the highly-effective category of MS drugs are only going to continue to expand as, importantly, patients look for better and better therapies in MS. So we'll make decisions as we get to that point as it would relate to other strategic alternatives for us. Operator, the next question.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Maris with Wells Fargo Securities.","David William Maris - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning, Joe. Good morning, Judy. Just building on a couple questions that others have asked, I'm going to ask it a little bit different way. I understand that M&A is still part of the strategy and before GPS was on every phone and every car, whenever I'd go on a road trip and know where I'm going and then ended up a little bit off, my wife would say, pull over and I sometimes would decide to keep driving. And it's always better to pull over and kind of get your bearings.","Why \u2013 how are you going to address shareholders that, say, over the next few days I'm sure \u2013 why not put a moratorium on deals for the next little bit? Buybacks and debt paydown is pretty straightforward \u2013 no risk to those. And with all the management changes, comp changes, why hoist more deals on a management team that's in a transition? Why not just wait? Is the environment for M&A so uniquely good right now that you don't want to miss things? So maybe if you can address, why not just wait for a year or two or until you right things before doing any further M&A?","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So, David, I guess a couple comments. Number one, I start with we believe that the strength of our business in the Consumer Healthcare side of our business and the Rx side of our business are still very strong businesses, and we think that they are still \u2013 there's still opportunities there to look to, as I said before, put one more item on the truck that's going from Perrigo today to one of our large retailers. So, we're going to keep looking at those opportunities. Do I take the point that you're suggesting, though, that we need to continue to improve the Branded Consumer Healthcare business and put a focus on that? The answer is absolutely yes. There's no mistake about that, some of the things that we're working on.","But I want to make sure my message comes across. We think the Branded Consumer Healthcare business is a great business. They've done some great things with new product launches, but is there some things that we think we can help them to improve as we bring some of the Perrigo processes into their business? Yes. We do think we're going to do that and we will spend the time to do that. But we've got an organization that has certainly a lot of opportunities to think about additional M&A, and we'll think about it.","I don't want to suggest to anybody, though, that M&A is going to be \u2013 we're going to do it just \u2013 no matter what the cost. We're going to be smart about it and disciplined about it just like we have been in the past. Therefore, we have an alternative; we have a share repurchase opportunity. We're always going to trade the return on investment for doing A or doing B. So I think the essence of your question is, are we going to look at it strategically and trade it off versus share repurchase? Yes. We will do that, and I think Judy tried to capture that in her comments.","But there may be some opportunities that we think are, from a timing point of view or a strategy point of view, maybe very important to us, and we're going to look at those for the next 12 months. And we don't think putting an absolute moratorium makes sense. It would just simply be smart and disciplined, as we always have been.","David William Maris - Wells Fargo Securities","Thank you.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Operator, next question?","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Sumant Kulkarni with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sumant S. Kulkarni - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. This is more of a strategy question. Is it fair to characterize the underperformance in Branded Consumer Health as a Perrigo or Omega-specific issue, or is there something specific that's fundamentally new that you've learned about managing the competitive dynamics in European branded consumer health markets, given that's a very different ball game relative to the U.S. store brands, where the company's traditional expertise lies?","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I don't think \u2013 so the summary comment \u2013 is we clearly still believe the Omega business is a very strong business. And as we've said at the onset, the team that was running it is still the team that is currently running it, with the exception of one individual. Having said that, we think there's some things we can strengthen, as I mentioned, in terms of a process point of view. We clearly believe there's things we can improve on relative to sales forecasting, sales operation planning, the financial planning and analysis, supply chain. Those are things that we already had in our minds, we just simply want to accelerate some of that as we get closer to the business and look at it, and also see some of the challenges that we saw in the fourth quarter.","So, it's things that we already know we're going to do. I think what I'm really saying is we're just going to accelerate some of these things faster, based on at least what we think are opportunities to improve. But I don't think it's a \u2013 there's any other structural or strategy issues, other than the ones I've outlined \u2013 for us to improve on.","Obviously, the only other comment, I guess, I could say on Europe is a known fact, that just obviously the foreign exchange is different than when we acquired it, but that's something that we all face as a company.","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. Our final question will then come from the line of Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James.","Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James","Thanks. Just want to come back to, I guess, Judy and ask a specific question about gross margins. Obviously, you don't provide guidance on gross margin parameters anymore, but specifically with respect to Consumer Healthcare, we saw a very strong ramp in gross margin performance over the last couple of quarters and then a pretty significant step down this period. And obviously, there's a lot of things that go into that in terms of mix and whatnot. And I think you closed the year around 34.5%.","But how do we think about, going forward, whether the 36%-plus rate we saw in the June\/September quarters, are those kind of \u2013 sort of high-end targets and not really new baseline numbers? Kind of get a sense of what you think the baseline is at this point? And as a follow-up to that, another gross margin question on the generic business. How are the acquisitions of tretinoin and budesonide going to impact the gross margin line?","Judy L. Brown - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","All right. I'll take the lead-off with Consumer Healthcare. You're right; we stepped back from giving very granular line-by-line segment margin analytics in our guidance. But suffice it to say, the Consumer Healthcare team, you have to give props to Jeff Needham and his entire organization. They have done a yeoman's job in years when there have not been the enormous switch products coming in their portfolio, but blocking and tackling, bringing dozens of new products to the market, positioning those products well, fighting the fight in a world of more challenging pricing dynamics out in today's market, taking advantage of good commodities buying and taking advantage, frankly, of the comments, Joe's talked about the operating model of Perrigo and our lean manufacturing efficiencies that we've continued to get over the years. That team has capitalized on that.","So you've seen the margin expansion. If I think about 2015, we've gotten 37% gross margin, almost 38%. Yes, it was \"down\" to only 35% in the fourth quarter, but that \u2013 we finished the year at just under 36% adjusted gross margin \u2013 which in a year without one giant, blockbuster launch to point to, I think is a phenomenal achievement. And as they margined out next year and thought about their planning, they are still running in the low to mid-30%s in their adjusted gross margin. It varies quarter by quarter with timing of product, and are also looking at working to maintain the types of adjusted operating margins you saw over the course of 2015 as well.","Remember, in my comments around how to think about the year, the balance of the year is always a factor of timing on new products, investments that are coming through down below the line within selling in terms of promotional support, et cetera, that's why I said second half of the year is slightly heavier because of the fact that you've got more launches in the back half. But you're still looking at the team working at maintaining those, I'll call it, 32% to 35% zone, that low 30% adjusted gross margin and very high-teens or around 20% operating margin, just again, thinking off that baseline of 2015 into 2016.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And the rest of the question on the Rx side, if you think about where we were from a gross margin in 2014, slightly below 60%, as you think about where we are gross margin in 2015 full year, slightly above 60%, almost 61%. As we think about the future, there's no doubt that the new product that we plan to launch, whether it be the ProAir product and also the Entocort, the tretinoin product that are now part of our portfolio will help us from a gross margin point of view as we think about our 2016 Rx gross margin. So we continue to see some upside from where we are currently on the Rx gross margins as a result of new products and also the acquisition products.","Joseph C. Papa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Operator, that concludes the call. I just wanted to make a couple of comments. First of all, thank you very much for your interest in the Perrigo Company. As I think about the business and we think about our guidance for the year, I remind you that we're looking at a revenue growth of 10% to 16%, we think dramatically driven by this concept of a durable business model. We","believe that the EPS will grow in that 25% to 29% in 2016. We think that the improvement that we've shown in our store brand businesses is very important to us if you think about how much the operating margins in the Consumer Healthcare moved from 2014 to 2015, and as we think about 2016, we think there's some \u2013 still some slight upside for the operating margin in that business.","So we're excited about it. We clearly know we've got some things to get done with our Branded Consumer Healthcare. We're going to put some focus on that. But importantly, we think that's still a great business for us over the long term as we think about the future of our business, and continuing to grow our business both organically and through M&A.","Thank you everyone for your attention today. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you for dialing in for today's Perrigo Calendar Year 2015 Fourth Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect."]}}
