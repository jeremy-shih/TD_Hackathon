At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Tommy Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Tommy Thomas - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Thanks you, Amber. Good afternoon and welcome to the PerkinElmer third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Rob.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. This afternoon I would like to discuss our third quarter financial results as well as give an update on the progress of our strategic priorities.","During the third quarter, we continued to drive strong operating margin expansion and EPS growth. However, our top-line performance was disappointing. Specifically, adjusted operating margins increased 190 basis points to 18.9% and adjusted EPS increased 13% to $0.68 per share over Q3 last year, while revenue was $548 million, representing a reported organic decline of 2%, and flat when excluding the extra week in the comparable prior period.","Looking first at our end markets, we are seeing market conditions consistent with what we have experienced over the last several quarters. In the areas where we have prioritized as attractive long-term growth opportunities which include reproductive health, emerging diagnostics, food analysis, and pharma services, we continue to see strong demand. However, in government and academic, as well as industrial, environmental and medical imaging, end market conditions continue to be challenging.","Relative to Q3, our revenue performance was negatively impacted by the additional week we had in third quarter last year as well as a more significant headwinds than expected in radiochemicals and our inherently more capital-intensive businesses, including Medical Imaging and Environmental Health. While most of the headwinds are market-related, we believe that our decision to deprioritize certain slower growth segments of the portfolio is negatively impacting revenue growth in the short-term.","Fortunately, from a profitability perspective, the significant traction we continue to generate on operational improvements more than offset this temporary revenue shortfall. In addition, because the areas we are focused on not only grow faster, but also generate much better incremental profit flow-through, the company will inherently become much more profitable as the portfolio continues to shift in the direction we have outlined. This is reinforced by both our Q3 results as well as our financial results through the first nine months. Year-to-date through the end of the third quarter, our growth areas of focus are averaging low double-digit organic growth with operating margins of greater than 25% and incremental profit flow-through in excess of 45%.","Year-to-date, absolute revenue growth is $5 million or 2% organic growth, while adjusted operating income has increased $19 million resulting in gross and adjusted operating margin increases of 100 basis points and 110 basis points respectively, and adjusted EPS growth of 12%. Furthermore, the margin and EPS growth has been achieved while we have increased our spending in research and development by 7%, or 50 basis points as a percentage of revenue.","As we reflected in our third quarter results, we are disappointed by the top-line performance but pleased to see the operational execution continuing to improve gross margins and the ongoing validation of the financial benefits from our portfolio realignment. We will continue to seek inorganic growth opportunities through bolt-on acquisitions and strategic partnerships that support our investments in these areas, as well as review the composition of the portfolio and prune where appropriate as we shift the portfolio to higher growth and profitability.","In addition to the inorganic moves, we continue to accelerate this transition by fueling organic growth through increased R&D as well as other organic moves. In that regard, we announced a significant change in our organization at the end of September, providing what we believe will be a more effective operating structure to facilitate this portfolio shift and better position PerkinElmer to strengthen our core product offerings and better align with our customers' requirements.","As of the fourth quarter, Diagnostics is now a standalone segment, and we formed a new segment, Discovery & Analytical Solutions or DAS. The DAS segment combines our former Research and Environmental Health businesses. These new segments have now replaced our previous Human Health and Environmental Health segments.","Looking specifically at the Diagnostic segment, we have now fully consolidated our clinical business offerings which are subject to regulatory oversight. We see significant growth opportunities across reproductive health, emerging markets, and infectious disease markets, as major macro trends generate over $2 trillion in healthcare spending each year.","Year-to-date, our Diagnostics business is growing about 10% organically, with our top-10 Diagnostic customers growing about 20% over the last 12 months as we continue to drive our reproductive health and emerging market Diagnostic strategy. And as we continue expanding our capabilities in these diagnostics areas, such as our Vanadis non-invasive prenatal testing currently in development and on schedule, we are confident in our ability to open up new opportunities for growth.","Additionally, as part of the recent reorganization, we formed an applied genomics group within Diagnostics by aligning our company-wide genomics offerings to better serve the fast-growing genomics market, particularly next-generation sequencing. Through this consolidation, we can now more effectively differentiate PerkinElmer as an integrated provider, helping customers with their preclinical and clinical applications. Ultimately, applied genomics will provide an enhanced sample to sequence or workflow proposition for NGS applications. The DAS segment on the other hand will be able to better coordinate how we serve our applications-focused customers, especially within pharmaceutical and biotech services and food analysis, which we believe will be strong catalysts for future growth. By changing how we are organized, we are taking the next step in our evolution to drive improved customer focus, facilitate more value-added collaboration, and deliver breakthrough innovations.","During the quarter, we also continued to advance our efforts to improve our operational efficiencies across the organization. While Andy will provide greater detail on the financials, we delivered stronger than expected gross margin improvement in the quarter. Increasingly, the integration of R&D and operations will become even more critical to how we deliver value for our customers, as we more thoroughly synchronize the design and manufacturing of our products. A key driver of our success is our implementation of Lean as we continuously work to enhance our manufacturing, supply chain, and business processes. Andy will share more details on the actions we've been taking, and we are already seeing early wins from our projects targeting quality, cost, capacity, cycle time, and productivity. In the quarter, we also were able to successfully leverage our SG&A spend to fund our increased research and development expenditures.","With regard to innovation, we continue to introduce new products into the marketplace, as offering truly differentiated solutions is an important component of our strategy. Based on our performance in the third quarter, we remain confident that our new product introductions this year will generate an incremental $40 million in revenue. In addition, we continue to increase the importance of new products and innovation throughout the organization.","During the third quarter, we held our second annual innovation summit, which brought together over 175 of our top scientists, engineers, and product managers with several key customers to facilitate collaboration and sharing of ideas. At this event, we also recognized 25 PerkinElmer associates who were responsible for securing two or more patents over the last 12 months. The recent organizational changes announced at the end of the quarter should permit a more efficient use of our R&D spending, as well as better enable us to prioritize our spending toward higher growth areas. These changes, combined with our commitment to increase R&D spending as a percentage of sales, should accelerate the increase of our vitality index over the next several years.","As we approach the end of 2016, our ongoing operational improvements in the business should help mitigate the impact of softer, near-term macroeconomic conditions. Meanwhile, we will continue to direct both our organic and inorganic investments toward our four key strategic focus areas, shaping our company into a faster organic grower with higher margins, stronger cash flow, and lower volatility. But given softer demand for analytical equipment, and as we work through the realignment of our portfolio, we remain cautious on the top-line. We are, therefore, forecasting low single-digit organic growth for the fourth quarter and adjusted EPS of $0.85 to $0.87. Assuming we achieve this guidance, our results for the full year would be organic growth of 2%, adjusted operating margin expansion of 90 basis points, and adjusted EPS growth of 8 to 9%.","I would now like to turn the call over to Andy.","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Thanks, Rob and good afternoon, everyone. I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our year-to-date and third quarter results as well as details around our fourth quarter outlook.","As Rob mentioned, our third quarter performance was mixed as revenues fell short of expectations; however, we continue to make very good progress towards improving our operational effectiveness, allowing us to deliver significantly better gross and operating margins along with strong adjusted earnings per share of $0.68, up 13% from the comparable period a year ago. For the third quarter, adjusted revenues were $548 million representing an organic revenue decline of approximately 2% from the same period a year ago, while year-to-date organic revenues are up approximately 2%.","Looking at our end markets for the third quarter, we continue to see broad based strength in Diagnostics, healthy pharma and biotech demand, lower than forecasted academic and government sales, and essentially flat industrial revenues. We did see significant softness in environmental capital spend, particularly at the end of the quarter, as well as in Medical Imaging, which declined double-digit.","Year-to-date, we've seen significant strength in our focus growth areas as we saw better than expected low teens organic growth in food, double-digit organic growth in Diagnostics, and low single-digit organic growth in pharma and biotech, in line with our expectations.","In contrast to these strong performances, Industrial, Academic, and Government markets have been slower than expected, experiencing low single-digit organic revenue declines with Environmental experiencing a marked deceleration towards the latter part of September. Medical Imaging remains challenging, and has underperformed versus our initial expectations entering 2016.","Looking at our third quarter and year-to-date results by geography, emerging markets remained resilient with organic revenues growing high single-digits in both the quarter and year-to-date, while developed markets softened, declining mid-single digits in the quarter.","Strength in China and India continued with organic revenue growth greater than 20% and 10% respectively in the third quarter with a similar performance year-to-date. We believe that our focus in continued investment in emerging market opportunities is a compelling strategy and we are actively looking to increase our presence in those higher growth geographies.","As to our operating results, third quarter adjusted gross margins expanded 170 basis points to 48.9%, while year-to-date adjusted gross margins expanded 100 basis points to 48.3%, driven by solid productivity gains and a positive mix from strong Diagnostics and Informatics growth, particularly in the current quarter.","We have broadly rolled out strategy deployment and Lean initiatives across the organization with the aim of making meaningful improvement in operational efficiencies and product quality. In addition, we have made incremental investments in Lean talent, assembling a global team of experts focused on teaching and implementing key principles and process improvement tools across all aspects of the company.","As a result, we're starting to see early successes as we more efficiently manage operating cost, which is reflected in lower scrap and warranty expenses year-to-date, as well as the creation of additional capacity within our manufacturing operations. This incremental capacity has afforded us the opportunity to bring in-house a number of previously outsourced manufacturing activities, reducing overall product cost and thereby contributing to incremental gross margin expansion. We see this momentum building in the coming months and years as we expand these efforts across all of our manufacturing and service operations, giving us increased confidence in our ability to meet our long-term goal of expanding gross margin by more than 300 basis points by 2020.","Moving to our operating expenses, we continue to leverage SG&A and reinvest in R&D. Third quarter adjusted SG&A was down 90 basis points with R&D approximately 50 basis points higher than same period last year. The extra week in the third quarter of 2015 was comprised of a full week of incremental expenses, coupled with more modest revenue growth, and this had a positive impact on our year-over-year operating results. Year-to-date, adjusted SG&A is down 50 basis points, driven by prior restriction activities and indirect spend initiatives, while incremental R&D investments are focused on new product development, primarily within reproductive health. Overall, we were very encouraged by our strong third quarter and year-to-date operational performance as we expanded adjusted operating margins by approximately 190 basis points and 110 basis points respectively.","Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with net debt of approximately $800 million and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.8 times. We feel we have significant flexibility to create further shareholder value through M&A and we are actively looking to close on transactions in the coming quarters.","Our operating cash flow generation remains strong with year-to-date operating cash flow of approximately $200 million, as compared to $160 million in the same period last year. We are beginning to see improvements in our working capital performance driven by system enhancements, which are facilitating our collection efforts, as well as our Lean initiatives, which are helping to lower our global inventory requirements.","Turning to our segment results for the third quarter, Human Health organic revenue was essentially flat, with Environmental Health declining 5% as compared to the same period a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, Human Health organic revenue was up 3%, with Environmental Health flat as compared to the same period last year.","This will be the last quarter we will be operating our operating segments in this format. For the fourth quarter of 2016 we will report our segment results as Diagnostics and Discovery & Analytical Solutions, or DAS, and we expect to have restated results posted to our website ahead of our fourth quarter analyst conference call.","From an end market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the third quarter of 2016, with Diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue and Life Sciences Solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue.","As I mentioned earlier, we had strong and broad based demand across our Diagnostics portfolio, which resulted in a high single-digit organic revenue growth in the third quarter. All of our Diagnostics franchises continue to experience healthy growth, led by Haoyuan blood screening, which grew over 50% in the quarter. We also saw strong demand for our new India lab services and forecast that demand to continue.","As Rob mentioned, our top-10 Diagnostics customers in both developed and emerging markets continue to rely on PerkinElmer for their critical needs, with sales over the last 12 months growing over 20%, further validating our reproductive and emerging market strategies.","Organic revenue in our Life Science Solutions business declined low single-digits in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the extra week in the comparable period last year, which disproportionately impacted our OneSource service offering. We experienced modest growth in academic and government end markets in the third quarter, as pharma and biotech markets remained resilient after adjusting for the extra week.","Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represented approximately 38% of adjusted revenue, organic revenues declined 5% for the third quarter of 2016. During the quarter, we introduced new products at analytica China and this region continues to be a standout for analytical equipment demand. However, slower than expected results in the U.S. and Europe more than offset this strength.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2016, we believe that our focus on continued operational improvements can help us weather the current slower growth environment. We continue to expect to see solid growth in our Diagnostics business, partially offset by slower than forecasted academic and government demand, as well as somewhat softer economic conditions in developed markets. As a result, we are slightly widening our fourth quarter revenue guidance to a range of $610 million to $620 million, representing low single-digit organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $0.85 to $0.87.","This concludes my prepared marks. Amber, at this time, we would like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Your first question comes from Jonathan Groberg from UBS. Your line is open.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a million. So, Rob, can you talk \u2013 I know in kind of your more recent comments you obviously had highlighted that you saw some weakness in Europe. From your comments here, didn't sound as much as \u2013 that you were calling things out geographically; it sounded like you were talking a little bit more around your growth businesses versus your non-growth businesses. So can you maybe just talk maybe a little bit how that quarter you saw develop and if there's anything kind of geographic that stood out to you on the top-line?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Sure. So I would say, first of all, as the quarter played out \u2013 and I think Andy mentioned this a little bit in his prepared remarks. You know, sitting here in sort of the second week in September, we are sort of tracking pretty well to what we would ship historically during a quarter. And again, just to remind everyone, particularly on the instrument side, it has a tendency to be fairly back-end loaded where the service and the reagents, let's say our Diagnostic business, is more consistent through the quarter, but clearly the instrument business is back-end loaded. And again, probably second week in September we were sort of tracking maybe even a tad better than what we had historically seen to get to the sort of 2% growth that we had guided to. I would say the last couple weeks of September, we saw particularly on the capital side, a fairly amount of deferrals or push-backs \u2013 push-outs. And I would say, we've seen that in the past, but normally there was the ability either to pull things in or to readjust and still achieve our revenue number. And unfortunately, we were unable to do that in the last couple weeks of this September. So the real shortfall was on the capital side of things, and our sense is, in talking to some of our customers, is there was a real interest in delaying capital purchases unless it was absolutely necessary. So whether it was capacity or replacement, we did get a sense that there was some deferral in the back part of September.","To your point on the geographic side, we saw that clearly in most all developed markets. The one area that continued to spend through the entire quarter was China. As Andy mentioned, China was up over 20%. And we saw that fairly broad based. But I would say, outside of China, we did see this capital-intensive side of the business definitely suffer here as we got into the latter part of September.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","And then just sticking with the top-line for a second more, I think you said your kind of forward growth initiatives were up double-digits. And if I remember correctly, I think that's maybe around $1 billion or so of sales. So that means that the other parts of your business, which is a little over 50% would have had to have been down double-digits. You are talking about maybe accelerating some of your corporate development initiatives. How do you, I guess kind of handicap where you are in the cycle when the right time to sell some of these businesses might be versus trying to improve? I guess I'm trying to think about your \u2013 you seem to be a bit more vocal on the capital deployment side and pruning the portfolio side, so I'm just kind of curious how you are thinking about the timing of those actions.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Right. That's a good question. Let me just clarify one thing. So the 10% growth that you referenced on the growth businesses are really year-to-date. And so, the growth business, while they did grow, were probably more in the mid to high single-digits. Again, every aspect of our portfolio was impacted by the additional week over last year. And so that's why, to some extent we are trying to look at this over a little bit longer period, at sort of year-to-date numbers, because I think the Q3 is clearly distorted because of the extra week last year.","But I think directionally your comment is correct where obviously the growth side of the business is doing very well, and we continue to have challenges on the sort of core part of the portfolio. To some extent, that was one of the reasons we moved to the reorganization. We talked about the benefits of having the clinical business and sort of the more application businesses together, and I think it does drive collaboration and it allows us to serve our pharmaceutical and food companies a little bit \u2013 the customers a little bit better.","But the other aspect of it is, when Research and Environmental was separate, it was a little harder to be more aggressive on pruning some of the product lines, because as those businesses were separate we became a little bit of a sub-scale in areas like front end and some of the other areas. So I think one of the things that this reorganization does I believe, is allows us to get a little bit more aggressive on the pruning side in addition to the other benefits of the collaboration, the R&D, the manufacturing scale, and serving our customers. The other thing obviously is, we want to make sure as we prune the portfolio that we've got a great foundation to build upon. And so it was important for us to get the organizational structure right. It was important to get our operating execution right, so that again, as we make the portfolio moves that we're not as disruptive to the bottom line. We recognize as we make these portfolio moves that we will disrupt the top-line, but we're trying to do as best we can to maintain the margin expansion and the EPS growth that we've talked about.","Therefore, it was important to make sure that the flow or sort of way that this was staged was to make sure that we had the organization, the operation and execution, and then we could start to be more aggressive on the pruning of the portfolio.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. Could I just \u2013 and one last one if I could sneak it in?","Rob, do you mind just \u2013 I think it's a nomenclature thing maybe to some degree, but I think what you said around environment \u2013 can you just remind us what you include in environmental, because some firms, well, they talk about industrial versus environmental, I think not everyone is talking about the same thing. You mentioned your food business was strong. And so, can you maybe just clarify kind of when you talk about environmental being weak -","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, no I think that's fair because we do split food from environmental and from industrial. And so when we talk about environmental, we're talking about something in \u2013 about 10% of our revenue, and it's largely in air, water, and soil. So that's how we would define environmental, whereas food, because \u2013 as that's become a big area of focus for us, we have sort of separated that. And then we have, industrial would be \u2013 the other areas, which would be more for us, petrochemical, fine chemical, and those types of areas.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, Rob.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just as we take some of the commentary and try to put it all into context, it would be really helpful if you could speak to the businesses, excluding instrumentation. Do you have a view on what consumables growth \u2013 maybe consumables and other repeatable business growth was in the third quarter and how that compared to the first half?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, so the consumer business grew. Services was sort of flat to up a little bit. And of course services is probably the business that's most impacted by the week. So \u2013 of course that gets distorted a little bit as \u2013 the consumable business. And the instrument business was down sort of mid-single digits. So again, it was really more of a capital-intensive period. And of course if you look at the areas outside of Diagnostics, then you can imagine, the instruments was down even greater than that.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then just looking at the margins, were there any concentrated cost actions taken in the quarter, given the environment that we should contemplate as we think about the sustainability of margin expansion? Thanks a bunch.","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Sure. Well, Steve, this is Andy. We had two things \u2013 we obviously had very strong gross margin, and we had very good SG&A leverage. On the gross margin side, we are seeing an acceleration maybe slightly faster than we had forecasted going into the quarter from our Lean initiatives. So I think, of the upside we saw in the quarter versus our guidance, about a third of that was due to productivity gains. And then the rest of that was really more mix, where we saw high growth in our Diagnostics and Informatics franchises.","On the SG&A side, a lot of it was around our indirect spend initiatives. We did want to go in with a bit of cushion, so we did accelerate some of our cost controls in the quarter. I think that we'll continue to do that, and we also had some favorabilities, given the comparison last year with the five weeks \u2013 the extra week of cost. But that was probably less. So I think we'll continue to have that as a lever, and I think that was really the primary reason we saw the upside to our forecast despite the top-line decline.","Operator","And your next question comes from Dan Arias from ZE (30:05) Citigroup. Your line is open.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, hi, good afternoon. Rob, what's your outlook for the Medical Imaging business at this point? Is that a down double-digit business for the year, and, I guess, how far are you thinking you might be from a trough at this point?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Well, I would say \u2013 I think Andy mentioned it was down double-digits in the third quarter. We're not forecasting that it continues at that rate. And I think it sort of improves a little bit here in the fourth quarter, probably still be down sort of mid to high single-digits is what our current forecast. And the whole key for that business is to continue to get some new products out into the marketplace. We've got a new cassette product that we are getting out and to continue to diversify away from some of the end markets that are a challenge; I would say specifically the radiology end market. So, getting more into some of the industrial applications and some of the other areas that we are seeing some growth. But our forecast right now for Q4 would be more sort of mid to high single-digits, which, again, that would put them down for the year in that sort of range of sort of high single-digits.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then maybe on the newborn screening business, specifically in India, if we look ahead to 2017 revenues, do you think that you can start to benefit from tests per birth going up there once we get through the pilot programs, or as we think about next year, should we think about that being a 2018 contributor and not necessarily something that falls into the 2017 timeframe? Thanks.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Well, newborn screening continues to do very well for us. It has a strong Q3, and if you look at year-to-date it continues to do quite well. The growth drivers are both in the developed areas, to your point, Dan, where we continue to expand the menu, and we continue to see nice traction there, as well as the emerging markets. Particularly, China continues to see very nice growth. We're seeing growth both in the birth rate, which is up fairly significantly during 2016, as well as the expansion of the menu in China. And as we've talked in the past, we continue to see opportunities in other emerging areas that have expanded. So I think we continue to feel like the newborn screening area should be a high single-digit grower going into 2017 and beyond.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Rob, can you provide a little more color on the environmental drop-off? I know you said it was U.S. and Europe, but any additional color? And then, across the portfolio did you see any improvement in trends in October?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So, I would say the environmental shortfall was \u2013 again, going back to my comment, was everywhere other than China. China, we continue to see good investment in the sort of air, soil, and water. So outside of China, it was fairly broad based; it was both in the U.S.; it was Europe. It was down fairly significantly. I think some of that might be a little bit of product positioning for us, where we had scheduled to get some new products out, and while they got out, they got out late. But clearly, Environmental was in the developed areas, a headwind for us in the third quarter. With regard to October trends, I would say, we saw October trends improve up from the back half of September, but still, concerning to the point where \u2013 again, given the significant miss on the top-line in Q3, we just thought it was prudent to be sort of conservative here as we guide on the top-line for Q4. So, a little bit of improvement in October, but not, I would say significant.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then on guidance, can you help reconcile the fact you beat this quarter on EPS, but the midpoint of the EPS for next quarter goes down by $0.04. Are you baking this metric into -","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","I think it's a function of the concern on the revenue. I think we still feel like we can do a good job on the operating margin, but again, because we guided conservatively on the revenue side, we just thought that EPS guidance was the prudent.","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","And I think the other piece of it, the difference between \u2013 sequentially between the third and the fourth quarter is the mix. Within the fourth quarter we're going to see more of an impact from Environmental Health than we had in the third quarter, where we saw very strong Diagnostics and Informatics revenue.","Operator","And your next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good afternoon.","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Good afternoon.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, as you think about pruning the portfolio, given the strong margin expansion that you have seen there, can we assume that anything that you prune will be basically neutral to EPS?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Well, I think that \u2013 we're trying to get the portfolio in a position from a margin expansion perspective that the pruning of the portfolio will be minimally impactful on the EPS. I think it's probably difficult to say that it wouldn't have any impact.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Now, if we turn around and say, we take the proceeds and use it exclusively to buy back shares, that's a possible way to do that. But I think right now it would be challenging to sort of say, by selling a business and reducing the revenue that it would not have any impact on EPS.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And the share buyback was my next question in terms of sort of what are your plans. It sounds like you are looking for more M&A opportunities. Would you talk a little bit about the buyback plan, what's the share count implications for the year?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Well, I think as we said in the past, our preference would be to continue to sort of add bolt-on acquisitions to the portfolio. Having said that, our share buyback would be determined on basically how we see the sort of size of the realistic acquisition opportunities and sort of availability. And to the extent that we think there are some realistic opportunities to improve the portfolio, I think that would be our preference. To the extent we don't see those, or that the size of those are such that we could do both, then we would buy back share. And I think we've done that in the past and will continue to do that in the future.","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So I think if you're looking at the share count for this year, we're going to be similar to where we were in the third quarter, about 110 million shares for the year.","Operator","And your next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, good afternoon. My first question is I guess a bit of a follow-up to Derik's last question. Andy, in your prepared remarks you did indicate that you are actively looking at acquisitions that could close in the coming quarters. Could you just refresh your M&A parameters when it comes to size of deal, growth profile, willingness to take on dilution? And I'll pause there.","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Sure. Well, I think first and foremost, it has to fit the strategic framework of the company. We also then look at, from a financial perspective, returns. We still look for greater than our cost of capital returns on deals we've made. We've been unfortunate enough to generate those types of returns on the deals that we've undertaken. I think the ones that we think we could close in the coming months will fit that criteria, and from an accretion dilution perspective it's highly unlikely we would do a diluted deal, especially in today's market. I think we really look more at our ability to generate those return on invested capital numbers.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you for that. And one \u2013 I guess one other question. Would you be willing to disclose what licensing and royalty revenue was in the quarter and how does that compare to the last couple of quarters? Thank you.","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","In the third quarter of this year, it was essentially zero. And as far as our expectations going into the fourth quarter, it's going to be minimal. I mean as far as incremental, we obviously get revenues periodically through the year, but as far as significant incremental changes, no. And we did talk about, last year in the fourth quarter we did have some incremental licensing revenue in the quarter. We don't expect something like that to repeat.","Operator","And your next question comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great, thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. First question. Rob, you mentioned softer several times in your prepared comments and then also talking about the realignment being \u2013 or enabling you guys to prune some of the businesses faster. Can you help us think a little bit about the framework in terms of the transition with some organic products coming through the pipeline? And recognizing you don't have a perfect crystal ball around pruning, but is this something that we should be expecting to see here as soon as the fourth quarter, or is this more 2017 continuing on to 2018? Just trying to get a framework. Thanks.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, I would say with regard to inorganic moves whether it's selling or buying, it's hard to predict the timing on those because obviously it's not something that's totally within our control. I would say that's one aspect of it. I would say the other aspect of it is, as we think about making moves, and again, this would be either buying or selling, we want to make sure that to Andy's point it obviously makes strategic sense, but also, we want to make sure that we're sort of optimizing the return for shareholders. And when we think about that optimization, we want to make sure that it's both on a pre-tax and an after tax basis. And sometimes that requires transactions to take a little longer than I think we would all like. So I would say, again, that sort of speaks a little bit to the timing of it. But I would say \u2013 could we see something here in the fourth quarter? We could. But if not, we'll probably see something in the early 2017 timeframe. But again, it's hard to put specific timing around those, because it's not things that are totally within our control.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Understood. And then just two quick ones for me on the product side. With respect to blood screening, kind of where are we in China right now with the full transition to screen their entire blood supply with NAT? And then secondly, the sample-to-answer workflow for sequencing, when might that be available? Thanks.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So I would say on the blood screening, we continue to do very well there. The Chinese government has instituted the mandatory blood screening this year, and so we're seeing sort of a nice ramp up there. We continue to see strong growth, so that business continues to operate well. If you recall, in the fourth quarter of 2015 we had a lot of instrument placements and we're now seeing the revenue flow from that. So that business continues to do quite well. And we continue to feel good about our opportunities to sort of expand there. Oh, and the sample to sequencer is \u2013 I would say we have components of that today, but there's a couple areas we think we've got to sort of develop and add to. To give you a timeframe, it's probably into the sort of mid-to-late 2017 timeframe.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good evening and thanks for taking my questions. Just had a couple for you. First, Andy, was wondering if you could \u2013 was there any impact from, like incentive comp here in the third quarter? Just thinking, as you accrue incentive comp in the first half, has anything reversed here in the third quarter that benefited SG&A?","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","No, there was nothing reversed.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Perfect. And then secondly, Rob, you made a comment about $40 million of revenue from new products. What timeframe were you thinking the new products would generate that revenue? Is that a 2017 event, or -","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","No. That's a \u2013 so we came out in the beginning of 2016 and said we were looking to add $40 million of incremental revenue from new products. And what I was commenting is, based on what we are seeing through nine months, we feel like we're going to be on track to achieve that. So, it was just sort of reconfirmation of the fact that we think we'll be able to add $40 million as a result of new products that were sort of launched in the past 12 months.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Brokmeier from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi, good afternoon. How has OneSource performed, and is there any (43:25) of benefit from grouping that business back with the Environmental business?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So OneSource continues to perform well. I think if you look through the year, it's up sort of high single-digits. So it continues to do well. I mean, Q3, again, because of this one-week impact, wasn't as strong for OneSource. But, again, when you look at year-to-date, it continues to do very well. And we do think that service, in general, will benefit by regrouping Research and Environmental back, because if you recall, couple years ago we sort of split it apart. And I think it has caused an issue relative to some of the areas where we don't have the density, quite frankly. And I think by putting it back together, that is one of the benefits we think we'll get from the new organization.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. And on terms of the new product revenues, I thought \u2013 I don't know if I have these numbers correctly, but I thought that you'd indicated that you had $35 million in revenues in the front half of the year. So if that's correct, does that mean that you're only generating sort of another $5 million in the back half of the year from new product?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Well, I tell you, I don't recall that. I recall having a discussion around $35 million in 2016 and saying we were growing at \u2013 I mean 2015 and growing at the $40 million. So we'll just have to go back and \u2013 circle back and get that.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","All right. I thought it was $18 million in the first quarter and $17 million in the second quarter but \u2013 okay. Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up on the new product question. Just curious if you could quantify how much contribution, either on absolute dollar or percentage terms you expect in fourth quarter organic growth?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","You know, I think it's been running in the sort of $10 million to $12 million a quarter, to tell you the truth. So I would assume it's going to be similar to that in the fourth quarter.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on capital allocation. If we just look back the last few years, you guys have been pretty opportunistic on buying back stock when you get a good chance. Given your earlier comments on the M&A aspect, wondering if we get to some point in the first quarter and you aren't able to close a deal that you want. Is it possible that we might see some use of your cash to buy back stock?","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, Isaac, this is Andy. We obviously look at the tradeoffs between M&A and buybacks as well as the timing, and if we see some of these slowing, I think we're going to generate some pretty strong cash flow. So I could see us taking some shares out of the system if the M&A doesn't come as quickly as we'd like.","Operator","And your next question comes from Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hey, Rob, on the re-org with the split of Diagnostics and then can you talk to specifically the analytical instrument business? I know you have always enjoyed a pretty top position in the world, but what do you want to accomplish with analytical, you know, manufacturing, distribution? What are your thoughts there?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So I think, to your point, we want to continue to be sort of the top player in that. I think PerkinElmer has got a good brand in analytical instruments. I think the opportunity we see of putting it together with the research is, in a couple end markets I think we'll be able to hopefully drive better coordination, particularly in the pharmaceutical area where we go call on those customers on a research \u2013 sort of drug discovery area, we think we can get some leverage. I think the service thing we talked about, I think specifically in food where we have some assets, again it \u2013 sort of we're in the research area, but are also in the historical Environmental area. So I think we should be able to continue to sort of try and be at that preeminent position, particularly in the areas of, like inorganic, materials characterization, and thermal. I think those are the areas where I think we've got a strong position and hopefully we'll continue to maintain that and grow it.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","And then on the China business for Diagnostics, it's been obviously a success story there. What are plans on that? And also, what are you \u2013 are you seeing that market pick up with the release of the five-year plan in March? I mean \u2013 so can you talk to the dynamics following the release of the plan, and, you know, what do you want to do next in that market?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So we \u2013 I would say we have continued to see very strong growth in China. I don't know that I could sort of attribute anything to the release of the five-year plan. I would say where we've seen it a little bit more is on the research side in areas like this precision medicine initiative, and an increased focus on food. They've come up with some new regulations on food where they are looking at the entire food chain. I would say, there I think we have seen a little bit of an inflexion, probably a positive. But Diagnostics has been strong, continues to be strong there. And I think we're well positioned in sort of several facets. We talked about newborn; that continues to do well. We continue to see very strong growth on the prenatal or the maternal fetal side.","Of course, we mentioned blood banking, and then of course our infectious disease area. So I think across those businesses, I think we feel good about it. So one of the areas where we're focused on is, we are seeing increased pressure on local manufacturing of products. And I would say, to a large extent we're in a good position there, but we just want to make sure we continue to have the majority if not all of our Diagnostic products manufactured locally. So that's a big focus for us, to make sure, as it becomes more challenging, both from government tenders as well as local competition that we've got a strong capability to produce everything and fundamentally design everything in China.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow-up on the capital equipment commentary and just dig in. Do you think any of the softness was simply timing-related? And how does that roll into the fourth quarter guidance you gave?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Well, we do believe some of it is timing. It's hard to determine at this point how much of it was. There's \u2013 I would say, at this point a lot of the information we have is sort of more anecdotal, right? You hear people talk about, you know, are they deferring things until after the election? Are particularly academic or government budgets on hold a little bit? So we're sort of anxious to see whether or not if that happens. But probably some of it was deferred spending until a little bit more certainty from whether it's a geopolitical or economic condition. Because we do believe some of these things are \u2013 that were sort of pushed off, will be needed or required at some point, again, whether it's for capacity expansion or just replacement.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And there has been a little bit more noise on the academic\/government side this quarter. Is it more nuanced within that, either by product categories or academic versus government? Just any additional color would be great. Thanks.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","For us, it's probably more on the academic side than it is government. And we can tell you, the area we see it probably most acutely is in our imaging area. And for example, I think you saw virtually no S10 grants over the last 90 days, so we clearly have seen a slower funding environment on the academic side. And we saw it, as I said, again, mostly in the research area.","Operator","And your next question comes from Catherine Ramsey from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, this is actually Emily on for Catherine. So I guess turning towards newborn screening, how many tests per birth are you seeing right now in China, India, and the U.S.? And then how have birthrates been trending in comparison to last year?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Okay. So in the case in China, it's starting to vary fairly significantly. I would say if you look back a couple \u2013 maybe a year or two ago, it was either two or four. We are starting to see certain areas like \u2013 particularly around Shanghai and a couple of the large cities start to implement mass spec, so we have seen a ramp up in almost sort of a bifurcation. You still, out in the West, continue to see in the sort of two to four area, but on the East, and particularly in the large cities, you are starting to see menus now get up to sort of 15 to 20. But I would say on average, in China right now we're probably six or seven. But there is sort of a movement into higher menus.","In the U.S. right now, the standard of care is 29, as you may know. We're probably in average in the States in the sort of low-40s. And then if you look in India right now, we're only testing right now. We've got four pilot programs; two of those pilot programs have moved into actual full-fledged programs, and to the most extent, of those four, they are in the sort of four to six range as far as the menu. So it varies a fair amount. Obviously, U.S. is by far the highest number.","Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks. And then the birthrates in comparison to last year?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So the birthrates, I would say globally it looks relatively flat, and I would say similar in the U.S. for us. Earlier in the year, we were seeing a little bit of a \u2013 sort of a positive trend on rates. We've seen that come down a little bit now, and I would say that's flat. China is very strong; China has probably mid-teens growth rate. And when our people in China sort of dissect that, we think probably about 10% of that \u2013 or 10 points of that is because of the sort of change in the zodiac sign, and we think probably 5 percentage points is because of the second child.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Mishan from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Aubrey Tianello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys this is actually Aubrey on for Matt. Can you hear me okay?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Sure. Yeah.","Aubrey Tianello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that the decision to deprioritize certain areas of the portfolio is also slowing sales growth a little bit faster than you expected on your last guidance update. Could you maybe just parse out how much of that impacted the third quarter and your guidance going forward versus a change in market demand?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So I would say, to determine that precisely is hard. But we believe it's having an impact, because as we've sort of announced some of these changes, we have seen for example in the sales organization or in some product management, we have seen a little bit of turnover, not probably unexpected, and so we're backfilling with individuals there; I would say are more consistent with the strategy. But we think some of that disruption is having an impact, I would say probably more in the sales organization or product management. I don't think I can give you a exact number, but when we look at \u2013 clearly in Environmental Health, we think that had an impact.","Aubrey Tianello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Got it. And then I just wanted to touch on free cash flow. Are you reiterating your guidance for $300 million? And if so, what gives you confidence that you are going to see an inflection in the fourth quarter?","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Well, I think that if you look at last year \u2013 our most significant quarter is the fourth quarter. For us to hit the $300 million, it's going to require some very significant working capital improvement, given the slightly lower earnings. I think the team is basically been tasked with still delivering the $300 million. I will say it's going to be a bit harder. But that is our goal, and if we can do somewhat similar to what we did a year ago, we should be very close. So, we are not coming off of it at this point. It's just becoming a little bit harder. And really that's overcoming a fairly weak first quarter of this year. So, again, we're sticking with the $300 million, but it's becoming more challenging.","Operator","And your last question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Rob, just a quick question on the pharma business. I know you noted it was up low-single-digits in the period, but any chance you could parse out the deviation in mix between equipment and instrumentation and in the software and service components, which I imagine were much more stable in the period. Any change in the end markets? And then I got one follow-up for Andy.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Sure. Okay, so if you look at \u2013 as you said, software informatics saw good growth in the quarter. Service grew, but not what you would normally expect in sort of the high single digits, I think because of the weak \u2013 one less week year-over-year, but this still grew (57:11). And we saw pressure, mostly again on the capital equipment side, so whether it was in plate readers \u2013 I mentioned the fact that imaging was down a little bit on the academic side. I think on the high content side we continue to see growth, and, of course, radiochemicals was a drag.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. So then, Andy, one for you. In terms of the EPS bridge for the year, is there anything specific that contributes to the higher purchase accounting adjustment in terms of the bridge between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS for the year? (57:47).","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","No, the majority \u2013 the majority is the \u2013 basically the amortization. We have that. That should be detailed in our reconciliations within the press release. But if you can't find it, let me know and I'll get that to you. It should be in our documents that are on our website.","Operator","I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Rob Friel.","Robert F.

The [EPS beat] was attributable to the higher organic revenue growth in the quarter and the slightly lower tax rate than planned.","In addition to the impressive financial performance, each of our two businesses made notable progress on our objective to invest in high growth areas, while shifting our portfolio towards those opportunities that are best aligned with our capabilities and expertise.","Given our results and positive expectations, moving ahead we feel confident in raising our full year revenue and profit guidance, which I'll speak to you in a few minutes.","Turning to end markets, Diagnostics, which now represents 40% of our revenue and our largest end market grew 62% on a reported basis and 7.5% organically with core Diagnostics business growing mid-singles organically and EUROIMMUN growing mid-teens organically.","Within Life Sciences, which represents about 35% of our revenue and includes sales of our pharma, biotech, academic and government customers, revenue grew 12% on a reported basis and 7% organically.","Sales to pharma and biotech increased high single digits organically and academic and government sales increased mid-single digits organically. The remaining 25% of our revenue is in the applied markets and includes our industrial, food and environmental customers and increased 7% on a reported basis and organically 2%.","Sales to environmental and food customers grew mid-single organically, but were offset by some softness in the industrial markets. We are very pleased to see our two largest end markets Diagnostics and Life Science growing high single digits through a combination of favorable market conditions, as well as our respective strong market positions and excellent execution.","So in addition to being pleased with the breadth of our growth this quarter, I am also very excited with the progress on our initiatives to increase profitability. While operating margins contracted in the quarter as we anticipated, we've made very good progress on both reducing product costs through low cost sourcing and supplier consolidation and collaboration.","In addition we are on track to deliver over 15 million savings in manufacturing costs in the next two years through the deployment of our lean processes and footprint optimization. As a result I remain confident we will achieve the operating margins goal of 70 to 90 basis points of improvement for this year, as well as 22% operating margins by the year 2020.","Also during the first quarter, we continue to make very good progress on the key growth initiatives we outlined earlier in the year that we expect we\u2019re able to achieve high single digit organic growth by 2020. The integration of EUROIMMUN continues to go very well.","In the U.S. the combination of our commercial and regulatory resources is already yielding some nice wins, as evidenced by recently placing in number of our new automated ELISA workstations with one of the large reference labs.","In addition, we received FDA approval for two lupus detection assays as our combined regulatory resources continue to submit new test, and we now expect an additional 12 new assays to improve this year. We\u2019ve also transitioned to service of all EUROIMMUN equipment from third parties to PKI engineers, which will reduce costs and improve response time with consumers.","And while we continue to prioritize integration of U S portion of EUROIMMUN, the technology and commercial groups globally are identifying many additional gross synergies across the portfolio between EUROIMMUN, the greater reproductive health business, our China Diagnostic business, applied genomics and our tool of immuno diagnostics business in India. I look forward to updating you on these opportunities on later calls.","One of the key drivers to our future growth in diagnostics is for Vanadis non-invasive prenatal testing solution. A research study recently published in Nature Scientific Reports detail the first clinical proof-of-concept data demonstrating the ability to apply Vanadis assay in the detection of trisomy 21 in maternal plasma. We look forward to receiving CE Marking shortly with shipments commencing in second half.","The third focus area in our Diagnostic business is our whole genome sequencing service from PerkinElmer Genomics. In the first quarter, we processed about 5000 samples and remain on track to reach the $8 million to $10 million of revenue for 2018 at attractive margins.","The ramping of some exciting partnerships with other leading organizations in the genomics field that together make new inroads in the areas of rare disease research, as well as genetic testing of healthy populations.","To mention just a couple of recent highlights, we announced the Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy as selected PerkinElmer genomics as its partner to perform full genome sequencing of the entire [Duchenne gene] using a new comprehensive assay.","We are also collaborating with Helix, also one of the first clinical products with the initial product being the 59 gene panel that the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics identifies as genetic conditions with established interventions aimed at significantly reducing morbidity and mortality.","Turning to Discovery and Analytical Solutions or our DAS business. As I discussed in January, the priorities of the business are shifting from [pre-new processes] in organization in place to operate as a single cohesive business to both accelerating growth and being more consistent.","One of the key components of that strategy is to continue to leverage our informatics and OneSource service offerings to improve our pharmaceutical customer\u2019s lab productivity.","A number of our customers is discussing a lab service model with us where the requirements for connected systems to avoid data silos, linked distributed research, manage complex data sets, and ensure compliance are driving them to a unique OneSource and informatics capabilities. Some of the investments we made last year are starting to fuel growth this year.","For example, at the end of last year we launched our new PerkinElmer Signals Application for research, translational, clinical development and enterprise analytics and search, which has led to one of our top global pharma customers selecting our analytics platform to power its in-house clinical trial review program.","Also we launched the new version of [Kendro] with significantly increased functionality, including biologics, which has experienced good uptake in the market."," Going forward, we believe the Kendro offering, which is used by 35,000 scientists can be better leveraged to increase connectivity and ultimately revenue with our scientific customer base.","Another important component of the DAS growth strategy is to accelerate our growth in China and emerging markets with increased investments to build local capabilities that address unmet needs.","In the first quarter, the DAS organization continued improving localization in emerging markets by expanding manufacturing capabilities. We are now producing three product lines in China and expect soon to close on a small acquisition in China and to expand our elemental analysis products.","For the DAS business, China grew high-teens in the first quarter with broad base growth across life sciences and applied market.","Finally both businesses will continue to develop innovative new products to support our customers and help solve their most pressing challenges. We are again targeting $50 million of incremental revenue from new products, exclusive of EUROIMMUN, and through the first quarter we generated $14 million from products introduced in the last year.","So to summarize the quarter, we are off to a great start. Our end markets for the most part continue to be robust. The organization is executing well and we feel good about our ability to deliver on our financial forecast for this year.","However, more importantly, we continued to make very good progress on our strategic priorities that should accelerate both the growth and profitability of the company and achieve the financial profile we have outlined for 2020.","In recognition of both the progress made in the first quarter and the continuing opportunities available to us, we have increased both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year.","While Andy will discuss the details, we are increasing our revenue forecast for the year to $2.8 billion, reflecting slightly stronger organic growth in both our base business and EUROIMMUN, as well as changes in foreign exchange rates since our prior guidance.","We are also increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to $3.60, which is $0.10 above our previous guidance and represents an increase of 24% over 2018.","Before I turn the call over to Andy, I'd like to remind everyone that this will be Andy's last PerkinElmer's earnings call. I would like to take a moment to thank Andy for not only his leadership and oversight of our financial function, but also for the significant role he has played in the transformation of PerkinElmer over the last nine years.","During Andy's tenure, we were able to significantly strengthen PerkinElmer's financial profile, evolve our portfolio, and increased the value of the company. On behalf of the entire senior leadership team and all the employees of PerkinElmer, I'd like to express our sincere gratitude to Andy for his leadership and wish him well.","I also appreciate Andy's commitment to ensure a smooth transition. Our new Chief Financial Officer, Jamey Mock's first day will be tomorrow. However, he has joined us this evening.","I'll now like to turn the call over to Andy.","Andy Wilson","Thanks for the kind words, Rob. And good afternoon, everyone. I also want to express my appreciation to the many inspirational people who have helped me throughout my time at PerkinElmer. I'd like to wish you all and especially our new CFO; Jamey Mock continued success in the future.","I'll now move on to the result for the first quarter of 2018, where I'll provide some additional color on our served end market, summary on our financial results for the first quarter, as well as details around our 2018 guidance for the second quarter and full year.","We were pleased with the start to 2018, as reported revenue increased 25% and adjusted earnings per share increased 15% over the first quarter of last year, exceeding our expectations set back in January.","Adjusted revenues in the first quarter grew to $644 million with organic growth of approximately 6%. Foreign exchange representing a tailwind of approximately 5% and acquisitions adding approximately 14%.","By business segment, diagnostics represented approximately 40% of total sales with organic revenue growth of approximately 7.5% for the first quarter driven by solid organic revenue growth in EUROIMMUN.","Discovery and Analytical Solutions representing approximately 60% total sales grew approximately 5% organically in the first quarter highlighted by strength in the life sciences end markets, specifically from our informatics and OneSource offering.","We are pleased to see continued solid order demand in the quarter and as a result we were able to build additional backlog giving us momentum entering the second quarter. I'll provide some additional color on both businesses in a moment.","We experienced healthy growth across all major geographies with high single digit organic revenue growth in Asia, mid single digit organic revenue growth in the Americas and in Europe. This represents three consecutive quarters of growth across all major geographies.","In the BRIC regions we experienced high teen\u2019s organic revenue growth driven by continued strength in Brazil, a very strong performance in India and mid teen\u2019s organic revenue growth in China.","Moving to the details of our operating results. First quarter adjusted gross margins were 48.6%, up 20 basis points from the prior year on a reported basis and up approximately 100 basis points on an FX neutral basis.","Reported results were favorably impacted by EUROIMMUN and benefits from our productivity initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable mix and the dilutive impact of foreign exchange. Adjusted SG&A was 26.6% up 60 basis points from the prior year with the addition of EUROIMMUN being the primary driver of the increase.","Research and development expenditures were 7.1% of adjusted revenue, up approximately 70 basis points driven by continued investments in Vanadis and the inclusion of EUROIMMUN.","As a result, operating - adjusted operating margin was 14.9% down 110 basis points on a reported basis. On an FX neutral basis, adjusted operating margin was consistent with our plan and down approximately 20 basis points due mostly to the seasonality of EUROIMMUN profitability.","Please note that as of January 1st, 2018 we adopted - recently issued pension accounting standards and have restated prior years. The impact versus our prior guidance is an increase in operating costs for approximately $2 million per quarter with an offsetting increase in other income. There is no net impact to adjusted EPS.","Because foreign exchange is having a greater impact on our forecasted revenue relative to our guidance and EUROIMMUN's cost structure significantly changes our earnings flow through from changes in foreign exchange rates, I wanted to briefly describe this dynamic.","Prior to the acquisition of EUROIMMUN changes in our euro and Chinese yuan denominated revenue resulted in a mid teens operating margin flow through based on the global distribution of our production costs and operating expenses.","As we have discussed roughly 75% of EUROIMMUN's revenue is in Europe and China and is split approximately 45% in Chinese yuan and 35% in euro. However, as most of EUROIMMUN's production and R&D expenses are in Germany over 70% of their expenses are in euros. As a result, this affects PerkinElmer's overall margin flow through on changes in the value of the euro, as our euro expenses now slightly exceeds our euro revenue.","Consequently an increase in the value of the euro relative to the dollar increases our revenue, but results in a slight reduction in operating profit. Also we are now more exposed to movements in the Chinese yuan relative to the euro because the change in the Chinese yuan, euro rate will now flow through at roughly 25% impact on operating profit.","Given the foreign exchange movements in the first quarter, we experienced significantly more reported revenue, but a slight headwind in the P&L as the euro appreciated much more against the dollar than the Chinese yuan.","For the full year, the foreign exchange impact on our revenue based on current FX rates will be approximately $80 million or $55 million more than we estimated at the beginning of the year. However, this additional revenue will add less than a penny of earnings operating earnings based on current rates.","Of course, the flipside of this dynamic is that if the dollar strengthens versus the euro reducing our represented revenues our income will not be materially impacted to the downside.","Despite the current FX environment putting some pressure on operating margins, we continue to expect to deliver strong adjusted operating margin improvement over the remaining three quarters to meet our guided range of 70 to 90 basis points of margin expansion in 2018.","Turning to adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter, we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.03 to $0.63, driven primarily by better organic growth and a lower tax rate. The lower tax rate is a result of recently passed Treasury Department guidance on the new tax law to provide some more favorable outcome than we originally anticipated.","Looking further into the key drivers within our segments for the first quarter, let's start with our Discovery and Analytical Solutions business, where first quarter results exceeded our expectations, driven by strong high single digits organic revenue growth in life sciences versus low single digit organic revenue growth in the applied market verticals.","Life sciences strength was driven by double-digit growth in both OneSource and our informatics business, as well as strong direct discovery sales and high content screening.","Applied market growth experienced mid single digit growth in food and environmental, but was partially offset by softness in the industrial end markets, which we attribute to the timing of instrument orders.","Switching to Diagnostics. Core diagnostics revenue grew 4% organically consistent with our expectations as we experienced strong high single digits growth in the first quarter last year.","In our core Diagnostics business, our infectious disease business, which exclusively serve the emerging markets continues to show strong growth as it increased mid teens during the first quarter with particular strength coming from Haoyuan and Tulip.","The reproductive health business grew mid single digits. A strength in newborn screening in China was partially offset by difficult comparisons in the US. And finally, our applied genomics business was down slightly in the quarter as expected due to strong micro fluidic sales in Q1 of last year.","Broad based growth across all disease states help EUROIMMUN exceed organic revenue growth expectations for the quarter up mid teens. Geographically for EUROIMMUN China and Germany were strong and in the US during the first quarter of this year we delivered over half of the amount sold during all of last year. We remain confident of future revenue opportunities, driven by a focus on innovation, time to market and strong customer focus.","I hope that you've had a chance to read the Nature of Scientific Reports article on the feasibility of our Rolling Circle Amplification Technology for Vanadis for trisomy 21 detection, which we believe to be as accurate as current generation - gene sequencing methods.","As Rob mentioned, Vanadis is gathering clinical data for all three trisomy's as part of their CE Mark application and we continue to expect the second quarter 2018 filing and commercial launch shortly after approval.","Looking down the income statement, adjusted net interest and other expense for the first quarter was approximately $12 million and our adjusted tax rate was approximately 17%, which I refer to - referenced previously.","Turning to the balance sheet. As we announced we finished the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of debt and $180 million of cash. We exited the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.4 times.","Turning to our cash flow performance. Our first quarter operating cash flow from continuing operations was impacted by the timing of pension payment and earn-outs related to Tulip, coupled with a temporary increase in working capital from higher receivables due to new OneSource contract initiated in the period, as well as higher inventory levels supporting production moves in Singapore and China in the first half of the year. We remain confident in our ability to deliver our full year free cash flow commitment for approximately $365 million.","To wrap up the first quarter, we are very pleased with a solid start to the year, as we delivered better than expected organic revenue growth including a stronger than expected performance from EUROIMMUN, which continues to outpace the market.","During the quarter, Vanadis achieved all key milestones and remain on track to launch - to our launch timeline later this year. Our end markets continue to very healthy in both our core and focus areas and we\u2019re encouraged by our ability to build backlog in the quarter.","In addition, we continue to have a good line of sight on adjusted operating margin expansion and free cash flow generation for the remaining three quarters, all of which we believe will contribute to a successful 2018 fiscal year for our key stakeholders.","As Rob mentioned, given our results in the first quarter we are increasing our 2018 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect full year 2018 reported revenue to be approximately $2.8 billion, which represents 5% organic growth in the base business coupled with EUROIMMUN generating approximately $380 million of revenue, which now reflects slightly stronger organic growth and the impact of the current foreign exchange environment.","For the full year, we now expect foreign exchange to be at $65 million tailwind exclusive of EUROIMMUN revenues, which is 40 million more than we estimated in January.","Our organic revenue growth guidance assumes 6% organic revenue growth in diagnostics, excluding EUROIMMUN and 5% in DAS driven by a mix of life sciences and applied markets.","Geographically we continue to expect mid single digit organic revenue growth in the Americas and Europe with mid to high single digit organic revenue growth in Asia. We are taking our full year adjusted earnings per share to $3.60, which represents approximately 24% adjusted earnings per share growth.","Our new guidance incorporates the first quarter out-performance of $0.03, slightly higher organic growth, which adds approximately $0.02 and we now anticipate our full year tax rate of approximately 17% versus our initial guidance of approximately 18.5%, which adds an incremental $0.05 to the remainder of the year.","For the second quarter of 2018, we're forecasting reported revenues of 680 million, which represents 6% organic revenue from the base business, 15% growth in EUROIMMUN and foreign exchange of 5%. In terms of adjusted earnings per share guidance, we are forecasting adjusted earnings per share of $0.86 with minimal benefit from foreign exchange headwinds.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Sara, at this time we\u2019d like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tycho Peterson","Hi, thanks. I guess, we'll kick it off Andy and just say congrats and wish you the best on the transition.","Andy Wilson","Thank you.","Tycho Peterson","As it relates to EUROIMMUN a couple of quick questions here. Can you maybe talk about what we should be assuming for contributions from the US ramp for the business? And then are you going to comment at all on the -- the headlines around buying some assets from Siemens in Europe?","Rob Friel","Tycho, the ramp in US will continue to be very significantly, but of course it's all a relatively small base. So what we're seeing in the US is growth in the sort of 40% to 50% range for the year. But I think as we've said in the past, it will take a little while before it sort of ramps up to the level of significance, but they're making good traction.","With regard to the Siemens discussion, I think at any point in time the people at EUROIMMUN in particularly Winfried St\u00f6cker, who is the founder is continuing to look at ways to invest in the future and to support a significant growth.","In any given year, EUROIMMUN hires anywhere from 175 to 200 engineers to support the growth that they've had historically, which is as you know has been in the sort of the high teens.","What happened in the Siemens situation is apparently they are looking to the exit facility in the southern part of [Germany and Winfried] had some discussions with them where we might assume some of those engineers or in fact some of the facilities. But it's only a discussion phase right now.","The way I would think about it is, you just sort of thinking out a couple of years and saying to the extent that we need to continue to get engineering capability in space this maybe a way to do that, and by the way we\u2019re also wondering if the German government might sort of participate in those transition costs. But nothing definitively, this is just as a discussion phase right now.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. That's helpful. And then for the follow up, you called out the softness in industrial. I know it's only 17% or so the DAS business. But can you maybe just talk a little bit about where you think things are headed for that part of the portfolio?","Rob Friel","Yes, I mean, I think it\u2019s a little bit of timing particularly in where we saw a little bit of weakness was in the chemical sector. I mean, but I would say industrial for us, which is down slightly in the quarter and I would attribute the more sort of the timing of instrument orders. It seems like the market overall is pretty good. We actually saw - saw a growth in the US and the weakness was really more in Europe and Asia.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thank you.","Andy Wilson","Hey, Sara before the next call, I just want to clarify something I said and you can attribute it to all there, it\u2019s being my last call. But the guidance for Q2 topline of 695 and I believe I said 680. But I want to make sure and I confirm that our topline guidance for the second quarter is $695 million. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Patrick Donnelly","Great. Thanks. Maybe just one on China, I think guidance coming into the year was for high single, low double-digits growth there, coming off another strong quarter of high teens' growth it's been well above kind of a guidance rate for a few quarters here. So maybe just update us on your thoughts in the region there. Obviously there has been some macro noise. So wondering how you're feeling about the environment? What market share you're feeling good about and again just so how you're feeling relative to the guidance?","Rob Friel","Yes, I think China continues to be a great market for us. When you look at the growth as I think Andy mentioned it was mid teens. It can be pretty broad based all of this, if you break it into diagnostics, life sciences, and applied markets, they are all double-digit or better. So, I think, we continue to be excited about the opportunities there.","I think the only year we were a little sort of cautious and I think we still continue to sort of look out for the back half and again just be - so I would say cautious about it. But I suspect rather than high single, China will probably be at least double-digits and maybe we'll get it up in the mid teens.","The other thing I would say is EUROIMMUN continues to do very well there as well. I think in the first quarter they were more in the high teens. So we continue to see good demand and like I said pretty broad based.","Patrick Donnelly","Okay. And then maybe just on the capital allocation side, you had a little bit of share repurchase activity this quarter, in spite of the recent EUROIMMUN deal. So I'm just wondering how you guys are feeling about where you are on the leverage landscape and with Jim coming in any changes we should expect going on the capital allocation side?","Rob Friel","Now I don't think there will be a change. I think we still have a preference to add to the franchises with some bolt-ons, as I think I\u2019ve said in the past, unlikely that you would see us go into - what I would call a large deal right now.","So I think our preference is to continue to delever a little bit, but it will be bolt-on acquisitions and then I think as we said in the past at a minimum we'll try and keep the share count flat. So to the extent that we see a little flowed up because of either stock price increases our option exercise, we probably take that out. But I would say no intention right now to significantly reduce the shares outstanding.","Patrick Donnelly","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken, Evercore ISI Your line is now open.","Ross Muken","Good afternoon, guys, and Andy congrats.","Andy Wilson","Thank you, Ross.","Ross Muken","And just in terms of the margin cadence, obviously after Q1 it's a pretty big sequential step-up and Q2 at least in our math doesn\u2019t imply a kind of expansion. So, I guess, one, could you confirm my math it seems sort of too equated, I guess we had some unique dynamic in 4Q of last year, so maybe that's - maybe easy comp.","But is it the math around just the timing of the EUROIMMUN business, which obviously is a weak seasons no Q1 and then steps-up at the incremental drop through from that piece and it gets better sequentially or is this something else that play on that cadence?","Rob Friel","No. I think you have described it exactly as we anticipate it rolling out. First quarter being EUROIMMUN\u2019s seasonally lowest quarter and had obviously a dampening effect as well as the FX. I think we'll see as we get into the second quarter - at the higher end of the range it would ramp through the year as we made progress with EUROIMMUN.","And as you can do the math it will be over 100 basis points in the quarter. Fourth quarter being a little bit of an anomaly where it's an easier comp. So I think all the things you highlighted are kind of how we're thinking about it as well.","Ross Muken","That's helpful. And could you just also confirm because there's a bunch of different pieces as you gave kind of the organics and M&A contribution with or without EUROIMMUN. Was EUROIMMUN about $80 million or give or take in the quarter including the organic growth?","Rob Friel","Correct.","Ross Muken","Okay.","Rob Friel","It was actually $82 million. It will be in our quarterly filing.","Ross Muken","Got it. And just quickly on sort of the base Diagnostics business. So 4%, so you came off a 8% comp last year, sequentially much easier. So I guess this will be probably the lower point of the year is that sort of the view on that segment?","Rob Friel","That's right. We\u2019re looking at sort of second quarter six and then it sort of continues to sort of ramp up from there.","Ross Muken","Thanks, Andy. Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin, Bank of America Your line is now open.","Derik De Bruin","Hey, good afternoon. And once again, Andy it\u2019s been pleasure. Good luck.","Andy Wilson","Thanks.","Derik De Bruin","Hey. Just to follow up on Ross's question. So the core diagnostics organic revenue number, the one that we also [bid] because we're not adding back pro forma contribution EUROIMMUN it\u2019s about 4% on the quarter, is that what it was?","Rob Friel","Yes.","Derik De Bruin","Okay. So the 4% number is...","Andy Wilson","And the way we think about that is reproductive health was sort of mid single and to Ross's point it was a little bit difficult comp in the area. Our infectious disease business which is basically China and India was up mid-teens and we saw sort of just a little slight degradation in what we call applied genomics and it was really driven by the micro fluidics business which had some difficult comps in the prior year.","That can have the tendency to be a little bit cyclical because there is are instruments involved. But reproductive was mid single ad infectious disease was mid-teens.","Derik De Bruin","Okay. Great. And then just two follow-up questions on the diagnostics. I guess what's the next milestone for Vanadis? And the overall I mean, what do you think the [genomics] business will contribute this year?","Andy Wilson","So the next milestone for Vanadis is clearly getting CE Marked. And I think as we've said we're expecting that -- I do know before the end of this quarter, but hopefully by early third quarter. And so the idea would be that - and be able to sell that out in the back half of the year. We don\u2019t have huge sort of expectations for that business in the second half, but call it sort of $5 million $10 million in that type of range.","Your second question was referred to the genetic testing business, are you talking about with regard to 2018 or longer term\u2026","Derik De Bruin","2018, since it's a brand new business.","Andy Wilson","Yes. 2018 we're targeting sort of $8 million to $10 million.","Derik De Bruin","Okay. Great. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll get back in the queue.","Andy Wilson","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel, Cowen. Your line is now open.","Doug Schenkel","All right. Good afternoon. Well, first off I want to welcome Jamie and I also want to thank Andy for all his hard work and help over the years. And congratulations on moving onto the next stage of things.","So in terms of my questions just I guess a couple end market questions to start. Following up on the industrial end market commentary and then earlier question, was weakness more pronounced in any specific geography? And would you be willing to comment on bookings in the segment in the quarter and whether or not you\u2019ve changed your assumption for that end market growth in the context to full year guidance?","Rob Friel","So first of all industrial was down about 1%. So just to sort of calibrate things a little bit, it was up around mid single digits in the Americas. It was sort of flattish in Europe and was down a little bit in APAC. So it's a geographic split.","And I think I mentioned before, it was probably most pronounced in the chemicals or petrochemical side of the business. And again I think that was probably just timing of instrument orders. I would say for the year, we think industrial is probably low to mid single digit growth.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Super helpful. And then on - in terms of the organic out-performance in the quarter, it sounds like generally speaking life science was the key contributor by end market is that right and if so, can you talk about whether a big part of this is your new products potentially tracking ahead of plan in terms of their contribution to the quarter?","Rob Friel","Yes. So first of all you're correct it was life sciences. It was particularly in the pharma and biotech area. Well, having said that, there academic and government was up sort of 6% which is nice to see. But really the over performance came in pharmaceutical and specifically in the service and informatics side of the business. And so I talked a little bit about that is some of that was new product, it was Kendro, it was the new signals offering.","But we are starting to get some nice traction, as we think we're somewhat uniquely situated with regard to being able to sort of meet this need that some of the pharmaceutical companies are seeing - the buzz word is digitalization of the lab.","But it's really trying to make sure that they are getting the right information out of their instruments. And so it\u2019s a combination of having ability to provide the sort of OneSource capability, but at the same time some of the analytics and electronic notebook capability that we\u2019ve had historically. And so that really what drove some of the upside performance in the first quarter.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. And lastly, I guess a similar question on EUROIMMUN. Could you break down how much of the strength in the quarter was the function of I guess you new assays, new customers and I guess those two things versus existing customers increasing utilization?","Rob Friel","No. I don't have the visibility into the customer. What I can tell you though is the growth was broad-based geographically. So whether you're looking China, EMEA or North America, it was also double-digits. So I would also say that the growth was pretty broad-based across the sort of diseases.","So if you look at EUROIMMUN, if you look at allergy, if you look at infectious disease they also saw nice growth. So it was pretty - like I said broad-based, but I couldn't tell you what the split was between new or existing customers.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi. Good afternoon.","Rob Friel","Good afternoon.","Steve Beuchaw","I'll certainly go ahead and echo the thanks and congratulations to Andy, really appreciate everything.","Rob Friel","Sure. Thanks.","Steve Beuchaw","I wondered just as we try to tune up our models, one last time, if you could give us any more quantification on the impact of EUROIMMUN at the EBIT margin line in the quarter? And maybe some update thinking on how that progresses over the balance of the year given the seasonality for EUROIMMUN?","Andy Wilson","Yes. We talked in my prepared remarks, it was around 30 basis points 20 to 30 basis points headwind on the corporation. That will flip as we make progress through the year. It will ramp through the year, the fourth quarter for EUROIMMUN will be the largest impact. So it will go from, let's say negative 30 to I would say something in the 50 to 75 basis points as we exit the year.","Steve Beuchaw","Perfect. And then Rob, I wondered if you could take the conversation around Vanadis a couple more steps. Maybe the data that you saw in the Nature Communications article weren't particularly surprising to you. They were certainly better than we had even hope for.","How is the data that you've seen so far in some of your preliminary conversations, you are impacting - you are thinking on how that assay, how do you priced and how big the potential market is where Vanadis would be a logical fit? Thanks.","Rob Friel","So I think you're - we were pleased to see the success of the study. But I think from a pricing standpoint and I know everybody's nice to see that and we'll have that out soon is we've said for a long period of time that the purpose of this product is really to replace screening, as compared to a diagnostic test.","So we want to make sure, and again the goal here is to really go out into the biochemical labs, so the labs that are doing biochemical screening today with both a simple workflow, as well as a cost structure that is close to that. So again, stay tuned. But that's our thought process around that.","And again, the whole theory is to make sure that the sensitivity of Vanadis is at least similar to the current NGS assays. I think we have some arguments as to why we think it's actually better in a number of serious. But we want to make sure at a minimum that it's similar, but in the argument, easier from a workflow perspective and much more economical.","With regard to the market, I mean, I think we feel - I mean, just as a rough guide, we said, if we can take 15% to 20% of the market we think that's close to $1 billion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Arias, Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Dan Arias","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Rob on the diagnostics side, can you just add a little color to what you're seeing in the genetic testing expansion? How much of that early business is just due to having the samples in hand and being able to leverage that.","Is that something that you're finding is working for you? I know that the thesis going was kind of that exact idea just you would be able to benefit from some of the other business that you are doing?","Rob Friel","I think that's part of it. But I would say when you look at the ramp up it's been not only in the newborn and the bio group business, but we are attracting pharmaceutical companies, we are attracting collaborations.","And I think the reason for that is what we have mentioned before is that we provide not only the genetic analysis, but we show the protein or biochemical analysis. And what we're finding that's distinctive in the marketplace and I think that's becoming very attractive to a number of the collaborators and customers.","Dan Arias","Okay. And then maybe Andy if I could just ask you one final question before you go. I guess it would just be, what are you expecting for interest income this year?","Andy Wilson","I think, right now we're looking at net interest income at about $60 million - just north of $60 million.","Rob Friel","60.","Andy Wilson","Yes. 60, that\u2019s net interest expense. Net interest income, was that the question, sorry?","Dan Arias","That's right.","Andy Wilson","That's going to be around $10 million. ","Dan Arias","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question - I\u2019m sorry\u2026","Andy Wilson","Net interest income and other.","Operator","Our next question comes from William March. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Guys, how are you?","Rob Friel","Good.","Unidentified Analyst","On EUROIMMUN, could you just talk a little bit about the America opportunity with a coming off a small base and saying that it's going to take some time to develop? Is that kind of driven by getting approvals of a critical mass of assays or an instrument? Just maybe what are some goalposts to think about for that becoming a more significant contributor?","Rob Friel","Yes. I think that's a piece of it. I mean, part of it is getting the regulatory approvals. I think as we talked in the past that was not an area that EUROIMMUN had invested significantly","And so, I mean, combined now we have a much more formidable regulatory capability. I think we've already filed, since the closing, some 18 submissions to the FDA. And I mentioned we're excited about getting two of them out already. So that's a big piece of it.","I think the other piece of it is just expanding your commercial presence in the US market and I think the sales force within EUROIMMUN was probably in 10 people or something. And so that's just getting - sort of opening - helping them open some doors, getting a little bit more sort of brand recognition out there.","And then I mentioned the other piece was, we've now transitioned all of their - the service of all of their instruments to PerkinElmer. So I think that's helpful from the standpoint of not only cost, but responsiveness to the customer.","So I think there is a number of components, just increasing awareness, so in some of the trade shows the combined presence of PKI and EUROIMMUN, I think, is helpful as well. So branding, presence, regulatory, I think, those are the main drivers.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. And then on the whole genome servicing business, can you maybe just talk a little bit about that opportunity in terms of the $8 million to $10 million in revenues? You've talked about the collaboration with Helix.","As you think about that offering is it more about trying to drive that as a standalone business or bundling that with some of your other products and services to try and drive maybe more incremental revenues? Thanks.","Rob Friel","So it's really both. And I think one of reasons we were sort of comfortable starting this is because we have a bundling opportunity. We\u2019ve talked about in the past that, we do the screening for newborn and very often the confirmatory test is done through sequencing.","So by us now doing the sequencing we can do both the screening and the confirmatory. I think that was sort of a natural bundling opportunity that was sort of captive business we could go after. Similarly with ViaCord, we've had a number of customers - customers approached us to see whether or not that was something we could do.","So we started the business with the understanding that we had sort of some captive business we could go after. But at the same time, we thought that there was an opportunity to go out and get incremental business. And that was some of the things we talked about before is working with pharmaceutical companies and working with the Helixes of the world, et cetera. And we're starting to see that ramp nicely.","So I think if you look at our $8 million to $10 million of revenue this year, it could be fairly evenly split between both of those opportunities.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Willoughby","Hi. Good evening. Two questions for you. I guess, first regarding your comments regarding the pharma strength being driven by service and informatics. I just wanted you to provide a little bit more color there on whether that's kind of penetrating the existing customers more, share gains or more Greenfield opportunity?","Rob Friel","So, in the informatics area, I think it was penetrating new customers and a little bit of I mentioned as new products come out with ChemDraw in particular and we saw a nice renewal from existing customers. So it's in the informatics a little bit of both.","I would say on the service side, it's probably mostly with existing customers where we continue to expand what we're doing with those customers. But having said that, we do get periodically some nice wins and one in particular we're ramping up in 2018.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. And then I think at least one time or two times you made the comment regarding building backlog and just trying to see if there's any more color on that related to your other comments talking about some timing of orders within your more industrial business?","And I guess I'll follow on to that as just some of your newer equipment system products, so just wondering if there's any comment on how those are doing out of the gate so far?","Rob Friel","I would say the timing in the backlog was probably more in reference to some of the markets that were a little slower in the quarter, mostly notably the industrial. I would also say food as we talked about is mid single. I think we sort of look at the year, I think, that will be a bit better than that.","And then I would say the third area was I mentioned in our core diagnostics business that our applied genomics business was actually down a little bit. I think for the year that's probably going to be high single-digit, double-digit grower. So that's where we saw some pretty good bookings in the first quarter and we think that will build through the year.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. Thanks very much.","Rob Friel","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Rob Friel","Good afternoon.","Brandon Couillard","Quick one for you Andy. In terms of the recent \u20ac300 million note offering, you're not paying down any incremental debt with that? Because otherwise I think there would've been some benefit to net interest expense outlook for the year?","And secondly the CapEx spike in the first quarter some of that EUROIMMUN timing related and what should we pencil in for the full year?","Andy Wilson","Well, there is two things going on. One is we did pay down the revolver, but it is that the net impact on net interest expense is offset by FX. So there really wasn't much savings.","As far as capital was concerned, a little bit of that is timing. We have a couple of fairly big initiatives that we started at beginning this year, I think that will normalize. And some of EUROIMMUN's capital hit in the first quarter, so I think we still feel like that we're going to be within our guidelines on capital for the year, and as a result we still think we can get to 365. So it's really mainly timing.","Brandon Couillard","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Quirk, Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Bill Quirk","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. First question just thinking Andy about some of comments you made on EUROIMMUN, European or euro denominated cost base and revenue exposure in China. Have you guys considered at all moving some manufacturing to China not unlike what you're doing with some of the DAS business?","Rob Friel","Yes, absolutely. EUROIMMUN has already been working on that. So they are in the process of finalizing fairly large facilities in Tianjian. And similar to our approach which is to continue to ramp up manufacturing in China and sort of make products in China for China.","And so that will probably come online later this year but because with the regulatory approval probably we won't see a lot of revenue from that factory probably until \u201919. But that's exactly what we're trying to do is to sort of shift some of those euro costs, euro based costs to Chinese yaun base.","Bill Quirk","Okay. Perfect. Thanks, Rob. And secondly and just staying in EUROIMMUN for a moment. You talked about a number of regulatory approvals in the states trying to expand the portfolio here. Can you just help us think a little bit about should we expect a fairly even metering of assays over the coming call it three years or you're trying to push a bolus out here in 2018? So just trying to get a sense both from R&D spend, as well as how should we think about the US franchise growth?","Rob Friel","I think there is initially a little bolus because quite frankly there was a little pent-up demand if you will. And we've been working hard to trying to get those out as quickly as possible. And I think I mentioned we - I think we filed some 18 or so in the last three months. So I don't know that we'll see that type of pace going forward.","Having said that, it's a little difficult as you can appreciate sort of determining how they hit the market because we're dependent on the FDA regulatory approval, which seems to be getting better, but we'll just have to wait and see.","But clearly there was a much larger amount in the first quarter. But we hope it to be sort of a steady pace, but probably not at the level you saw in the last 90 days.","Bill Quirk","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Leonard, Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. Rob can you update us on your thinking around portfolio pruning. Is there anything we should expect in the scope for 2018?","Rob Friel","I don't think there is going to be anything of significance. We've talked a little bit about pruning some things within DAS and I think we'll continue to look at those. But I don't know that they will be that material.","If I had to give you number it could be $50 million it could be $75 million, it could be something like, but it\u2019s not - I don't know that it\u2019s going to be significant.","Dan Leonard","Okay. And then secondly on Vanadis, could you comment on what publication waterfall looks like to the balance of the year? Are you expecting further papers and what would the cadence look like?","Rob Friel","I think there is two that are sort of in the works right now that we would hope to see in the next - again this is a little difficult to predict, but probably in the next 60 days or so. And then there is I think - there's a number that we expect to come out sort of latter in the year.","Dan Leonard","Okay.","Rob Friel","So maybe in the course of 2018 we'll see three or four.","Dan Leonard","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. And our next question comes from Jack Meehan, Barclays. Your line is now open.","Mitch Petersen","Thanks. This is actually Mitch Petersen on for Jack this afternoon. On the newborn screening business, could you just elaborate on what you're seeing in terms of birth rates and then [how tax] utilization is trying to influence the EM regions?","Rob Friel","So, first of all we\u2019ll say the newborn business continue to do pretty well, but it's not because of birth rates. It's because, we continue to make either expansion of menus or expansion of penetration.","If you look in the US, I think birth rates are probably trending down a point to 1.5 points. And if you look in China for \u201817 they were down, we would say sort of three, in fact, you may have seen the article in the journal today and there was a recent article in The Economist that talked about the challenge that China has right now with their growth targets as their birth rates have sort of been suppressed here a little bit.","So that's something that, obviously, is a bigger issue than just newborn screening. So it's not been driven - sort of the growth in the newborn business right now is not being driven by birth rate globally, but like I said on the other aspect of it.","Mitch Petersen","Helpful. And then I'm talking M&A, could you just elaborate on some of the areas where you potentially like to add to the portfolio? Thanks.","Rob Friel","I would go back and reinforce here is that we've talked about this sort of strategic priorities for growth. So when we look across at the diagnostic businesses continuing to build out our capabilities in emerging markets, it's obviously something that's interesting to us.","I think our applied genomics area is an area where we think there is a significant opportunity to spend our capabilities. I would sort of spite those two out in the DAS area clearly in the pharma services area where I think we built a nice portfolio.","Food, we believe is very attractive and combined with the fact that it's fairly fragmented industry, I think provides a lot of opportunity for us. And I would say in the analytical instrument area anything that can sort of build out our consumable, revenue would be something we would be very interested.","Mitch Petersen","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Rob Friel for any further remarks.","Rob Friel","So first of all I appreciate and thanks for all your questions. And so in closing let me just reinforce that we're all excited about the opportunities moving ahead and confident in the terrific team of employees around the world who are committed to not only driving our mission, but creating even greater value for our shareholders. So thank you for your interest in PerkinElmer and have a great evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"16765":["PerkinElmer (NYSE:PKI) Q4 2011 Earnings Call February  2, 2012  5:00 PM ET","Executives","David C.

My name is Jeremy, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Dave Francisco, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","David C. Francisco","Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the PerkinElmer Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. If you have not received a copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at perkinelmer.com or from our toll-free investor hotline at 1 (877) PKI-NYSE. Please note, this call is being webcast live and be archived on our website until February 16, 2012.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of our Safe Harbor statements that we've outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future, even if our estimates change. So you should not rely on any of today's forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date after today.","And during this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to non-GAAP financial measures we plan to use during this call for the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available as an attachment to our earnings press release. To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during this call that are not reconciled to GAAP in that attachment, we will provide reconciliations promptly.","I'm now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel.","Robert F. Friel","Thanks, Dave. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to report another great quarter for PerkinElmer, rounding out a very good year for the company and a year in which we made significant progress across a number of parameters. Given that Andy will discuss our financial results and key market segments in more detail, I'll provide high-level financial highlights and focus more on our strategic progress, as well as discuss our outlook and guidance going forward.","Turning first to our fourth quarter financial performance, PerkinElmer delivered strong growth in revenue, adjusted earnings per share and cash flow. Revenue grew 15% and organic revenue grew 6% in the period. Adjusted operating margins increased approximately 250 basis points and operating cash flow was $82.5 million, up 95% over Q4 last year. ","Adjusted earnings per share were $0.62 in the fourth quarter, up 38% from the fourth quarter of last year and significantly better than our guidance of $0.49 to $0.51. This much stronger performance was attributable to 3 fundamental reasons. First, our revenue growth was stronger than we forecasted, largely due to higher growth in Europe than we had expected with particular strength from Eastern Europe. ","Second, a more favorable mix and improved operating execution resulted in excellent conversion of our incremental revenue. And finally, the profitability of Caliper during this stub period was better than expected. While stub periods are sometimes difficult to forecast, Caliper's performance benefited from the timing of the closing as their expenses in the quarter were fairly linear but their revenue was skewed towards the end of the quarter. The higher-than-planned profit from Caliper contributed about 1\/3 of the approximate 250 basis point margin improvement for the company, with the remainder coming from solid revenue growth, favorable mix and improved operating execution offset somewhat by the stronger U.S. dollar.","Turning to the full year. Revenue grew 13% and organically, revenue grew 6% at the high end of our original guidance with solid contributions from all territories. We expanded adjusted operating margins by 150 basis points to 15.4%, well in excess of our stated objective. Our progress in 2011 gives us even greater confidence in our ability to meet our objective of 18% adjusted operating margins in 2014.","This improved profitability translated into adjusted earnings per share growth for 2011 of 35%. ","Lastly, adjusted operating cash flow grew 24%.","During 2011, we also made significant progress improving the growth profile of the company through the introduction of several market-driven, innovative new products and a number of acquisitions that expanded our capabilities and considerably increased our addressable markets. In particular, we significantly strengthened our capabilities in molecular analysis, imaging, sample preparation and informatics. And combined with our historical strength, we now believe we have put together a portfolio of highly differentiated offerings to serve the diagnostic, research and environmental markets. While it is still early, we are extremely pleased with how the acquisition integrations are proceeding, and our strong results in the back half of 2011 are partially due to our recent acquisitions exceeding our expectations during last year.","Also in 2011, we continued to make a real difference for the lives of millions of people across the globe. I'll highlight a couple of examples. Through our digital imaging technology, we touched over 1 million people through cancer screening and radiotherapy. Over 2 million scientists worldwide use our electronic notebook and software to improve their research efforts.","Through our analytical instruments, over 1.5 billion environmental samples were analyzed hoping to improve the quality of air, water and food for millions. And we screened over 31 million newborns last year, resulting in 50 babies a day being saved from severe medical complications. As we look ahead, I'm excited about our ability to leverage our global footprint, strong customer relationships and full spectrum of technologies to continue to help improve the quality of life across the globe from early detection of disease to ensuring cleaner drinking water and safer food.","Turning now to 2012 guidance, we remain cautious with regard to the overall macroeconomic environment and have, therefore, assumed growth in our end market remained similar to what we saw during the last half of 2011. Accordingly, we expect full year revenue to grow 10% to 12% and organic revenue grow to be in the mid-single digit range. We continue to believe we can expand adjusted operating margins in the 75 to 100 basis point range this year despite expanding operating margins of 150 basis points in 2011.","Given these factors, we estimate our full year adjusted per share -- earnings per share for 2012 to be in the range of $1.98 to $2.04, representing growth of 9% to 11% over the prior period. Assuming we achieve the midpoint of our ranges that we have suggested, since the end of 2009, our adjusted revenue will have increased approximately 40% over the 3-year period and adjusted EPS will have increased 85%.","I would now like to turn the call over to Andy.","Frank A. Wilson","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll now provide some additional details on our fourth quarter results. And following my prepared remarks, we'll open it up for questions. As Rob just discussed, we were very pleased to deliver another strong quarter of growth in revenue, adjusted earnings per share and cash flow, finishing off a great year for PerkinElmer. ","Revenue for the fourth quarter increased by 15% and our organic revenue increased by 6% as compared to the same period last year. By segment, organic revenue increased by 5% and 7% in our Human Health and Environmental Health segments, respectively.","By geography, organic revenue in the Americas was flat, while Asia and Europe grew at a double-digit rate with Eastern Europe showing particular strength in the quarter. Within the emerging markets, which represented approximately 27% of total revenue in the quarter, we experienced continued strong demand posting organic revenue growth of over 20% in these regions.","From an end market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represented approximately 48% of total revenue in the quarter. Within Human Health, we serve 2 end markets, Diagnostics, which represented 26% of total revenue and Research, which represented 22% of total revenue. Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business increased at a low-double digit rate in the fourth quarter with strong growth generated from both our screening and Medical Imaging businesses.","Our Screening business benefited from solid demand across all major areas of the portfolio despite cycling up against significant instrument placements from the prior year and ongoing pressure from relatively low birth rates in the U.S. In addition, we continue to gain traction in emerging markets as we further penetrate these fast-growing, highly populated regions of the world with our market-leading screening solutions.","In our Medical Imaging business, we saw a healthy demand across all key platforms with solid growth from our base medical diagnostics offering, as well as strong contributions from nonmedical applications incorporating our amorphous silicon detectors and from surgical applications utilizing our CMOS imaging technology. Organic revenue in our Research business declined modestly in the fourth quarter. ","Within our base research business, we saw a continued demand for our in Vitro Imaging Systems, particularly our Opera High Content Screening System utilized for greater understanding of biological functions through the study of cellular dynamics. ","Moreover, we experienced strong growth in our radiometric detection equipment in support of identification and remediation efforts related to the ongoing nuclear issues in Japan.","With regard to Caliper, we saw a broad-based demand across the portfolio experiencing strong interest in the recently launched Spectrum CT for simultaneous in vivo imaging of multiple animal [ph] models providing critical insights into complex, living biological systems. We also saw strong growth from our LabChip GX\/GXII microfluidic systems, as our customers remain acutely focused on fast, high-quality results in genomic and biologic research.","Let's now turn to Environmental Health, which represented 52% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter. Within Environmental Health, we serve 3 end markets: Laboratory Services, which represented 24% of total revenue; Environmental and Safety, which represented 19% of total revenue; and Industrial, which represented 9% of total revenue. ","During the quarter, we saw double-digit organic growth within both Environmental and Safety and Industrial and low-single digit organic growth in our Lab Services business, as we cycled up against a significant contract win from last year. During the quarter, we experienced strong organic revenue growth from all of our major product areas in Human Health. The broad-based demand illustrates the breadth and depth of our product offering and our extensive application knowledge, as we help address our customers\u2019 need for a wide range of detection capabilities for trace metal and organic content.","Before going any further, I want to provide some additional color on the 2 non-cash charges we highlighted in our release. These charges had an unfavorable impact on our GAAP results in the quarter but we believe will benefit the company in the long run. First, we changed our methodology of accounting for our defined pension plans. This change is particularly relevant to PerkinElmer as these plans are primarily related to businesses we no longer own and only approximately 10% of the beneficiaries within these plans are active in our current operations. In addition, the mark-to-market method of accounting for defined benefit plans is the preferred method under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, as it provides greater clarity of business performance and improves the comparability of financial results by clearly segregating the financial implications of defined benefit plans. This change has no economic implications and there is no impact on cash flow or pension funding requirement or to PerkinElmer's future liabilities associated with these plans.","I will provide additional details on the impact to our financial results shortly, but I want to highlight that as a convenience to our analysts and our investors, we have placed in the Investor section of our website a presentation, which includes further information on this change, as well as a summary of our historical results reflecting this change. This analysis includes GAAP results as well as a reconciliation to our non-GAAP results.","Secondly, during the quarter, we recorded an incremental tax provision for the repatriation of $350 million of earnings from international operations which will enable us to utilize these funds to pay down our increased debt resulting from the acquisition of Caliper. This one-time charge of $80 million represents a 23% effective tax rate on the repatriation. The utilization of tax attributes attained with the acquisition of Caliper will result in virtually no cash taxes on this repatriation. But under GAAP, we are required to record a nontax charge in the P&L because the tax benefits from the Caliper tax attributes are reported on the balance sheet. The long-term benefits of accelerating debt reduction will benefit us with more flexibility to resume strategic capital deployment, thereby continuing to increase our growth profile.","Now looking at our margin performance in the period, adjusted gross margin expanded approximately 300 basis points driven by volume, leverage, strong productivity gains resulting from our margin expansion initiatives and the favorable impact of acquisitions. Adjusted operating margins expanded approximately 250 basis points in the fourth quarter to 18.5% due primarily to these same factors. For the full year 2011, adjusted operating margins expanded approximately 150 basis points to 15.4% as compared to the same period a year ago, well ahead of our stated objective of adjusted operating margin expansion of between 75 to 100 basis points. With further productivity investments planned in 2012, we firmly believe in our ability to achieve our stated goal of high-teens operating margins by 2014.","In our Human Health segment, adjusted operating margins for the quarter were 22.8%, representing an increase of approximately 350 basis points as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, while our Environmental Health segment delivered adjusted operating margins of 18.8% representing an increase of approximately 320 basis points. Volume, leverage, favorable mix and productivity gains across the company, combined with solid contributions from our Caliper and informatics businesses drove these strong segment performances. GAAP operating loss was $27.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus operating income of $48.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. As mentioned previously, the fourth quarter of 2011 includes a noncash, pretax charge of approximately $69 million in the period, resulting from the change in accounting methodology for our defined benefit plans. To reiterate, this change has no impact on our cash flows or funding obligations.","For the fourth quarter, our GAAP tax rate included a non-cash charge of approximately $68.3 million related to our previously mentioned plans to repatriate foreign earnings to accelerate both our deleveraging strategy, as well as for the utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards obtained with the acquisition of Caliper, partially offset by other discrete items. On a non-GAAP basis, our adjusted tax rate was 24.5%, which is slightly favorable to the guidance communicated in November. GAAP loss per share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 was $0.75 compared to earnings per share of $0.37 in the fourth quarter of 2010.  ","Our adjusted EPS was $0.62 in the fourth quarter of 2011, up 38% from the prior year and exceeding our guidance for the quarter of $0.49 to $0.51. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $1.83 as compared to $1.36 in 2010, representing an increase of 35% year-over-year. Our weighted average basic share count for the fourth quarter of 2011 was approximately 112.7 million shares and our ending share count was approximately 112.8 million shares.","Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the fourth quarter with approximately $945 million of debt and approximately $142 million of cash. Looking at our cash flow performance for the quarter, our operating cash flow from continuing operations was $82.5 million as compared to $42.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, representing an increase of 95% year-over-year. For the full year, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $234 million as compared to $163.1 million which included a $30 million voluntary pension contribution in the prior year. Full year adjusted operating cash flow was up 24% year-over-year.","In summary, we are extremely pleased with our financial performance for the fourth quarter. 15% reported revenue growth, 6% organic growth, 38% growth in adjusted earnings per share, 95% growth in operating cash flow and approximately 250 basis points of operating margin expansion are the result of the dedication and hard work of PerkinElmer's 7,000 employees around the world, successfully executing on our growth and productivity initiatives. This performance gives us even greater confidence in our ability to achieve our longer-term objectives.","Now I'd like to discuss our 2012 guidance in a bit more detail. We expect full year 2012 reported growth of 10% to 12% and organic revenue to be in the mid-single digits or approximately 4% to 6%. In the first quarter, we expect adjusted revenue to be in the range of $500 million to $510 million with organic revenue growing at the low end of the mid-single digit range, given the difficult double-digit growth comparison from the prior year. ","We expect an impact from foreign exchange in the first quarter similar to that of the full year or a headwind of approximately 200 basis points.","Regarding adjusted operating margins, with leverage on the expected revenue growth as well as continued progress on our multiyear productivity initiatives, we expect to continue to expand adjusted operating margins in the range of 75 to 100 basis points for the year. Bringing all these factors together, we estimate our full year adjusted earnings per share for 2012 to be in the range of $1.98 to $2.04 representing growth of 8% to 12% over the prior year. Additionally, taking into consideration the items just discussed, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter to be in the range of $0.39 to $0.41, representing growth of 11% to 17% as compared to the first quarter of 2011.","This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Dave.","David C. Francisco","Thanks, Andy. Operator, at this time, we'd like to open up the call for some questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Congratulations on what looks like a good start to the Caliper integration. Obviously, a lot of adjustments here. I'll have to go to your investor website and get all the details. But I just have 2 questions. First, Rob, I guess if you think about geographically, most companies have been talking about more strength in the U.S. and kind of weaker in Europe. And as you said, you had kind of in the quarter the exact opposite. So maybe you can just talk about what you're seeing geographically and how you think that plays out in 2012? And then the second question is on the Environmental Health operating margin where obviously there, you didn't have a benefit from Caliper but you still had pretty significant expansion which is a big reversal from last quarter. Maybe you can just detail that a little bit more?","Robert F. Friel","So I would say on the geographic side, and I think we mentioned this briefly, is the reason why we saw strength in Europe was largely Eastern Europe, in particular, in the Diagnostic area. We saw some real strength in Russia where we had won a tender where they were looking at both newborn screening and prenatal screening. So that was really one of the big drivers to the double-digit growth in Europe. I think in the U.S., one of the reasons why for us, U.S. was a little weaker was because of strong comps in Q4 of 2010. We had very strong growth in the U.S. So I think those are the explanations for maybe why we're a little off than maybe what some of the other companies you're talking to. And with regard to the environmental margin expansion, I mean, we've been seeing good operating margin expansion in the environmental area. And I think what we saw in Q4 was particularly strong mix. And you're seeing some of the benefit now of the informatic acquisitions as they start to ramp up. Of course, we talked about this at the time of the acquisitions. They carry obviously much higher gross margins and much higher operating margins. So we saw those benefits manifest themselves in Q4.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just in 2012, kind of maybe are there any other tenders or how do you think geographically things will play out in 2012?","Robert F. Friel","So as I think about 2012, I expect the U.S. and Europe to be comparable, particularly when we talk about Europe as Eastern and Western Europe. And I think they're going to be in the low-single digits. And I continue to see the majority of our growth from a growth rate perspective coming in the APAC regions. So like I said, U.S. and Europe probably in the low-single digits. I think probably the APAC region is high-single, low-double.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","On your EBIT margin expansion plans for 2012, you mentioned that assume some leverage on incremental revenue as well as productivity initiatives. How much of the expansion would you throw in each bucket? And I guess I'm trying to think of how sensitive that expansion would be to your revenue line.","Robert F. Friel","So I would say probably 60% is revenue and 40% is from the productivity. And that assumes the mid-single growth that we've guided to.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And on the productivity initiatives, are those primarily targeted on the gross margin line, on the OpEx or any color?","Robert F. Friel","They're actually a little bit of both. We're doing some things from a G&A perspective. I think we've talked on a couple calls about how we want to continue to drive back office consolidation. And then in the other area, you may have saw we made some announcements a couple of weeks ago with regard to moving some of our manufacturing into Asia. And obviously, those benefits will flow through the gross margin side.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my final question on CambridgeSoft, on the software side, I guess if there's anything to pick out in this quarter, I actually thought the number for that business would have been higher. I thought it was very Q4 loaded. Looking forward, do you still expect that business to be Q back-end loaded or seasonal? Or would you expect it to normalize and smooth out under your ownership as opposed to...","Robert F. Friel","I think it will smooth out to some extent but it takes us a little while. As you know well, in the software business, the revenue recognition is sometimes difficult to predict. And so if we look at the informatics business in the back half, it probably grew mid- to high-single digits but our expectation for 2012 is more in the mid-teens. And I think as it becomes -- as we own it longer, we'll do a -- we'll be able to increasingly smooth out the flow of that revenue. So I expect 2012 will be more linear than '11. And '13 will be more linear than '12.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So in terms of sort of Caliper, since you've owned it, how would you sort of characterize, kind of happy surprises, parts that you feel like you need to work on? How you feel like you're going to take some of the R&D expertise there and reinvigorate maybe parts of the research franchise and kind of turn around that business that's sort of been growing below market for a while?","Robert F. Friel","So I would say, first of all, that the probably most important surprise from my perspective is the quality of the people and the leadership. I mean, I think we had some sense of that during the discussions. But as we sort of get more and more involved with the individuals at Caliper, it's really sort of a terrific group of individuals, both with good technical domain experience, but also terrific attitude and really very sort of culturally synergistic with what we're trying to do where we're trying to improve health sort of across the globe. So I would say that's been a -- probably the biggest surprise. And I would say the other thing is we get to sort of better understand their technology. We also see increasing opportunities across all of PerkinElmer. So while we, I would say report this business within the Research segment, we are fairly optimistic that some of the, for example, microfluidic capability is going to be able to be deployed on the food pathogen area as well as in the diagnostic side. So I would spike out those 2 as big surprises from a positive perspective.","Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Andy, just from a capital deployment perspective, is debt paydown going to be the focus still in the interim or with the repatriation, does that sort of solve some of it? And if not, sort of where is the M&A focus going to be?","Frank A. Wilson","I think we'll still be active in the diligence side of M&A. But I think, at least over the next several months, we are going to focus on delevering. I think we were able to put more cash into the deal, so we actually started at a better place. We still expect, by the end of this year, to have really gotten back to where we started prior to the Caliper acquisition. So I would say, we may be a little slower in the first half than the second half, but I think at some point, we'll be active again on the M&A side.","Robert F. Friel","Yes. And, Ross, I would say the other thing is, I think the reason for the pause is not only financial in nature, right? We've got a couple significant integrations in front of us. And so, with the informatics businesses and of course, the Caliper integration, I think we want to make sure we focus on those. And so, I think both for financial reasons and for management bandwidth reasons, I don't expect to see anything significant in the first half of '12.","Operator","And our next question comes from Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird.","Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So first with respect to kind of the outlook for 2012, mid-single digit, but looking at your 2 segments, Environmental and Human Health, should we assume that Human Health then, with a more cautious outlook, to be lower core growth and Environmental Health to be higher?","Robert F. Friel","No. Actually, I think as we look out forward to 2012, we think we're going to see much more consistent growth from both segments. As Andy mentioned, that we were pleased in Q4 to see that it was 5% and 7%, I actually think for 2012, you could see a scenario where we continue to see fairly similar growth across the Human and the Environmental Health. And of course, one of the reasons for that is we continue to feel good about the prospects for Caliper to improve the growth profile of the Human Health side.","Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then, Rob, over the -- it seems like the last few weeks, we've seen a lot of news with respect to maybe a diagnostic company going hostile against one of the -- the tool space. We've seen tools companies increase their diagnostics management or do acquisitions. Kind of, could you give us a little update on how you feel about your diagnostics platform? And what do you think you need to do to continue to grow that over the next, let's say, 3 to 5 years?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I would start off by saying, look, we feel terrific about our diagnostic platform. I would say the way to think about our diagnostics platform is it's a little different though in the developed markets as it is in the emerging markets. I would say in the developed markets, it's fairly specialized around newborn and prenatal and maybe some molecular diagnostics test, in particularly, in those applications. I think when you get in the emerging markets, it's much broader from the standpoint of, we have a terrific channel with the SYM-BIO acquisition. And of course, we picked up through that acquisition assays and capabilities into infectious disease and places like HIV and hepatitis C. So I think you've got to look at it as, in the emerging markets, a much broader diagnostic play. Whereas I think in the developed markets, it's fairly specialized.","Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Do you think that over the time period, do you feel like that you have what you need to continue to grow? Or will you be looking to be opportunistic with, let's say, M&A?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I think we'll continue to be opportunistic across all our businesses. But as I sort of alluded to before, the other very interesting aspect of Caliper is, as you know, a lot of our diagnostic test of immunoassays and protein base and Caliper brings us some very interesting technology around molecular DNA testing. So we also, down the road, look to sort of deploy some of that into our diagnostic channel. But I think we'll continue to look and add assets, as I said, across all of our businesses. And obviously, you mentioned the attractiveness of the diagnostic market. And so, obviously, that's an area of significant priority for us.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nandita Koshal with Barclays Capital.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering if, to begin with, if you could comment on expectations around the Caliper deal included in the 2012 guidance. Has your view of the revenue and EPS accretion changed at all? What's the contribution from that piece?","Frank A. Wilson","No, I don't think anything's changed for '12. I would say that the expectations of '11 are obviously, now that '11's closed, were a little bit low. But I think we still expect $0.08 of accretion and the top line growth of around $180 million is still pretty firm.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And Andy, is there a meaningful tax rate advantage linked to the deal? I believe there was a fairly quick advantage that you could see in 2012. How should we be thinking about the tax rate?","Frank A. Wilson","No, I think that was really the reference to the repatriation of the cash. While Caliper had some tax attributes, the requirement under the acquisition accounting is those tax attributes actually go up to the balance sheet as a deferred tax asset and you do not get the benefit of that through the P&L. And so, to some extent, by bringing the cash back, we're utilizing those attributes much sooner. So while we get a significant economic benefit from the tax attributes, we don't get a P&L or earnings benefit.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I see. And again, on the margin expansion front, you're looking for a 75 to 100 basis points of margin expansion for the full year. That's including obviously the very high margin acquisitions that benefited Q4. How much of that expansion is coming from acquisitions? And why does that number not look more comparable to what we found in Q4? I know there was a bit of that skewed revenue profile issue as well. But one would imagine you'd be above the usual run rate on margin expansion?","Frank A. Wilson","Well, first of all, I'll start off by saying look, we think when you do 100 basis points, we think that's pretty terrific performance. But I would say one of the things that is depressing that is that we are also within that 75 to 100 basis points continuing to fund productivity moves. So I mentioned the fact that we're talking about moving some production in the low cost regions. We're also doing some things from a G&A perspective. And so when you do those types of moves, very often you have repetitive costs. And so the 75 to 100 basis point margin expansion is net of funding the continued productivity actions we're taking so that we can continue in '13 and '14 to achieve the margin expansion and hit our 18% that we stated.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And I don't mean to hog time here so just one very quick last one. What was the source of the strength in Eastern Europe? What end markets, et cetera?","Robert F. Friel","It was largely in the diagnostic area and specifically, in our newborn and prenatal area.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Wood with Jefferies.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So what are the -- what are your expectations for the Medical Imaging business in your guidance for '12?","Robert F. Friel","I think the Medical Imaging business will perform similar to the overall corporation, so our expectations are probably mid-single.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And, Rob, when I lump prenatal, neonatal and cord together, that business looks like it's around low-single digits in the full year of '11. Does that accelerate in '12, that kind of collective newborn business?","Robert F. Friel","So I think your assumption on '11 is correct. And I think for 2012, our assumption is it accelerates a little bit. But the real key factor for that business is birth rates. And historically, when you look at a recession, particularly in the U.S., you'll see depressed birthrates for maybe 12, 18 months. We're now going into the third year. So that's going to be the real determinant for us, is if we continue to see flat-to-down birthrates, it's going to be tough to grow much beyond mid-single digits. If we get a little help from birthrates, I think you could see some acceleration there. Now clearly outside the U.S. and I think in particular the prenatal area, we expect to see much better growth than that. It's just a question of how much the U.S. will be a headwind.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. Is the, and this is for Andy, the Caliper NOL shield, is -- you basically exhausted that with the 350, bringing that back. Right? Is it totally done at this point or is there still some kind of fringe benefit there?","Frank A. Wilson","No. For the most part it is done at this point.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Last one is, what -- did you give a tax rate guidance for 2012?","Frank A. Wilson","We didn't. But it will be slightly better than our fourth quarter which was 24%. We're going to -- we estimate it to be 24% for 2012, but [indiscernible] points lower.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Knight with CLSA.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","As you go into the 2012 period, the risk would be budgets are reset by customers and academics like they've done in past recessions. What's your read on customer attitudes on their R&D plans for 2012?","Robert F. Friel","So I think we're cautiously optimistic in that regard, Paul. But the only thing I would say is, and again we've seen this in the past, even though people will sort of reset their budgets or cut their spending, we find that they still tend to spend in the areas where they think they're getting good productivity improvements or improved technology capabilities. And so I feel pretty confident that, and particularly with some of the new products that we've come out with and some of the call offerings that Caliper has, that even despite some realignment of budgets, I think we'll still find moneys allocated to the types of things that we can deliver to the customers.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Where are you with R&D budgets, Rob? Are they going to go up or be unchanged as a percentage of revenue?","Robert F. Friel","They've gone up a little bit in the back half of 2011 and they'll continue to go up in 2012. And just to give you a perspective, we're now at a run rate closer to $125 million or $130 million a year and we entered the year at a run rate of about $100 million a year. So we've taken that up fairly significantly. Now to be fair, our revenue has grown as well. But we've significantly improved the R&D spend at PerkinElmer and we'll continue to do that.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","As a percent of revenue going up a bit?","Frank A. Wilson","It will go up.","Robert F. Friel","Yes. It was up 20 basis points in Q4 and it will go up in 2012 as well.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last, others in the industry have kind of an above 50% goes back to shareholders and dividends and buybacks. Are you guys thinking that way? Or do you have a set number that you would like to be at? Or is it -- are you there yet?","Robert F. Friel","So if you look historically, we've been sort of consistent with that number. When you look at our dividends and share buybacks over the last couple of years, we've returned a fair amount to the shareholders. With the Caliper acquisition, of course, the informatics acquisitions we did earlier in 2011, we put on a fair amount of debt on the balance sheet. So our intentions probably for the next couple of quarters is to use the cash flow we generate to really delever. So I wouldn't anticipate significant share buybacks until we get the balance sheet back to where it was prior to Caliper. And now of course, we do pay a dividend every quarter and we'll continue to do that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Peter Lawson with Mizuho securities.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Rob, I'm just wondering if you could talk through some of the one-time benefits in Q4? You mentioned the Russian tender. Is there anything else in there? And then how much did Caliper contribute?","Robert F. Friel","So from one-time benefits, I would say rather than benefit, it was in any given quarter, we may have some wins. So that was just a tender that we won, so -- in any given quarter. But I would say that's probably the one that I would spike out as having the most impact. And the reason why it's fairly visible is because it improved the European growth rate. And I think relative to our expectations, it was much higher. The Caliper contributions in the quarter was about $31 million, so fairly consistent with what we expected. As I said, it grew about mid-teens. And from an operating perspective, we sort of alluded to this. But because of the timing of expenses being fairly linear and because of the revenue being more back-end loaded, I think we had guided to about a $0.01 benefit in the fourth quarter. It was closer to $0.04. So there was about a $0.03 incremental EPS improvement as a result of the higher income in Caliper. Some of that is due to performance quite frankly, and some of that due to just the timing of the revenue and expense.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then the weakness in Research, I can't remember if you talked through that?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I think the Research area continues to have a headwind because of our radiochemical business. And so if you pull that out, I think the rest of the Research business grew. We saw good growth in our Imaging area so the Opera's continued to do well. And of course, I mentioned Caliper continues to do well. So there's pockets of growth in the Research area, but just because of the radiochemical being down again in the high-single digit range, it just puts a lot of headwind on that business. And of course, the strategy there or the goal there is to use Caliper's growth to help sort of offset that and then ultimately return that to a business that can grow mid- to high-single digits.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","When did you think that radiochemical business hits a base?","Robert F. Friel","It's hard to predict. One of the things we are looking at is, what other things can we do with that business? So it's a combination of, it's going to continue to shrink relative to just sort of overall markets, but we are looking at maybe other opportunities to find up some applications. So Kevin\u2019s here, Peter, maybe Kevin just wanted to spend a second because I know he's been looking at the radiochemical business, so maybe just...","Kevin Hrusovsky","Yes. I think Rob is right on relative to the decline and I think that we had some really interesting developments back about 1.5 years ago. A scientist from Millennium actually started using the Iris imagers from Caliper to do PET scans, which wasn't what they are initially intended for but we found great translation to a clinic by using PET scans in the imager. He subsequently went to Amgen and is now creating a lot of energy around using these PET scans. And what's really interesting is that our assets that we have here at PerkinElmer can be utilized to actually make some of these PET reagents. And so we're looking at some of our Caliper technologies to further stimulate some of the growth opportunities in some areas that we think have some rather interesting prospects both in Research and maybe even ultimately in the clinic to offset some of the declines. So if it's declining at a rate of about 8%, 8% to 10%, if we can get that down to no worse than 5%, I think it's going to have a very material benefit to our overall P&L because it is a very profitable part of the revenue stream.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Arias with UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Rob, in the Pharma business, did the difference in growth between the developing and the developed world close at all in 4Q? Or did that basically look like it did in 3Q? And so I guess, what is your view on 2012 with that dynamic in mind?","Robert F. Friel","So I would say it closed a little bit. But I mean, I think we continue to see, that is probably the opportunity for us in the 2012 area to continue to make penetration in the APAC region. I would say our expectations are not significant or -- in our 2012 guidance, we haven't assumed that we're going to make a significant amount of progress there. But I think that maybe presents a potential opportunity and upside for us. Go ahead, Kevin.","Kevin Hrusovsky","I'm just going to add one comment to that, and that is at Caliper, we never really had a very good footprint in Asia. And so the technologies have a lot of potential there. And I think one of the really interesting and compelling reasons for the merger is to, in fact, get this footprint in Asia established for Caliper. And I think we have a meeting going on actually this week. It's really been a productive meeting with our sales organizations and I think that merger\u2019s going extremely well. There's a lot of motivation, a lot of excitement. We've actually placed a senior manager to head up that Asia-Pac region. And -- but most of those leaders are with us this week, and I think that we're going to find that there's going to be a nice opportunity to start really tracking the Caliper portion which will bring an overall balance to the Asia position for the Research markets.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then on the OneSource business, can you just give a sense of what the competitive dynamic is like there? What is the key to account wins? And I guess, how much of a role does price play? And how sticky do accounts tend to be?","Robert F. Friel","So I think the competitive dynamics have always been fairly fierce there from the standpoint of there's a couple large instrument players who compete on most of the OneSource opportunities. I think the competitive dynamics start with probably who has the experience and who had sort of the capabilities to do this. And I think, generally, that's why at least historically, we've done quite well in that because I think we were sort of early out of the gate and sort of multi-vendor service. And so I think in most of these tenders, we obviously have references and a lot of customers that we can point to. So I think that in a lot of cases, I'm not sure if price is that significant, quite frankly, because generally, the discussion with the customer is really around availability and uptime. So while that ultimately converts to productivity for the customer, it's not necessarily, from the standpoint is we're doing it cheaper, it's just that because we put engineers on site, we can guarantee 2- or 4-hour turnaround or uptime as compared to an OEM that might say 24- or 48-hour turnaround. So that's really -- it's really improved productivity in the lab as compared than necessarily sort of cost reduction. And I guess the answer to your other question is we -- generally, it seems to be fairly sticky. If you're doing a good job, they have a tendency to keep you around because it can be fairly high switching costs.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then I guess one last one for Andy. I don't know if I missed it, but did you give the currency impact for 4Q? And I guess, can you just parse out what you're looking for from FX next year?","Frank A. Wilson","Yes, it was about 200 basis point of headwind where we think that's going to be pretty much throughout -- flat in the fourth quarter, 200 basis points for the full year 2012, about the same in the first quarter. It won't have a significant impact to the bottom line, maybe $0.01 or so if we see the rates where they are today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","I was wondering on the Diagnostics business, if you could break out or give us an idea of how much of that business you consider from developed markets versus emerging since they obviously have the different growth rates?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. So I would say the emerging markets right now is probably about 20% and the developed markets right now about 80%.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then given that you're -- been going against tough comps in your Service business, do you expect that business to kind of go back into the mid-single digits in 2012?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. Our expectation for Service would be to return to sort of mid-single organic growth.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the mid-single digit growth outlook you guys outlined for Medical Imaging this year, I just want to kind of square up a couple of things. We obviously have an outlook for new orders from the major imaging companies that is probably flat to negative. And so I just want to make sure that it's fair to say that with that in context, the balance of your business can go grow closer to double digits?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I think clearly a higher growth is coming from nonmedical and the CMOS business, the acquisition we made. But having said that, our Medical business, we still expect to grow slightly.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so that's and by slightly, I think you said earlier, mid-single digit. I just want to make sure I had that right?","Robert F. Friel","No, I think mid-single for the total business. I think the way to think about it, the medical side is probably sort of low-single and the nonmedical and the CMOS is higher, sort of high-single or low-double.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then, in terms of just the mix benefit from -- or the margin benefit from the Caliper integration versus the new assets from your line of softwares, so I'm just trying to figure out the importance of one versus the other in terms of driving better operating margins this year?","Robert F. Friel","So in the case of Q4, Caliper was very significant, again, because it was a timing issue. I think if you look at, let's say, the full quarter, then I think Caliper is probably going to be in 2012 neutral to our operating margins. And of course, they are sort of growing into their scale, if you will. So our expectation is, for 2012, the operating performance of Caliper will be maybe equal to or slightly better than the corporate average. So that the benefit from an acquisition perspective is more on the informatics standpoint from a mix point of view.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then lastly maybe a big picture question on your line of software, obviously you guys have a lot of new assets there. And maybe -- if we think about developing those products into more combined offering, what kind of a time line should we think about before you think you have a more integrated offering for those types of products and then in concert with the OneSource business you have?","Robert F. Friel","Well, we've actually got some pilots that were actually going on right now with a couple of select customers. And so assuming those go well, I think we could have something in sort of the latter part of 2012.","Operator","At this time, there are no questions queued.

[Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Dave Francisco, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","David C. Francisco","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to the PerkinElmer First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call are Robert Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ","If you have not received your copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at perkinelmer.com or from our toll-free investor hotline at (877) PKI-NYSE. Please note, this call is being webcast live and will be archived in our website until May 10, 2012.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor Statement that we've outlined in our earnings press release, issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future, even if our estimates change.

To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during this call, but are not reconciled to GAAP in that attachment, we will provide reconciliations promptly.","I'm now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel.","Robert F. Friel","Thanks, Dave. Good afternoon and thank you, for joining us today. ","I'm pleased to report that we had another very good quarter in which we delivered strong financial results while making excellent progress against our 2012 strategic priorities. ","During the first quarter, we grew adjusted revenue 16% year-over-year, delivering better than expected growth despite very difficult comps from the first quarter of last year, particularly in Environmental Health, which grew 17% organically in the first quarter of 2011.","In the first quarter of this year, Human Health increased adjusted revenue by 27% due to the addition of Caliper and solid organic growth from Diagnostics and Medical Imaging. ","Environmental Health grew by 6%, reflecting notable contributions from our inorganic analysis offerings plus strong end market drivers, such as water and chemical analysis. Organically, our revenue grew 6%, with Human Health up 9% and Environmental Health up 3%.","Our continued focus on improving our operational efficiencies and expanding our operating margins enabled us to exceed our plans for earnings per share in the quarter and deliver adjusted EPS growth of 23%. ","Across our end markets, there are 2 fundamental themes that are changing the behavior and needs of our customers. These themes uniquely position PerkinElmer to play a significant role in improving world health.","First, there is an increasing interconnectivity between human and environmental health resulting in the convergence of our 3 core end markets, Diagnostics, Environmental and Life Sciences. As the developed world faces increasing health care costs, we can leverage our complementary capabilities in these markets for better outcomes and reduce cost. We have the capabilities to aid in both understanding genetic predisposition to disease, as well as helping people avoid potential environmental triggers to disease. ","Additionally, we can aid in identifying diseases, they're always possible, and help discover more effective targeted therapies.","The second overarching theme is that, as the developing world continues to grow rapidly, it is demanding greater access to health care. While many of these developing countries today are focused on necessities such as access to clean air and water and safe food, the rising middle class is demanding improved living standards. This will cause many countries to require advanced medical capabilities, such as early disease screening or diagnostic tests. Today, there is a great need to serve these customers across the increasing level of the requirements and spanning virtually every region of the globe.","PerkinElmer's extensive global channel and footprint enables us to address these needs head-on. We have a unique ability to tailor our technologies for the developed world and then bridge them into the emerging markets. While we're well-positioned to leverage these 2 macro themes to improve global health, we cannot stand still. Critical to our success is our ability to apply our knowledge and expertise to develop cutting-edge innovations that solve customer needs. In that regard, during the quarter, we introduced several innovative new products targeting our core end markets. These included, the HER2Sense preclinical imaging agent which supports breast cancer discovery research. The Panthera-Puncher for the handling of neonatal blood spots. An Ensemble for Biology, a suite of informatics applications intended to serve as an integrated biology workflow for use in research and development, as well as in quality assurance and control.","Additionally, I'm pleased with how well our recent acquisitions performed in the quarter. Our teams are making excellent progress in driving smooth integrations, including not only streamlining processes and creating greater efficiencies, but equally as important, bringing forward the best of both cultures and combining them together as one entity. And particularly, the former Caliper Life Science business performed very well, as revenue growth accelerated from the strong performance in 2011.","The Life Sciences and Technology team has done a fantastic job across all aspects of the integration, including global training of the sales force, accelerating customer connectivity and assessing opportunities to maximize the combined global footprint, which should only increase efficiencies but facilitate innovation, which, of course, was a cornerstone of Caliper's culture.","In addition, despite difficult comparisons, we continue to see excellent traction with our OneSource Laboratory Services offerings, especially as customers in emerging territories look to drive improved workflow in asset management in their laboratories.","In summary, I'm very pleased with our strong start to the year and feel the organization is executing well against our priorities. Looking ahead, we maintain our cautious outlook on the macroeconomic environment. As such, we continue to forecast the similar demand profile to what we experienced in the first quarter, but with lower expectations for Europe. Accordingly, we expect full year revenue growth consistent with what we communicated at the beginning of the year or in the range of 10% to 12%, representing organic revenue growth in the mid-single digit range.","Regarding adjusted earnings per share, given the performance in the first quarter, we are raising the bottom and top end of our forecast range from $1.98  to $2.04 to $2 to $2.05. I'd now like to turn the call over to Andy.","Frank A. Wilson","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. ","As Rob mentioned, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets and our first quarter results, and following the prepared remarks, we'll open it up for question. ","We are pleased with our strong start to 2012 delivering another solid quarter of growth in revenue and adjusted earnings per share.","Revenue for the first quarter increased by 14% and organic revenue increased by 6% as compared to the same period last year. Adjusted revenue for the quarter increased by 16% as compared to the first quarter of 2011. ","By segment, organic revenue increased by 9% and 3% in our Human Health and Environmental Health segments respectively.","By geography, organic revenue in the Americas grew low-single digits. Europe was up mid-single digits and Asia grew low-double digits. ","We were particularly pleased with our performance in Europe given the economic uncertainty in that region. Additionally, we experienced continued strong demand from emerging territories, with organic revenue growth in the BRIC countries up over 20%.","Looking at organic revenue by product category. Recurring revenue, which includes reagents, consumables and service, grew mid-single digits in the quarter while instrument and components grew at a high-single-digit rate despite cycling up against mid-teens growth in the first quarter of 2011.","The stronger-than-expected growth in instruments and components was partially due to favorable shipment timing in the period. From an end market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represented approximately 50% of total revenue in the quarter where we served 2 end markets. Diagnostics, which represented 27% of total revenue and Research, which represented 23% of total revenue","Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business increased to a low-double-digit rate in the first quarter, with notable contributions for both our Screening and Medical Imaging businesses. In our Screening business, we experienced solid demand across all major segments of the portfolio. This business continues to benefit from the stabilization of U.S. birthrate estimated to be flat year-over-year in the quarter, as well as expansion of our prenatal, newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in key regions outside the US.","Our Medical Imaging business also experienced broad-based growth across all the key technologies and applications in the period. Traditional medical diagnostic imaging offerings generated strong with additional contribution from our CMOS imaging technology, particularly related to mammography and surgical applications. Furthermore, our therapeutic and nonmedical applications also contributed to the strong performance in the period. ","Organic revenue in our Life Sciences and Technology business grew mid-single digit in the first quarter. As a reminder, LST is comprised of our research and Caliper Life Science businesses.","As Rob mentioned, within LST we saw robust demand for our In Vivo Imaging systems, including the legacy FMT imaging and fluorescent agent offerings, as well as the recently launched Caliper Spectrum CT imaging system with advanced optical features enabling highly efficient, multimodal invivo imaging.","PerkinElmer now provides the most complete solution for non-invasive animal imaging, providing researchers the ability to understand biology in the physiological context. Additionally, we experienced strong growth on our front-end high throughput sample preparation systems, supporting enhanced workflow for next-generation sequencing analysis with our complete, highly flexible solutions to run multiple chemistries to support all sequencing instruments.","Furthermore, we experienced continued demand for our suite of radiometric detection equipment that has been primarily utilized for assisting the continued efforts in Japan, identifying and remediating nuclear contamination resulting from last year's earthquake and tsunami.","Turning to Environmental Health, which also represented 50% of our total revenue in the first quarter, we served 3 end markets. Laboratory services, which represented 23% of total revenue; environmental and safety, which represented 18% of total revenue; and industrial, which represented 9% of total revenue.","During the quarter, we experienced low-single digit organic revenue growth across all 3 market segments as each cycled up against double-digit organic revenue growth comparables from the prior year. As Rob discussed, within Environmental Health, we saw strong demand for our full suite of inorganic analysis solutions, particularly for the analysis of trace metal content and contaminants for environmental applications in water and soil.","Additionally, continue to drive further penetration of our OneSource Multi-Vendor Service into emerging markets with some key early-stage wins in Brazil and China, as these high-growth regions recognized the extensive benefits of our unique offering.","Now looking at our margin performance in the period. Adjusted gross margin expanded approximately 230 basis points, driven by volume leverage, favorable mix, robust productivity gains and the favorable impact of our businesses acquired in 2011. ","Adjusted operating margins expanded approximately 160 basis points in the first quarter to 15.3%. We were particularly pleased with our performance in the period, as we were able to absorb higher acquisition-related operating expenses and expand operating margins despite an approximately 160 basis points margin expansion performance achieved in the first quarter of 2011.","As stated previously, we are planning additional productivity investments for the balance of 2012 and we believe we'll further solidify our ability to achieve our stated objective of high-teens operating margins by 2014.","By segment, adjusted operating margins in our Human Health business for the quarter were 20.4%, representing an increase of approximately 200 basis points as compared to the first quarter of 2011. ","Our Environmental Health segment delivered adjusted operating margins of 14.4%, representing an increase of approximately 30 basis points. The combination of volume leverage, favorable mix and productivity gains across the company contributed to the strong performance delivered by both segments.","GAAP operating income from continuing operations was $22.1 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $27.2 million in the first quarter of 2011. For the first quarter, our GAAP tax rate was approximately 6.3%, and on a non-GAAP basis our adjusted tax rate was 25%, which is slightly higher than the guidance communicated in February. However, we expect the full year to be approximately 24%.","GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2012 was $0.19 compared to GAAP earnings per share of $0.24 in the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to higher intangible amortization and purchase accounting adjustments related to acquisitions completed throughout 2011.","Our adjusted EPS was $0.43 in the first quarter of 2012, up 23% from the prior year and exceeding our guidance for the quarter of $0.39 to $0.41. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter, first quarter of 2011, was approximately 114.1 million shares and our ending share count was approximately 113.4 million shares. ","Turning to balance sheet. We finished the first quarter with approximately $934 million of debt and approximately $145 million of cash.","Looking at our cash flow performance for the quarter. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $15.3 million as compared to $47.3 million in the first quarter of 2011, due primarily to a $17 million contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan and the timing of approximately $13 million of tax items in both the current and prior year periods. While we did see an increase in receivables, we believe this was primarily related to our strong finish to the quarter. We still expect to deliver greater than 100% of free cash flow to net income for the year and believe our 2012 first half will be in line with our historical cash flow performance.","In summary, we are pleased with our financial performance for the first quarter. 14% reported revenue growth, 6% organic revenue growth, approximately 160 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, leading to 23% growth in adjusted earnings per share.","And now I'd like to discuss our second quarter and full year 2012 guidance in a bit more detail. As Rob mentioned, consistent with our views from early in the year, we remain cautious regarding macroeconomic conditions. As such, we are forecasting a similar demand profile to what we experienced in the first quarter of 2012, but with somewhat lower expectations for Europe. ","We continued to expect full year 2012 reported growth of 10% to 12% and organic revenue growth to be mid-single digits or in the range of 4% to 6%.","For the second quarter, we expect adjusted revenues to be in the range of $530 million to $540 million, with organic revenue to be mid-single digits.","Regarding adjusted operating margins, we expect to continue to expand margins in the range of 75 to 100 basis points for the year. As previously mentioned, we are deploying investments throughout the balance of the year in support of our multi-year productivity initiatives that will be absorbed within our full year target for adjusted operating margin expansion.","Bringing all these factors together, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share for 2012 from our previously announced range of $1.98 to $2.04, to a new range of $2 to $2.05, representing growth of 9% to 12% over the prior year. ","Additionally, taking into consideration the items just discussed, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter to be in the range of $0.47 to $0.49, representing growth of 9% to 14% as compared to the second quarter of 2011.","That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Dave.","David C. Francisco","Thanks, Andy. Operator, at this time, we'd like to open the call to questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Your first question comes from the line of Dan Brendan with Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","There's been some conflicting commentary thus far in the earnings season from some of your instrument peers regarding pharma spending on instruments in the first quarter. Just wondering if you could maybe start off discussing what type of spending you saw from large pharma customers this quarter on instrumentation. Whether there was any evidence of kind of different pacing throughout the quarter?","Robert F. Friel","I would say when you look at Pharma and it's difficult to characterize all the companies as sort of one entity, but I think what we see is, against the backdrop of further consolidation, outsourcing and, I would say, modest R&D spending is probably 3 or 4 trends that impact our business. The first trend and one that's probably been going on for some time is this move from a small molecule to large molecule. And so what we see is that benefits us in the area of microfluidics in a lot of for imaging products, probably puts a little pressure on the high throughput screening readers. I think on balance, it probably provides us a bit of a benefit, but I think that's a trend. Again, if you look at overall, probably a slight benefit to us but affects different product lines. There's clearly a focus on more companion diagnostics in epigenetics. I think that's another area where it sort of helps us in the microfluids in our tissue imaging and some of our reagents. And then, of course, the continued drive to outsource and drive productivity in your labs helps us in the areas of services, in informatics and in developing countries. So I think when you look at the trends that are occurring within pharma, some good and some bad, but overall, fairly positive for us with our portfolio, with the exception of, of course, we've got the RAD reagents that continue to get some drag as people move away from that.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then maybe just one follow-up. In terms of your U.S. economic customers, like when you\u2019re thinking about kind of a spending level from them, as we get to the second half of the year, are you building any conservatism into your own internal budgeting, thinking may be there might be some slowdown in spending from the researchers as they kind of look ahead to '13 or have yet to see kind of what you're seeing from those customer base?","Robert F. Friel","So again, similar to pharma, I think when we look at the academic spending, you've got to too look at sort of where they are spending it. In our assumptions, probably for the back half, is overall spending is probably flat to may be down a little bit. But more importantly, it's in the areas that we provide products for them. So particularly, we're seeing a lot of interest in some of our higher end imaging like the IVIS imaging as they're doing large molecule distribution studies. And so there's areas within academic, even though the spending is slowing down, that they're still spending in. The key is, obviously, NGS is another one where they -- looks like they're continuing to spend. And so I think the key for us is just making sure that we're in  the right places.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Rob, maybe just on your comments around Europe, you mentioned as well that there was favorable timing in your shipments. So are you seeing anything specific right now that gives you that caution or are you just given all the macro and headlines that you read out of Europe, you're being cautious? Are you seeing things kind of slow right now?","Robert F. Friel","No, I think it's more of the latter. I think it's just -- we continue to obviously read the headlines and view the concerns, whether it's around the capital markets or just the overall funding levels of the government. We do expect that at some point that's going to impact demand in Europe. We didn't see it in the first quarter, as you know, we didn't see it in the fourth quarter. And I would say, to a large extent, the timing of shipments that Andy talked about was not necessarily specific to Europe. I would say that was more of a global phenomenon. But Europe again did pretty well for us, but we do think, at some point, we'll see a slow down there.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","When were the timing of shipments? I mean just because you highlighted it -- there must have been -- was that in a particular business or what was that?","Frank A. Wilson","We had a very strong month 3, Jon. And it was really, I've mentioned it more in conjunction with the receivable bill that we saw in the quarter. So I think we feel good about our ability to collect that in the second quarter, but there was a bit of an increase in the receivable balance in the first quarter. I think the linearity in the second quarter is probably going to be a little more spread evenly but we did see a very strong March.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And if I could just one more. You heard kind of conflicting things around emerging markets as well. I think you said your BRIC countries had 20% growth. Can you maybe just talk about which businesses were driving the growth and what you saw there?","Robert F. Friel","I would say we saw a pretty broad base. Our view is China was up 20% again, another strong quarter from there. So we're not seeing the contraction in the emerging markets. Brazil and South America were strong for us as well. I would say we saw a little bit of a slowdown in Eastern Europe but I think that was a comp issue as compared to economic phenomena. So our growth in emerging markets continues to be pretty much across the board.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities USA.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Rob, just with the guidance to maintain full year top line guidance, you mentioned Europe being weak. What's the offset from Europe? And then based on kind of the lower Q2 guidance and revenues, what's makes up the delta in the second half?","Robert F. Friel","First of all, let me just sort of clarify, with regard to the second quarter, we're still talking about mid-single digit growth, so we're not really talking about changing that. And again, relative to the full year, we're still at a mid-single digits. So we're basically holding the guidance. I think the only thing we're saying is whilst 6% was a little better than we thought in the first quarter, we do think that Europe will slow down here a little bit. So I think that's fundamentally what we're saying is, we're not saying let's take the 6% in the first quarter and assume that continues through the whole year.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then the fact that Europe's slow for the rest of the year, what's the offset, is that coming from Asia?","Robert F. Friel","Well, we are just saying that in our assumptions, we are assuming that Europe slows down a little bit relative to the first quarter.","Frank A. Wilson","We are assuming, Peter, that our second, third and fourth quarter European performance is in line with our expectations but not at the level we saw in the first quarter. So overall, our full year guidance, that's why it hadn't changed dramatically. And by the way, we haven't given second quarter guidance until today. So there is a -- that's new news for today.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And then the higher OpEx from particularly R&D, is that coming from the Caliper? Or is there something else in there?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, Caliper spent a higher percentage of revenue on R&D than PerkinElmer and we're maintaining that high level of R&D.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird.","Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","With respect to OneSource, you talked about even moving out to the emerging markets. Rob, as you do so, how are the margins for the services business in those areas compared to the western markets? And do you need to have a build out, more technicians? How does that, how do you scale?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I think that's a fair assumption. As we go into new markets, we need to build, in most cases, we're building the capacity ahead of the revenue. And so, I think, that's an investment we're making, we recognize we need to be where our customers are and sort of alluded to before, we continue to see the pharmaceutical and biotech companies move into those areas with their R&D spending. So I think initially, there will be a lower margin in those areas as we build out the capabilities. But those things can scale relatively quickly.","Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And with respect to free cash flow, Andy, could you kind of go over it again because the impacts in Q1 and then how you expect that to -- the full year to be again?","Frank A. Wilson","Sure. Within the first quarter, we had 2 significant items that impacted the year-over-year comparisons. One was, we made a contribution to our defined benefit plan of $17 million. We also had some tax items that impacted the quarter by about $13 million. So that's really the difference between 2011, 2012. There was a little bit of a receivable build, days for both receivables and inventory were pretty consistent year-over-year. But given the  shipment linearity, we did see a bit of a build in receivables more so than we wanted. We think the first half will be in line with past years and we still believe we'll generate more than 100% of free cash to net income for all of 2012.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line up Zarak Khurshid.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes. Zarak Khurshid of Wedbush Securities. First, I guess on Caliper, can you break out the contribution there? I think you mentioned that it accelerated. What's driving that? How fast did it grow and can you speak to kind of the relative strength of IVIS versus microfluidics and some of the drivers of the acceleration?","Robert F. Friel","So with regard to the contribution, I'll with that and Kevin's actually here, so I'll ask him to drill in to some of the performance from so a product line perspective. I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, if you look at Caliper in 2011, they grew and I think it was sort of mid-teens. Actually, for the first quarter, they did a little bit better than that. And the operating margins, we had stated that through the year, there was a plan that they would get to the PerkinElmer average by the end of the year, and I would say, based on the first quarter, we're actually tracking ahead of that plan but with regard to the specifics, I'll ask Kevin to comment on that.","Kevin Hrusovsky","Zarak, we actually have 3 different applications areas that have been very hot. One is NextGen Sequencing, the second is biotherapeutics and vaccines and the third is imaging. And the imaging is primarily the IVIS imagers and that grew double-digit, I'd say low double-digit. And we acquired that business unit about 5 years ago, 6 years ago. And it's really been performing at that mid-teen growth level ever since we acquired it. So it's been a really good ramp and it's been very consistent even though a lot of that is going to academia, a lot of grant writing and then there's like I think 2,400 peer-reviewed science journal articles now further support that build out. The NextGen Sequencing and the biotherapeutics were primarily microfluidics and there, we actually saw even a faster growth. We saw more like a 20% to 25% growth and primarily, we're doing sample prep in the NextGen sequencing area and we continue to build out nice quality control platforms there and we're agnostic with all the big NextGen sequencers, alumina, Life, primarily being most of the market right now. And then in biotherapeutics, we are seeing growth in academia and pharma and interestingly, it's primarily microfluidics but we also have large molecule biodistribution studies now occurring with their IVIS imagers. So those are the primary growth areas, but interestingly, you might be surprised to hear their automation also did extremely well in the first quarter from Caliper and it's primarily the linkage up with NextGen Sequencing with our microfluidics. So we sell these platforms of a combination of microfluidics and automation. So automation actually grew the fastest of all 3 segments in the first quarter. Again, very strong build out occurring in hospitals, particularly, children's hospitals for NextGen sequencing.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","What did Caliper do for the first quarter? Can you break it out, was it $40 million?","Kevin Hrusovsky","It's approximately $40 million, right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Andy, is there any way to quantify or normalize what the impact of the timing benefit was in the quarter, on the total revenue growth rate?","Frank A. Wilson","It was probably less than 1% but it was not immaterial, so I would say, 1% or less.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And given that one of your partners\/competitors received CE marking for a newborn screening product today, could you remind us what the barriers look like in that market and your competitive positioning vis-a-vis new entrants?","Robert F. Friel","First of all, the Luminax assays do not really talk about improved performance, it's really just about a workflow. And what they got CE marked in Europe, as my understanding was 4 assays. I believe what they're doing in the U.S. is actually cut it down to 3 now. And so really the workflow benefit to actually do that is fairly minimal because they're still going to need one of our instruments to do IRT. So we don't really see a real challenge for that in the U.S. and just as a data point, one of the states that ran their sort of instruments has just re-upped for us for another 3 years. So we don't see a significant challenge as a result of the recent announcement.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And my final question, where do you stand? I appreciate that integration process to Caliper has gone well, so far, but where do you stand in terms of what inning are you in, in the heavy lifting pieces of that process whether they've customer facing functions or ordering activity interface, things like that?","Robert F. Friel","I would say, probably in the sixth or seventh inning, I think we've made terrific progress there. We mentioned in the last call we sort of jumped at this early November and so we had a good almost 6 months now at this. So I think we're pretty late innings. Maybe --  Kevin, you want to comment on that a little bit?","Kevin Hrusovsky","I think you're right on, Rob. I think the only thing that will be pretty exciting is we got these user group coming \u2013 user group meetings coming up, Dan. You remember those, and this year is going to be really credible, the first one is going to be in June. We're expecting over 600 customers from around the world, mainly PhD's and MDs. And we've got over 60 speakers, customer speakers over 2-day track and then we're going straight from there to the U.K. and there we're expecting over 40 speakers from our customers. And then from there to China. I think that's going to be one of the last major integration points because the customer base here is going to be coming from both sides of PerkinElmer and Caliper, and it's got an incredible linkage that we have built with informatics and we even had a lot of newborn dimensions to this. So it's going to be a real showcase of what PerkinElmer has got to bring to the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Wood with Jefferies.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So Rob, hopefully, you'll let Kevin answer this. What was Caliper's OP in the first quarter?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I don't know if I want to get into this because as you can imagine as we integrate these together, that's a little harder to trace,. I mean we can trace the revenue pretty well, but I think, as we start to benefit from some of these synergies, all I would say is that we are ahead of the plan to reach PerkinElmer's margins by the end of the year.","Frank A. Wilson","If I could just make one comment. You may recall there are contribution margins in the Caliper product line are very strong and the global footprint of PerkinElmer is really bringing in a big advantage to this overall revenue acceleration that you're seeing.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just looking at the Human Health margins. I mean, Europe, up 200 basis points year-over-year and, I would imagine Caliper is still dilutive, given that they're coming off a very low base. So you comment maybe on screening and imaging businesses, I mean how did the absorption look in kind of the core?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. So I would say you're right under the assumption that while we're seeing good progress in Caliper, they're still dilutive to the Human Health margins but we are seeing very good incremental flow through in the revenue growth. We are seeing it in the diagnostics side both on the screening because they have a tendency to be very heavily-related towards reagents. And also, in our Medical Imaging business, as Andy talked about had a very good quarter with strong growth. They also are putting a very strong incremental margins as well. So I mean I think one of the aspects of the Human Health business is and, of course, Caliper now, complements that very nicely, is those businesses have a tendency to have nice gross margins and very strong flow through on the incremental revenue.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And are you willing to, Andy, quantify or kind of parse out imaging versus screening. I think you've mentioned all of Diagnostics was low-double digits, can you just give us a little bit more color?","Frank A. Wilson","We haven't historically done that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First question was on the newborn screening business. I was wondering if we could maybe parse out U.S. versus x U.S. growth in the business this quarter.","Robert F. Friel","So U.S. was positive because like we're starting to see some recovery there in births, so we think we've now, hopefully, stabilized and actually sort of February and March timeframe, we actually detect some positive growth there from births. So we actually saw probably something in the mid-single digits in the U.S. And outside the U.S., it was probably more in the high single-digit to low double.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then on the medical imaging business new flow of order rates from medical imaging from the big companies has been generally positive but also can you help us understand sort of nontraditional applications for that technology, what you're seeing from an order perspective and how you expect that to play out for the rest of the year?","Robert F. Friel","Well, sort of Andy talked about had a very good quarter and it was fairly broad base so, not only on the medical diagnostic sides, which again the larger players like GE but also in the nonmedical applications and, of course, we are also seeing strong growth from the recent acquisition that put us into the CMOS technology. So I think almost across every aspects of that business, we saw a good growth in the quarter.","Frank A. Wilson","They were up almost every aspect double-digit in the first quarter.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Last one for me is just on the margins. Obviously a pretty solid operating margin versus at least my numbers. And then if we look back sequentially to the last, to fourth quarter last year, you also had a really solid number. So if we look at sort of how you're guiding this year with 100 basis, up to 100 basis points of operating margin improvement, how should we think about kind of the pacing of that improvement especially given the fourth quarter comp you have on margins?","Frank A. Wilson","I think we feel like that the 75 to 100 is a prudent way to go out now. I think we had a very good performance in the first quarter. We did see some licensing revenue that probably helped us 30 or so basis points in the first quarter. I would say that we think it's going to be fairly ratably grown over the second, third quarters maybe a little bit less in the fourth. But keep in mind that we are investing in some of the longer-term productivity initiatives so there will be a little bit of a back-and-forth here. But I would say, at the end of the year, we feel pretty good about hitting that 75 to 100, and probably closer to the higher end of that range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier with Group.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Kevin, you talked a little bit about the growth of microfluidics and the sample prep for NGS, is that largely been in the higher end sequencers, how's your penetration of desktop sequencers' sample preps compared to that larger higher-end platforms?","Kevin Hrusovsky","Interestingly, it's still primarily on the higher end because what you have there's a lot of folk in these core labs would buy the sequencer and then as they started to get sample flows coming in, that would then start to bottleneck to your sequencer and that's where they would move in with the automation in the microfluidics. But I should point out that the same bottleneck is going to occur with the tabletops and microfluidics really play to the hand of the smaller sample size, as well as the speed that's going to be needed for these tabletops. So I think we are well-positioned with microfluidics. In fact, I think microfluidics was overkill for many of the large sequencers. We're really well-positioned as the tabletops starts to command sample flow. And I think that's the real question now, how much sample flows going to come in and when. But we are starting to see that he's going to command and when. But we're starting to see that movement already, so we feel good for the future.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, secondly, you guys talked about a strong finish to the year. How much of the revenue was back-end loaded and was that really just sort of some onetime revenue boost at the end? Or should that sort of fall through at the beginning of second quarter?","Frank A. Wilson","No, you're talking about the strong finish to the quarter?","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Right.","Frank A. Wilson","No, that was really across the board, we just saw an acceleration through the month of March. We see it every once in a while. Some of our customers actually asked for us to ship early in March just based on their buying needs. So I would probably look as we go out, it will be more normalized and the linearity will be more similar to prior years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Rob or Kevin, I guess on Caliper, I understand the comments you just made about the numbers getting a little blurry as you integrate the business, but if I could, I know at one point the outlook for margin expansion over the next few years was sort of just under 2\/3 OpEx improvement and then 1\/3 gross margin improvement or so. Is that still how you\u2019re looking at that improvement opportunity there?","Robert F. Friel","Are you talking about Caliper specifically or PerkinElmer?","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I am.","Robert F. Friel","Caliper, specifically.","Kevin Hrusovsky","Yes, you know what? I think that the interesting part now when you merge it's as if -- I think the OpEx opportunities start to do get blurred. But the footprint of the revenue acceleration that occurs with the globalness of PerkinElmer's footprint, commercial footprint, is really going to allow us to get there sooner. So you might actually start to see this OpEx move faster. But I think, with that said, we continue to launch a lot of new innovation and that's really where we got our gross margin expansion was primarily through new innovation and when we bring that out, like you heard Rob mention earlier, the new Spectrum CT, these products command a much higher gross margin because they're bringing a lot more to the table. So I do think we're going to continue to keep pace with gross margin but I think it will be outpaced, 2\/3, 1\/3 by the OpEx because of the leverage that we're getting in the synergies of the merger.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, you guys have been somewhat active on the legal side of things lately, at least as it relates to mass spec, just in terms of some the brands for IP, should we be thinking about modeling a bit more in litigation costs just given that you have got multiple suits ongoing here?","Robert F. Friel","No, I mean, I don't think -- we're not expecting that to be a material cost. I mean, you mentioned we've got some interesting IP in a number of areas and we just think it's appropriate that we sort of defend that. But I don't think there's going to be material litigation costs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Andy, could you were going a little fast when you were talking about the tax rate, could you just go over that, the tax rate in the quarter?","Frank A. Wilson","The tax rate for 25% in the quarter, adjusted tax rate. And for the year, it's 24%. So if you're modeling out, I would use 24% for the next 3 quarters.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And it was a little high in Q1 because of what?","Frank A. Wilson","It was basically just distribution of profits. It will fluctuate a little bit just because...","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And so -- Kevin, since I got you there, I just wanted to ask a question, also to the whole team there. Kevin, I caught the tail end of your talk at AGBT and you were talking about integrating some of the GeneSifter technologies and Geospiza technologies, and the automation platform, the sequencing platforms and some of the service and stuff that kind of look at light penetrating into the clinic with this. I guess, can you kind of give us some -- kind of go back and kind of address that? And basically kind of outline how you see this going in and, I guess, you guys, how are you going -- what are you doing for like a go-to-market in terms of the clinical approach? And how are you approaching the -- how you're approaching the, obviously, the clinical sequencing market. That's kind of a broad question but I was intrigued by your talk.","Kevin Hrusovsky","Yes. Absolutely, Derik. I think one of the key points here is just, in general, how fast will Next Gen Sequencing penetrate the clinical market? And I think, certainly, the Roche Alumina situation is, in my mind, potentially a telling sign around the belief systems around NGS. We see it very much right now being utilized in children's hospitals and some cancer hospitals. And they typically will have a cap or plio-type approach and they will be looking at Sanger sequencing to correlate in a kind of a parallel lab approach. The economics and the time of answer, as well as the answers you can get by multiplexing, are very compelling for NGS. We see that as being game-changing compelling. But the real challenge I think is converting these research reports that you're getting today into medical reports. And that is an adoption challenge that you saw with Sanger sequencing, it took really quite a few number of years. What we are encouraged by, we have collaborators. We have a couple of tracks on this and investors will be invited to attend the user group meetings. But what we were encouraged by is that many of the folks that ran these Sanger labs, that were able to get medical reports and get adoption from the clinicians, are now being moved into these NGS labs, and they're actually starting with the medical report, working backward into the workflows. Now where we participate is in the sample prep, and we actually believe that the sample prep is worth so much of the variability is coming from relative to NGS. Primarily because you got the GC bias in many different issues that you have with the samples being taken from the human and getting in them into the right kind of library to go into NGS and that's where we're trying to play. And so GSPs for us was a real nice opportunity to bring informatics into the sample prep. It's both a lens system, as well as it can be an analysis system. And so now, what we're challenging our GSP's think tank with was helping us evolve this into medical reports. And we're very encouraged by -- Rob and the team have acquired 3 or 4 different informatics platforms. They have a phenomenal leader in that informatics business and we're seeing the opportunity to leverage across the informatics infrastructure to try to be the company to help migrate into more of a medical report. So we think it's got real potential starting out in these children hospitals, then we think evolving into cancer where it's more complicated. It's not medallion-type diseases, when you start dealing with cancer and I think that's where -- right now, there's more pushback from the clinicians and the pathologists.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Paul Knight with CLSA.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","In the Asian markets, I know there has been a lot of excitement in your groups about the 90 to 100 sales people that can leverage the Caliper product, Kevin. Is that traction occurring now in the sales effort?","Kevin Hrusovsky","Yes, you know Paul, it's interesting. We had one of the -- a lot of this is a cultural thing, right? And I got to say we had an AIPAC meeting back about a month, a month and a half ago. And I got to tell you, I've never seen a team come together so excitingly. The folks from the PerkinElmer side were being given some amazingly disruptive products to sell. And the folks from the Caliper side were just blown away by the competency of that Asia team and so, I think, there have been some challenges in certain pockets of that Asia operation, historically, which have been filled almost like -- hand in glove with the mergers. I actually think that we had strong Q1 and I believe that the ability for us to continue moving products throughout Asia is probably one of the best parts of this merger.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then, Rob, you had mentioned earlier on the call on analytical instruments, I think, inorganics or that must be your microscopy businesses, is that the driver? And is Asia driving that on the environmental side? What's happening in that big analytical piece right now?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I would say, probably over the last 18 to 24 months, we basically almost have a whole new product line from the inorganic perspective with a number of new products that we've come out with. That, combined with the number of new products we've come out in the molecular spectroscopy area, I think, is really allowing us to do very well in areas like water, food, environmental and chemical analysis. I would say the growth right now is probably disproportionately higher in the Pac Rim and the emerging markets. But, quite frankly, I think, we're seeing good growth across the globe fundamentally driven by these new products that have come out fairly recently.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And lastly, Rob, you were conservative about Europe on your last call, and then you said that Eastern Europe was strong particularly. Are you just continuing that tone or do you see any change in orders in other parts of Europe?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I would say, the one difference in the first quarter versus the first quarter in 2011 was we saw actually strength in Western Europe in the first quarter. And so again we continue to be surprised to the upside by the resiliency of the European demand, at least particularly with our product set.","Operator","You have a follow-up from the line of Dan Brennan with Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just one quick one. I think on your last call, you discussed the U.S. birth rate that was still flat-to-down versus the improved outlook now. So I'm just wondering, can you discuss what type of birth rate you're seeing today and help us think about the leverage for Perkins organic growth from an improving U.S. birth rate?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I would say, I would describe it as it's stabilized. And I just mentioned the fact, in the latter part of the quarter, we saw some small uptick. I think it's probably a little early to call the turn here. But I would say, we think it's and our assumption through the year is it's going to be flattish for 2012. If we see a little bit better that, if we see some growth in the back half of the year, I think, that will provide us some upside. But we're assuming sort of flat birth in the U.S.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to Rob Friel for closing remarks.","Robert F. Friel","So first, well, thank you for your questions and continued interest in PerkinElmer. As some of you know, last week marked the 75th anniversary of PerkinElmer. As we commemorate this important milestone, we are proud of the recognition and the tremendous contributions from our employees, our rich histories of scientific innovation and our commitment to serving our customers, which have shaped our culture over 7 decades. On behalf of our 7,000 employees, I'm excited about continuing to significantly improve human environmental health around the world and help make life better for years to come. With that, I want to thank you and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation. All parties may now disconnect.

My name is Sarah, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Tom Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Tommy Thomas","Thank you, Sarah. Good afternoon, and welcome to the PerkinElmer's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","If you have not received a copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com. Please note, that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website until November 13, 2014.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the safe harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future, even if our estimates change. So you should not rely on any of today's forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date after today.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures we plan to use during this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available as an attachment to our earnings press release. To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during this call that are not reconciled to GAAP in that attachment, we'll provide reconciliations promptly.","I'm pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel. Rob?","Robert F. Friel","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong quarter. We grew organic revenue by 4%, expanded adjusted operating margins by 110 basis points, achieved good operating cash flow, increased adjusted earnings per share by 14% to $0.57, coming in at the high end of our guidance. As Andy will discuss the Q3 financial results in greater detail, I would like to mention a few highlights from the quarter and comment on trends currently impacting our end markets.","In the quarter, we continue to grow market share and further strengthen our already solid positions in core areas of the business such as diagnostics and service. Our strategy to further increase our adjustable markets in these areas continues to be through geographic expansion and broadening our capabilities to meet growing demand.","In diagnostics, we grew low double digits as we continue to benefit from improving birthrates and increasing purchasing power of the middle class outside the U.S., which is creating a nice tailwind for our newborn and prenatal screening and infectious disease testing solutions.","During the third quarter, these 3 product lines actually generated more revenue outside the U.S. than within, whereas, several years ago, over 60% of the revenues were U.S.-centric. We expect this trend to continue as we have recently secured a number of new international customers and are driving expansion of our diagnostics business deeper into new markets.","In our service business, which grew high single digits in the third quarter, we are experiencing strong growth as our customers continue to seek innovative partners like PerkinElmer to help improve productivity and outsource their lab services. Our OneSource solutions are playing a vital role in meeting this demand.","Our recently announced acquisition of Ceiba Solutions will help expand our deep software and services solution with lab IT capabilities focused on lab computing, applications management and scientific development. Similar to our diagnostics business, service grew faster outside the U.S. with high-teens growth in the Asia-Pacific region.","On innovation front, our recently launched new products have been gaining interest among customers, and we are on track to meet our goal of $15 million to $20 million in the second half new product revenue.","Specific application areas where we are gaining traction include the food, forensics and environmental markets with our new mass spec, the Biotherapeutics drug discovery area with our new microfluidics and MultiMode Plate Reader products and the preclinical cellular analysis space with our new High Content Imaging offerings.","In the research and environmental markets, new innovations are critical to driving growth, as these end markets are currently experiencing modest overall growth rates as certain geographies face more challenging macroeconomic headwinds.","In particular, Europe experienced low single-digit growth, consistent with recent declines in broader European economic indicators. And in China, while we grew high single digits, we continue to encounter headwinds in the environmental business due to delays in converting tenders to orders. Despite these delays, we remain bullish on our long-term outlook as the demand for our solutions in analyzing and monitoring environmental conditions in this market continues to grow.","The U.S. remains an area of increasing strength as we grew mid-single-digits in the quarter and experienced accelerating order patterns as we exited the quarter. So overall, our performance within the major geographies was consistent with our expectations, except for Asia-Pacific, where China which fell slightly below our expectations of low double-digit growth.","In addition to our revenue growth, we are also quite pleased with our operational execution in the quarter. Despite the impact of foreign exchange, our incremental revenue to adjusted operating income came close to 50%, reflecting good leverage of our operating expenses and improving mix.","Furthermore, our operating cash flow was roughly equal to our adjusted net income, demonstrating our effective operational execution.","So in summary, we feel very good about our results for the quarter and our progress through the first 3 quarters of the year. On the top line, despite less favorable-than-expected macroeconomic conditions, reporting revenue increased about $60 million or 4% organically, representing a 300-basis-point improvement over our 9-month growth rate this time last year.","Additionally, adjusted operating income increased $32 million to $264 million, translating into 150-basis-point improvement in adjusted operating margins and resulting in a 19% increase in adjusted EPS, despite this year's significant foreign exchange headwinds. And free cash flow, to-date, is significantly higher than this time last year, reflecting a greater-than-90% conversion of free cash flow to adjusted net income. However, arguably more important than our financial success has been the progress we've made in improving our growth profile to introducing more new products and strengthening our organizational capabilities in key growth markets. This progress positions us extremely well to take advantage of the attractive opportunities we see through advanced smart solutions, enabling better screen for adulterants in food and contaminants in water and air, earlier and a more accurate disease detection and more efficient drug discovery.","I would now like to turn the call over to Andy, who will cover our Q3 financial performance and guidance for Q4, and then we'll open the call for your questions. Andy?","Frank A. Wilson","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. As we've done in previous quarters, I'll provide some color on our end markets, a financial summary of our third quarter results. I'll provide some details about our fourth quarter guidance and we'll open up the call, as Rob mentioned, for questions.","Reported adjusted and organic revenue each increased 4% for the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted revenue was $543 million as compared to $523 million in the third quarter of 2013. I want to note the foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact of approximately $3 million versus our third quarter adjusted revenue guidance provided in late July.","By segment, organic revenue in both our Human Health and Environmental Health businesses grew 4%.","Looking at our geographic results. All the regions performed better on a sequential basis as organic revenue increased high single digits in Asia, mid-single-digits in the Americas and were up low single digits in Europe.","Across China, organic revenue increased high single digits, driven by strong demand in our diagnostics business and renewed strength in our research business. While we believe that much of the government activity impacting our Environmental business over the last couple of quarters is winding down, funding continues to be delayed. Despite these challenges, as Rob mentioned, we continue to believe that our product portfolio is well positioned and we expect to see a high single to low double-digit organic revenue growth in China for the year.","From an end-market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 56% of reported revenue in the quarter, with diagnostics representing 29% and research representing 27% of reported revenue.","Organic revenue from our diagnostics business increased low double digits during the third quarter and, as Rob mentioned, strength in our newborn and prenatal screening and infectious disease testing solutions was driven by healthy demand throughout emerging markets bolstered by key wins in Thailand, Brazil and Mexico during the quarter.","Once again, we saw a solid performance from our SYM-BIO business, as infectious disease testing in China grew double digits organically. Our Haoyuan business had another solid quarter, capturing a number of new tenders in the Chinese blood-screening market. We are now beginning to see earlier wins translate into revenue as some provinces have begun to roll out screening ahead of the mandated 2015 start date.","Medical Imaging organic revenue growth was up double digits in the period, driven by growth in our new wireless cassette detector using diagnostic imaging and veterinary applications, and an easier comparison. We expect to see somewhat more moderate growth in the fourth quarter as a result of OEM buying patterns as well as softer European demand.","Our research business declined low single digits in the third quarter. Low single-digit growth in pharma and biotech was offset by continued softness in academic end markets which declined low single digits. A bright spot within the research business was the performance of our microfluidics franchise, up double digits in the quarter.","As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect to see a sequential improvement in our research business driven by our new product introductions, focused on High Content Screening and microfluidics.","Moving to our Environmental Health business which represented 44% of reported revenue in the third quarter. We serve 3 end markets, laboratory services which represented 21% of reported revenue; environmental and safety which represented 15% of reported revenue; and industrial which represented 8% of reported revenue.","As I've mentioned earlier, organic revenue in our Environmental Health business grew 4% in the quarter, driven by continued strength within our service offerings which increased high single digits. In our industrial, environmental and safety end markets, organic revenue was up low single digits in the quarter, as funding delays in China were the primary drivers impacting our instrument revenues. While the volume of tenders being released is modestly improving, we expect to see instrument revenue growth in the fourth quarter, similar to what we saw in the third quarter.","As Rob mentioned, we recently acquired Ceiba Solutions, a leader in Lab IT. The acquired capabilities from Ceiba will help expand our multivendor software and services offering with enhanced information technology focused on lab computing, applications management and scientific applications development. Ceiba will have a de minimis impact on our financial results in 2014.","Turning to our margin performance in the quarter. Adjusted gross margin in the third quarter of 2014 was 47.3%. As our new product introductions continue to gain traction, we expect to see sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, offset by the negative impact from foreign currency and certain revenue mix.","Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter expanded 110 basis points to 16.8% as compared to 15.7% for the same period a year ago. We continue to experience strong leverage from SG&A and R&D productivity initiatives. As we noted in our second quarter call, our R&D spend is still expected to ramp in the fourth quarter, as we continue to efficiently add resources and investments in our center of excellence -- our Center for Innovation at Hopkinton.","By segment, adjusted operating margins in our Human Health business increased approximately 50 basis points to 23.2% as compared to 22.7% in the third quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily a result of productivity actions and volume leverage.","In our Environmental Health business, adjusted operating margins expanded approximately 140 basis points to 12% as compared to 10.6% in the third quarter of last year. The increase was primarily the result of sales mix and ongoing productivity initiatives.","On a non-GAAP basis, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was approximately 20%, and our full year guidance is expected to remain at approximately 21%. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.57 was at the high end of our guidance range, despite being negatively impacted by just over a $0.01 from foreign currency.","Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the third quarter with approximately $860 million of debt and approximately $204 million of cash. We exited the quarter with a debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 2.0x and a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 1.6x. We","are pleased with our cash flow performance year-to-date, as our operating cash flow from continuing operations was $63 million in the third quarter and $186 million for the full 9 months -- first 9 months of 2014.","I'd like to note that the board has approved a new 2-year, 8-million share repurchase program to replace the existing program which expired last week.","Looking back on our results through the first 9 months of 2014, we are encouraged by the resiliency of our organic revenue growth, particularly in light of a somewhat softer global economic backdrop. Productivity initiatives and volume leverage remained key contributors to our year-to-date adjusted operating margin expansion for approximately 150 basis points and working capital improvement that helped contribute to a strong year-over-year cash flow performance.","Turning to the fourth quarter. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact adjusted revenue by approximately $13 million and adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.03.","As a result, we expect reported revenue to be in the range of $595 million to $605 million, driven by improved demand in the U.S. and a slightly weaker Europe, a result of a difficult prior year comparison. Our outlook for APAC is consistent with our performance in the third quarter as strength in our Human Health business is offset by soft environmental safety demand which continues to be negatively impacted by longer government funding cycles. We remain confident in our ability to deliver 130 basis points of operating -- adjusted operating margin expansion for the year, and our guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of approximately 113.8 million shares.","Taking all these items into account, adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of this year is expected in the range of $0.77 to $0.79. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share guidance is expected to be $2.39 to $2.41 with the midpoint of $2.40, a result of a negative impact of approximately $0.04 of foreign currency headwinds in the second half.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time, we would like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company.","Chris Lin - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","This is Chris Lin on for Doug today. So despite revenues coming in, I think, a bit lighter than expected, you still delivered a solid operating margin expansion on a year-over-year basis. As I look at your OpEx, you were able to control R&D and SG&A expenses quite well. And overall, OpEx declined year-over-year, even though the prior year quarter, you decreased operating spending as you went through your restructuring. My question is, can you talk about how many more levers are there left for you to pull on operating expense side given that you've had 2 impressive areas of operating expense control?","Robert F. Friel","Sure. We have obviously done a lot over the last couple of years that is really driving that improvement. And I think as we look forward, we feel like -- we will continue to get the benefit of a smaller footprint, we'll continue to get the benefit of leveraging our facility, our back-office facility in Poland. And we also, on top of that, have other things we're looking at. We have mentioned before our supply chain opportunities in China are still ramping, and we feel like that's going to provide us with some upside over the next couple of years. In addition, we also have an issue around indirect spend. Our goal this year was to take $10 million of indirect spend costs out of the system. I think we're going to have equally, if not greater goals for next year, and so I think we can continue to see good leverage from that. I think I did mention on the R&D side, we are going to continue to build out the R&D facility. So some of that upside that we saw in the second, third quarter, will start to anticipate in the third quarter. But I think overall, we are much more efficient on the R&D front and we will continue to be very diligent on the G&A front.","Chris Lin - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just one more question. So I think at today's spot rates, it will appear FX represents about a 2% headwind. Revenue for --at '15 revenue, is that about right? And I think you guys have a decent and natural hedge in most geographies with few exceptions. Does the revenue headwind via FX trickle down to EPS at slightly above the net margin?","Robert F. Friel","It is slightly higher flow-through, it is a slightly higher flow-through than we've seen in the past, primarily because most of the volatility has been with the euro where we do have a fairly significant cost base. So we are somewhat naturally hedged. I think if you look at the strengthening of dollars since -- if you look at the spot rate, the dollar strengthened about 6%, and a lot of that is in areas where we don't have a significant cost position such as Japan and some of the emerging economies. The flow-through on that top line headwind from FX is a little bit higher and that's why you're seeing the $0.03 on top of the $13 million of revenue headwind.","Chris Lin - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Sorry, I think -- can you just comment on what the FX headwinds for -- on 2015 will be at today's rates?","Robert F. Friel","We will probably talk to you a little bit more about that when we talk about 2015 guidance, and things could change between now and then, so I'd probably defer that until that time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Rob, can you talk about the service business a little? And specifically the question I have is, some of your competitors are focusing on services more of an offering, is it because you've taken share? What are the dynamics going on with some of your peers trying to be a little more focused? And are you worried about it, is my first question.","Robert F. Friel","So first of all, I would say within our service business, as I mentioned, we continue to see good growth there. What we're focusing on is continuing to expand there, particularly in the emerging markets. What we saw in Q3 was strong growth, clearly across all the regions, but particularly strong in the Europe and emerging markets here. I think I mentioned high teens in the APAC area. So our approach is to continue to expand in the emerging markets. I would say with regard to why the competitors are focusing more on service, first of all, I think you guys talked to them about that. But I think what we're -- what we've always felt is the service engineer creates much more relevance with the customer. And as you become more relevant with the customer, hopefully that allows you to pull through additional products. From our perspective, what we're looking to do is to continue to build out our capabilities. And so the Ceiba Solutions acquisition which we've announced fairly recently is an example of where we're continuing to add, in that case, Lab IT. So hopefully differentiate our offering on the services side relative to just sort of repair and overhaul.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And you mentioned that China was, I think, showing better bookings. Could you talk about that you're not actually guiding the higher China growth though in Q4?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I think that's correct. I mean, as I think about China, what we've seen there is diagnostics continue to do very well, really sort of unimpacted by any of the, say, overall slowdown. We saw in the research market in Q3 that come back. And so we actually saw good growth in research. The area that sort of lagged a little bit, and I think we talked about this last quarter, is particularly around the food safety area, that continue to be down. We did see decent growth on environmental. And so given that, that has not snapped back, particularly in Q3, we're being somewhat hopefully conservative and cautious into Q4. But Andy did mention, we are seeing a little bit of improvement on the orders and the tenders. But again, this continual delay in sort of funding has sort of led us to be more conservative in Q4.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Quirk from Jefferies.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","It's actually Dave Clair from Piper Jaffray. So I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the global academic markets. It sounds like those were a little weak this quarter. Can you give us some more info there?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I would say, for us, the academic markets will decline, let's say, low single digits. But what I would point out a couple of things there is, this is where our Radiochemical business is. And of course, that continues to be a drag on the academic markets. And the second thing I would point out, I think we've talked about this in prior quarters, in our in vivo imaging business, in the third quarter, some of the royalty revenue or licensing revenue that we had received historically sort of has come off. And so when you look at our low single-digit decline in the quarter, it was really driven by those 2 things. The radiochemical business and the reduction in our licensing revenue in the in vivo business.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then I know you guys aren't giving 2015 guidance today. But how should we think about 2015 operating margin expansion?","Frank A. Wilson","Well, I think we have communicated fairly consistently, that we believe we can drive 60 to 80 basis points of margin expansion on mid-single-digit growth. And I think that calculus still holds. I think we're always looking for ways to accelerate that. In some cases, we may end up expanding margins faster. In some cases, we may spend it back, but I think, that's probably a pretty good proxy going forward.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last one for me. And it sounds like you're making some good headway on the China and AT [ph] opportunity? Can you just give us a little bit more color on the number of tenders that you're winning? And it sounds like actually testing might be starting out on a regular basis in some areas a little bit faster than expected.","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I think we continue to feel good about the blood-screening market in China. We talked about the fact that we continue to do a nice job on winning tenders there. We're continuing to build out our production capacity in China. So I think we feel good about the opportunity that, that presents itself. And I think as I mentioned in the past, it's currently sort of single-digit millions for us from a revenue perspective, but we do -- we would expect, when you look out a couple of years, this is probably a $20-million or $30-million business for us in a couple of years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken from ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe on the capital allocation side, obviously, you re-upped without the 8-million share buyback. Can you talk about how should we think about sort of pacing there and transpose that again sort of the more recent activity over the last few years which has been more tuck-in driven. You've obviously gone through a period here where you've probably been a little bit less active than maybe you wanted but valuations have also been up. And so help us put that puzzle kind of together.","Robert F. Friel","And so I would say, Ross, first of all, I think our preference is to do the tuck-ins as they obviously make good strategic sense and have good financial returns associated with them. As you mentioned, that's been a little challenging in this environment. I will tell you, more recently, the pipeline looks -- I would say, we're more optimistic with our pipeline. And so I think that was one of the reasons why in Q3, we weren't as active in the share buyback as maybe we could have been. But at the same time, we want to have the flexibility so that if we're not successful with the tuck-ins, we want to be sort of aggressive on the share buyback area, so that was really the basis behind -- or the background behind asking the board to sort of not only re-up the historical 6 million shares but actually increase it to 8 million. With regard to how we would specifically pace that out, I think that's going to be largely dependent on what kind of success we have with the bolt-ons or the tuck-ins.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And I guess, as you look at your core debt [ph] activity in the last 6 to 12 months or year-to-date, and do you feel like you've wanted to be more active and you're -- you just seen assets trade away from you? And has that been more on the higher growth areas? I mean, maybe just give a little bit of color of what's transpired over the course of the year. Because it's been a fairly inactive year for you in general.","Robert F. Friel","I would say probably the single biggest reason for our lack of doing some of the deals is probably valuation, you're saying -- and of course, that would be largely around the higher-growth assets. So when we look at some things that we felt were particularly attractive from a strategic perspective, we were just challenged by coming up with the valuation numbers. And so I think, one of the things -- hopefully, we'll continue to be as disciplined in the returns that we look at from an acquisition perspective. I think we sort of tried to point out in the past that while we will be opportunistic and we will look for bolt-ons, we don't feel like there's anything that really we sort of have to do. And so I think we can be a little bit disciplined. But at the same time, we recognize that, particular to assets that's got good growth prospects that in this environment, people are paying up for it and to be competitive, we'll have to be aggressive. And so we've got to make sure that, that asset fits well with us strategically, that we can try to put synergies and that sort of 1 plus 1 is greater than 2.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Leonard from Leerink.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So it looks like your gross margin's going to be down pretty sharply in the fourth quarter. How much of that is foreign currency versus other factors? And is there any -- are there any actions you can implement to help offset?","Frank A. Wilson","I think FX is clearly a piece of it. I would say, it's maybe not quite half. The rest of it is clearly ongoing mix with very strong service revenues, we think we'll continue into the fourth quarter, which is fairly consistent with kind of what we've seen historically. I think the one thing that could change that is the uptake in our new products. We are seeing very strong gross margins on the new products we've launched. So if we can see a pickup there, I think that will be a positive. And again, some of the things I talked about, for operating margin also affect gross margin, which is around our supply chain. I think going forward, we hope to start to see some pickup on procurement in Asia in the fourth quarter, but more so, in the second half, but we should see some benefit from that.","Robert F. Friel","I think the other thing I would mention is -- and we've talked about this in the past, as we continue to grow in emerging markets, the dynamic there from a P&L perspective is it usually puts a little pressure on gross margins but it's accretive from an operating margin perspective because our operating expenses in that region of the world has the tendency to be lower. And so again, this growth in emerging markets is also putting pressure on -- as I said, it's accretive to operating margins but it does have the impact of being dilutive to our gross margins.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And I guess my follow-up. So I feel like your services business has been growing faster than the corporate average for years. But the negative impact on gross margin seems to have shown up more recently. Is that fair? And if it is, is there maybe -- to the extent that -- are people just needing more things repaired now than previously to the degree it's kind of an insurance business and folks are...","Robert F. Friel","I would say, first of all, as you point out, the service business has been going well. And as we've talked about in the past, the service business is, in most part, accretive to our operating margins. So that's actually been one of the contributors when you look at the significant operating margin expansion that we've had over the last couple of years. Depending on the type of service that's done and whether it includes our spare parts or not will also get to the point of whether it's accretive or dilutive in the gross margin area.","Operator","Our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On Europe, I want to spend a minute on that region. Now I'm just curious how you're paced throughout the third quarter just given what we're seeing in the macro picture here and curious what is baked into your expectations for the fourth quarter this year?","Robert F. Friel","Well, we actually saw Europe get a little bit better through the third quarter. But what we've built in is actually down a little bit in Europe relative to the growth we saw in the third quarter and that's fundamentally driven by comparisons or comps. If you look at our -- our fourth quarter in 2013, we had a very strong Europe and it was up high single digits. And so we're -- again, hopefully we're being conservative. But given the comp that we have in the fourth quarter, in our guidance, we're assuming Europe actually is down low single digits.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just on the newborn business, as we think about the overall trend globally on birth rates, at least in the U.S., it seems like things have gotten better throughout the year. And I'd be curious if you guys are expecting that to accelerate into the end of this year and into next year? Or if we're on a slow-but-steady kind of improvement?","Robert F. Friel","No, I would say the U.S. birth rates for us, while they're increasing, they're not increasing -- they're not improving at an increasing rate. So U.S. birth rates, the ones that we track are probably at 1%, 1.5% increase year-over-year. The growth that we're really seeing in the newborn area is really outside the U S. And some of that is birth rates, but quite frankly, more of that is adoption. So I think Andy mentioned a little bit of this in his prepared remarks, but what we saw in the third quarter were significant wins in Thailand, Brazil. We've recently signed a big contract in Mexico. China grew over 20% in newborn. So newborn is really expanding outside the U.S. Some growth in Europe, but again, it's largely in the emerging markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Miroslava Minkova from Stifel.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Let me just start with the new product. I'm curious -- if you could give us some color on how your new products are doing in the marketplace is particularly the AxION iQT. And you did mention in the script that you're comfortable with the $15 million to $20 million contribution. Did the new products help in the third quarter? And how -- where are you with the launches?","Robert F. Friel","So as I mentioned, we feel very good about the progress and with the new products. What -- we think we're tracking well for the $15 million, $20 million, if you look at Q3, we think the benefit was probably in the high single millions, probably call it, $8 million to $9 million is what the benefit was in Q3, so again tracking well for the sort of high teens for the back half of the year. If you look across -- I think we feel good at the traction on all of them. The Phoenix, the EnSight, the Touch and the AxION iQT, I think that continues to see good feedback from customers. So I think we feel pretty good about that.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And a follow-up. I was wondering if I could get you to reflect a little bit on the overall growth trend in your business towards that mid-single-digit growth trajectory targeted organic growth rate? You came close to that this quarter, but you're still sort of at the low end of it. What will it take for you to get more consistency towards the 5%-ish kind of growth rate? Is it all about China?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I think that was probably a little bit of an issue relative to our guidance. But I think, for us, let's say in sort of through the cycle is we've got to get some growth out of Europe. I mean, I think it's going to be difficult to get to sort of 5% or 6% growth if Europe continues to be flat or low single digits. So I would say that's the biggest contributor from a geographic perspective. I think from an end-market perspective, we are seeing nice growth in diagnostics. We're seeing decent growth in the Pharma area. Academic is still a little slow, and I think that's probably attributable to the government funding side. And then again, in some of the emerging markets, some of the areas of industrial and environmental, if we saw a pickup there, I think that'd helpful. So as I would think about getting the sort of mid-single-digits.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tosha from Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Tosha","I wonder, Rob, if I could ask you to reflect for another minute on the comment that you made about the strength in the U.S. You made a comment specifically indicating that the U.S. picked up through the quarter, exited a little stronger. And was that a comment more on the end markets? Or was that a comment on Perkin? Was there any contribution from new product flow embedded in that comment about the U.S.?","Robert F. Friel","So the comment specifically was about PerkinElmer. So I was talking about our specific ordering pattern. We did see it increasing through the end of the quarter there, so we felt good about that. By the way, I do -- it does feel like the end markets seem to be improving as well. And if you look at some of the macro indicators, it does seem like the U.S. economy is sort of improving, maybe not as quickly as everybody would like. But our forecast for Q4 actually assumes the U.S. improves over Q3. And to some extent, going back to my prior comment where we're assuming Europe comes down a little bit, fundamentally because it had difficult comps. We're looking to sort of offset that or replace that with a little higher growth coming out of the U S.","Stephen Tosha","Got it, really helpful. And then I wonder if you could think about the path forward in China for growth. We're all focused on the potential for these budgetary constraints to be resolved. But I wonder, if we're in a scenario where the budgetary constraints are resolved, how we should think about growth? You could argue that there's a potential for China to return to something akin to its prior growth profile, but then in the next few quarters, we'll have easy comps. So if you just do a really simple arithmetic, you might argue that it could be a strong double-digit growth driver. Should we take the view that maybe the growth recovers or maybe it's healthy growth on top of easy comps?","Robert F. Friel","So I think when you look at our China business, you really got to break it into the 3 components. So first of all, our diagnostics business has consistently been growing, let's call it 20% maybe even a little better. I think for the foreseeable future, that continues. Because we're getting good penetration, as I mentioned before, on both the newborn and the prenatal. We're seeing infectious disease continue to grow nicely. Some of that's new products. And of course, we've got blood screening coming on we think more significantly in '15. If you look at research, we've started to see some good recovery there in Q3. We think that continues into Q4. So again I think that's going to be a more modest increase over the next couple of quarters and maybe will return to sort of double digit or midteen growth there. I think the area where your sort of comments are more germane is really around the environmental or more specifically for us, the food area where we have seen sort of declining revenue over the last couple of quarters as these tenders have sort of backed up. And there's a possibility it could snapback very quickly. My sense is when it does open up, it will sort of open up the funnel and it will be more measured. Now you will have easier comps in that area, but I don't think there's going to be a huge snapback in growth and you won't see it pop up in 1 or 2 quarters. I think that will be more measured over a longer period of time.","Operator","Next question comes from Dan Arias from Citigroup.","Daniel Anthony Arias - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Rob, on blood screening in China, as we move towards 2015 here, how are you thinking about the pacing of revenues there as the mandate becomes effective? Do you see that being pretty metered? Or are you expecting a bolus, one way or another, as everyone sort of...","Robert F. Friel","I think it's probably -- our sense is it's probably more in the back half as this thing sort of gets ramped up. I think as you know it's supposed to start 1\/1, but we think there will be a probably a little bit of delay, and not all the provinces will probably start that the same time. So we think, by the time we get to Q3, we'll probably been where we probably need to be. So at least our -- as we're thinking about it now, that sort of paces out somewhat in the first and second quarter. But by the time we get to the back half, you probably got everybody sort of complying with the requirements.","Daniel Anthony Arias - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then if I could just go back to China once more. Last quarter, you kind of quantified the scope of the tender delays by saying that I think 35% of the Environmental Health business was affected by that dynamic. So I guess based on the way that you just talked about the different end markets, where would you sort of put that number at this point?","Robert F. Friel","So I think that's probably still a pretty good number. I mean, if you look at the environmental business right now, again it's really focused for us in really the food area what we would call safety and security. And that's probably in the 35% to 40% of our business in China. That's when it's been slow. Actually, environmental grew fairly significantly in the quarter. And industrial sort of flattish. So I would say it's probably 35% to 40% of our Environmental business, which right now is about half of China, so just to give you a calibration there.","Operator","Next question comes from Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","My question for you, Andy, on the indirect spend side, you mentioned the savings there, $10 million you targeted this year. Can you talk about the areas you're targeting? And how much flexibility do you have to perhaps step that up next year?","Frank A. Wilson","Well, I think we have a lot of opportunities to step it up. I mean, I think really, what we were trying to get across this year is really exposing the entire workforce to the initiative. We've put tools in place. We have all kinds of opportunities that we're going after at a facility level. But I think if you look at our overall indirect spend, it's well north of $400 million. So if you just look at our percentage improvement year-over-year, it doesn't take much to get to $10-plus million. I think it's interesting as we end up rolling out initiatives across PerkinElmer, we tend to have a great uptake. And I think there's been a lot of work around this and I think as we start to put together our plans for next year, I think you'll see something, hopefully, well north of that $10 million target for next year.","Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. And just to clarify, how much of that is volume dependent? Is that all independent of what the top line looks like next year?","Frank A. Wilson","Some of it does have a volume dependency. But I would say, a large slot of it is not volume dependent. And it depends on how you want to classify it, I mean, travel is a very significant expense, it's somewhat volume related but office supplies and so forth tends to be less so.","Operator","Next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I won't ask about China. On neonatal, I'm wondering if you can just talk on that. You talked about -- or actually prenatal, I'm sorry. Your 20 months into this Verinata collaboration. Maybe just talk about how that's trended relative to expectations. And then, are you getting any traction from the Good Start collaboration as well?","Robert F. Friel","So I would say prenatal for us grew, I think, was sort of high single digits in the quarter. A lot of that was outside the U S. Let's say, as we've talked about in the past, specifically in the U.S. so the Verinata arrangement, it's really -- gets down to how quickly the cash payments sort of flow from the payers. We are, I would say, over the last 90 days, we have seen good progress there, so we're at a point now where I think the cash collections are getting much more, I would say, reasonable. I would say the other thing in the quarter, we reached agreement with Alumina on a couple of issues and we've now extended our contract for another 2 years. So we feel good about that. And I would say the third thing that I think helping us to some extent is, we've seen a lot historically some of the competitors in the space do some things with regard to guaranteeing minimum payments or out-of-pocket. And we're starting to see some of the payers sort of impose what I'll call a more level playing field there. And I think the combination of those things, I think, make us feel much better about the business as we go into '15.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then going back to the question on M&A before, you don't have a lot of leverage. You're focused on tuck-ins. I guess, can you maybe just talk about the thought process for not looking at larger deals. I understand there's maybe some valuation disconnects out there, but it's still a very fragmented industry. And maybe talk about the maximum leverage you could consider taking on if larger deals did hit your radar screen.","Robert F. Friel","I would just say, one of things that -- when you look at larger deals, our sense is it's much more disruptive to the enterprise. So whether you can manage that or not. But probably more importantly, when we look out there, we're not necessarily looking to build scale for scale's sake. What we're really looking is where are the opportunities for us to build significant relative market scale. And so we want to look for acquisitions that build in the spaces where we're strong, and it's just hard to find big targets that do that. And I think that's probably the bigger issue. It's just that there isn't something out there, at least from our perspective, that is attractive, that's large, that builds in our areas of strength. So take for example, newborn screening or imaging or any of the areas where we think we're differentiated and focused. And so I think that's fundamentally the challenge for us.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Then one last one, since you did mention imaging, any thoughts on the flat-panel market? It looks like CapEx budgets are freeing up a little bit in the U.S. Has that business picked up for you at all?","Robert F. Friel","As Andy mentioned, we had a very strong Q3. We think we're going to do sort of probably mid single in Q4. We are seeing some push outs from a timing perspective, but I think as we've talked about historically, we think this is a business that probably grows mid- to high single digits. We've introduced some new products, most notably around the cassette, and we're also starting to get some FDA approval of our panels, which will open up adjacencies into the clinical market. So I think -- we still feel good about this business and like I said, can grow sort of high single digits.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Rob, early in the script, you mentioned market share gains in the quarter. Could you elaborate on exactly which verticals you experience the most acutely?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I would say specifically in the diagnostics and service area where we're seeing double-digit growth rates there. Our view is we're able to go in and take some share. In some cases, it may be -- in case of service, it may be customers that are outsourcing internal or it may be the case of -- in our diagnostic business is where we're taking business away from local competitors. But clearly, at sort of double-digit growth rates, we feel like we're growing faster than the market.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And Andy, a 2-part question for you. You made some nice progress on the working capital front. Can you remind us if you've made any or planned any U.S. pension contributions this year? And then secondly, what type of free cash flow conversion ratio would you expect is achievable for 2015?","Frank A. Wilson","We -- I think, noted in the previous call, we did make a fairly significant pension contribution last year and we don't really have a need for a pension contribution in the U.S. planned over the next few years. So I don't foresee any cash outflow in that regard. I would say if you back out some of the restructuring activity as we go forward, and I think you will see that abate somewhat, I think there's no reason we shouldn't be at that 100-plus free cash net income conversion. We're about 92% year-to-date. And that's certainly our goal. That will certainly be our target as we go into 2015. I think some of the improvement -- there's still a lot more improvement left to be done on the working capital side. I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be reporting that 100-plus in the near future.","Operator","Next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You'd never -- you didn't specifically say an organic revenue growth target for the year. I mean, it was 4% to 6%, you didn't really update that. Could -- I assume we're -- just sort of given some of the headwinds in China and Europe, we're probably for the full year, we're tracking closer to the 4% to 5% range rather than 5% to 6%.","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I think that's a fair assumption.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. I mean, do you think it's still achievable? I mean, do you think the higher end could potentially happen if things go away? Or you just -- is that out of the question?","Robert F. Friel","I'd hate to say it's out of the question, but we would need some fairly significant growth in the fourth quarter to be able to get to 6%.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And I guess just sort of -- through doing the math here, it's like what -- do you have sort of impact on sort of relative to where your initial expectations were, sort of Europe and China, are in terms of where you thought you're going to be on an organic growth basis to where you ended up? Basically, are those weaker markets cutting you by 1 point, 1.5 points, just some color on where the impact is?","Robert F. Friel","If we look at Q3, for example, I would say, America's at, call it, 4 mid-single-digits. That's about what we expected. If you look at Europe at sort of low single digits, that's about what we expected. If you look at APAC, which again was sort of high single digits, that's about what we expected, maybe 100 basis points short and it really gets down to China. And so I think as we mentioned, China came in at high single digits, which isn't a bad number. But we historically and actually expected, it could be sort of low double. So that was really when you sort of cut through from a expectation to actual, it really gets down to a little bit light in the APAC, and it was fundamentally China.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And you mentioned sort of the imaging royalties coming off. What -- does that create a significant headwind in 2015?","Robert F. Friel","It creates a headwind, I don't know if it will be significant. But what I would say is, we've got a fairly extensive intellectual property portfolio. And while there were some coming off on the in vivo side, we continue to make good progress in some of the other areas. And so in any given quarter, we've got probably a couple million dollars of licensing revenue maybe positive or negative. So it's just sort of something that we deal with in any given quarter. But I would say the headwind in '15, I wouldn't call it a significant headwind.","Frank A. Wilson","And it's really more, Derik, in the first half because some of those patents fell off kind of midyear so we've seen some of the impact to that in the second half. So that V will really be a first-half V.","Operator","Our next question comes from Zarak Khurshid from Wedbush Securities.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Rob, so how should we be thinking about the growth in the prenatal serum screening NTD business?","Robert F. Friel","I think that's a business that probably over time, it's flat and maybe down a little bit. It's not as much from a volume perspective, but it's continued pricing pressure. I would say, so -- and when you talk about NTD in the U.S., when you go outside of the U.S., for the kids, we continue to see strong growth there. But I would say the NTD business over time is sort of flat to down slightly.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then how should we be thinking about NIPT potentially eating into that average risk market? And just generally, how big of a like kind of a long-term headwind is the NTD business long term? Can you give us a sense just of the size of the business?","Robert F. Friel","I think eventually that probably occurs. I think we're still some time off that from NPT going to sort of average risk. But for us right now, the NTD business is, I want to say, it's $20 million or something, so not a huge part of our business but I'll give you that rough size.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then last one. Just on -- while we're talking about the IP on the in vivo imaging side, how is the licensing revenue coming through on the caliber side of the business? I know they're pretty good at asserting that microfluidics IP.","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I was sort of -- to some extent, what I was referencing before when I was talking at -- with the microfluidics, again, it's a little bit lumpy depending on any given quarter. But for example, this quarter, we did have some nice microfluidics licensing income come in that helped offset the in vivo runoff of the patent. So I think we continue to appropriately enforce our IP and consequently that periodically allows us to put some additional income in any given quarter.","Operator","Next question comes from Peter Lawson from Mizuho.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Just thinking about 2015. Which businesses excite you the most heading into '15? And which new products could be meaningful?","Robert F. Friel","Peter, I would say, all of the businesses excite me going into '15. And I hope all my business leaders are listening to this. But seriously, look, I think we have nice growth prospects across the board. Clearly, the macro indicators would imply that the diagnostics business, I think, continues to do quite well. And probably the service businesses sort of spike those 2 out earlier. But look, our expectation is that all the businesses should be able to get the sort of mid-single-digit growth or better. With regard to the new products, I think, we continue to feel good about the products around the research area. We're making good progress there. The Alpha Phoenix has had very strong demand, as is some of the other products. And we continue to feel good about the AxION with regard to the applications in some of the end markets there. And I would say, clearly, while we've talked specifically about the products that we introduced in the back half of the year, our expectation as we get into '15, that we'll continue to roll out significant amount of new products. And that will continue to be a big contributor to our growth next year.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And just a quick question. Andy, I joined the call late. The EPS impact for 2015, what would that be on the bottom line?","Frank A. Wilson","We'll probably provide that when we give guidance for '15 because obviously it could likely change. We just mentioned it was $13 million and $0.03 in the fourth quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bryan Brokmeier from Maxim Group.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","There appear to be a few more locations on the map of your Elm air-monitoring system. Are you generating interest in that system? And how is -- I think the largest is probably in Massachusetts, in Boston. How is that pilot program going? And any other comments that you have based on the early adoption of it.","Robert F. Friel","I would say we continue to get a lot of interest. We were at analytical over at Shanghai a couple of weeks ago and got some good interest there. And we're seeing good interest not only from the municipalities but also industrial companies as well. So we've got a couple of pilots here. We'll probably be taken off in the latter part of the year or early '15. And so we continue to be sort of excited about it. Again, what we tried to explain to people is we don't think there's any revenue in '14 but as we get into '15 here, it could be incremental to our growth.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue. So I'll turn the call back over to Rob Friel for closing remarks.","Robert F. Friel","First of all, thank you, all, for your questions. And I hope you got a sense that we feel great about our performance in the third quarter and year-to-date. And we believe we're in a great position to achieve a solid finish to the year as well as continued long-term success. Thank you for your continued interest in PerkinElmer, and have a great evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

Please proceed, sir.","Tommy Thomas","Thanks, Jillian. Good afternoon, and welcome to the PerkinElmer First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","If you have not received a copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com. Please note that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website until May 9, 2013.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release, issued earlier this afternoon, and also those in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future, even if our estimates change.

To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during the call that are not reconciled to GAAP in that attachment, we'll provide reconciliations promptly.","I'm now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel. Rob?","Robert F. Friel","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As many of you may have seen in our earnings release, in the first quarter this year, we experienced a 1% decline in revenue, following 12 consecutive quarters of greater than 3% organic growth. This lower-than-expected revenue, combined with our previously communicated growth and productivity investments, resulted in lower operating profit, and consequently, adjusted EPS was lower than both our forecast in Q1 of last year.","During today's call, I will summarize what caused our top line miss, how it impacted our financial performance this quarter, as well as what we expect for the rest of the year. In addition, I will discuss several of the qualitative accomplishments this quarter.","Turning first to our revenue in the quarter. 85% of our product lines performed as we expected and grew quite well during the first quarter. Our shortfall in the quarter was almost exclusively due to 3 distinct parts of our business that together represent about 15% of our revenue. While a small portion of our business, the magnitude of the decline in these areas drove the overall 1% organic revenue decline.","The first of these areas was our environmental instrument business in Western Europe, which declined midteens versus our expectation of low single-digit declines. While the revenue declines were fairly broad-based and not restricted to any one country, from an end market perspective, the most significant headwinds were felt in the industrial end markets. As some of you may recall, at the beginning of 2012, we were quite bearish on macroeconomic conditions in Western Europe and planned accordingly. Despite the difficult operating environment in 2012, we were able to significantly exceed our projections in both Q1 and Q2. Although we remain cautious this year, conditions proved to be more challenging than we had anticipated.","The second area of unanticipated weakness was in Japan. Japan represents about 5% of our revenue and has recently been growing high single digits. In fact, I was there at the end of 2012 attending a large customer event and did not detect any concern for funding or reduction in demand. Our forecast assumed a slight decline in Japan in the first quarter due to difficult year-over-year comparisons, resulting from strong sales of our radiometric detection instruments generated from the disaster response in 2011 and early 2012. However, our actual results declined over 25%. Lags in government funding resulted from the delay of supplementary budget approval, along with the lower yen and a general cautionary spending environment, impacted not only our radiometric detection business but the majority of our product offerings across the portfolio in Japan.","The third factor impacting this quarter's financial performance was a significant decline in our in vivo imaging business, a product line that has a been historically long strong performer, generating midteens growth, and one which we believe we have very strong market share. As a portion of this business that's exposed through academic funding in the U.S., we assumed its growth would moderate to mid-single digits in the early part of this year, due to concerns over sequestration. However, this business was also down more than 25% in the quarter as delays in funding for academic laboratories brought on by austerity concerns were more severe not only in the United States but internationally as well. Due to the significant costs in our in vivo instruments and our strong share in this business, we generally have a strong indication of which customers will purchase and when purchase orders will be received. Going into March, we believed that we had good line of sight to achieve our in vivo forecast.","Unfortunately, the majority of our deal pipeline was pushed out due to a number of reasons, which fundamentally centered on concerns over the uncertainty of future funding. Fortunately, we do not believe any of these deals were lost and believe most of the projected first quarter orders will result in future purchases.","Before discussing our adjusted operating profit, I would like to briefly touch on the remaining 85% of our business, which as I mentioned previously, performed quite well and continues to generate very good growth.","Our Diagnostic business grew mid-single digits and with contributions for both screening and medical imaging. Our screening business experienced good growth across every product area and geography, and with the newborn area growing double digits and our business in China continue to expand over 20%. Also, of note this quarter, was that based on our newborn screening data that appears that birth rates in the U.S. have increased almost 3% in the last 12 months. In the Medical Imaging business, despite difficult year-over-year comparisons, we continued to grow mid-single digits, and in fact, shipped the largest number of panels in the history of the business.","Turning to our research business. We experienced good growth in those areas, where we have prioritized our investments, including sample prep for next-gen sequencing and reagents for the biotherapeutic area and High Content Screening. And our informatics business continues to perform well, growing over 20% in the quarter.","Finally, in the environmental business, while our instruments have come under pressure, as I mentioned previously, particularly in Europe and Japan, the service business continues to grow, expanding mid-single digits as we win new customers with our comprehensive OneSource program.","Turning now to operating income. When we issued guidance, we discussed our plans to use the incremental profit from our planned growth in the first quarter of the year to complete several productivity projects, as well as fuel incremental growth investments. Therefore, we guided to minimal adjusted operating margin expansion in the first half of this year. Since our revenue actually declined slightly in the quarter rather than increase, we, obviously, did not generate any incremental profit from the higher revenue. And as a result, our incremental costs have resulted in lower operating margins year-over-year. In addition, as our revenue shortfall did not become apparent until very late in the quarter, we did not have an opportunity to offset the revenue miss. Furthermore, much of the revenue that experienced the unexpected contraction carries some of our highest gross margins, which further compounded the profit delta and resulted in a very high percentage of the revenue miss flowing through to the bottom line.","And for the remainder of the year, we've reforecasted both the top and bottom line assumptions to reflect more modest revenue growth, particularly in the short term. Specifically, we are assuming our demand profile in Q2 is similar to Q1, with Europe and Japan continuing to be challenging. However, we believe our in vivo imaging business will return to positive organic growth this quarter. As we move into the second half of this year, we believe the severity of the headwinds will moderate, and we will return to an organic growth rate more similar to what we had in plan, albeit probably at the lower end of our original forecast.","Consequently, we now believe that for the full year, we will grow organically in low single digits as compared to mid-single digits communicated in January. In an effort to offset some of the profit miss from the lower revenue forecast, we will be both moderating our investment plans for the remainder of the year, as well as pursuing additional prudent cost actions and accelerating some previously planned productivity actions. However, given that the large bulk of our business continues to perform as planned and are in attractive growth markets, we believe it is important to maintain the appropriate balance between investing in growth and disciplined cost management.","While Andy will cover the specifics of the guidance, overall, we believe Q2 will be another difficult quarter, where our financial results will be below last year. However, we believe that through actions we plan to take in Q2, and some recovery in the impacted areas, the adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS for the second half of the year to be close to our original guidance.","Before turning the call over to Andy to cover our financial results in more detail, I would like to quickly highlight some of the areas where we made good progress in the quarter against our management priorities for the year.","First of all, in the quarter, we continued to make strong headway on rationalizing our production footprint and are on target to transfer manufacturing several product lines to lower-cost regions by the end of June. We are accelerating our efforts to expand our global reach, most recently through opening of our new South African office. And we are in the process of growing our direct presence in other expanding economies such as Turkey, Israel and Vietnam.","This quarter, we continued our efforts through developing the next generation of screening assays for genetic diseases such as SCIDS, which we discussed last quarter, and have now deployed, as well as Fragile X, a genetic disease that can result in mental retardation and neuro degeneration. This assay has already been successful with our collaborators in Hong Kong, and we look forward to expanding use later this year.","Additionally, our recently introduced Spectrum Two infrared spectrometer instrument has been introduced in the air monitoring, food analysis, oil analysis and a wide array of applications within customers that meet expanding needs in measuring contamination in the world around us. We also continue to expand our prenatal and informatics capabilities in the quarter, and we are pleased to announce the expansion of our contract with Aetna to include an IPT screening. Aetna's approximately 20 million covered patients will now have access to Verinata Health's verify prenatal test, helping to accelerate the broader adoption of noninvasive prenatal testing.","Now let me turn the call over to Andy, and then we'll open the call to your questions.","Frank A. Wilson","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with prior quarters, I'll provide additional color on our end markets, the financial summary of our first quarter results and details around our revised 2013 guidance. And then we'll open up the call for any questions you might have.","As Rob mentioned earlier, the majority of our businesses performed as expected. We did, however, experience declines in instrument demand late in the quarter concentrated in 3 key areas. Specifically, we saw declines in the environmental instrument business in Western Europe, overall weaker demand in Japan and significant declines within the in vivo imaging business. I will provide additional details on our top line performance later in my prepared remarks.","Reported revenue for the first quarter declined 1%, while adjusted revenue declined by 2% to $507 million as compared to the first quarter 2012. Organic revenue for the quarter declined 1% as compared to the same period a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.36 as compared to $0.43 in the same period a year ago, impacted by the lack of volume growth and negative mix with the decline in higher-margin revenue and incremental growth in productivity investments deployed through the quarter.","By geography, organic revenue in the Americas grew low single digits. Asia declined low single digits, and Europe declined at a high single digit rate. China remained resilient with growth of approximately 20%.","Looking at organic revenue by product category. Recurring revenue, which includes reagents, consumables and service, was solid with mid-single digit growth in the quarter. This was the -- primarily the result of continued demand for our diagnostic products and strength in our OneSource and informatics offerings. Instruments declined at a high single digit rate, negatively impacted by delayed capital equipment spending due to funding delays, primarily in Europe and Japan as we discussed.","From an end market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represented approximately 56% of reported revenue in the quarter. We served 2 end markets in Human Health: diagnostics, which represented 29% of reported revenue; and research, which represented 27% of reported revenue. Organic revenues for the Human Health segment were flat in the quarter.","Organic revenue in our Diagnostics business increased mid-single digits during the quarter, with continuing contributions for both our screening and Medical Imaging offerings. Our screening business benefited from increasing birth rates in the U.S. and the expansion of our prenatal, newborn and infectious disease solutions in key regions outside the U.S. We continue to be pleased with our organic revenue performance for the Diagnostics market in China, which delivered organic growth above 20%, once again, in the first quarter of 2013.","As Rob mentioned, we remain optimistic regarding our partnership with Verinata and also we're encouraged by the progress we've made since we launched on February 1. We are also delighted that Aetna will now begin offering the Verinata's verify noninvasive prenatal tests to their 20 million members.","Moving to Medical Imaging. The organic revenue grew mid-single digits despite a difficult year-over-year comparison of over 20% organic revenue growth in the first quarter of 2012. This business continues to benefit from OEM relationships in the traditional medical diagnostic imaging offerings, while our CMOS imaging technology continues to be selected for use in adjacent high-growth verticals, including a number of incremental wins in the quarter for industrial, nondestructive testing applications.","Turning to our Research business. We experienced mid-single digit declines in the quarter versus the comparable period in 2012, as sequestration concerns in the U.S., European austerity and weak research markets in Asia, most notably Japan, contributed to unexpected delays and push outs late in the quarter in 2 key product lines. Specifically, in vivo imaging declined over 20%, a result of delays in both the U.S. and Europe, while radiometric detection instruments declined significantly due primarily to softness in Japan. Declines in these higher-margin product lines also adversely impacted adjusted operating margins.","Regarding informatics, we continue to be pleased with our innovative product offerings, which once again had organic revenue growth in excess of 20% as compared to the same period a year ago, driven by a strong performance from our Spotfire offering and solid demand for the core lab notebook.","We are proud to report that our Ensemble Electronic Lab Notebooks solutions for chemistry, biology, and quality assurance and control received superior accolades in Gartner's ELN industry study earlier in the quarter. As you will recall, informatics is now reported as a part of our Human Health segment within the Research business.","Moving to Environmental Health, which represented 44% of reported revenue in the first quarter, we serve 3 end markets: laboratory services, which represented 19% of reported revenue; environmental and safety, which represented 17% of reported revenue; and industrial, which represented 8% of reported revenue.","During the quarter, we experienced mid-single digit organic growth in laboratory services. Within environmental and safety, we saw low single-digit organic revenue declines, while industrial experienced a mid-teens organic revenue decline, as both of these markets were impacted by lower demand, particularly in Europe and Japan as compared to the same period a year ago.","Turning to our adjusted margin performance in the period. Adjusted operating margins in the first quarter were 12.6% as compared to 15.3% in the comparable period a year ago. The key drivers of the significant year-over-year decline were lower revenue, an unfavorable mix, as I mentioned earlier, as well as our previously announced growth in productivity investments, as well as some currency headwinds. Adjusted operating income was $63.7 million as compared to $79 million in the comparable period a year ago, as lower gross margins were modestly offset by productivity actions in SG&A.","By segment, adjusted operating margins in our Human Health segment for the quarter were 17.8%, representing a decline of approximately 160 basis points as compared to the first quarter of 2012. This decline was primarily attributable to the adverse mix in our Research business, and growth in productivity investments deployed in the quarter.","Our Environmental Health segment delivered adjusted operating margins of 10.4% in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to 14.8% a year ago. This decline is due to lower revenue volumes, resulting from weaker industrial end markets, specifically in Europe and Japan, and an unfavorable instrument mix.","GAAP operating income from continuing operations was $35.9 million in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to $36.4 million in the same period a year ago, due primarily to lower revenues mitigated somewhat by lower SG&A spending. On a non-GAAP basis, our adjusted tax rate was approximately 21%, and we now expect our adjusted tax rate for 2013 to be approximately 22%.","GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2013 was $0.28 as compared to $0.19 per share in first quarter of last year. As mentioned, adjusted earnings per share was $0.36 in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to $0.43 in the comparable period one year ago.","During the first quarter of 2013, we purchased 3.6 million shares of our common stock for approximately $123 million, leaving approximately 2.4 million shares remaining under our current board authorization. As a result, we finished the first quarter with approximately $1 billion of debt and approximately $126 million of cash.","Looking at our cash flow performance. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $11 million as compared to $15 million in 2012. Operating cash flow was impacted by approximately $60 million due to voluntary pension contributions and prepaid royalties paid in the quarter. As a result of these payments, we do not expect to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plan through 2017 and no further royalty is required under this specific multi-year license agreement.","Moving to our 2013 guidance. As Rob mentioned, we reassessed our assumptions for the balance of the year, reflecting more modest revenue growth expectations. We will also be moderating our investment plans over the remainder of the year, as well as pursuing appropriate cost actions and accelerating previously planned productivity actions.","As a result of these factors, we now expect adjusted organic revenue for the full year to grow low single digits as compared to our original guidance of mid-single-digit growth, with full year adjusted earnings per share for 2013 to be in the range of $2 to $2.10. This guidance assumes interest expense of approximately $45 million and adjusted tax rate of 22% for the year and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 113 million shares.","For the second quarter of 2013, we expect organic revenue growth to be in the range of 0% to 2%, with adjusted earnings per share to be in a slightly wider range of $0.46 to $0.50. As I mentioned on the second quarter call last year, our second quarter results benefited from higher-margin licensing revenue, which we do not expect to reoccur in the second quarter of 2013.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we would like to open up the call for questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Paul Knight, CLSA.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Rob, if you recall, the gas chromatography, spectroscopy, I think that's what you would define as environmental analytical instruments. I guess, you are assuming that, like past cycles, that this is, what, down for another quarter or 2?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I think that's fair. A lot of it -- what we're seeing, Paul, actually is it's dependent to a large extent on geography. So actually, in the U.S. we saw growth -- slight growth in our analytical instruments in the first quarter. But as I mentioned, we saw fairly significant declines in Europe and Japan. China continues to do quite well. So actually, when we look at the growth profile of the company, it seems to be more impacted by geographic region than necessarily application or technique.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So meaning, across-the-board, on the analytical instruments side, Raman spectroscopy, GC, LC, et cetera?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I would say across the technologies. Again, when you're thinking about the decline in Japan and Europe, it was pretty much across almost the entire portfolio.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then on the Japan side, you mentioned down 25%. I guess, 17% of that 25% is from the yen, so kind of a mid upper single digit decline in the organic on the Japan side, is that the way we should think about it?","Robert F. Friel","I would say on the currency side, it was probably closer to 10%. And so on an organic basis, it's probably closer to 15%.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the in vivo side, I guess, this is the animal imaging technology. What's the ASP on those units? It's high, right, like 250?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, it's that -- in north of that.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Is the academic side on the in vivo that was soft?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, absolutely. And we expect it because the sequestration, that it was going to be softer. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this is a business that's been growing consistently midteens or better. And we expected some moderation of that, but we're, quite frankly, surprised by what happened in the first quarter. I think my own view is that I think there's a -- there was a lot of uncertainty as to how budgets would be handled and, of course, people were trying to preserve on to labor and maybe other types of expenses. So they really pushed off a lot, particularly the large capital expenditures. I will say we have started to see, in early part of April, some of that come back. And so as I mentioned, we're fairly optimistic that in this business returns to at least mid- to high single digits for the remainder of the year.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Yes. And then last, I guess, in Europe, can you say what industries? Was it, oil, gas, petroleum, refining? Was it that area?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I would say it's largely in the chemical and energy area. I mean, the 2 that I would spike out as where we saw a fairly significant cut back from instrument purchases.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken, ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Obviously, a pretty rough quarter. I think as you look at the results, I mean, the thing that stands out to me and sort of the decremental, which shows, obviously, as you said in some parts, you didn't see the sort of revenue miss come probably until late in the quarter, so you weren't able to adjust spending. I guess, when you sort of went back and you sort of sat down with heads of divisions or with the sales force, I mean, how do you feel -- as you sort of think about when you were projecting out for the next quarter, how did you get comfort that you kind of got a hold on, sort of where those businesses are and sort of the causes behind some of the -- I guess, pauses or pullbacks in demand? And then, how much of it going forward is just going to be now, you have to be a lot more proactive on the cost management, because obviously, you don't want to have 150% decremental margins for more than one quarter.","Robert F. Friel","Yes. So I would say, first of all, it's 15% of our revenue we're talking about here, so -- and again, in these 3 components, I think first of all, if you take in vivo imaging, it's a business that we have a good share in, so we think we understand almost product by product, or customer by customer what happened in the first quarter, and we can track those. And so again, we're starting to see some recovery. So I think we've got a pretty good handle on what's going on there. Of course, you still have the risk of uncertainty around funding. So we -- like I said, we think this recovers -- starts to recover in the second quarter and in the back half start to get more to what we've seen historically. I think in the case of Japan, as we look back in hindsight and understand it, I think a lot of it was this issue with the supplemental budget that was pushed. Our view is that, when you had a change in government, you created some uncertainty -- and keep in mind, one of the bigger pieces of our business in Japan is the radiometric detection, and a lot of that is government funded. And so we think that will sort itself out over the year. And so we do think there's some recovery there as well. I think the bigger question for us is Europe. And as I mentioned before, and as you recall, we -- in 2012, we're fairly bearish on Europe, and we're surprised with the upside in first half. And so, consequently, I think we're probably more optimistic in our projections than we probably needed to be. So as we think about the rest of the year, I think Japan will recover, I think in vitro will recover -- we're still fairly cautious on Europe, and that's how we tried to build our forecast, in trying to be a forecast that we think is accurate but also achievable.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And so when you think about managing the business the next quarter or 2. I mean, this has -- when you saw the roll up, you had to be pretty disappointed. I mean, this is a pretty terrible outcome from at least in earnings and op income standpoint. And so, I guess, when you're thinking about what you need to be ready to do or how you need to sort of be proactive to kind of manage through this tough environment, what are the sorts of things, internally, you guys have been discussing? And what sort of in the thought process of -- we, obviously, don't want to have another delta of this magnitude, versus sort of your forecast in the Street. And so what's sort have been the discussion point around that on your side?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I think the other thing to point out is that, as you mentioned, there -- it's not just a revenue drop, but I think probably more surprising than the revenue drop is the flow-through. So whether you look at, for example, year-over-year, we've got over 100% of flow-through where our operating profit decline is greater than our revenue decline, and when you look at relative to plan even it's fairly high. I think one of the things that was unfortunate, particularly, in the first half was that we went into this year, again, assuming we were going to see some growth. And so we were investing both from a R&D and growth perspective, as well as from a productivity program. And so again, with sort of a drop late in the quarter, we couldn't respond to that, and so, consequently, you're seeing increasing costs and no revenue to cover that. And so that's really what's caused the significant flow-through. So consequently, we are looking at a couple of things. We'll probably take some of those investments and defer those, given the revenue drop. We're also looking at pulling in some further productivity plans that we had on track for maybe later in the year in 2014. So I think as we've talked to you in the past is we think we've got a series of things that we can do that continue to drive efficiency through the organization. And then the third thing is we will take a hard look particularly in those areas, where we're not seeing the growth, and in fact, seeing accelerating declines, and we will take some cost actions there. So combination of cost actions in the areas where we're seeing declines, accelerating productivity plans that we would have done either later in the year an '14, and a deferral of some of the investment plans that we had in the second quarter and either later in the year or into 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel, Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So just to run through some math. If 85% of your revenue grew at close to mid-single digit levels, the other 15% would seemingly have had to have declined over 30%. Put differently, I believe we're talking about a base of about $75 million to $80 million in revenue, accounting for what was over a $20 million miss relative to expectations. And again, this was all late in the quarter. This seems pretty remarkable, again, given you said that you were on track until late in the quarter. So just to be clear, was the other 85% of your business truly in line with expectations?","Robert F. Friel","So let me just help you a little bit with the numbers. The 85% grew about $3 million, and the 15% declined about $25 million, so those are the numbers. So the answer to your question is, yes. If you look at the 85% -- now, if you look at those products and geographies, those businesses generally were not off more than $1 million individually. Now of course, you have some that are up a little bit, some that were down a little bit, and that's basically all it says [ph]. But the fundamental, the 85% of the revenue, as I said, it did as we projected. With regard to the -- late in the quarter, we look at our revenue through the quarter on a week-by-week basis and measure the percentage of revenue we've achieved to date and compare that sequentially to the percentage in Q4, and we compare it year-over-year to the percentage in Q1. And actually, if you look at week 12 and actually up through week 11, we were tracking within 50 basis points of where we needed to be. And there was really only in week -- partly, in week 12 that we started to see a decline that ended up resulting in the, call it, $25 million miss to the revenue. Now having said that, particularly, when you're talking about instruments, a big portion of our instruments occur in the last couple of weeks of the quarter.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. You indicated, I guess, just kind of digging in again more on the math that Asia-Pac declined low single digits? We talked a lot about Japan. I believe that only accounts for about 5% of sales, maybe that's higher this quarter, typically, given it's the end of the fiscal year. But you combined that with the fact that, I believe you said China growth was still strong. Were there other pronounced areas of weakness in the region?","Frank A. Wilson","The 2 other areas were Korea and Southeast Asia that were really declining significant double digits. So those, combined with Japan, unfortunately offset a relatively good performance in China.","Robert F. Friel","But again, going back to my comments before, there were other areas that were declined. But in these instances this was planned, either because of difficult year-over-year comparisons or various dynamics that were going on in those countries, either from sort of a mix.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro, Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the cost savings that you guys are pulling forward from 2014, can you maybe put a little more detail around what kinds of cost savings they are? And then maybe update us on some of the facility consolidation works you have in store this year, just wondering how much that will help in the back half of the year.","Robert F. Friel","All right. Well, let me take the first one, and maybe Andy can talk about the status of productivity. So I think as we sort of laid out a roadmap in the past, we talked about initially doing some things from a sourcing perspective, doing some things from a factory consolidation and doing some things from a back-office. I think the other opportunity is to do some things on how we go to market. So from a selling and marketing perspective, also as I mentioned in some instances, maybe going direct versus indirect. So those are the types of things that we had teed up largely for 2014. I think we'll look for opportunities to pull that in earlier into 2013.","Frank A. Wilson","And on the other question, we are actually relatively complete with one of our facility moves, which is really the transfer of manufacturing to Singapore and China, and we will start to see the benefit of that in the second quarter, and then the full benefit at the third and fourth. On the other facility consolidation in the U.S., where we're consolidating 3 facilities into 1, the actual activity will be completed in the second quarter, we'll start to see that benefit as well in the second half. And the spending, we -- within the first quarter, the spending was a little over $5 million for these projects -- for these growth and productivity projects. That will decline some, but the savings we're going to generate just from the manufacturing and restructuring on an annualized basis is about $15 million.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just, Rob, if I could press you a little bit on the longer-term picture for the business. If we look at the short-term disruption and put that aside for a minute, I think last quarter, you guys were relatively optimistic that the organic growth of the company could accelerate beyond the mid-single digit range in the out years, is that still a fair characterization?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I don't think there's anything that occurred this quarter that changes our mind with regard to that. And again, that's what I wanted to sort of reemphasize the point that -- well, obviously, we want to be responsive to what we're seeing from a revenue shortfall here in the first quarter. We want to make sure that we're balanced from the standpoint of trying to attack the cost in the areas where we think it's appropriate, but we want to continue to fuel this significant opportunities we see. Because we do think with the portfolio we have now and the end markets that we serve, that we do think there's an opportunity to sort of expand faster than mid-single digit.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then last -- one cleanup item on the financials, Andy. You guys repurchased, I think about 3.5 million shares this quarter, a little more than we had in our model, can you just talk about incremental uses of cash for the balance of the year, just given that you guys didn't update the share count guidance?","Frank A. Wilson","Yes. I think, as I said, our share count for this year will be about 113 million. We had indicated going to the year, we would take out, but it was essentially the option creep from 2011 and we did that. I think going forward, we have an acquisition pipeline primarily of bolt-ons that we're continuing to work through and I think there's some opportunity there. And we will continue to look at further share buybacks as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla, Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Rob or Andy, when you're talking about moderating investments, I wanted to see if you could give a little more detail there, because I think in the past, you've talked about investments in China and Molecular Diagnostics, the NIPT channel and some informatics. So what exactly are you going to be moderating on the investment side?","Robert F. Friel","I think what we'll try to do in here, some of those investments, to the extent that they were sort of people, some of them were sort of marketing and training and those types of things. And what we'll probably do is sort of delay some of those, rather than say being in the second quarter, and maybe we'll wait and look to see how this revenue grows. If we get more comfortable that the third quarter will be at least as we project or maybe better, we'll start to feather those out a little later in the year, or if we have to hold them off to '14. So I would say it's generally in the areas you mentioned there and we'll just sort of moderate that as we see the revenue.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And the second question is on Medical Imaging. I know the performance was fine in the quarter, but can you just talk to what's happening on flat panel pricing and the competitive dynamics? Anything that we should be aware of that could take place later in the year.","Robert F. Friel","I don't see anything happening on the competitive dynamics that should have any impact on our Medical Imaging business. I think we still feel very good about our share. I think with regard to pricing, and this is something we talked about in the past, this is a business that every year generally has pricing decreases that are, in the last cases, contractual with our customers. Because as volume increases, generally, it's -- think about fab economics, the incremental costs to produce that additional panel is fairly low, and so some of that is shared with the customers. So generally, in any given year, we're probably looking to 100 basis points or so margin contraction, and 2013 is similar.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg, Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Rob, I guess one question with -- I know you said it's hard to kind of de-convolute [ph] what's going on with Caliper, but just given since that was a big investment, what did Caliper grow? I know that in vivo was down, it sounded like you said sample prep was still up, so maybe just some color there?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I would say, again, it's getting harder and harder to do, but I would say, given the magnitude of the drop in in vivo, Caliper would've been negative in the quarter. I would say it was probably something in the high single digit decline. But as we think about those products and those applications, we still feel very good about it. As I said, I do believe the in vivo imaging has probably mid-teen opportunities as we sort of go out later in the year and into '14. We continue to feel very good about the microfluidics business and think that will see very strong growth in the back half of the year. And I mentioned the fact that sample prep around NGS saw good growth in the quarter, and I think that will continue to do well. I mean, one of the challenges is, as we talked about some of the cannibalization, so we saw very strong growth in our JANUS liquid handling. And some of that was cannibalization of some of the Caliper liquid handling business.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's helpful. And then obviously we've been hearing a few company's reports, and it's kind of tough to piece together exactly what's going on and obviously, not everybody sells the exact same product in the exact same market. But I don't know, I guess as you kind of see the business and you think about the M&A opportunities that Andy was referring to, does anything that you're seeing right now, or kind of as you consummated that, does it change how you're thinking about which businesses you want to invest more in, versus ones that you want to invest less in?","Robert F. Friel","I don't think so. I think we still feel good about the growth prospects for all the business. And like I said, I don't -- well, obviously, from a cost and investment perspective, we want to sort of get after this. I don't think we want to sort of overreact from a sort of one quarter phenomena here. And again, I think it's fairly geographically focused in Japan and Europe, and of course, the sequestration impact in the U.S. So I think we'll continue to look across the portfolio. There are areas of the portfolio that we feel better about from the macro trend. So -- and it's clearly, some of the areas of Diagnostics continue to be attractive. And again, we saw a good growth in Q1. Informatics, I think, is an area that again put up very strong numbers in the first quarter, and so I would like to continue to build our capability there. I think that is something that somewhat differentiates us relative to some of the other peers. And of course, China is an area that with 20% growth, is an area that will continue to -- will try and build out our capability there.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","I guess one thing I was kind of contemplating, and that was helpful is, do you see -- given someone like Thermo who's really increasing their scale and some of the other players that have really increased scale, I mean do you see any of the things going on in some of these businesses as where it's more difficult for you to compete and there are certain areas that you should either get out of, divest or deemphasize, or you don't see this as a share issue, it\u2019s more of a mix issue?","Robert F. Friel","I would say, clearly, the competitive landscape is changing. But I think we still feel good about our position in the areas where we're focused. And again, our strategy has been a little different in that we're not really trying to sort of be sort of all things to all people. What we're trying to be is very focused in areas where we think our technology and our intellectual property can be differentiated, and hopefully we can target those in areas that have a little higher growth. So I think we continually are assessing our portfolio. And if there are some product lines on the margin, we think there should be somebody else that might be a better owner, we'll continue to look at that. But I would say, for the most part, we feel good about our positions, we feel good about our technologies, and we think we can continue to be fairly differentiated in our offerings.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias, UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Rob, over the last couple of quarters, you've kind of expressed a level of comfort with the potential impact from NIH exposure. So I guess, is it just the magnitude of the decline that caught you by surprise, or given that it's not always easy to pinpoint where resources are coming from. You found that maybe federal funding is a bit more meaningful than you thought?","Robert F. Friel","I think first of all, the magnitude of the impact, I think, did catch us by surprise. I think we were saying, it could be 10% to 20%. I think clearly, it was more than that. And my comment previous was, I think, a part of the issue has been just the uncertainty. I think, a lot of the labs are still trying to figure out how it's going to work, will they reach back and cut some grants that have been issued previously? And so I think the magnitude of it was a little higher. I think the other thing is, well, I think it's difficult to tie it directly to sequestration. I think there has clearly been a ripple effect with general austerity. Because again, I'm not sure our exposure is any different than what we thought, and we, I think, sort of calibrated that around mid-single digits. But we were surprised to see the global aspects of it. So again, the in vivo business has probably 50% of its business outside the U.S., but we saw researchers in Brazil and researchers in Asia and researchers in Europe pulling back as well. So I think the general sort of economic austerity, we were surprised by.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. Okay. That's good color. And then maybe a strategic one, on the RAD business, do you still feel like that's something that makes sense in the portfolio? And if so, what's sort of the pitch for those assets at this point?","Robert F. Friel","Well, the issue this quarter was really more of the RAD detection, so it's a little different than the issues that we've seen historically. The RAD detection business, it's grown modestly, I would say over the last couple of years. It had a pop because of the tsunami in Japan. But I think what you're probably referring to more is the RAD radiochemical business, which again saw probably a mid- to high-digit decline from a year-over-year perspective. Again, that was something planned, that's something we've seen for quite some time here. And I think as we think about it, it does give us some ability to discuss with certain labs. And we think about disposing of it, we're not sure that we would get a lot of value. Our view is that people will probably just discount the cash annuity. And so as we think about the opportunity to bundle it with some things that we do, we think it still probably makes sense for the stay in the portfolio, but we don't think it's probably ever going to be a significant grower.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan, Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Regarding the in vivo business, what's implied in the remainder of your '13 guidance for in vivo growth? And could you share with us, Rob, the details. Like, what gives you confidence in that business recovering towards double digits, which I think you mentioned earlier in the call?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I would say for the rest of the year, it's probably high single, low double, is what we're assuming. And I would say, if you look at second quarter, it's sort of 5 to 8 and then it sort it picks up as you go through the quarter. And I think what gives us the confidence is there is still a fairly significant pipeline and there's a fairly significant demand from researchers to use that product. It's very instrumental in a lot of cancer research. And so in just the discussion with researchers and looking at the pipeline, we think once we get through some of these funding uncertainties, we think the demand will continue. And again, because we have pretty good insight into the customers and because we have pretty good share here, we're fairly convinced that this is not a share issue, and we're not losing share.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right, right. So I think earlier in the call, you had mentioned the prepared remarks. It looks like a lot of those orders use felt you actually would recapture, they weren't lost. So is that -- what can you share with us about the commentary there, maybe early action in April thus far, is there any color towards that confidence?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I would say we are seeing an early -- some of the funding free up a little bit. So I think that gives us a little bit more confidence. But clearly, this is an area we are going to watch very closely. We were surprised in Q1, and so we feel like this will recover, but it's something we're going to have to keep a close eye on. But early indication is in April, it seems to imply that there is some funding freeing up and we're starting to recover some of these that got pushed.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then, Andy, how did this quarter's results impact your long-term margin targets?","Frank A. Wilson","Well, we've had an 18% target out there for operating margins in 2014 for some time, and I think this obviously makes it more difficult. I think we feel, if we can deliver the second half forecast that we have now, it's still achievable, it's going to make it a lot more difficult to do. But as Rob mentioned, there's some things we're pulling in on a cost savings perspective. And I think some of the initiatives that are actually complete and the cost are rolling off will start to generate some fairly significant savings in 2014. So we're still sticking with that at this point.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, Andy, one more. After a shortfall of this magnitude, I think we'll hope that there's a significant level of cushion in terms of the guidance that you're providing, so that we don't see a shortfall again. Maybe can you just discuss, I think it was an earlier question was asked, maybe a similar question, but can you discuss, Rob, any kind of planning in terms of what you put into this guidance and kind of what level of conservatism if it there?","Frank A. Wilson","Sure. Well, this is the first quarter we've missed guidance in over 10 years, and we do not want to miss guidance again. So we took a very detailed bottoms-up approach to the forecast, and we also then put a very conservative overlay on that forecast. So our confidence level in achieving this forecast is, I would say, high.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Rob, earlier, you kind of laid out some timelines just to how the quarter tracked. Can you just talk as to why you didn't pre-announce given you had the data a week ago?","Robert F. Friel","Tycho, I would say, our practice has been to announce on schedule and not to release early, whether we are positive or negative. Because we don't think it makes sense to go out with incomplete data. Our view is it's better to provide a complete analysis and we wanted to make sure that we -- when we did go out, that we had a complete understanding of what happened, how it affects the business and what we're going to do about it. And to sort of depart from that rigor, would just lead to speculation and probably increase volatility. So we wanted to make sure that we had it buttoned up and said, hey, we fully understand what happened. This is what we think the implications are for the rest of the year, and this is what we think we can do about it. And my own view is to go out with incomplete data, again, just would lead to speculation and further confusion.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then going back to a prior question on Medical Imaging, I know you got a question about flat panel pricing, but just the CapEx datapoints haven't been great around hospital spending. Can you just talk us to what gives you conviction that, that business still holds up for the next couple of quarters?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I would say, for our guidance, we have generally guided Medical Imaging to relatively modest growth in 2013. And part of that was because we saw a very strong growth in 2012. So our expectations for Medical Imaging, even in the beginning of the year, were relatively modest, I'll call it sort of flat to low single digits and we still think we can deliver that. We did a little bit better than that in Q1, but we have fairly modest expectations for the Medical Imaging business throughout the remainder of the year.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right. And then just lastly, on the environmental business, I don't know that the commentary from your competitors has been as negative as you guys, particularly on Japan. Can you just convince us that that's not a share issue, it's more of a mix issue?","Robert F. Friel","Well, again, I sort of mentioned a little bit before. A significant piece of our Japanese business is radiometric detection. It was down, actually close to 40% year-over-year, and I don't know that any of our competitors do radiometric detection in Japan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin, Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Tycho sort of got to some of the cleanup questions I wanted to ask, but let me just ask some other ones that I need. Can you just -- how big is, sort of like, the in vivo imaging business in terms of a dollar amount?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. It's about 4% or 5% of the revenue, call it $80 million business.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I'm going to ask the competitive question another way on this. I mean in Japan, have SHIMADZU and Hitachi, given that the yen has gotten weaker. Have you seen -- was that part of the issue, that people were buying more local suppliers for some of the environmental equipment there?","Robert F. Friel","I think it's -- at this point, it's a little difficult for us to go back and sort of parse out whether our competitors are getting share or not. I mean, I think that's going to take us a little bit time to understand what's going on, and I just sort of mentioned, sort of understanding what are the other competitors. We know because we have a big presence in radiometric detection and that was a big driver to the decline. If you pull that out, actually our analytical instrument business in Japan was down single digits.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, okay. That's actually the data point I wanted. So I guess, and can you just sort of talk about geographies in Europe? I mean, your more pronounced weakness in Germany, that came in late in the quarter, was it more pronounced?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. Actually, when we looked out and sort of mentioned the prepared remarks, it was pretty pervasive. I mean, it wasn't, in fact, actually there was a slight higher downturn -- decrease in sort of the northern and central parts of Europe as compared to Southern Europe. But it was across the board. And again, and what I'm talking, the decline, it was really Western Europe. Actually, Eastern Europe was fine, Eastern Europe grew for us. But when you look across Western Europe, and again, the area I'm spiking out as sort of the significant decline was in analytical instruments, but it was, whether it was north, central, south, they were all down fairly significantly.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And I guess just one final question on -- is there any update you can share on sort of the Verinata transaction, I mean how has that gone so far? What are you seeing? Can you give us any sort of color on that?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I mean, I think Andy mentioned is we're very pleased with -- we launched it February 1, and so we've got a little bit of history here. So we're seeing a very nice uptick running in through our channel. But as I think we mentioned, the key here is you've got to get paid. And so we're taking a very conservative approach to revenue forecasting. But we still feel very good about it.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And along those lines, are you running into -- are there one competitor you're running more into those markets when your people are going out, are you running more into Sequenom or into Ariosa. I'm just curious about who are your people sort of interacting with in the field.","Robert F. Friel","No. I would say, not really. And I think it's continued to validate our hypothesis, as because we had great relationships with the physicians, particularly in this area because of our NTD business, that we're getting great traction and uptick.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson, Securities U.S.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Rob, of the 3 issues that happened, which ones are starting to turn around in the first few weeks of Q2, and how are you sure that you didn't lose share and what gives you the confidence it isn't going to bleed into 3Q?","Robert F. Friel","So I would say the area that we're seeing the most significant change was probably in the in vivo area, where we are starting to see some people actually purchase instruments. And as you can imagine, Q4 was down very significantly. So I would say that here. Also in the case of Japan, we will see some recovery there for no other reason than we have much easier comps. I mean part of what was driving again -- and we knew we were going to be down because of the tsunami sort of blip we had in late '11 and early '12, so we will see some recovery in Japan. I mean Europe, it's a little early to tell, because going back to my earlier comments, a lot of the instrument purchases are more back-end loaded in the quarter. So I would say we're not seeing a significant uptick in Europe, but we will probably see some recovery in Japan for no other reason than comps, and we are seeing some improvements in in vivo.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And what stops it bleeding into 3Q, let's say, Europe?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I think Europe is -- and I think as we have put together the forecast, we have been probably most cautious about Europe. And so I think Japan we feel better about, again, part of that is just comparison purposes. I think in vivo, again, because of our pipeline, but I think we are cautious in Europe. So while we think Europe gets a little bit better, we are forecasting for analytical instruments in Europe still fairly modest demand.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And then I mean, is there anything wrong with the reporting systems? And why didn't you see it earlier?","Robert F. Friel","No, I don't think so. As I said, I mean this is something that we track on a weekly basis up until the last 2 weeks of the quarter and then we track it on a daily basis. And we were tracking pretty well. And when you look at both Q4 as a percentage of our revenue during the various weeks and Q1. I think one of the things though as we go back and analyze this in more detail now, we believe what may have been happening is, there were some declines that were inherent in the weekly numbers that were being masked by revenue that was not necessarily beating plan but was just coming in early in the quarter. So while we were tracking, again, on a percentage, we were within 50 basis points of our percentage revenue on -- in week 9, 10, 11, and going into 12. But we think that what was happening was that some of the revenue for the quarter was pulled earlier in some of these areas other than the 3 I mentioned.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And in any of those 3 areas you think you've lost share?","Robert F. Friel","As I said, we don't believe so in in vivo, and we've got pretty good visibility into that. We don't believe we're losing share in radiometric detection because, quite frankly, there's not a lot of people that do that. I think there is a question with regard to Europe, and I just don't know that we have enough data to have a good appreciation for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier, Maxim Group.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","You cited OneSource as one sort of area of strength in the quarter and you've been seeing that growth over the last several quarters. There are numerous players in the lab services market, and I was just sort of wondering how are you sort of differentiating your business? A lot of them are also talking about growth in the lab services business and wondering why customers are choosing OneSource over some of the other offerings out there.","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I would say for me, it's probably 2 or 3 differentiators. One is we've been doing it for a long time, we've got a great track record and we've got a lot of experience in doing this, and we've done it with a lot of customers. I would say the second thing is, because of some of the acquisitions we made in the informatics area, call it, 18, 24 months ago. We are now able to bundle some very unique offerings, where we can provide our customers not only opportunities to manage the service aspect of what's going on in their labs, but we're giving them visibility through the use of our informatics capabilities.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And you talked about the weakness of your instruments in the environmental market, and some of your competitors have talked about strengths of their food safety businesses, specifically. I was wondering if you could provide some color around your food safety business and what you're seeing there.","Robert F. Friel","Yes. Actually, food safety was up for us, probably sort of high single digits in the quarter. So we continue to see good growth in the food area. And again, the majority of the weakness that we saw was on the industrial analytics. So the environmental piece, air and water was fine, the food area was fine. We mentioned the fact that the service was fine. It was fairly contained within Europe and Japan, and largely focused in the industrial end markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Zarak Khurshid, Wedbush.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","So how are things developing in China around the blood screening opportunity, government tenders and so forth?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. So I would say, we continue to be very pleased with the integration, first of all. I think that's going well into our -- in our business there. And we continue to feel good about our win rate there. In the Q1, we continued to win tenders there, and so we think we're getting more than our fair share of the business. So we continue to be excited about that business and think come '14, '15, that's going to be to a big contributor to our growth.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Interesting. And then, just curious on the analytical instrument business as it pertains to China, how significant is that, and could your issues in Europe sort of bleed into China, which has issues of its own and maybe isn't immune to some of these kind of credit issues?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. Our analytical instrument business is, call it 60%, 65% of our China business. And as we said, we continued to see very strong growth in China in the first quarter. And the growth was sort of broad-based across all our businesses. All of our businesses in China grew mid-teens or better, including the environmental business.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","That's encouraging. And then maybe I missed it but what was the overall currency impact and if you could comment on the CapEx spend for the remainder of the year, that would be great.","Frank A. Wilson","On the FX side, we did have about a $6 million FX headwind on the revenue side. We did have a flow-through of that. Because of the change in the yen, we don't have a very large cost base or manufacturing presence in Japan, so that flowed through, so we had about a $0.02 hit on the FX side year-over-year. I think the CapEx piece, we're usually about 2% of revenues. That's pretty much on track at least thus far in the first quarter, and I think we may end up being a bit below that in the second half at this stage having reviewed the projects in the pipeline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby, Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Two questions for you. First on the earnings guidance. I was just wondering with the new guidance, what you're assuming as it relates to the impacts from currency as a headwind? And then also secondly on that, given the reduction here, are you still having incentive comp in the guidance or was that halted as well?","Robert F. Friel","Andy, why don't you do number one, I'll do number 2.","Frank A. Wilson","Right. Within the full year plan, year-over-year, our currency impact is going to be about $10 million, that's in the forecast.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Okay, great.","Robert F. Friel","Revenue perspective. Yes. So from an incentive comp standpoint, obviously our incentive comp is down significantly. But keep in mind, some of the businesses continue to do well. And in fact, some of our businesses actually did a little bit better than their forecast, so obviously, the leaders in those businesses will continue to expect and will probably continue to pay incentive comp in those businesses. Obviously, the businesses that have not done as well, the incentive comp will be down significantly.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then my second question was just -- or I guess it will be my third, is on your second quarter guidance and saying that you expect organic growth to be, I think, you said relatively similar to what you saw here in the first quarter. I was just wondering how to think through that with the in vivo business maybe getting bottoming or getting a little bit better, and the Japan business maybe not being as bad as it was in the first quarter.","Frank A. Wilson","Steve, what I had said was the majority of the business would be similar to the first quarter, but we are seeing an uptick. And I think our guidance calls for flat to low single digit in the second quarter, so that is an uptick from the negative one in the first quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Sir, you have no questions at this time. [Operator Instructions]","Robert F. Friel","Great. Well, thanks, everyone, appreciate your questions. So let me just close by saying that despite the performance this quarter by a limited portion of our portfolio, I see a lot to be optimistic about for PerkinElmer for the remainder of 2013, as well as the years to come. I remain confident that we are extremely well positioned to drive our mission of improving human and environmental health through the development of cutting-edge solutions, serving attractive markets. Our ability to weather more difficult economic times is well proven, and I believe we can continue to deliver strong shareholder returns and accelerate our growth through the quality of our offerings, as well as our operating discipline and the dedication of our 7,500 terrific employees.","Thank you, again, for your continued interest in PerkinElmer, and have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Tommy Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Tommy Thomas","Thanks, Clinton. Good afternoon, and welcome to PerkinElmer's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive of -- and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","If you have not received a copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com. Please note that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website until August 15, 2013.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future, even if our estimates change.

Rob?","Robert F. Friel","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report PerkinElmer delivered solid performance in the second quarter. Adjusted and organic revenues each increased 3%, with Human Health up 2% and Environmental Health up 3%. As a result of the strong top line performance, adjusted earnings per share was $0.51, $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance.","Andy will discuss our second quarter results in more detail. But before he does, I would like to highlight a few specific areas.","First of all, the 3 parts of our business that resulted in lower revenue last quarter all showed significant improvement. In fact, the improvements in these 3 businesses accounted for approximately 3\/4 of the 400 basis points sequential improvement in this quarter's organic growth rate.","Other areas of strong growth included our newborn and infectious disease screening businesses, which benefited from further penetration into emerging markets. Our informatics business continued to grow double digits, including significant momentum with Spotfire. And OneSource experienced high-single-digit growth as our differentiated capabilities continue to enable share expansion.","Also of note, our radiochemical business was flat in the second quarter, reversing a long period of consecutive revenue declines. Partially offsetting this growth was a mid-single-digit decline in Medical Imaging in the quarter. While we continue to believe revenue in this business will be flat in 2013, relative to the very strong growth we experienced last year, Medical Imaging will experience significant volatility quarter-to-quarter during this year due to anticipated customer ordering patterns.","During the second quarter, we completed several major productivity initiatives and announced additional actions to further improve our cost structure and enable our growth investments. Specifically, we completed product line transfers to China and Singapore to rationalize our global footprint, and we made headway in consolidating Western European back-office capabilities in Krak\u00f3w, Poland.","We also completed the consolidation of 3 North American facilities, and efforts are underway to consolidate 2 additional legacy Caliper sites, further simplifying our operational footprint and improving our R&D efficiency.","In addition to focusing on our cost structure, we achieved a number of significant commercial wins and continued to invest in high-growth areas, where we can deliver competitive differentiation and disruptive innovation. For example, we announced the launch of our breakthrough AxION iQT, which combines identification and quantification capabilities in a single mass spec instrument. We successfully executed the first customer deployments of the new version of our flagship E-Notebook platform and launched our first ChemDraw scientific applications for iPads.","On the diagnostic side, we won additional newborn screening programs in Saudi Arabia and South Africa and continued to expand our newborn and prenatal testing menus, adding additional assays. In China, we launched 2 new SFDA-approved diagnostic analyzers for infectious disease testing, 1 targeted at fully automated larger throughput hospital labs and 1 focused on smaller clinical labs.","In the environmental area, we introduced a new photodiode array with an innovative flow cell for liquid chromatography, which will expand our capabilities in environmental and research labs.","Turning to our outlook, we feel good about our ability to deliver organic growth and improved profitability in the back half of the year, as we build momentum heading into 2014. The macro environment is tracking as we expected, continuing to be weak with recovery in some pockets. Europe still faces headwinds with economic and political pressures, and the impact from sequestration in U.S. continues to dampen capital spending.","In Japan, we expect to see improved growth in the region as funds from the supplemental budget are released. And in China, we expect the government to continue to moderate growth slightly, disproportionately impacting the larger cities in the East with sustained robust growth in the West. This month, we are moving into a larger facility in Beijing. And later this year, opening an office in \u00dcr\u00fcmqi to improve our access to the growing areas in the far west of China.","Despite indications that overall growth may be slowing in China, their increasing need for capabilities to improve both human health and environmental health presents us with excellent opportunities, potentially offsetting any moderation.","While we remain confident in our long-term strategy to deliver organic revenue growth in the mid-single digits, in light of the global economic climate, we think it's prudent to assume low-single-digit organic growth rates for the remainder of the year. While Andy will discuss our guidance in more detail, we are forecasting a return to adjusted margin expansion and solid adjusted EPS growth in the back half of the year. More importantly, we believe that we can achieve this forecast while continuing to invest appropriately in our most exciting opportunities to drive profitable growth.","I would now like to turn the call over to Andy.","Frank A. Wilson","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with prior quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our second quarter results and details around our revised 2013 guidance. Then we'll open up the call for your questions.","As Rob mentioned earlier, we were encouraged by our performance in the second quarter, as both adjusted revenue and organic revenue increased by 3%. Adjusted revenue for the quarter was $547 million, as compared to $532 million in the second quarter of 2012. We experienced organic revenue growth across both segments of our business, with Environmental Health and Human Health growing 3% and 2%, respectively, versus the same period last year.","Looking at our geographical results. Organic revenue increased low-double digits in Asia, increased low-single digits in Europe and declined low-single digits in the Americas. In China, organic revenues increased high teens with the BRIC countries, as a whole, increasing mid-teens.","As a reminder, emerging market comparisons will continue to be difficult through the third quarter of 2013, which was the high watermark of last year.","Looking at organic revenue by product category. Recurring revenue, which includes reagents, consumables and service, grew mid-single digits in the quarter, primarily the result of continuing strength in our OneSource Laboratory Services and our informatics offerings.","Instruments and components reported flat organic revenue growth in the quarter, but were up sequentially as compared to the first quarter of this year. As Rob indicated earlier, each of these -- each of the 3 areas negatively impacting our first quarter performance experienced significant sequential improvement. First, organic revenues in our In Vivo business grew organically by more than 20%, despite continuing sequestration pressures in the U S. While a portion of the second quarter growth is attributable to the catch-up of first quarter delays, order demand remained strong.","Second, organic revenue for our environmental instrument business in Western Europe was essentially flat in the quarter as compared to our mid-teens decline in the first quarter. We were encouraged by the broad sequential strength experienced across the portfolio.","And finally, our Japanese business also improved sequentially as organic revenue declined low-single digits as compared to our mid-teens decline in the first quarter of this year. We expect the ongoing deployment of government stimulus, which began in the second quarter, will continue to help enable our ability to deliver positive organic growth in Japan for the back half of the year.","From an end market perspective, our Human Health segment represented approximately 55% of reported revenue in the quarter. We serve 2 end markets in Human Health: diagnostics, which represented 27% of reported revenue; and research, which represented 28% of reported revenue.","Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business increased low-single digits during the second quarter, primarily due to tougher comparisons in our Medical Imaging business, which declined mid-single digits. We continued to see good results from both our screening business and our infectious disease and blood screening diagnostic offerings, targeting emerging markets.","Our screening business grew mid-single digit in the quarter and continues to benefit from the stabilization of U.S. birthrates and the expansion of our prenatal and newborn screening solutions in key regions outside the U.S. We are also pleased with our ongoing newborn sales uptick in Asia, which saw organic growth in the high teens in the second quarter of 2013.","As mentioned earlier, our Medical Imaging business experienced a mid-single-digit decline in organic revenue during the second quarter, a result of very difficult double-digit comparisons in the prior year. You may recall, this business will be facing strong comparisons in every quarter of 2013.","Our Research business delivered low-single-digit organic revenue growth in the second quarter versus the comparable period in 2012. As I mentioned earlier, we saw a strong recovery in our In Vivo imaging business, as well a sequential improvement in our radiometric detection business. European and Asian research markets both experienced solid organic revenue growth.","Moving to Environmental Health, which represented 45% of reported revenue in the second quarter. We serve 3 end markets: laboratory services, which represented 19% of reported revenue; environmental and safety, which represented 17% of reported revenue; and industrial, which represented 9% of reported revenue.","During the quarter, we experienced high-single-digit organic growth in the Laboratory Services business, mid-single-digit organic growth in our industrial business and low-single-digit organic revenue declines in our environmental and safety business. While we are pleased with the second quarter performance in our industrial business, we expect industrial end market demand to remain soft for the second half of the year.","We experienced strong acceptance of our laboratory service offering in the quarter, as we help our lab customers better manage their critical laboratory assets and related data needs. Our OneSource offering is a key differentiator for us, as evidenced by the win of a new major pharmaceutical company, while also expanding our presence in other key pharma and health care customers during the current quarter.","Turning to our margin performance in the period. Adjusted operating margins in the second quarter were 15.6% as compared to 16.9% in the comparable period a year ago.","As we mentioned earlier in the year, the first half of 2013 was going to be a period of investment, and this quarter's results were in line with our expectations. As we move into the second half of this year, we expect adjusted operating margins to show improvement versus the comparable period in 2012.","By segment, adjusted operating margins in our Human Health segment were 21% and operating margins in our Environmental Health segment were 13%, representing a decline of approximately 110 basis points and 160 basis points, respectively, as compared to the second quarter of 2012. These declines were primarily the result of increased R&D spending, additional investments in our informatics business, pricing pressures, primarily in the Environmental Health segment, as well as difficult year-over-year comparisons due to 2012 licensing revenue that did not reoccur in the second quarter of 2013.","GAAP operating income from continuing operations was $39.7 million in the second quarter of 2013 versus $49.8 million in the same period a year ago. GAAP earnings per share for continuing operations in the second quarter of 2013 were $0.24 compared to $0.29 in the second quarter of last year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.51 in the second quarter of 2013, $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range. On a non-GAAP basis, our adjusted tax rate was approximately 21%.","Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the second quarter with approximately $1 billion of debt and approximately $112 million of cash. We exited the quarter with a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.6x and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3x.","","Looking at our cash flow performance, year-to-date adjusted operating cash flow from continuing operations was $99 million, as compared to $115 million in 2012. Higher working capital requirements, primarily accounts receivable, negatively impacted our performance in the second quarter, as extended terms and the timing of revenue contributed.","I also want to note that as planned, the pension contributions made in the first quarter of 2013 will be funded by the recently announced sale-leaseback of one of our facilities in the Boston area. And therefore, the pension funding will be neutral to our full-year cash balances.","To summarize, our performance in the second quarter of 2013 came in ahead of expectations and we remain focused on achieving our longer-term organic growth and adjusted operating margin expansion targets.","I'd now like to discuss our 2013 guidance in a bit more detail and highlight a few items impacting our second half outlook. Specifically, in Q4, we will face currency headwinds of approximately $5 million due to the movement of the yen, which will negatively impact our reported revenue. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, there is a fourth quarter revenue weighting in our Medical Imaging business due to the calendarization of end customer demand.","Medical Imaging reported revenues are expected to be down high teens in the third quarter, but grow low-double digits in the fourth quarter. This impact represents approximately $6 million shifting between quarters, and should offset the fourth quarter currency headwind I just mentioned.","As a result, we expect adjusted revenues for the third quarter 2013 to be in the range of $515 million to $525 million with organic revenue growth to be in the range of flat to 2%. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.48.","Regarding adjusted operating margins, despite approximately 40 basis points of FX headwinds in the third and fourth quarter, we expect second half adjusted operating margins to improve approximately 50 to 75 basis points, as compared to the second half of last year, but more heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter, primarily due to the aforementioned timing of second half Medical Imaging revenues. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 22% for the second half of 2013, and our weighted average diluted share count for the year is assumed to be approximately 113 million shares. Finally, we expect interest and other expense to be approximately $12.5 million in both the third and fourth quarters.","So based on these assumptions, we expect our full year organic growth to be low-single digits, and we are narrowing our full year earnings per share guidance, raising the bottom end of our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share for 2013, from a range of $2 to $2.10 to a new range of $2.03 to $2.10.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we'd like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just want to talk a little bit about margins. I'm wondering if you could put some more color behind in the margins this quarter, specifically with environmental, what was going on there. Was there something in the way of FX versus sort of other sort of transient factors? And maybe was there something maybe more structural? Just kind of -- if you can kind of separate those 2, that will be helpful.","Robert F. Friel","Well, just let me start off with sort of the margins overall and then Andy can drill into the specific environmental. But the way I would think about our margins is, it was probably 3 things that drove the reduction year-over-year. One is we talked about investments, and those are both productivity and related to growth, and that's probably about 1\/3 of it. I think we did see -- continued to see some pricing and mix pressures, and obviously, that was planned. Probably about 1\/3 of that was probably mostly related to the mix and those types of things. And then...","Frank A. Wilson","Yes, and then the third thing, we had investments, we had the mix and -- yes...","Robert F. Friel","License -- yes, the year-over-year. There was some licensing year-over-year. So about a third on the licensing, about 1\/3 on pricing mix and about 1\/3 on investments.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then just if you could remind us, in back half of the year, what's embedded in your guidance in terms of the geographic outlook in the U.S., Europe and sort of Rest of World? Just kind of -- given the volatility in the macro picture, what you guys are assuming would be helpful.","Robert F. Friel","So I think we're assuming pretty similar geographic growth than what we've experienced in the first half of the year. I would say the only difference is maybe a little moderation in China. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we think there's going to be a little moderation, probably more impact on the eastern side as compared to the western. So we're anticipating a little bit of moderation there. I would say Europe continues to be sort of flat in our view and modest growth in the U. S. So again, in the back half we're assuming similar geographic growth patterns.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan of Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My first question is on the 3 businesses that were the culprits of the first quarter shortfall. I know you gave some color about, not only the growth this quarter, but the expectation. Maybe could you give a little more color about how we should think about those businesses progressing kind of in the back of the year, implicit in your guidance?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. So first of all, in In Vivo, as we mentioned, we saw good recovery in the second quarter. We think a lot of that was just a make up for the first quarter, although I think the team did a terrific job because we continued to see some pressure in the U.S. from sequestration. So the majority of the growth occurred actually in Europe and Asia. But as Andy said, we feel good about the pipeline there. I would say our expectations for In Vivo is probably mid-single-digit growth for the rest of the -- or the back half of the year. I think in the case of Japan, we saw that recover from mid-teens to low single. We think with some of the release of the supplemental budget in Japan, we could probably return that to low- to mid-single growth in the back half. And we're continuing to be fairly conservative in Europe. Although we did see positive growth in Europe in the second quarter, we do have more difficult comparisons going into the third, and so I think we're assuming Europe will be flat to down slightly.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Andy, terms of the guidance, Q3, Q4, just the way you chase that. I mean, is it fair to assume -- I know your third quarter comp from last year certainly a lot more difficult. I know you discussed some other factors in terms of the shift between Q3 and Q4. Maybe can you just go through that a little more again like, is it really just a tougher comp for the kind of the 0% to 2% in Q3 or just maybe go through the factors again, how we should think about the back half of the year progression?","Frank A. Wilson","Well, I think Q3 is a more difficult comp than Q4. We also talked about the Med Imaging shift on the top line. So I think if you're looking at flat- to low-single digit, you're going to see a little bit of sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. And I think if you look at, from a margin expansion, the rollout of our initiatives and some of the restructuring that we have just completed, you will see margin expansion in both periods, but more weighted towards the fourth quarter.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And maybe one more quick one. Rob, is your expectation in '14 with some of the new product initiatives that you have ongoing, I know there's no '14 guidance but you previously were talking about an accelerating growth rate in '14. I mean, any high-level color about how we should be thinking about the impact of these new products?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I think we continue to feel good about our ability to improve growth going into '14. And one of the things we wanted to do in Q2 when we took the restructuring actions, was not only to respond to what we saw was more difficult sort of macroeconomic conditions, but more importantly, we wanted to create the flexibility to continue to invest in growth. So I think I feel good about the fact that we -- I think we've given ourselves the ability to continue to fund the growth initiatives. So again, a lot of it will be dependent on macroeconomic conditions. But I do feel good about our ability to get the new products out into the marketplace and hopefully, to achieve increasing organic revenue growth as we get into '14.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of ISI.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","This is Vijay in for Ross. First one, maybe on Japan. I know that you mentioned, in the south [ph], the stimulus there could benefit in the back half. And how should we think of -- in terms of growth or dollar-wise, what the contribution could be?","Robert F. Friel","So for the second quarter, as I mentioned, we were down low-single. I think as we think about the back half, we could see Japan growing sort of low- to mid-single. So I would say, going from down sort of 3% to probably up in the 4% to 5% in the back half. As you probably know, Japan is about 5% of our revenue. So it gives you a sense of what impact that might have on the back half.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Rob, and just on U.S., could you mention segment-wise sort of pockets of strength and weakness that you're seeing?","Robert F. Friel","So I would say, if we look at the U.S., first of all, academic continues to be a headwind. And so I think while the uncertainty around sequestration is not what it was in the first quarter, I still -- we continue to see funds moving relatively slowly from a capital acquisition perspective. So I would say academic continues to be relatively slow. We mentioned the fact that service was strong, so we continue to see good growth in the service end markets. Diagnostic, particularly in our newborn screening, continues to grow in the U.S. And we're continuing to see positive birth trends. We continue to see birth trending up in the United States, close to 3%. I would say in the environmental area though, we were down there in the U.S. And I think that's more of a sort of an economic environment, where I still think there's some headwinds from a macroeconomic perspective. So Environmental down a little bit, service up, Diagnostics continuing to see good growth. And I would say, within the LST area, academic headwinds, but we are seeing some improvement in our pharma spending. Pharma for us was up low- to mid-single digits.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink Swann.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Great. I was hoping you can give us some understanding on some of the bottoms-up efforts to improve the gross margin as the year marches along here.","Frank A. Wilson","Yes, well, we've talked a lot about some of the initiatives that we were putting in place. And we did complete one of those and we're almost complete with the second significant leg of that. The first being, moving some manufacturing to Singapore and China, that is complete. There is primarily a supply chain savings that we have baked into the second half, which I think will help grow our gross margin. The other piece is the consolidation of facilities in North America, and we're closing 3 facilities. We've announced 2 other small facilities that we're also going to incorporate into Hopkinton, and that will be completed here shortly. And so we will see some second half savings there. So I think if you look at our 50 to 75 basis points, the majority of those savings are going to be coming in gross margin. We're also making progress around the back-office consolidation, but that really won't be completed until the end of this year. We are underway and so we'll start to see those savings really hit the OpEx in 2014. So it's -- as you look at the 50 to 75 we forecasted for the second half, most of that is going to be around the gross margin side, and then the second -- as we move into next year, it will be more equally split between gross and operating margin.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then my follow-up question, it seems from talking to your partner on the cell-free fetal DNA side that you're making some great progress there. I'm wondering if you can give us an update on how we should think about that impacting the P&L and modeling changeover between cash accounting into accrual accounting, and also the trajectory there.","Robert F. Friel","Sure. So I think as we've been fairly consistent this year, we really don't expect it to have a material impact in 2013, from a revenue or profitability perspective. But at the same time, as you alluded to, we feel very good about the rapid and successful contracting with the managed-care providers for the verified test. And we think the willingness of these providers to contract the test is really a terrific testament for the quality and importance of the testing. Today, we actually signed another, we signed CIGNA. And we're now up over $130 million contracted lives. Clearly, the most covered of any provider in NIPT. So we continue to be excited about the uptake, the receptivity from the doctors and the progress we're making with managed-care providers. But we also think it's going to be more of a 2014 from the standpoint of a material impact on our financial results.","Operator","The next question comes from Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Based on today's updates, it seems fair to assert that last quarter you suffered through a bit of a perfect storm at the end of the quarter. It's good to see a nice rebound this quarter. That being said, comps get a bit tougher in the second half, and growth in the first half was at low-single-digit levels and -- that's clearly embedded in your full year guidance. But really, where I'm going with this is, as we look ahead, does revenue growth really need to accelerate in 2014 for you to get to that 18% operating margin target? Or are the initiatives that you're pulling forward now enough to get you there, even if growth continues at low-single digit levels?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I would say we can continue to get margin expansion but I think to get to the level of 18% by 2014, we would need to see accelerated revenue growth. And I think we've said for some time that mid-single-digit organic revenue growth is probably what we would need now. We have taken some additional actions in the second quarter. And as I said before, that was largely driven by the fact that it allows us to continue to invest into growth, but clearly, it will -- should provide some incremental margin expansion in '14. But I think to get to the level of 18%, we would need to see an acceleration of organic revenue growth beyond what we're experiencing in '13.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","But with that, I guess it's probably worth keeping in mind, you do have a more -- the set-up from this year to next year will be a pretty favorable one and so if you kind of -- so if you maintain the current pace, that alone, probably would get you to mid-single-digit levels, I would think. Maybe a follow-up on the Verinata question from a second ago. Your main competitor in NIPT talked about some reimbursement challenges and pricing challenges in the quarter. It doesn't sound like you guys are experiencing any of that. Is that the case?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I think that's fair. I mean, I think when you think about those exchanges really being talked about in the first of the year, I think to a large extent, we factored that in when we thought about our forecasting. And while I don't want to get into the specifics, we feel very good about the pricing we're getting. And clearly, the average rate we're seeing is higher than what we had originally anticipated in our financial models.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And one last question, maybe a little too early and maybe a little too high level at this. But it was reported in the mainstream press recently that China was going to announce a $275 billion plan to reduce pollution over the next 5 years. Is that an opportunity for you in China in environmental testing? Is this something that you're actively acting on, and any way to quantify the opportunity for you at this time?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, first of all, absolutely. I mean, I think that provides a great opportunity. And again, I talked in my comments about, we're well aligned with what China's trying to do from both a human health and environmental health perspective. So whether it's -- there was also a lot of discussion about soil contamination, in addition to the air and some of the other environmental concerns that they have. So clearly we -- we've -- we are very active in the environment over there in China. We will continue to be -- and in fact, we've targeted specifically air monitoring in China as a significant opportunity for us, probably beginning in '14, but also expanding out over the next couple of years.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla of Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A question on the changing cost structure of the business. I appreciate that you laid the moving pieces of consolidation, et cetera, that are taking place. But I was hoping you could put some numbers around the reduction in total company headcount, either in absolute terms or in percentage of total employees at the business?","Frank A. Wilson","It's a reduction over these initiatives of about 300 people. And if you really look at the dollars, it's about -- with the restructuring we just initiated, it's about $40 million in total. Now again, we've -- we're spending back on about $10 million of that this year on some initiatives, but I think as we look at 2013, we probably have about $10 million worth of upside in the back half. It's offset a little bit by some price and mix in FX.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And my second question is on Medical Imaging. So I appreciate there's a lot of customer volatility in that business, but I was hoping you could go into a little bit better of a geographic breakdown of how that business has performed, U.S., Europe and then the Asia Pac region.","Robert F. Friel","So if you look specifically in QT -- in Q2, what we saw was America was down quite significantly, sort of greater than 15%, Asia was relatively flat and Europe was actually up mid-single digits. Now the one thing I would caution you here though, is when we talk about our revenue geographically in Medical Imaging, again, this is probably the only business in PerkinElmer where we're not selling necessarily to end customers because we're providing components here. So in a lot of cases, the geographic information really talks to the system, the ultimate system provider. So it can be a little misleading from a geographic perspective. But anyway, if you look at our revenue, that's how it would break out.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Just a follow-up there, in the Asian markets for Medical Imaging, did you feel like inventory in the channel was stable? Did you see any drawdowns of inventory taking place there?","Robert F. Friel","I think going into 2013, there clearly was some inventory in the channel and we're seeing that drawn down. And that's why I think, as Andy talked about, we're expecting some fairly significant growth in Q4. And then I think as we look out into '14, we think Medical Imaging will return to a more high-single-digit growth rate, which we think is probably more representative of the opportunity in those end markets.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg of Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Rob, in Asia, can you maybe just talk a little bit more about some of the geographies? If I'm remembering right, from the fourth quarter, along with Japan, Korea and other parts of Southeast Asia were weaker. And I think you said China was just kind of okay, it wasn't great. It looks like China rebounded to the high teens, you said. But from your comments, it sounds like you're expecting that to slow. And I don't know if that's things you're seeing this quarter or if that's just kind of looking at the first half overall. So maybe just any color you can give around Asia, generally.","Robert F. Friel","So, first of all, I would say in China, I think we've gone probably 10-plus quarters in a row with 20-plus organic growth. And our view is that's probably not sustainable forever so we expect a little moderation of that but still at a very robust rate. So as I mentioned, we were very high teens this quarter. I think as I look out to the back half of the year, it's probably going to be very similar to that. So I would say in the 15% to 20% range, we also have a very significant comp issue in China, specifically in Q3. But generally speaking, I think there's going to be some moderation there, but still very robust growth. I mentioned Japan, I think Japan is going to be sort of mid-single digits as we go back -- go into the second half of the year. And then I -- if I think about the rest of Asia, I think it's going to be in that range. I think it's going to be sort of low- to mid-single digits there. I think that's mostly, for us, being impacted by the industrial end markets.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","And just to be clear, again China, you're just looking at the comps. It's nothing that you're seeing there itself that, that would suggest it would be a little bit slower.","Robert F. Friel","No, I think it's mostly the comps.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay, and then on the Environmental side or the -- I guess, on the Lab Services side, any -- it seems to be a market that others are trying to get into. You've been pretty successful there, kind of updated views about the opportunities that you're seeing in that segment going forward?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I think as we said in the prepared remarks, we continue to see strong growth in the Service business. And again, that was against some -- in the second quarter against some difficult comps. So we're pleased with our progress there. It's an area where I think we continue to invest in. We've got a great organization. We've talked about the fact that adding the informatics capabilities -- because I think for us, it's all about providing your customers with differentiated capabilities. And so I think our success there is a recognition by our customers or in the marketplace that we continue to provide a differentiated offering here that our customers feel valuable.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","If I can, what percent of Lab is just basic asset management and some basic services tied to the lab versus some of these newer offerings that you have in informatics, I don't know if you want to call them higher value-add type of offerings?","Robert F. Friel","Well, so -- I don't know if we can get into that level of detail. But I would say that at this point, the informatics offerings are still a relatively small piece. Our expectation is that will be a larger piece, but again it's pretty early days. So I would say that's a relatively small piece of our service revenue right now. But I think it -- the capability is a significant enabler. And I think our customers are recognizing that the potential is fairly significant going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe just to go back to In Vivo, with the improvement that you saw in Europe and Asia, did you find that it was a handful of large orders coming through that made the biggest difference? Or really, was it just that the overall funding environment eased and what you saw was broad-based spending improvement?","Robert F. Friel","Well, if you're looking outside the U.S., I think it was a couple of things. First of all, clearly, some of the stuff that moved out of the first quarter, we were able to close in the second quarter. So I think that helped a little bit. I think when you look in the U.S., there are still funding issues. And I think sequestration is having an impact. And then I would say, generally, like I said I think the organization has done a terrific job in trying to get a lot of those orders closed in the quarter and not running into the end-of-quarter issues that we had in Q1.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe on the Diagnostic side. As the menu broadens for the noninvasive prenatal stuff over time, to what extent, if any, might Verinata start to compete with the Signature business -- Signature Genomics business? Is that something you think about?","Robert F. Friel","I don't think so. I think we continue to think of Signature as more of a confirmatory test, and the NIPT has continued to be a screen. I do think over time that NGS, or next-gen sequencing, does start to infringe upon the arrays. But I think at this point, again, they are separate enough. And in fact, the 3 pieces of our business, I think, are very complementary because I think of the biochemical screen as sort of low-cost, and then you go into the NIPT and then you go into the arrays as a confirmatory test.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just maybe to sneak in one more, as we sort of triangulate these outlook comments, Rob or Andy, at this point, do you have a growth outlook for instruments overall for the year -- or for the back half?","Robert F. Friel","For analytical instruments?","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes.","Robert F. Friel","I think it's probably low-single digits.","Operator","The next question comes from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.","Rafael Tejada - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's Rafael in for Derik. Rob, just regarding the business in China, can you maybe compare the customer mix that you have in that country versus developed geographies?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I would say, when you look at China, clearly there's a higher percentage of the environment, the environmental business. So if you look at overall, PerkinElmer, we're 45% Environmental, 55% Human Health. If you look at our Asian businesses, it's probably 60% to 65% Environmental. So I would say that's the first distinction. I would say, the other thing is the Medical Imaging business is a relatively small piece, although growing in the China business. And so the other mix is within the Diagnostic business, much higher percentage of hospitals from infectious disease than we have outside. So it is a little bit of a different mix relative to Environmental and Human, and then even within Human Health, a little bit of different mix from a customer perspective.","Rafael Tejada - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I guess, if I'm -- based on the comments you made earlier, basically in the back half, you're not necessarily expecting any one of these customer segments who radically changed from the other, meaning not -- one of these customers isn't slowing down dramatically in the back half?","Robert F. Friel","We don't. And I think going back to the prior comments, I mean, first of all, on the Human Health side, we think there's going to be continued demand for access to health care. And so we expect, whether it's on the newborn, prenatal or infectious disease, they're going to continue to grow probably north of 20%. And then, of course, we talked a little earlier about the demands on the environmental issues. So whether it's air, soil, water, et cetera. So we think we're going to continue to see strong growth for our products in China.","Rafael Tejada - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And on the mass spec that was introduced at ASMS, can you comment on maybe on the sort of bookings or orders that have come in so far?","Robert F. Friel","Well, we, at this point, are still talking to employees but we haven't started shipping it. We'll probably start shipping that towards the end of the third quarter. But the response to this and the receptivity to the product has been terrific. And so while we're starting to take some orders, we don't expect it to have a material impact in Q3, probably start to see some revenue in the fourth quarter. But I think the significant impact, from an orders and revenue perspective, again, will be in 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I think maybe, Rob, just following up on that last question. I mean, with the new mass spec systems, I mean, you're going after, I guess, like $1 billion GC triple quad market. Maybe just talk about your go-to-market strategy. I mean, you go to Agilent, Shimadzu, Thermo, some fairly entrenched competitors, so can you maybe just touch on your strategy there? And presumably, this will have some pretty interesting appetite in China, so maybe talk about how you see demand for that product over there as well.","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I think our approach on the mass spec side is to try and find those market niches where the innovation within this mass spec can really provide our customers with some great performance enhancements. So as you know, the AxION combines the identification and quantification capabilities of a triple quad and a TAF [ph]. And so we think that's fairly unique in a couple of specific applications. And so our go-to-market is, not to sort of try and blanket the mass spec market, but to really focus on those applications and those end markets where the AxION iQT can be really differentiated. And so -- but as you mentioned, we think it's a fairly sizable market but ones where the combination of the identification and the quantification in one instrument can provide real benefits, both from a result perspective and a lower cost. So it's going to be a much more targeted go-to-market against specific applications.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And do you see an opportunity to add LC upfront? I mean, it seemed like there were some potential there at ASMS when you first talked about it. How do you think about that?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I think as we talked about ASMS, we think about this as a generation of products. And the first offering had a GC in front of it. I think clearly the opportunity to put an LC is something that we would look to do probably next year.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and then 2 other quick -- just points of clarification, for academic in the back half of the year, I mean you mentioned Japan continues to be okay, obviously, sequestration here in the U.S. Are you assuming academic in aggregate is down in the back half of the year?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I would say, we would think globally flat. And the way I would think about that is outside the U.S., low-single-digits up and in the U.S., we think it's going to continue to be a little bit of a headwind, down a couple of points. Our U.S. business is probably a little bigger. So when you sort of average that together, it's probably -- our assumption is probably flattish.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then last one, radiochemicals flat in the quarter. I mean, that's been a tough business for a long time. I mean, anything to call out there?","Robert F. Friel","We were quite pleased by that because, as you know, it has been a drag on our revenue for a long period of time. It's a little early to call it trend, but we are getting a sense here that some of the pharmaceutical companies are returning back to screening, particularly with kinase and GPCRs and -- are looking to do it with the radiochemicals. We'd like to see a couple of quarters of this before we're ready, again, to call this a trend. But we are encouraged by the fact that the business was flat in the second quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Andy, on the operating cash flow in the period, can you describe sort of what happened on the DSO front and whether that should sort of reverse in the second half? I know you mentioned extended payment terms, if you could elaborate there and then, perhaps, give us an outlook for the full year?","Frank A. Wilson","Sure. I mean, I think from a payment term perspective, we have seen some of our larger customers continue to put pressure on payment terms. That's a little harder one to turn around in the near term. But I would say, the other piece, which was also a large portion, was around linearity. I think that's a timing issue. And I think that we should see some of those receivable built up at the end of the second quarter. Collected in the third quarter, we continue to try to work on the linearity side of the business as well. But I think, overall, in the second quarter, that really was the impact. I think if you look at it from a year-to-date basis, really, we just had a couple of items, some accrueds, which were -- it's really more of a timing issue. It includes taxes and other things and then some working capital. I mean, had some CapEx, which is really around the consolidation of the business as we've talked about earlier. So I think, overall, our working capital was kind of a neutral to the half, but as you point out, we do have some work to do on the collection side. I think second half, we're anticipating our free cash flow to net income to be a little below 1x, really, more like 90% because we have some additional restructuring. But I think we're starting to make some headway there around working capital.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then, Andy, just in terms of the -- given where the capital structure is at this point, do you feel like you're in a position to do perhaps more M&A activity? How would you characterize the pipeline? And should we expect any incremental share repurchases in the second half?","Frank A. Wilson","Well, I think we certainly have continued to remain active on the diligence side. And I think there's a number of bolt-on acquisitions that we're in the process of reviewing. So I think M&A, more of a tuck-in variety, is still something that we are very interested in. I think, it really depends on how those actions progress through the second half. If we see our ability to bring in more of those coveted acquisitions, we'll probably do that. If not, we'll probably look at share buybacks.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Zarak Khurshid of Wedbush Securities.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I have kind of a multi-part question for the diagnostic analyzer launches in China. Can you just talk about the competitive environment there? How are you differentiated? Can you give us a sense of how big that business could be down the road and is there may be a U.S. opportunity for that product?","Robert F. Friel","In the Chinese diagnostic market, generally speaking, the way we think about our competitive advantage is, to really go after the Tier 2 hospitals. And our approach there is -- and again, these products are both designed and produced in China, so we have a very attractive cost structure. But of course, we have entered a national quality and brand that we can attach that at. So generally, we've been very successful in going after -- and as you know, Tier 2 is the largest piece of the market there. So you've got sort of international branded and produced products going after Tier 3, have the tendency to be higher cost, and then you've got the local producers that are, really, at the Tier 1. And so we're really focused in that Tier 2 area. And again, providing the combination of lower cost with a higher quality and brand and service associated with an international company is basically how we take -- how we win there.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then just, if you could clarify an answer to a prior question on Verinata. In the second quarter, did you experience a more significant payment delay associated with the new codes versus what you saw in the first quarter?","Robert F. Friel","Well, first of all, it's a relatively small population for us, but the answer is no.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","First, just a follow-up on the new products that you introduced in China. I was just wondering if you could maybe provide a little bit more color on those, and are those something that can even more accelerate your growth for that business in China?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I mean, basically what they are is they're analyzers for infectious disease, and one of them is really targeted at the fully automated, larger-throughput hospital labs. And we've actually had that out in the second quarter, and we're seeing very good receptivity. We actually sold, I think high-single-digit instruments in the second quarter. So good receptivity on that. And then the other one was really targeted more at the -- as I mentioned, the smaller clinical labs. And again, these are products that are produced in China, designed in China, have a very competitive cost structure and have generally seen pretty good receptivity. Could it accelerate our growth? I think, I would say, I would think about it more as it continues to support our ability to grow 20%-plus in that marketplace.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then just following up on a comment you made earlier regarding either pricing or mixed issues having an impact on gross margins, was just wondering if you could talk about maybe kind of where or what products you're seeing those on?","Frank A. Wilson","Yes, the comment really is focused more on our Environmental business and really around and the instrumentations -- in the instrumentation side of the equation. I think if you really look at the quarter, we did see some significant instrument sales in Asia. A lot of those were government tenders, and those tended to be a little bit lower in price. And then there was the mix with service, which also had an impact there because service is a -- typically lower gross margins.","Robert F. Friel","So as we talked about, service grew very nicely in the quarter and instruments was sort of flattish. And while service has very good operating margins on the gross margin side, that usually causes a little bit of a negative mix.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Got you. And then just my final question, just because I don't think it's been asked and I just wanted to clarify. If you could just talk about the pacing in the quarter and just how did the quarter kind of wrap up compared to your expectations?","Robert F. Friel","So as Andy alluded to on the receivables side, obviously the linearity for us, and I think a lot of our peers, is challenging in the capital equipment side. I would say the linearity returned to similar trends that we've seen prior to Q1. But I would say, in that regard, though, I think the clarity around sequestration is not what it was in the first quarter. I think increased clarity around Japan and the releasing of the supplemental budget, I think, is sort of helpful. So I think what we've seen is more clarity around the customers' ability to spend money. But having said that, clearly, we continue to have a large portion of our instruments occurring in the last couple weeks of the quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Eric Criscuolo of Mizuho Securities.","Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Just filling in for Peter tonight. The weakness in the industrials market this quarter, what kind of customer types were kind of driving that weakness?","Robert F. Friel","So I would say, first of all, on the environmental side, we actually saw a little growth on the industrial side. And so the weakness was probably more on the environmental side than it was on the industrial side. But historically, our industrial customers -- or in the chemical, petrochemical end markets is increasing some on the energy side. So I would say that's the majority of what we -- or generally, in industrial.","Frank A. Wilson","Yes. I think in my -- it may have been confusing, but in my prepared remarks, industrial was up low-single digit. And it is, at least historically over the last several quarters, been down. So we did see a sequential improvement and year-over-year growth. My comments also said we don't see that as being the type of growth rates we expect in the second half. We still expect second half to be flat to down low-single.","Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Just lastly, your next-generation sequencing services and your informatics around that market, maybe could you talk about how that business has been performing for you and what you see in the future?","Robert F. Friel","So first of all, it's a relatively small business for us. And it\u2019s a business that has been growing fairly significantly, but of course, off of a very low base. One of the things that we're doing is shifting the emphasis of that business from the research market into more of a diagnostic play, and we've got CLIA certified a couple of months ago. And so with that shift, I would say more recently, we're seeing a little bit of the slowing of growth there, but again, that continues to be a relatively small business for us.","Operator","And I would now like to turn the call back over to Rob Friel for closing remarks.","Robert F. Friel","Okay, great. Well, first of all, thank you for your questions. And while we're closely watching the macroeconomic environment, we were encouraged by our second quarter performance. And I feel good about our organization and our ability to deliver our improved second half guidance. I would like to close by reiterating our confidence in our long-term strategic plans and the opportunity to create shareholder value.

Rob?","Rob Friel","Thanks, Bryan, and good evening, everyone. The third quarter was a busy one for PerkinElmer in which we continued to take important steps to position the company for acceleration of our growth and profitability, while also delivering strong financial results.","Turning first to our financial results in the quarter, revenue was $707 million representing organic revenue growth of 5%. Adjusted EPS was $1.06, an increase of 18% over Q3 last year and significantly exceeding our forecast. As the benefits of our new operating model and increased contributions from our growth businesses delivered very significant operating leverage.","This strong margin expansion has given us the confidence to raise our full-year adjusted EPS growth to 13% despite stronger than anticipated headwinds from foreign exchange and a challenging macroeconomic environment.","While Prahlad and Jamey will discuss the specifics of our performance in the end markets overall market conditions for the majority of our portfolio are consistent with our previous outlook. And except for two areas we will discuss our businesses are performing well.","Importantly, our key growth areas are continuing to gain traction and scale and remain on track to achieve or exceed our previously communicated goals for 2019. At the start of this year, I discussed the opportunity we saw to increase our impact and growth by better leveraging the intersection in synergies of our technical and commercial capabilities across PerkinElmer.","During the third quarter, we completed a fairly significant organizational realignment to create a more unified approach to customers and better facilitate collaboration across the company. In addition, during the quarter, we announced the appointment of Prahlad as CEO effective the end of this year as well as several other business and functional leadership changes.","These actions are the final steps in the execution of a multi-year strategy to position the company organizationally for the next phase of its evolution and growth. During the quarter we also added a key strategic asset to our food capabilities with the addition of the Meizheng Group. Increasing our product and technology breadth as well as commercial resources in China.","Prahlad will go into the acquisition in more detail. However, strategically this deal is consistent with our recent Cisbio purchase as it is focused at an attractive end market, increases our consumable mix and expands our scientific and technological capabilities and adjacent technologies.","Also, similar to Cisbio, we believe Meizheng will provide very attractive financial returns given the natural channel and geographic synergies between our two companies. Additionally, during the third quarter, we issued an $850 million 10-year bond and extended the term of our revolving credit facility. These actions strengthen our financial position by securing long-term capital at very attractive rates while also increasing our capacity for both organic and inorganic investments.","The last item I will highlight for the third quarter is a significant operating leverage we experienced this quarter. As we outlined previously the key actions for 2019 and 2020 to meet our operating margin objectives were focused on increasing the incremental margin flow through on revenue growth to 28% with an emphasis on improving EUROIMMUN\u2019s margins and reducing our SG&A to 24% of revenue by 2020.","As many of you know, driving sustainable margin improvement often requires efforts to simplify processes and improve supply chains that must be implemented several quarters before they are evident in financial results. Consequently is great to see that the many actions we have taken over the prior several quarters are beginning to translate into improved profitability.","Specifically our incremental margins for the third quarter and full year are tracking significantly above our plan and in particular EUROIMMUN margins year-to-date are over a year ahead of our acquisition model.","Similarly in the third quarter adjusted SG&A as a percentage of revenue was below 24% and year-to-date we are trending ahead of our 2020 plan. And while we are proud of the progress we've made this year, we view this as a never ending journey to become a more efficient and streamlined organization.","However, the results this quarter further reinforce our belief that there is a significant opportunity to further increase operating margins of the company while maintaining ample capacity to appropriately invest in growth. So, to summarize both the third quarter and performance year-to-date, our organic revenue growth of 5% has been about a 100 basis points below our guidance due to market headwinds in the applied markets and some timing of revenue in diagnostics, neither of which we believe present mid or long term challenges to our high-single digit revenue growth model.","In addition, despite the lower revenue operating margins and adjusted EPS are tracking ahead of plan as our margin improvement plans are yielding greater benefits than anticipated.","Therefore, as we put our plans together for the next several years, we are quite optimistic as our growth businesses like EUROIMMUN, Vanadis, our Genomics business, Service Informatics and Cannabis continue to do very well. Also the three bolt-on acquisitions completed this year, the completion of our commercial realignment as well as our improved operating leverage should further increase organic revenue growth and profitability.","I will now turn the call over to Prahlad who will discuss in more detail some of these specific items and our optimism about the future of PerkinElmer. However, before I introduce Prahlad, I did want to recognize that as I will be stepping down as Chairman and CEO at the end of this year this will be my last earnings call for PerkinElmer. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for your support of me and the Company over the years.","I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to get to know and work with all of you and wish you all continued success. I am now very happy to turn the call over to the next CEO of PerkinElmer, Prahlad Singh.","Prahlad Singh","Thank you Rob. Before I begin my prepared remarks, I wanted to take a few minutes to acknowledge and thank Rob for his leadership and service to PerkinElmer. As you know, Rob will be retiring from the company and this is his last quarterly earnings call. For those of us keeping tabs this is his 84th earnings call with PerkinElmer. Rob has evolved PerkinElmer into a strong company with a legacy of sustainable and profitable earnings growth and optimize the portfolio towards high-growth end markets.","The management team at PerkinElmer will build on his legacy to progress PerkinElmer to its next level as a growth focused company providing high-quality earnings. Today I'm excited to update everyone on the continued progress we have made on our strategic priorities during the third quarter. But to start off, I want to begin with some details of our recent acquisition of the Meizheng Group.","We are extremely excited to welcome the team from Meizheng to PerkinElmer. Meizheng is a highly attractive and strategic asset, one that will play a pivotal role in our domestic food strategy in China as well as our broader long-term food strategy across the globe. Meizheng has developed a reputation as a leading food safety testing company in China due to its current portfolio breadth, strong culture of innovation and unparalleled customer intimacy.","The Company is headquartered in Beijing and has a broad commercial presence in China, supported by over 140 direct sales and marketing feet on the street. Meizheng\u2019s comprehensive technology and product portfolio covers immunoassay, microbiology and molecular testing for food safety in prioritized end-markets grain, dairy, meat and seafood.","With the addition of Meizheng, we estimate that the total addressable market for our food portfolio in China is now $1 billion to $2 billion and we have the most extensive set of capabilities across the food testing value chain. For example, in dairy, we now have the broadest set of food quality and safety capabilities, which span from upstream herd management to midstream collection center testing to transportation and storage testing.","Additionally, we also now serve the QA and QC labs at processing facilities and third party safety and regulatory adherence testing customers. We estimate that the overall China food safety testing market has been growing at a low double-digit CAGR over the past five years, driven by increasing government regulation and enforcement changes in local dietary preference and a rising middle class.","And we expect that the market to continue to grow at a healthy high-single to low-double digit clip for the foreseeable future? Since Meizheng was founded in 2009, the company has grown its top-line revenues at a greater than 25% CAGR. More importantly, 75% of Meizheng\u2019s revenue comes from reagents and consumables and is resilient to macro cyclicality.","With the addition of Meizheng, we will now have more than $80 million food quality and food safety testing business in China. We see significant synergy opportunities from a portfolio, channel and regulatory standpoint. Meizheng has developed strong connections with major regulatory bodies and key opinion leaders and the company counts many of the leading local food companies as customers, all of which we view as critical in a country still in the early innings of establishing national and industry standards.","While the downstream food quality end-market has been soft globally this year, upstream food safety testing has been solid and we continue to view overall food quality and safety testing as one of the most attractive end-markets globally due to its long-term structural tailwinds, it's regulated nature and the fact that the market is highly fragmented with no dominant player across the value chain. We believe with the acquisition of Meizheng, we are now in a prime position to establish ourselves as a leader in food quality and safety testing over the coming years.","Switching over to the third quarter performance and an update on our strategic priorities. I echo Rob's enthusiasm, we continued to make tremendous progress, shaping our organization internally to leverage our capabilities across PerkinElmer and provide a better customer experience. On the customer experience front, the team has made good progress leveraging cross-functional expertise across PerkinElmer\u2019s focused business segments, food, diagnostics, life sciences and applied markets as well as informatics.","For example, we are now able to provide turn key solution for cannabis customers that cover all testing, analytical lab management and data analytics need to ensure the quality and safety of their products and meet compliance requirements.","There are still some elements of these cannabis workflow solutions that will be rolled out over the coming quarters. But the team has had early success during the third quarter cross-selling additional PerkinElmer products. To share one example, recognizing that faster turnaround times and higher accuracy sample prep are increasingly important needs in the cannabis industry. Our internal cannabis team leaders connected customers with members of our applied genomics team, who in turn developed a cannabis-specific workflow to sell alongside a complete analytical offering.","The JANUS G3 liquid handling workstation was recently adopted by Anandia's new testing lab in Vancouver to automate the primary sample transfer and sample setup for the analysis of contaminates such as mold spores and pesticides in cannabis, which is extremely important for medical users who could potentially have compromised immune systems.","Turning to our priorities around people and culture, we finalized our commercial organizational realignment during the quarter. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, aligning a commercial structure by region has been a key initiative this year. We firmly believe that empowering the regions with decision-making closer to the customer is the right playbook as it puts the voice of the customer at the center of our commercial strategy.","Finally, on innovation, Vanadis continues to gain traction. Inbound inquiries have increased following the prenatal diagnostics publication in late August. There is significant interest in our technology as Vanadis\u2019 high sensitivity and specificity and low no call rate resonates with clinicians. Year-to-date, we have 19 systems installed or in the process of installation and we remain on track to achieve our year-end goal of 30 installations.","Our pipeline of opportunities over the next six months remains very healthy. Additionally, as we announced in the press release yesterday, our Pittsburgh and Malaysia labs can now receive samples to perform NIPT testing and support of our maternal and fetal health customers. In the U.S. the aim of the Pittsburgh lab is also to serve as a backup for clients requiring overflow capacity as well as an outsource service labs for small customers who need to scale before they bring technology in-house.","We also will be offering carrier screening and pre-eclampsia testing which along with Vanadis as a first to market combined offering will serve to further differentiate us in the U.S. market and provide a much better customer experience. As Vanadis is now up and running at our Pittsburgh lab, we are excited to announce that we will be hosting a tour at that facility in the near future.","Given the capacity constraints at the lab, we will only be hosting the cell side during the day, but we hope to be able to host investors at the facility down the road as well. We'll send out official invites in the coming weeks. As I said on our last call, I'm inspired to witness the immense talent in our organization rallying together to achieve the vision of becoming a truly differentiated player by leveraging our capabilities across our organization to provide a flawless customer experience.","I believe we are in a good position to close out 2019 on a solid footing which will set us up well heading into 2020. I look forward to sharing ongoing progress with you as we achieve our mission and accelerate profitable growth.","I will now turn the call over to Jamey.","Jamey Mock","Thanks Prahlad and good evening everyone. As always, I want to start with the highlights for the quarter. Next, I'll provide some additional color on our served end markets and detail on other financial metrics. Lastly, I'll finish by providing a brief update on how we're thinking about the fourth quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our third quarter results and year-to-date performance. To start, market conditions were largely in line with our expectations entering the quarter and our growth accelerators continued to perform well.","For example, EUROIMMUN continued to grow at a double-digit clip due to strong demand in China. Cannabis and genomics testing remain on pace to meet or exceed our initial goals for 2019. And Vanadis momentum continues to build following the prenatal diagnostics publication in late August. As Rob and Prahlad mentioned, we completed and are excited about the acquisition of Meizheng, which I will cover in greater detail later.","Additionally, prior actions to reduce our organizational complexity have made us a nimbler organization moving forward. Finally, we are raising our 2019 earnings estimate to the high end of our prior range or $4.07 per share, which represents $0.03 increase versus the midpoint of our prior range. In summary, the team has done a great job executing on our near and long-term priorities.","Turning into the third quarter results. We continue to be pleased with the strength in our business as organic revenue grew 5%. Reported revenue grew 5% to $707 million and included 2% foreign exchange headwind and a 2% net acquisition tailwind.","By business diagnostics, representing 40% of total sales grew 6% organically driven by our immunodiagnostics and reproductive health business lines. Discovering analytical solutions representing 60% of total sales grew 4% organically, highlighted by continued strength in life sciences and offset by ongoing tepid demand in the applied markets.","I will provide some additional color on both businesses in a moment. On a geographic basis, organic growth trends remained mix as they have throughout the year 2019. Asia-Pacific and Europe grew mid single-digits while the Americas grew low single-digits. Year-to-date, the Americas and Asia-Pacific are up mid single-digits while Europe is up low single-digits.","Operationally, we are extremely pleased with our performance in the third quarter and we continue to see significant potential to improve our profitability going forward. Adjusted operating margins expanded 250 basis points in the third quarter to 21.6%, driven by productivity, mix and cost out actions. Year-to-date, we have expanded adjusted operating margins by 150 basis points year-over-year.","As Rob mentioned, adjusted earnings per share of $1.06 was an increase of 18% versus the third quarter of 2018 and $0.05 ahead of our guidance. Looking further into the key drivers within our segments, let's start with our diagnostics business. As mentioned in my earlier remarks, organic revenue grew 6% driven primarily by our immunodiagnostics and reproductive health franchises.","On the immunodiagnostics front, EUROIMMUN and Tulip led the way as both grew at a healthy low double-digit organic growth rate. EUROIMMUN was broad-based with autoimmune, allergy and infectious disease testing, all growing double-digits during the quarter.","Geographically, China remains strong while EUROIMMUN\u2019s U.S. business also continues to scale, rapidly growing at a very healthy double-digit rate. Testing went live during September at a large reference lab. Therefore, we continue to expect EUROIMMUN\u2019s U.S. market share for AMA testing to reach 50% as testing ramps up moving forward.","Reproductive health grew mid single-digits organically driven by our genomics testing business and expanded coverage in Asia-Pacific. As one example from earlier this year, the Philippines implemented and expanded newborn screening program, the national insurance company, PhilHealth announced that it will provide 100% public insurance reimbursement for all newborns. Previously only 12% of newborns were screened and payment was all out of pocket. By the end of September and estimated 85% of newborns were screened under the new program.","Applied genomics growth moderated versus the first half trends down mid single-digits in the third quarter. Comparisons in the business were difficult due to the timing of some high ASP, large automated workstation purchases last year. We continue to see healthy expansion in our opportunity funnel, which keeps us encouraged that this business will return to healthy growth.","Turning to Discovery & Analytical Solutions. Organic growth of 4% was a 2% uptick versus the first half performance. By end market, we experienced high single-digit organic revenue growth in pharma biotech, propelled by our imaging and detection and informatics product lines. Both were up double-digits in the quarter.","Our informatics business continues to perform well as leading pharma and biotech companies actively shift to modern future-proof workflow solutions like PerkinElmer signals to accelerate their R&D insights. The applied markets were flat in the quarter, driven primarily by softness in China and Europe, which were down mid single-digit and low single-digits respectively. Combined overall industrial and environmental was flat and improvement sequentially. However, we think the improvement is a function of easier comparisons on a sequential basis, not a fundamental improvement in the underlying market trends.","Food was up low single-digits bolstered by strong cannabis demand. Shifting to below the line items, adjusted net interest and other expense for the third quarter was approximately $15 million and our adjusted tax rate was approximately 14% driven by benefits from global tax planning actions.","Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of debt and $393 million of free cash flow \u2013 of cash. Free cash flow in the quarter was $90 million and adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $96 million. As a reminder, the difference between the reported and adjusted number as due to cash payments associated with prior acquisitions. Actions to improve working capital had been put in place and as a result, sequential usage has improved versus the first half performance.","We anticipate additional improvement in the fourth quarter and into 2020. As mentioned, we are excited about our Meizheng acquisition. The net purchase price was approximately $152 million. We expect a double-digit return on invested capital by year four. We estimate Meizheng to approximately have $30 million of revenue in 2019 with accretive operating margins.","For the fourth quarter, we expect Meizheng to contribute less than 1% to PerkinElmer revenue growth and negligible EPS accretion. For modeling purposes, the acquisition officially closed October 17. Over the course of the last 45 days, we refinanced a substantial portion of our debt. We were pleased with the pricing of our new $850 million 10-year bond in the extension of our revolving credit facility. We reduced our cost of debt by 50 basis points, more than doubled our overall maturity profile and alleviated our 2021 maturity cliff risk. Finally, we exited the quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.8 times and we expect to end the year at approximately that same level.","Closing the books on the first nine months of 2019, we remain pleased with our performance including 5% organic growth, 13% growth in earnings per share and continued success of our growth accelerators. The additions of Meizheng and Cisbio will help accelerate our growth in coming years and improve our reagent portfolio and capabilities.","The new organizational structure will further strengthen our ability to execute on a consistent basis. For the year, we now expect 5% organic growth and reported revenue to be approximately $2.88 billion, including $68 million from foreign exchange headwinds and approximately $41 million of contributions from acquisitions and divestitures.","We are increasing our full year EPS guidance, adjusted EPS guidance to $4.07, which includes an incremental $0.02 headwind from foreign exchange compared to our prior guidance. Additionally, we now expect to expand our operating margins by 150 basis points. Finally, we anticipate $60 million in adjusted interest and other expenses, 14% to 14.5% tax rate and our share counts remain at slightly under 112 million for the year.","For the fourth quarter of 2019, we are forecasting reported revenue of $800 million, representing 5% organic revenue growth, including a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $11 million versus a comparable prior period. In terms of adjusted earnings per share guidance for Q4, we are forecasting $1.32.","Before I kind of call back to the operator, I'd also like to congratulate Rob on an enormously successful career. In addition to Prahlad\u2019s remarks on Rob's transformation of the company, he's also positively impacted the lives of thousands of employees and their families along the way, including myself. From all of us, we thank you and wish you a relaxing and wonderful retirement. This concludes my prepared remarks.","Operator, at this time, we would like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. And your first question comes from the line of Derik DeBruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Derik DeBruin","Hi. Good afternoon.","Prahlad Singh","Good afternoon.","Rob Friel","Hi, Derik.","Derik DeBruin","So I'm still not clear on the diagnostics slowdown in the quarter. I mean, you did 9% in the first half of the year, 6% this quarter and it was on easier comp. Can you just walk through what the sequential deceleration was in the quarter?","Rob Friel","Yes, the two aspects to it, Derik. One is as we are moving the genomics testing lab, we had two facilities, one in Branford and one in Pittsburgh. And we are consolidating that into Pittsburgh. So from the move that has resulted in a backlog of samples which were not read through and that contributed to some of the slow down on the diagnostics one.","The second one was around the applied genomics business. We had last year a lot of capital based systems on the automation side of it, which did not come through. And that has postponed over to the next few quarters. Again, these are things that we \u2013 it's not that we have lost these, but they have moved on into the next couple of quarters.","So that essentially has accounted for the slowdown that we saw on Q3. Again, coming back to it, our reproductive health franchises and immunodiagnostics, those continued to do very well despite the slowdown in birthrates.","Derik DeBruin","Right. So if you adjust for those two items, what was that about \u2013 what was the hit on organic revenue growth [indiscernible] it's about 3%?","Jamey Mock","Yes, that's right, Derik, so get you back to about the 9% run rate.","Derik DeBruin","Great. Thank you. And I think, I guess one follow-up question on this one, you look at the margin expansion, which is really impressive. I mean, is that SG&A number sustainable going forward?","Jamey Mock","Yes. Let me take that, Derik. Yes, I mean, when I think about margin expansion, I think this has been, as Rob mentioned in his prepared remarks, years of planning around this. And a lot of times it just takes some time to kind of show up in our margin line. And I think we talked about three general levers, all of them playing a role, SG&A to your point being one of them.","But I mean, I think mix has been better so a little bit more diagnostics. Even within DAS, our Life Sciences business is growing, informatics and reagents continued to grow. With regards to leverage, to your question, yes, I mean I think we have made the necessary investments in years prior and we anticipated that we'd be able to take down the SG&A as a percent of revenue. Obviously and we also had some improvements due to the synergies in our reorganization.","And so that helped a little bit here as well. And then on productivity, I think we've got a lot going on both from a shop perspective, services perspective as well as indirect as well so that we can elaborate more on those. But I think it is sustainable here. There might be a little bit of timing, but not much of it.","Derik DeBruin","Great. Thanks. Rob, happy trails and good luck.","Rob Friel","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney. Please go ahead.","Paul Knight","Hey Rob, congratulations. And when I first started covering you 19 years ago, 5% organic or mid-single wasn't even on the horizon for Perkin, could you kind of replay what you did as you became CEO and as you stand here today because you kind of reflect on where you think Perkin stands and kind of take a bow for what the investment you've done on R&D and M&A and divestiture. If you could \u2013 can summarize that up, it'd be awesome.","Rob Friel","Yes, I'd be happy to do that. And Paul, you're probably one of the few people that sort of remember the old days there in the early 2000s. But anyway, as you can imagine, not surprisingly, over the last couple of weeks, I've been a little bit more reflective on my tenure here. And I would say, I feel really good about what we've been able to accomplish at the company during sort of almost two decades. And I really want to emphasize the, we part of that statement is I've been extremely fortunate to work with really some outstanding people over the years.","As I think about the most important accomplishments, there's probably three or four I sort of just spike out quickly. One, obviously it's relevant for this audience is the value we've created for our shareholders. If I go back to when I started as CFO in 1999, the company had a little north of $1 billion in market cap when I became CEO in early 2008, it had grown to three. And today we sit at it just under 10 with an enterprise value of close to 12. So to put that in perspective, if you had invested $1 billion in the market in 1999, you'd be at about $3 billion, meaning, over that period of time we've created about $7 billion in incremental value, four of which was during my tenure as CEO.","And I think an important component of that value creation, as you mentioned, Paul, was the dramatic shift in the portfolio and capabilities of the company. And it's been particularly, I would say in the last six or seven years. And I feel particularly proud that we've been able to do that with fairly minimal disruption. And for those of you that have been around for awhile, it's really dramatic change of our end markets, our geographic footprint, our technological capabilities. While that not only provides, I would say, a better platform to accelerate the growth and profitability, it's created a more unifying mission and purpose for the company around improving health globally.","And that really takes me to the third area where I really feel great about the organizational capability we've built. And that sort of things like work environment and culture and why people would come to PerkinElmer. And in the past I would say, I felt like the company attracted people because more or less the job and it was sort of a transactional relationship, they came here to work and receive a paycheck. And that was sort of it.","I now think people come to PerkinElmer as a place to participate in a mission at the same time, pursue a sort of a career. And as a result, I think what really starts to differentiate us is how our employees take a more caring and longer term approach to what they do and how they do it. And then the last thing I just mentioned is, so we sort of reached this transition point.","I feel extremely proud of the condition of the company. I think we're fortunate to have Prahlad as our next CEO. He knows the company well. He's been part of the significant changes at the company over the last five years. I feel like he'll be supported by an excellent leadership team. And as Jamey and Prahlad talked about the recent commercial realignment, I think it allow us to better serve our customers and in fact infuse more simplicity in how we operate.","So feel like when you look at the company from a financial perspective, strategic position or operation, it's just never been in a better place. And so it's an exciting time for the company and it should be for our shareholders, customers and employees. So anyway, I apologize for the long answer, but I feel like I've been here a long time and there's a lot of good things to talk about. So anyway, it's been a good run and I feel like it's turning over to some great hands and excited about the future.","Paul Knight","Thanks Rob and thanks for the incremental $7 billion and it\u2019s been a great run. Thank you.","Rob Friel","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Willoughby","Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. And Rob, I wish you a wonderful retirement. A couple of questions for you. I guess first, Jamey, could you talk a little bit there was some larger onetime charge this quarter. The one that stuck out to me was the accelerated executive comp, just kind of any color on that. And then just also if you could talk within the DAS business kind of how your instruments business versus services grew in the quarter?","Jamey Mock","Instruments versus services, is that what you said on the second one there, Steve?","Steve Willoughby","Yes, exactly. Yes, exactly.","Jamey Mock","So with regards to the accelerated CEO charge, in conjunction with Rob's announced retirement, the board agreed to accelerate the best thing of a portion of his equity awards. And so the accounting typically spent that over the required service period in the future. So let's say three years if that's what the vesting period is and since Rob is now retired, we accelerated that and the board granted that and that's the additional charge for, some of those equity awards and that increased compensation. Does that make sense?","Steve Willoughby","It does. Yes. Thank you.","Jamey Mock","And with regards to DAS instruments versus services, I mean, I think we've saw good mix. I kind of mentioned it earlier in DAS. So greater pharm biotech, greater reagents, software was great. So our informatics business did extremely well, Cisbio continues to do very well. So the mix in that business was positive. The applied markets were flat. So overall we're seeing an improved mixed change to greater service software and reagents in that business, which helped contribute to if you see the gross or the margin expansion in DAS of 340 basis points in the quarter.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. And then if I could just squeeze in one last one, just Jamey, how are you thinking about, it seems like there are a couple of different moving pieces within the earnings guidance for this year. Have you broken out or could you walk through how you're thinking about kind of the EPS bridge versus your old guidance to guidance today? Just seems like tax rate is moving around, organic growth is moving around, margins are moving around, et cetera.","Jamey Mock","Yes, I mean, if I were to simplify it, going up $0.03 is largely on the back of extra margin expansion. So I'd call that kind of up $0.06 to $0.07 versus our prior guidance for the rest of the year. Organic growth is coming down, so 5% versus kind of a 5% to 6% organic guidance range, so that's maybe down $0.04 to $0.05, so up $0.02 margin versus organic growth. And then really all the other items, FX is a headwind of $0.02 and tax and interest expense is probably better by $0.03, so that gives you maybe an extra penny as well. So greater margin expansion, more than offsetting organic growth shortage here, and a little bit extra tax benefit more than offsetting foreign exchange.","Steve Willoughby","Perfect. Thanks Jamey.","Jamey Mock","Thank you.","Operator","And your next questions comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. I want to dive into the margins a little bit more, you did have a restructuring during the quarter. Can you just talk on how much of that was from kind of the riff versus stuff that had been in the works ahead of the quarter. And then as we think about next year you're sticking with the high single-digit organic growth targets by the lower base this year. I just wondering how you think about the comfort level and hitting that?","Rob Friel","Yes, so maybe I'll touch on restructuring first. So I mean, much of this has been planned. So it's really in two broad areas. One is our services organization. I've mentioned in the past that we've invested in software platform called ServiceMax, which basically allows us to schedule and dispatch our field service engineers better, control contracts, control pricing, et cetera.","So we've known that that's been invested in over the last couple of years and up and running well. So we were able to do a little bit of right-sizing in our services organization. And then the other part was also related to the reorganization of a company. So we think of the company transformation much more is a growth oriented change, but it definitely provided a little bit of synergy as well. And that those two things really comprised the restructuring charge.","In terms of high single-digit growth next year, I mean 5% this year is still strong. We still think a lot of the organic growth accelerators will come next year. And some of these things that are going on right now is timing. So I think we mentioned, applied genomics is still a strong market. Some of that backlog we see visibility to in 2009 or 2020. The PerkinElmer genomics testing item is a short-term issue as we transfer from one facility to a different facility, it's not a demand issue. In fact, we\u2019re having the turn away demand.","And DAS, we expect, it did improve quite a bit. So DAS came from 2% to 4%. We'd said 5%, academic government came through, OneSource came through. But the applied markets were still a little bit softer than we anticipated. I think it'd be headed into next year, Vanadis hasn't contributed a lot this year. Cannabis and all of our growth accelerators we think will kick in even more. So we're still quite confident in the future trajectory here.","Tycho Peterson","And then a question on the China strategy here around food, there's obviously a lot of turmoil, you alluded to that in your comments. Can you just talk to your visibility into that market? And how \u2013 what's the strength of upstream versus downstream for you guys and what's your comfort level that you want to run into some of the problems with the privatization that we've heard about from some of the other tool peers.","Jamey Mock","Yes. Tycho, I mean I think the number one thing that to point out is that from Meizheng\u2019s perspective, they have a very strong hold on the local customers. And 70% to 75% of their revenue comes from consumables. So it's not playing in like a very capital intensive market. The installed base is already there. They are providing more of the consumables and the reagents.","So that trajectory is one that we haven't seen slowing down while we've been talking to Meizheng. And again the strategy that we have used for this acquisition was not dissimilar to what we've done with the EUROIMMUN and Cisbio, we\u2019ve worked with the principal owner for more than a year and a half and understood and studied the market. So we feel really good about it.","Tycho Peterson","All right. And then one last one for Jamey, just on cash flow, $95 million or so year-to-date, can you just talk on where you think that that could be headed as we think in the next year? I'm just curious if there's an opportunity to improve on that?","Jamey Mock","Yes, I mean if I step back and just talk about cash flow a little bit. I mean, if you go back a few years, I think it's clear that the company has been focused on improving our revenue growth and expanding our margins. I think we've done a lot of things to do that. We've changed incentive plans. We've leaned into working capital to better serve our customers. We've invested in capital expenditures in EUROIMMUN and other parts of PKI.","And we felt that during that time period, it was important to change the trajectory of the company and it also happen to coincide with the low interest rate environment. So we thought it was a good trend. As we look forward, I mean certainly we understand that all three metrics have to go well together. So increasing our growth rate, increasing our margins, I think we've been able to prove that over the last couple of years. And I think cash flow will come along well.","So I'm competent in an improving but I think it's going to take a little bit of time. It's not going to be an overnight change. We've got some things underway and some process improvements underway, largely in the areas of receivables and inventory. I think if you look year-to-date, CapEx is down 10%. So that was an easy one to help fix or invested a little bit differently I'd say. So I think it's confident, I won't guide on next year, but very confident that we will get this up to a 90% plus business.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thanks and best of luck with everything, Rob. Good working with you.","Rob Friel","Thank you.","Operator","And we have a question for the line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi, thanks for the time here. I'd echo the well-wishers, Rob. It\u2019s been great working with you.","Rob Friel","Great, thanks.","Steve Beuchaw","One, I might like to do, first is just probably for Prahlad, if you could give us a little bit of an update on some of the commercialization efforts around Vanadis. And I think it's a two-parter. One is, have you seen progress on Vanadis reimbursement in Europe? And if not, can you talk about like when you might be ready to talk about progress there?","And then we saw of course, the news about the Vanadis strategy in the U.S. and Asia. You mentioned it in the prepared remarks. I just want to clarify, I mean, do you still intend to seek FDA approval, CFDA approval for Vanadis to work on that as a system that goes into both of those markets as something that people run on site. And then between now and then are you taking a meaningful number of samples as something of an LDT? And then I have one follow-up.","Prahlad Singh","Let me start with the regulatory strategy in the U.S. and China. So in the U.S. our strategy is not going to be dissimilar to our peers. It's going to be an RUO, under a CLIA, it will be an LDT. Just like most of the other tests out there. Currently, we do not have any plans to go under a PMA or get a regulatory approval in the U.S. In China, we are pursuing CFDA, our regulatory approval, we\u2019re done with type testing. We are in the process of our clinical trials and that will take its due course in time.","So from a regulatory perspective, that's our strategy. In the U.S. the benefit that we have is we will be able to differentiate in terms of providing pre-eclampsia and carrier screening and providing it as one test. So it results in a better customer experience as there is only one prick and one report out in a simplistic manner to our customers. So that's from a regulatory perspective. In terms of EU reimbursement strategy that is mostly controlled by the countries where it is operated. As you know, some countries initially where we have already put the system in \u2013 there is government approval around EUR 250. So that is already available and it's out there. It's not a specific Vanadis code, but it is available for NIPT reimbursement.","So that's from a EU perspective, feedback that we continue to get from our customers is the ease-of-use, workflow, automation and obviously, cost is an important factor. And again, Steve, as we've said earlier, our focus this year is to ensure that we get 30 installations, make sure that they work flawlessly and well and our customers present and publish from there.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay. So sorry if I'm being a little dense, but is it the case that you don't believe there's any additional work you need to do to get reimbursement in Europe?","Prahlad Singh","In Europe? No.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay, great. And then my follow-up is actually going back to a point that came up on last quarter's call where there was a discussion around some, some back and forth in China dynamics that that popped up there where some tenders were pulled away. Just wondered if I could get an update on how those dynamics were progressing and if you've got any of that back. And then maybe as a corollary to that, more on the diagnostic side in China how you're seeing that sort of pricing competitive dynamics there. Thanks again.","Prahlad Singh","So let me take the first one on the tender. Again, the tender was a very small one. It was really not that material. It probably got a little much more attention than it should have. So, I don't think it is significant enough for us to talk about and it did not materially impact what we are. What our business is in China.","Specifically, now switching to your second part around diagnostics in China, despite low birth rates in China, our reproductive health franchise continues to do well. Our immuno diagnostics franchise continues to do well. So I don't know, Jamey, what was our Q3 diagnostic","Jamey Mock","Yes, up mid-single digits.","Prahlad Singh","It was up mid-single digits. So we, Steve from a diagnostics perspective, China continues to do well for us.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay, great. Again, thanks. Really appreciate it.","Prahlad Singh","Yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line as Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Doug Schenkel","Thank you. And Rob, thanks for all your efforts and good luck in your next chapter.","Rob Friel","Thank you","Doug Schenkel","I guess three or four questions starting on DAS, how impactful were the three transitory dynamics you pointed to in Q2 that you expected to reverse in the third quarter? One of those is the one that Steve just asked about the $4 million in revenue. You didn't book in Q2 due to the China import approvals. I think you expected half of that to come back. The second was expected changes you made in the academic government leadership team is having the potential reverse, what was a headwind in the first half where revenue decline 10% year-over-year. And the third was enterprise services backlog converting. You thought that could give you 50 basis points to 100 hundred basis points of growth this quarter. So, I'm curious if you could just provide updates on those things within DAS.","On diagnostics, I think you attributed the Q3 moderation in diagnostic growth relative to trend to a couple things you positioned as one-timer such as lab consolidation. I'm just wondering if they are one-timers, what is in the full year guidance implied if that that comes back in the fourth quarter.","The third is on 2020 targets. Prahlad, I know you're not new to PKI but you're going to be new to the CEO role. Based on Jamey\u2019s response to one to Tycho\u2019s questions it looks like you're good with the 2020 financial targets that Rob outlined a few years ago. I just want to make sure that's right.","And my last question is on free cash flow conversion. Last quarter you set new adjusted free cash flow conversion guidance to around 80% is that still the case? Thank you.","Rob Friel","So since we are furiously writing down to make sure we didn't forget the list.","Doug Schenkel","Yes, I\u2019ll chime back in, if I went too fast. Sorry about that.","Prahlad Singh","Let me go with the one that was for me because the other three were for Jamey, so let me take the one around 2020 CEO. Look, as to Tycho\u2019s question I don't want to give guidance on 2020. We'll be happy to do that as we get to our Q1 call. But I will look forward to Tycho\u2019s conference in San Francisco and be able to give more of an update on our strategy and how we see next year and the next several years coming in. But what I will say that our thesis holds, our growth accelerators continue to do very well and we are very confident in what we have talked about earlier in the year.","Jamey Mock","Yes. So first one with regards to DAS bridge from the first half to the second half year, so I would say two to three of those came through as expected. So academic and government did turn around as anticipated, we definitely saw a significant uptick versus the first half being down over double digits as you mentioned.","OneSource I had mentioned that we definitely had visibility to a lot of this backlogs, so that did see an uptick as well. And in the applied markets did not though. So that's why we're at 4% versus 5%, applied markets continues to be soft. So probably, we did mention some of our food NPIs, those actually are performing pretty well or better than the first half. That said, the overall market is just not where we see it to be.","And I think you call it out the China items on MOFCOM or maybe the tenders or whatnot, but I think that's such a small amount. Now, we'll just talk to the overall applied markets and that has not recovered as we talked about earlier.","Second on the Dx bridge in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter with regards to lab consolidations. So, late in the third quarter we did start our move into a different facility that will impact the fourth quarter as well, which we, that's why we're guiding, a similar organic growth rate heading into the fourth quarter.","This is not a demand issue. As I mentioned earlier, we have plenty of demands and we are actually having to turn away samples just as we kind of pulled through this. So it will impact the fourth quarter, but we anticipate heading into 2020, we'll be fine.","Now, the last one around free cash flow, yes, we called out 80% not coming off that I would say, if you look at the fourth quarter there's really two areas that we've got a lot of focus on. One is it's our highest sales quarter, so inventory does normally deplete through the quarter here. And we fully expect that as well.","We've also done a lot of work around demand planning to make that better. And then receivables, receivables needs a lot of focus as I mentioned earlier, it is not a turn of the switch here, but we've got a lot of good actions in place, both from a billing process perspective, additional resources, calling on customers, engaging our commercial teams. So, we're still hoping that 80% is still the right answer here, but we are it's a lot to do in the fourth quarter here.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Thank you very much.","Jamey Mock","Thanks Doug","Operator","And your next question is coming from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe for Prahlad just on the amazing acquisition, can you talk about what technologies they have that you didn't already have in the Perkin portfolio? And what's proprietary about any of the technology, if anything, and when they're, what timeline do you have to perhaps take some of those outside of China for the export market?","Prahlad Singh","Yes, good question Brandon. I think from a technology perspective more than the uniqueness in the technology that they provide what was important for us that they had the regulatory approvals and they already had the products in the marketplace. So it was not that there was significantly, a unique technology or differentiated, it was the ability to have a broad product portfolio that they had taken through the regulatory approvals and it was entrenched in the marketplace.","I think the more important fact was the second point that you pointed out, Brandon, the ability for us now to take this product portfolio and combine it with our existing product assets of food assets from [indiscernible] Delta and the Perten acquisitions allows us to present a more comprehensive workflow solutions to our customers, not just in China but also in other markets.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks, then a two part question for Jamey. The corporate expense stepped down quite a bit to about 13 million in the third quarter, is that a good run rate to kind of assume going forward. And then could you give us the impact of FX on the gross and operating margin lines in the period? Thanks.","Jamey Mock","Yes, I mean I think in general our overall cost bases are pretty similar. Cost base we expect moving forward into the fourth quarter. I mentioned there's a little bit of timing. So I don't know the exact split off the top of my head between corporate or the divisions, but we had a little bit of timing in R&D, which probably shouldn't hit the corporate milestone, a little bit of extra marketing expense that launched. So there's probably a slight uptick there in the fourth quarter. Maybe some of that comes through the corporate.","And with regards to that foreign exchange, I think it was 20 basis points on the gross margin line in the quarter, which flowed through to the same amount on the operating margin line as well.","Brandon Couillard","Great, thanks.","Jamey Mock","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Kumar","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Rob, congrats on your career.. It's coincidental that this is my first call and it happens to be your last and Prahlad maybe this is going to be a journey for us. This being your I guess first call coming in as the inbound CEO.","So maybe I'll start with the 2020 outlook questions. So, if the base business here, we're looking at doing mid-singles is it right to thing that the key to get to high-singles for next year's Vanadis in the food business and the cannabis side? And between those two drivers, if I'm on the right track is there one versus the other, which is going to be a more significant driver from a 2020 perspective. And for 2020, should we be assuming some of these applied markets or macro any of those end-markets maybe improving or should they be stable where they are right now?","Prahlad Singh","So, Vijay I look forward hopefully to a long journey together. But I think, the answer to your question without specific guidance is that the resilience now as we have realigned our portfolio is that there is not one growth driver. There are about seven growth accelerators that we have, but we are not now becoming dependent on any one thing clicking. It's Vanadis, EUROIMMUN, our enterprise business, genomics, cannabis, we've got several growth levers that gives us the level of confidence that we \u2013 those will continue to act as growth accelerators for us.","Vijay Kumar","Gotcha. And then maybe one on the balance sheet, inventories seems like it's ticked-up and maybe up, this is not some of this as timing issues given the acquisitions. Maybe comment on inventories.","Jamey Mock","Yes. So you're right, some of that is M&A related, but I think year-to-date it's about a $45 million cash flow usage. I think. And a lot of that is seasonal. So if you look at the last few years, it's similar where we build in the first half and kind of get ready for a larger second half. So a large part of that is seasonable. Some of that is choice, I mentioned that, we've invested in working capital to improve our customer experience. So Vijay, on prior calls I've talked about our distribution center strategy, which we think is going well. And I think, as we turn into 2020, that's something that hopefully we can start to depress the level of finished goods that we have on hand. But some of that's the choice in terms of how the fill rate and how quickly we service our customers and but overall that number that you're seeing year-to-date should come down substantially in the fourth quarter.","Vijay Kumar","Gotcha. Thanks guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS. Please go ahead.","Dan Brennan","Great. Thank you. Rob, congrats, it's been great spending time with you working with you through the years.","Rob Friel","Thanks Dan, appreciate it.","Dan Brennan","Yes. So maybe Prahlad just maybe an early question, I know it's, first quarter in here or really first call. I am just interested in any early insight about the type of different perspectives that you might bring to the CEO role.","Prahlad Singh","I think the, I mean I would say rather than say different, I would say you would probably look on building on what Rob has done. And there are two areas I think in, if you were to look at this from a differentiation perspective, is the focus on bringing the organization together. Bringing the commercial alignment, which has already happened now gives us more wherewithal to push our workflow solutions across end markets, leveraging a combined commercial organization.","So I think that's a big, I would say a differentiation that we are implementing in and which has been completed now. And the second aspect I would say is as we look forward is a lot more focused on technology and continue to build on innovation. I would say those are the two areas where you probably will see some differentiation.","Dan Brennan","Great. Thank you for that. So maybe, I don't know Jamey, I guess just on DAS, I know, it's come up a few times, but just on the applied weakness, I guess what gives you the confidence that you captured this in the trend with the new guide and anything we should look at to help us assess kind of, when maybe some of this weakness will turn, whether it's PMIs or any end market indicators you can help us with?","Jamey Mock","I think the, I mean I think what we're guiding here is pretty similar to those, the last three quarters really it's been 5% every quarter. I think applied markets in general has been flattish for the entire year and so we aren't embedding really at this point any additional uptick on the DAS side. I think it kind of be more of the same in the fourth quarter here, really it is the way to answer that.","Dan Brennan","Great. And then maybe final one just on the deal, on the Meizheng deal, I guess. I apologize if I missed this, but was this a competitive deal, any color how long you've known the company for? See I think you mentioned 25% growth in the prepared remarks back to 09. But how should we think about, what's a reasonable level of growth going forward?","And then the final one is I think post the deal now your China exposure is close to maybe 25% or so, at a time when the countries, the relations are showering a bit and the country seems to be getting more inward looking. So I guess, how do you think about from a control perspective, just having such a big portion of your business over there? Like any changes or additions you need to make sure you're staying on top of things over there. Thank you.","Prahlad Singh","Yes, so maybe I'll talk about the deal piece first. Again, it is very similar to the ones that, and I think I mentioned it earlier, very similar to what we have done with Cisbio on EUROIMMUN is, it was not competitive. In fact the principal was not looking at divesting the company, but we worked with him for about 18 months to 24 months and convinced him that partnership with us is probably the best interest for him and for his business. So that's to that.","In terms of China per se sorry, going back to the growth aspects, we expect this to continue to grow at a healthy pace off about 20% plus over the next few years because it's really got a unique product portfolio, lot more focused on consumables and that gives us, the confidence that will continue to have traction.","On the third aspect around China and, the noise around it, look, I feel, and then we feel very confident that, this is essentially, eventually when the noise slows down, things are going to go back to being normal. From our perspective again, we have not seen any discernible change in our business there. There might be one or two noises here or there, but there is no discernible change.","Our strategy in China is in China for China and that has worked well for us over the past decade, with the SYM-BIO and Haoyuan acquisition and we see it to be no different for Meizheng.","Dan Brennan","Great.","Jamey Mock","So the Meizheng business is $30 million in revenue, so that should increase it by about 1% and we're right around now about 20%.","Dan Brennan","Excellent. Okay. Thanks Jamie. Appreciate it.","Operator","And our final question from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray, please go ahead. ","Bill Quirk","Great, thanks. Good afternoon, Rob obviously the best of luck to you in the future and congratulations to Prahlad.","Rob Friel","Thank you.","Bill Quirk","So I guess a couple of questions. First off with respect to the, I think the couple of comments Jamey has made about turning down business on the diagnostic lab side of things, can you just give us a little comfort that as you consolidate into Pittsburgh help us think about any sort of capacity expansion that you'll have there, such that you're not turning down volume? And if so, when is that? And then I'd have follow-up for that. Thanks.","Prahlad Singh","Yes, maybe I can take that one Bill. As we look at, as we look in our, I mean, just talking more specifically, we had two or three NOVA six, which were in Branford. Just getting them packed up, moving them, revalidating them and getting them up and running. It's the process more than anything else. From a funnel perspective, the issue here is not about having a, making sure that we have a strong funnel.","The issue here is to just getting those NOVA six back in installing them, validating them and getting them up and running. From a capacity perspective, I don't think that, from a 2020 till 2021, we are going to have an issue that from off capacity utilization. And you know, Bill, as a we do the Vanadis tour in Pittsburgh, you will have an opportunity to see the infrastructure and lab there yourself.","Bill Quirk","Okay, perfect. Now, I appreciate the clarification. And then I guess just staying in diagnostics, can you remind us where we are on a EUROIMMUN FDA approvals? In other words, kind of what percent of the portfolio at this point is through FDA and if you know, we're not all the way there. Again, maybe you can give us a roadmap in terms of when your organization has effectively an equivalent portfolio in the U.S. to what they have in Europe. Thank you.","Prahlad Singh","Well, I think it'll probably take a couple of years before it has the same level of approvals in the U.S. that it has from C-Mark perspective. But at this point, we initially if you recall post the close when new approvals would come through, we would send out a trade release, but now these happen every, a couple every quarter or three or four every six months. So we have stopped doing that? And we've essentially stopped tracking and the business there is a small base. It's growing, it's doubling every year. And we continue to see it as a, one of the fastest growing markets for EUROIMMUN. And I don't think that's going to slow down in the near future.","Bill Quirk","Got it. Thank you very much.","Prahlad Singh","Yes.","Operator","And we've reached the top of the hour. I will now hand the call back to Rob Friel for closing remarks.","Rob Friel","Great. Well first of all, thanks everyone for your questions and continued interest in PerkinElmer. It's been a genuine privilege to lead the company over the last 12 years and I'm proud of what we've achieved, but proud of still the people who carry our mission forward in the years to come. As I mentioned before, I think the Company is very well positioned from a financial perspective, but also to provide important solutions that help create healthier families and improve the health and longevity for people around the world. So I truly believe the best days are ahead for PerkinElmer, and I look forward to celebrating the ongoing success. Good night and have a great evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Tommy Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Tommy Thomas - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Thank you, Belinda. Good afternoon and welcome to the PerkinElmer first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","If you have not received a copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com. Please note that this call is being webcast live and being archived on our website until May 18, 2017.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future even if our estimates change.

To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during this call that are not reconciled to GAAP in that attachment, we will provide reconciliations promptly.","I'm now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel. Rob.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on PerkinElmer's strong start to the year in which we delivered a solid financial performance and made good progress on accelerating our long-term profitable growth. Through the first three months of this year, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making to further differentiate our capabilities by introducing innovative new products while also improving how we provide a better and more complete customer experience.","Andy will cover our financial performance in detail. But at a high level, we exceeded our revenue and profitability expectations as organic revenue grew by 4% during the first quarter and adjusted earnings per share increased 10% to $0.55.","As you recall, at the end of the third quarter of last year, we announced the realignment of the company into our two business segments of Diagnostics and Discovery & Analytical Solutions or DAS. The intention was to better position PerkinElmer to more effectively serve and innovate for our customers.","Now, six months into the reorganization, we are pleased with the number of improvements we've made from a leadership, process and capability standpoint. R&D teams are coming together to drive more targeted and collaborative innovation. And the new united, unified front-end sales and service teams are actively selling complete solutions across the portfolio to holistically meet customer needs, an important differentiator for PerkinElmer.","Specifically in the Diagnostics business, we're working to increase our leadership positions in the key growth areas of reproductive health, infectious disease and oncology. During the first quarter, we launched two new products to facilitate targeted sequencing and detection of genetic variance to aid in oncology and genomics research.","In particular, using Amplicon Studio, we continue to release new sequencing panels for our customers on a catalog and customer basis \u2013 and custom basis. And our new NEXTflex control system helps detect contamination as well as human and sequencing process errors. We also announced a relationship with 10x Genomics to combine our high throughput automation platform to create a compelling workflow for long-range structural cellular information.","In the area of infectious disease testing, we closed our acquisition of Tulip Diagnostics in India at the start of the year and the integration is well underway. Tulip brings a strong product portfolio, channel access and broad footprint that will help accelerate PerkinElmer's growth in this important market. In China, we continue to expand our infectious disease menu. And during the first quarter, we introduced a new assay for hepatitis B surface antigen and a PCR-based hepatitis C assay kit.","Within reproductive health, we expanded newborn screening programs in the first quarter particularly in emerging markets. In China, greater penetration of mass spec and the increasing adoption of our automated GSP screening solution is enabling an expansion of the menu of tests administered to newborns.","In India, where newborn screening occurs less than 5% of the time, we continue to make progress on expanding pilot programs. In addition, we are seeing strong interest from private sector commercial diagnostic labs in offering our screening technology, potentially accelerating our penetration of this significant opportunity.","Additionally, we continue to be excited about our Vanadis Smart NIPT technology currently in development. The program reached key milestones in the first quarter as we have now automated an assay that very accurately measures trisomy 13, 18 and 21.","We remain on track to introduce instrumentation to beta customers in the second half of this year with CE-IVD approval expected in the first half of 2018. To reiterate, this new offering will allow maternal fetal health labs to use a high throughput approach with lower labor requirements, enabling millions of pregnant women access to affordable, non-invasive prenatal screening.","Another potential growth driver to our reproductive health business is a recent Phase I clinical trial conducted by Duke University evaluating the use of a baby's own cord blood stem cells to treat autism spectrum disorder. We're proud that ViaCord, our cord blood and cord tissue preservation business, provided nearly one half of the banked cord blood units used by the families participating in this important study. We're optimistic that the positive results of this trial will expand the potential uses of family cord banking by highlighting the opportunities for its use in regenerative medicine including autism.","In the DAS business, we are optimizing our commercial, operational and R&D capabilities to pivot the business to deliver higher growth and better weather varied economic conditions. For this year, the key priorities are launching several exciting new products in our focus areas of growth and better leveraging our 1,700 service engineers and informatics capabilities to strengthen our position as a strategic partner for our customers.","Regarding new products, during the first quarter, we introduced the NexION 2000 ICP-MS. Capable of handling any sample matrix, the NexION 2000 can be configured to provide results for many critical applications including analysis of trace elements in environmental and food samples or testing for elemental contaminants in pharmaceutical products.","The NexION is also opening up new products such as fast, accurate nanoparticle characterization and even single-cell applications. The NexION 2000 allows scientists to study the cellular uptake of heteroatom-containing drugs, thereby better understanding their efficacy in vivo.","During the quarter, we also introduced the Vectra Polaris, part of our Phenoptics workflow solution for quantitative pathology. This new tissue imaging system enables researchers to gain a deeper level of understanding of potential cancer immunotherapies.","Also during the quarter, we continued to experience strong demand for several of our products introduced in the back half of last year including our new QSight triple quad mass spec as well as the Operetta CLS. In addition to driving our organic growth rate, these four recently introduced products expand our addressable markets by several hundred million dollars in attractive growth areas.","Over the last several quarters we have been investing significant energy and resources in improving our processes and capabilities regarding new product development and commercialization. Our progress over the last two quarters is encouraging and we remain confident in our goal of adding $50 million of incremental revenue this year from new product introductions.","Our DAS service business, which is now unified under the OneSource brand, is approaching $600 million in annual revenue and has built a strong market position in managing the laboratory assets of our customers, particularly in the form of biotech space. More recently, we have been using this extensive presence in the labs to better understand the workflow of our customers and look for what we refer to as asset adjacencies.","By changing the dialogue to broader workflows as compared to only instruments, we changed the discussion from one about asset optimization and cost to one about business outcomes and improved results. Consequently, conversations with customers become more strategic, which both expands the market potential and the opportunity to provide more value-added services.","From an organic perspective, we see significant opportunity to increase growth through focused innovation and by enhancing the customer experience. Looking at our end markets, conditions are playing out fairly consistent with what we expected when we prepared our plan for this year.","We continue to see strength in all four of our key focus areas comprised of reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics, food and biopharma services. In the first quarter, these areas grew high single digits for us and now represent just under half of our total revenues, up from roughly 40% two years ago. Our core businesses serving the industrial, drug discovery and environmental markets comprise the remainder of revenues in the quarter and saw flat but stabilizing demand.","In addition to organic growth expansion, we are also pursuing several opportunities to better focus our portfolio through selective divestitures as well as acquisitions in our targeted areas of growth. Earlier this week, we closed the sale of our Medical Imaging business, resulting in proceeds of roughly $270 million.","Consistent with our statements made in the beginning of the year, our intention is to deploy this capital to expand our capabilities through acquisitions or to buy back shares. Once we have deployed the capital, we will provide specific details on the use of the funds.","So to summarize our first quarter, I would say we delivered a solid financial performance exceeding our commitments on the top and bottom line. We made good progress on new products and organizational alignment to growth priorities.","Market conditions have been consistent with our planning assumptions with a little less foreign exchange headwind. And we're excited about having a robust pipeline of potential acquisition opportunities. I feel we're in excellent shape and are quite confident we will make real progress this year increasing our long-term growth trajectory.","I would now like to turn the call over to Andy to discuss our quarterly financial results in more detail. Andy?","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, financial summary of our first quarter results as well as details around our guidance for the second quarter.","It was a solid start to the year as reported revenues from continuing operations were $514 million, resulting in organic revenue growth of just over 4%. FX negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 1%. And the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures in the quarter was approximately 50 basis points.","New product introductions within our Discovery & Analytical Solutions business coupled with solid execution helped to drive the revenue beat in the quarter. As Rob mentioned, we are reiterating our expectation for approximately $50 million in incremental revenues from new products for this year.","Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter grew 10% to $0.55 from $0.50 in the comparable period a year ago, a result of higher revenues partially offset by incremental R&D spend in the quarter.","Looking at our business segments and served end markets, Diagnostics organic revenues grew 8% organically in the first quarter with healthy demand in reproductive health, infectious disease and oncology. DAS grew 2% organically with environmental up high single digits, food and pharma biotech up mid single digits, industrial was flat but improving sequentially and academic and government declined low single digits. As we exit the first quarter, we think most of our end markets, as Rob mentioned, are playing out as expected with the academic end market continuing to underperform.","Looking at our geographic results for the first quarter, we experienced high teens organic revenue growth in Asia, low single-digit organic revenue growth in Europe and low single-digit declines in the Americas. In the BRIC regions, organic revenue growth was broad-based with an overall increase of more than 20%.","As to our operating results, first quarter adjusted operating margins from continuing operations of 16.3% came in as expected as we increased R&D spending in the quarter by 50 basis points due to accelerated investments in both Diagnostics and DAS, while adjusted SG&A improved by 100 basis points driven by the success of ongoing indirect spend initiatives.","Adjusted gross margins were down versus the prior year due in part to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures consummated in 2016, which represented a 40 basis point headwind as well as a mix shift in the laboratory services. The headwinds related to the aforementioned acquisitions and divestitures are not expected to continue as they anniversary early in the second quarter.","By segment, adjusted operating margins for DAS were 14.1%, down 100 basis points from the prior year due primarily to incremental investments shifted into the first quarter as well as a very difficult prior year comparison. Adjusted operating margins in our Diagnostics business improved 160 basis points over the same period last year, the result of strong revenue growth and a positive mix of reagents.","For the full year, we believe DAS operating margins will expand 80 to 100 basis points with Diagnostics operating margins expanding more modestly due to investments slated for the balance of the year. Netting it all out, we remain on track to deliver on our full year gross and operating margin expansion commitments.","Looking further into our reporting segments for the first quarter; Diagnostics, which represents approximately 30% of total revenue, had strong results as compared to the same period a year ago. Growth was driven by continued strength within our core reproductive health franchise which grew high single digits organically led by double-digit newborn screening growth. We continue to experience strong revenue growth outside of the U.S. And we believe that the opportunity to further penetrate emerging markets remains promising.","Growth in our infectious disease product offering experienced high single-digit organic revenue growth driven by SYM-BIO and our Chinese clinical lab, which has been operational for a little over a year. Finally, our oncology offering, focused predominantly on NGS workflow, saw mid single-digit revenue growth driven by demand in Europe and Asia.","Switching to our Discovery & Analytical Solutions business, our improved performance was driven by solid execution on our go-to-market applications focused strategy as well as early traction from our new product introductions.","In terms of drivers behind our growth by end market, growth was driven in part by our new ICP-MS offering targeting environmental applications; while pharma biotech strength was driven by another very strong performance from OneSource, which was up mid-teens in the quarter. We remain pleased with the success of the OneSource team and believe that our differentiated service offerings continue to provide unique insights for pharma and biotech customers around the world.","Food revenues grew organically mid single digits in the quarter in spite of a very difficult comparison in the prior year. Organic strength was driven by double-digit growth in Perten. And their results strengthen our belief that nascent secular trends for grain moisture and protein analysis continue to improve.","Industrial revenues were flat with modest order improvement, while academic and government results remained soft. Overall, we feel good about our revenue performance in the first quarter and remain hopeful that recent industrial trends and this week's announcement to fund the NIH will help improve organic revenue growth in the second half of 2017.","In terms of operating margin expansion, as I mentioned, we are confident in our ability to deliver 70 to 90 basis points for the year as lean initiatives continue to ramp and we continue to benefit from low-cost sourcing actions. First quarter net interest and other expense was approximately $11.6 million. And our adjusted tax rate was approximately 17.5% essentially in line with our guidance of 18%.","Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of debt and nearly $290 million of cash. We exited the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 1.7 times.","Turning to cash flow. We had a good start to the year with operating cash flow from continuing operations of $41 million as compared to $26 million in the first quarter of 2016. This performance was due in part to successful working capital initiatives focused on receivables and inventory which contributed to an improvement of 2 and 14 days respectively versus the first quarter of last year. As we look ahead to the balance of 2017 and beyond, we believe that we can continue to more efficiently manage our working capital needs through the expanded use of lean tools.","Looking to the balance of 2017, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver a solid financial performance and see a path to improving organic growth driven by new product introductions and more favorable year-over-year comparisons.","As a result of more favorable foreign exchange headwinds and better revenue growth in Q1, we are raising our reported revenue guidance for the full year 2017 to be in the range of $2.2 billion to $2.22 billion. This continues to represent organic revenue growth of 4%, which now includes $25 million to $30 million in foreign exchange headwinds and approximately $30 million of revenue from Tulip, our recently acquired Indian diagnostics company.","In addition, we are raising our guidance for the full year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations to reflect our Q1 results and updated foreign exchange impact from our previous range of $2.75 to $2.85 to a new range of $2.80 to $2.90, which does not incorporate any impact from future capital deployment.","For the second quarter of 2017, we're forecasting reported revenues to be in the range of $550 million to $555 million, which represents organic revenue growth of approximately 3% to 4% with FX representing a headwind of approximately 2%, which is offset by the impact of our recent acquisitions. As a reminder, Diagnostics in the Asia Pacific region have very difficult Q2 2016 comparisons. We remain cautious but optimistic that the industrial and academic end markets within DAS will pick up in the second half of 2017.","In our second quarter guidance, we're assuming $12.5 million of net interest and other expense and a weighted average share count of approximately 110 million shares. As a result, we expect second quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.66 to $0.68.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Belinda, at this time we would like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Steven Reiman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. This is Steve Reiman on for Tycho. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just first off, so it sounds like you expect DAS organic revenue to improve in the back half of the year. Can you talk about how much of that is dependent on improving end market growth versus new product flow?","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","I think we are not considering any huge step up in end markets, although we were encouraged by the improvement that we saw through the first quarter in industrial end markets. I would say really the majority of that growth is coming from new product introductions. We launched several in the first quarter. There's a number in the second quarter as well. Those will continue to ramp in the year. And we also have an easier comparison in the second half as well, which will obviously be beneficial for the organic revenue growth.","Steven Reiman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then you mentioned that growth in the BRICS was broad-based. So does that imply you're seeing some improving conditions in Brazil and Russia? And could that potentially be a source of upside this year? Thanks.","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","We are. Obviously, last year, both economically and due to the issues with the Zika virus, we did see a significant headwind. Obviously, we have a much lower bar, but we did see growth in the first quarter. And we are expecting growth through the balance of this year, although off of, again, a more modest base.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Rob, I'm not sure if it's difficult to quantify, but any way you can kind of parse out how much of the better organic versus the guide was from better execution and the selling processes that you've mentioned versus end markets? It sounds like it was almost all the former but just want to make sure I'm seeing it right there.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yes, I would say, going back to Andy's comments, we're not seeing a dramatic change in the end markets relative to what we thought sort of in the December-January timeframe. So I would say the improvement, it was largely on the DAS side. It really came from better execution particularly on the service side. We saw very strong service growth in the first quarter. I think the products also benefited from the new products. But I think it was more execution than market.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe, Andy, if I just go back to what you said about the outlook. On the new product side with the ICP-MS platform, not to get too granular there with how you're thinking about the ramp and the contributions. But I'm just kind of curious whether when you gave your outlook for new products, did it contemplate a product launch into some sluggish environmental industrial markets? Or were you kind of thinking implicitly there that there should be some pickup in demand by the end of the year? I know you're highlighting some of the research functions there. But maybe on the industrial side, basically, is there a couple of billion of upside there?","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. I would say that as we were going into the year and we were looking at what we felt we could get from the launch of the new ICP-MS, we were assuming a bit more sluggish industrial market. So I think if we continue to see improvements in industrial, I think we'll see a bit of a pickup. And it's harder to quantify them as they might be (25:01), but it certainly will be a net positive.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I'd like to jump off the comments around the efforts to restructure the commercial organization. It was an important point as you guys framed up the growth in the second half last year that we were going through a transition there. Now that you've seen some of the benefits of those efforts, could you give us a sense just to layer on top of the commentary you've given us so far? What inning do you think that we're in, in terms of the benefit from those changes?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","I would say it's fairly early. As you pointed out, Steve, we're encouraged by the progress we saw in the first quarter. But it's still pretty early. We've got two fairly large organizations coming together. And we had to standardize some processes, even some compensation arrangements and obviously leadership. But I would say the areas where I think we're really seeing some early wins is clearly in the service organization. I alluded to the fact that we saw nice growth there. We're seeing significant benefits from the global account program that we have. So we've got some 12 or so global accounts that are now able to sell sort of all the products of PerkinElmer across the old historical environmental and life science business. So I would say some early wins, some early good indications. But it's fairly early days.","I know you asked the question on the front end. But also I would say the other area we're seeing is on the R&D. Clearly, by consolidating the R&D across the larger DAS organization, we're seeing some benefits there in the pace and commercialization of the new products.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I appreciate all the color there, Rob. I guess just to follow up on that. Taking into consideration the comments on some of the encouraging signs in industrial, the traction and the momentum you have there on the commercial organization and the easy comps in the back half of the year; it's a little tricky to look at a model and say that the full year comes in around 4%. The pattern seems to be shaping up a little bit better than that. Are there any items you might flag for us that should keep us conservative when the trend looks to be a little bit stronger than that 4%? Thanks a bunch.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","I would say, no, I don't know that there's any strong indicators that would suggest that we're concerned other than it's early. I think Andy pointed out that in Q2 we are bumping up against both difficult comps in Asia and APAC as well as Diagnostics. So obviously, that's something that concerns us a little bit in Q2. So I think that the 3% to 4% guidance is prudent. But I think if we continue to see the markets that we've seen through four months and we continue to make the good traction in the new products, I would expect there'd be an opportunity to maybe do better than the 4%.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you. Maybe can you just give us a little bit of color on some of the pharma end markets and sort of what you saw there and maybe cut it by customer type and geography in case you saw anything that was sort of notable? It seems like Asia and China in particular on the pharma side has been a pretty big strength across most of the quarters.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, so we saw pretty good strength in pharma for us. It was sort of mid single. And, of course, when you look at the split of our businesses, we've got a little bit of a headwind with the radioactive. So if you're sort of excluding that out, we were probably in sort of the high single digits. When you look across the sort of geographies, clearly it was APAC that was the significant driver to that. We saw very strong growth in APAC driven largely by China. But we continued to grow both in the Americas and in Europe, but something more in the low single digits. So we're getting much more Asia-driven, much more sort of imaging, our imaging products, our reagent products are really the driver. And, of course, the services I alluded to were the big drivers of our pharma strength. But pretty strong and pretty broad-based.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","And maybe just on the M&A front, you have a lot of capacity here. Obviously, you said that if you can't do anything, you'll do repo. But you did tuck in Tulip. There's a pretty active market we've seen just in general. How would you kind of characterize the pipeline? What are the types of assets or the spectrum of stuff you're sort of thinking about more from a high level perspective would be sort of helpful?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. So as I mentioned, we've got a pretty good pipeline. And we feel fairly confident we'll get some stuff done here in the latter part of 2017. The focus areas are the ones we've identified. So it's going to be diagnostics. It's going to be food. It's going to be pharma services. It's going to be those critical areas where we see both a combination of our core capabilities with strong differentiation as well as the overarching growth prospects of those businesses and markets. So those would be the area of focus.","Historically, we've had a tendency to do smaller bolt-on deals and probably those are the majority of the ones that are in the pipeline. As I've said on a number of occasions, I'd like to expand that. And as much work goes into a $50 million deal as it does to do a $200 million deal. So if we could do something a little larger, that'd be great. So it's in that sort of range from a revenue perspective, right, things that are probably in the tens of millions to maybe a couple that are actually larger than that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Question -","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Good afternoon.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, guys. Just question for you on China newborn. You mentioned in your early prepared comments that penetration of the mass spec option had really picked up. Just curious if you can give us a ballpark in terms of where you are in driving that market, kind of upsell. And if I recall, the economics here are significantly better. So I'm just interested in where that can go over the next, let's say, 24 months.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. So I would say right now if you look at China newborn, we think there's about 90% penetration of screening. But as we've talked about it in the past, generally depending on the part of the country, it's in the two to four disorders. We've seen a fairly good ramp up of mass spec. We think that's probably more in the 20% to 25% penetration now. And, of course, the benefit of mass spec, you get an additional sort of 15 to 20 tests that you can do with the same sample. So that's where we think the penetration is.","On birth rates, it's been sort of low single digits as I think we've talked about in the beginning of the year. We knew we'd come off a very strong 2016. So when Andy talks about the strong growth in newborn, it's really coming from menu expansion and to a large extent it's the expansion of mass spec penetration. And then I also alluded to the fact that we're seeing good uptake of the GSP which is the automated platform. So penetration now at 90%. Birth rates are sort of moderating in the low single digits. It's really coming from menu expansion.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then just a follow-up on capital deployment. You guys have obviously been very proactive in reshaping the portfolio with the Medical Imaging divestiture. And at the same time, you've been pretty disciplined about acquisitions just given how expensive assets are. So if you had to probability weight the likelihood that something maybe bigger than Tulip, something more significant on the earning side comes through in the next, let's say, 6 to 12 months; is that decent possibility, low possibility? Just kind of curious -","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. It's tough to put probabilities on these, right? Because there's a lot of things that can sort of cause problems. But I think we feel pretty good about the probability of getting something done here in the next three to six months.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Co. Your line is now open.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right. Good afternoon, guys, and thank you for taking my questions.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Good afternoon.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","I think I only have two or three quick ones. The first one on \u2013 another follow-up on newborn screening. You mentioned the opportunity in your prepared remarks to expand newborn screening in other emerging markets beyond China. How would you describe the stage of your commercial and broader infrastructure to fully go after that opportunity? The second question is on the academic, government end market. I think you indicated that there was some softness in the quarter. Would you be willing to provide a little more detail on which geographies were weaker than expected?","And my last question is just in the context of guidance. My impression was, coming into the year, that you've acknowledged you're somewhat dependent on the industrial end market improving to get to your guidance. You sounded pretty positive on how industrial was trending during the quarter. But it sounds like maybe you're a little less dependent on industrial improving to actually get to your goals for the year. Is that the right way to think about things? I will stop there and get back in the queue. Thank you.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Okay, great. So as far as commercialization in newborn, I think we're in a very good position here. We've been operating internationally in newborn for a long period of time. We distribute or sell our products in 93 countries. And so when we look at the opportunities, I would say right now in the short term, we talked about India. I think that will be \u2013 it's a significant opportunity, but it'll probably ramp over a number of years. The other ones that we're in fairly active discussions with is Indonesia and Vietnam. And then I think when you get sort of to the 2018 timeframe, we actually think there are some interesting opportunities in Russia. And I think in all of those, I don't think the barrier is going to be our commercial capabilities. So I think as we look at the runway for newborn screening in emerging markets, we feel good about our ability to sort of support that from an infrastructure standpoint.","Having said that, I don't want to sort of ignore the developed markets because I think there are some nice opportunities there as well. We think probably as we get toward the end of this year, early 2018; we'll come out with an LSD assay panel and eventually get that CE-IVD as well. So I think when you look across newborn screening, there's a nice path over the foreseeable future to sort of continue to grow that in the sort of high single digits. The second question was around the academic market, I believe, and what we've seen from a geographic perspective. And we saw actually strength in Europe. The U.S. was down sort of mid to high single digits. And actually, APAC was down a little bit. So that was the geographic split of our academic business. Again, it was largely in Europe. I think there was some episodic sales there that probably drove that to some extent. And maybe Andy wants to comment on some of the specifics.","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Sure. Well, I was just going to talk about the industrial piece because you had indicated that it was a part of our guidance. We going into the year did not expect significant improvement. And I think we're encouraged up to this point given the flat performance in the first quarter. It looks like the order trends are supporting that. And I think the new products that we're going to launch in DAS are going to also be helpful. So I think maybe at this stage, we're a bit more confident in the industrial piece of our guidance. But we remain cautious because it's still fairly early in the year.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. And I think what you may be recalling is when we talked about 2017, I think that we were concerned about \u2013 because industrial has been challenging for us particularly in the back half of the year. But we didn't want it to get any worse, right? So I think if we saw continued deterioration in industrial, that would have been challenging for us, we believe, to continue to get our organic growth rate up to 4%. But to Andy's point, I think we're encouraged by what we see at least through the first quarter of this year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thank you and good afternoon. A couple of questions. First is, I guess, going back to India and the potential there for newborn screening. Is there any way \u2013 and I realize that we've got slightly different call points in different organizations. But to what extent can you guys leverage Tulip and their relationships to try to accelerate your penetration there?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","I think we can. When we announced the acquisition of Tulip, we talked about the fact that while we're excited about the product suite and the current channel that they have, we do think there's an opportunity to leverage Tulip because some of their products, they're actually going into the hospital labs. And so we think there's an opportunity there. The other thing that I alluded to was we're seeing actually some demand coming from the private labs to do newborn screening. So we do think there's an opportunity to sort of leverage that a little bit more. And actually, they are calling on some of the pharma customers as well. And so we think there's a potential to leverage it actually on the DAS side.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Interesting. And then secondly just on the restructuring. You had mentioned that you're continuing to look at some selected divestitures. In baseball parlance, Rob, can you give us a sense as to what inning we're in here in the overall strategic realignment?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","I would say probably \u2013 it's still fairly early from the standpoint of significant divestitures. And I think what we (39:30) said for 2017, I do not anticipate seeing anything of the size of Medical Imaging. I think what we're looking at right now is sort of maybe some relatively small product lines. So I think to see more significant divestitures would require us to be more successful on the acquisition side.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from Janney. Your line is now open.","William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hey, guys. This is actually Bill on for Paul. How are you doing?","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Good.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Good. How are you?","William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit about your oncology segment and the NGS workflow. Illumina announced that they were getting out of that segment. So maybe just opportunities to capture market and just your positioning within that market.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So as we've talked about it in the past, our really strategy around here is sort of encircle the box, if you will, or encircle the sequencer. And we think we've built a nice capability in and around sort of sample preparation, automation, library preparation and those types of steps that are required. And in particular with the addition of Bioo Scientific, I think it brought us some really strong capabilities there. So I think that what we're really trying to focus now is to take those capabilities that we have and target those after very specific applications and looking to extend our workflow capabilities so that we can, basically from sample to sequencer, have a very efficient workflow. And so potentially there's an opportunity with Illumina sort of realigning their priorities to continue to take share there.","William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Got it. And then maybe just more holistically on the Diagnostics segment. That business is running at around a 30% operating margin. Can you maybe just talk about the maturity of that portfolio and how you guys think about maintaining a really high margin as opposed to investing in some of these newer products and categories that are a focus for you guys? Thanks. Have a good one.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","I think it's a constant balance between making sure that we are investing at the appropriate level but then also driving the growth and the efficiencies in our operating processes to make sure that we're continuing to get better. I think one of the benefits of the Diagnostics business is it has a very high percentage of reagents. So some 90%-plus of the revenue now is coming from reagents. So you get significant incremental flow-through when you grow. So as long as we can continue to grow at high single digits and get good flow-through from the profitability, I think it still allows us to do a fair amount of investing into R&D or building our capabilities from a distribution perspective.","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. I don't see Diagnostics anywhere near operating margin maturity. And as Rob mentioned, I think there's fairly significant incrementals on the higher volume. We are cognizant of the fact that we got to continue to invest. And that's why in my prepared remarks we talked about operating margins growing at a slightly lower pace than DAS because of those investments. But I think we think long term, there's still operating margin expansion opportunities in that segment.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Good afternoon -","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Rob, I was wondering could you provide some additional color on trends in the U.S. market? And then what you're seeing here in terms of birth rate?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So when you say U.S. market, are you talking about sort of globally all our products or just specific to newborn?","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Both. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks a low single-digit decline in the Americas. Is that right?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yes, that's right.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then within that is \u2013 so maybe just U.S. in aggregate and then birth rate specifically.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. So if you look at birth rates, our data would suggest that birth rates in the U.S. are up about 1.5% when you look at first quarter of 2016 versus first quarter of 2017. So a slight increase in birth rates. If you looked at our newborn or reproductive health business, it was down slightly year-over-year. I think the biggest driver of that was a very difficult comp. There was very strong growth in the first quarter of 2016. So we still think if you look at the full year, we'll grow in the U.S. probably mid to high single digits.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then I was just wondering if you could give us an update in terms of blood screening and where you thought we were in terms of the penetration within China and the growth for that business too. Thanks.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So we saw very strong growth in that business in 2016, if you recall, as we placed the instruments out into the various testing labs. Our expectation is for 2017, that's going to moderate as it goes against some very difficult comps. So what we're seeing in Haoyuan or the blood screening business in China is lower growth. And actually, for first quarter, it was actually down a little bit, but higher margins. Because what we're selling now is basically reagents. And so I would say at this point, you're not going to see the significant instrument placements that we saw in 2015-2016. And you'll see a more normalized growth, which we still think could be significant as the Chinese ramp up more blood screening. But we are, for 2017, psyching up against very strong growth as we're placing those instruments out into the lab. Having said that, our Diagnostics business grew north of 20% in China.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Good afternoon.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So a couple of questions. So first off, you mentioned something about the Vanadis assay. Could you give us some thoughts on how you're thinking about pricing that assay? The first question.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Well, you know what, we haven't, Derik, gone into the pricing yet. I think we're going to wait until we get closer to launching it into the marketplace. So we're not really discussing pricing right now. I think one of the things that we've talked about though is the goal is to try and be competitive both from a workflow perspective and a price with biochemical screening.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, fair enough. Remind me what the margins are in the OneSource business.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Well, OneSource now we are sort of rebranding as our entire service business now. So when we talk about OneSource \u2013 I talked about it in my remarks \u2013 it's $600 million large service business. So our service margins are a little bit higher than the corporate average.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, okay. That's what I thought. Forgive me if I missed it, but did you say anything about what you were thinking about your 3% to 4% organic revenue growth guides, what's \u2013 if that's embedded for the segment organic revenue growth? What's your embedded expectation again?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. I don't know that Andy talked to it, but I think you're going to see closer rates between DAS and Diagnostics. And one of the reasons is so they will be closer alike than \u2013 for example, this quarter was sort of 8% and 2%. And the reason for that is, I think, that Diagnostics grew, Andy, what, 12% last year or something?","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So they've got a tough comp in Q2. So I think you'll see very similar growth rate is at least what we're forecasting between DX and DAS in Q2.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte from Robert & Baird (sic) [Robert W. Baird]. Your line is now open.","Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, you guys. This is actually Emily on for Catherine. Just want to touch on first \u2013 so after divesting Medical Imaging, can you break out your new exposure by end market by pharma, academic, diagnostics, industrial, applied? I know previously you had said a decent amount of your academics exposure was in Medical Imaging. So just trying to true-up what the new model looks like.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. And I'll start and then Andy can just \u2013 so think of diagnostics and pharma biotech as sort of equal at around 30%. Then you've got sort of academic and government at sort of 10% and industrial on that range as well. Maybe the way to think about it is industrial, academic, food and environmental safety are all roughly around 10%. Makes it pretty easy.","Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, perfect. Yeah, it does. And then I don't really recall if you said this earlier on your call, but could you walk us through what's embedded in your guidance assumptions for growth rates by end market for the year?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","For the year, for 2017?","Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Hold on a second. So I think we're looking at pharma and biotech sort of mid single. We have academic and industrial sort of flattish. Environmental similarly sort of mid single and then food high single. So that would make up the sort of DAS split. And then within Diagnostics, I think we talked about it. I think it was 7% for the year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald","Hi. Good morning or good afternoon. In your prepared remarks you talked about the automated GSP adoption in China as enabling the menu expansion. Where are you today for the number of tests on average that are being tested in China? And how does that vary across sort of the larger hospitals or the coastal cities versus other parts of the country?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So I had mentioned a little bit before that 90% penetration in China right now. Think of that as about 70% of those are screening for two to four disorders and about 20% to 25% is doing the mass spec and the GSP, either\/or. And that's going to take you up closer to like low 20s. So we've got about a fifth of the babies being screened in the sort of low 20s and the remainder in low single digits. And the split is largely going to be sort of east coast-west coast. So largely on the east coast is where you're going to see the higher screening. And as you got out more into the western part of China, you're going to see the lower number of tests.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. And could you update us on where you are in India? I think previously you'd indicated that you had one or two regions that had adopted and a bunch of other that were in pilot programs.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. So India is still relatively slow ramp-up. I would say less than 5% of newborns are being screened in India. And I would say the uptake is \u2013 as far as sort of official programs, it's still at the sort of two to three stage. There's a number of ones that are in pilot programs. But a lot of these pilots, rather than being done statewide, have a tendency to be in institutions. So they may be in universities; they may be in medical institutions, et cetera. So a lot of the pilots, we'll just have to see how they ramp up. But as I think we've said on a number of occasions, while India is a significant opportunity with 27 million births; I think it's going to be a fairly slow ramp.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Great. Well, first of all, thank you for your questions. And as I said before, I think we're off to a solid start to the year and encouraged by the progress we are making to drive innovation while achieving profitable growth and advancing our mission. So we appreciate your interest in PerkinElmer and wish you a great evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Sir, you may begin.","Tommy Thomas - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Bridget. Good afternoon and welcome to the PerkinElmer fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings conference call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","If you have not received a copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com. Please note that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website until February 18, 2016.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future, even if our estimates change.

Rob?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today.","I'm pleased to report that PerkinElmer delivered a solid performance in the fourth quarter, wrapping up a particularly successful year, one in which we delivered significant value for both our customers and shareholders.","Looking at the fourth quarter specifically, we grew organic revenue by 3% and, on a constant currency basis, grew revenue by 5% and adjusted earnings per share by 11%. We also achieved strong operating cash flow of $126 million, which represented growth of over 30% over the fourth quarter of 2014.","For the full year, we grew organic revenue by 4% and, on a constant currency basis, grew revenue by 7%, expanded adjusted operating margins by 50 basis points, and increased adjusted earnings per share by 13% to $2.55. All these financial metrics met or exceeded the goals we established in January last year, despite a more challenging economic environment than anticipated.","In addition to our strong financial performance, we also achieved excellent progress against our 2015 strategic priorities, addressed critical customer needs throughout our end markets, and expanded our capabilities technically, organizationally, and geographically. Moreover, our increased emphasis on innovation is now recognized throughout the industry and has resulted in a number of impressive awards.","For example, our Phenoptics platform for quantitative pathology was named one of the top 10 innovations of 2015 by The Scientist magazine. And our NexION 350 ICP mass spec was chosen as the best new spectrometer by SelectScience at last year's Pittsburgh Conference.","As we enter 2016, I'm excited about the opportunities I see to advance our mission and profitably grow the company. While we expect challenging global economic conditions to continue, our hard work up to this point has positioned us well to both invest in several compelling growth opportunities and, at the same time, deliver consistently attractive financial results.","Specifically, rapidly changing technologies and analytics are playing a more pivotal role in healthcare and science than ever before. Growing populations are demanding better access to expanded healthcare offerings and safer food, while regulatory changes are focusing on the health of our families and the environment.","The strategic priorities we have set for 2016 support the objective of improving our financial, organizational, and scientific capabilities, enabling us to make an even more profound difference around the world. For this year, the majority of our efforts will be focused on three areas. First, investing where we believe we have the most significant opportunities to increase, maintain, or capture leading share positions.","Second, we are concentrating and expanding resources to accelerate our current momentum in driving innovation. While some of our competitors compete based on scale and scope, we are directing our efforts towards serving high-growth markets with differentiated capabilities, which we believe will in turn create greater customer value.","A large part of what differentiates PerkinElmer is our ability to offer novel solutions that leverage the combined power of our technical capabilities and deep application knowledge. This year, we are increasing our efforts to more effectively collaborate with our customers and thereby enhance their scientists' discoveries or, in some cases, jointly enable breakthrough technologies.","Third, we will continue to drive operational effectiveness globally by implementing a multi-faceted approach aimed at improving processes, simplifying our supply chain, improving quality, and driving efficiencies. This approach, combined with an imperative to continually enhance the organization's talents and skills, will both advance our competitiveness and improve profitability.","Before Andy provides more color around our financial results and 2016 guidance, I would like to discuss the key strategic areas of focus and the investments we are making to support our future growth.","With a broad set of offerings, it's important to differentiate our investments and focus on the programs that we believe will best advance our mission and provide the greatest opportunity for healthy financial returns. For 2016, these areas of investment include reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics, food quality and safety, and laboratory services. I'd like to spend a few minutes on each of these four areas.","Our first area of focus is reproductive health. Worldwide today there are over 130 million babies born every year. Sadly, the majority of these newborns are never screened for serious but treatable metabolic disorders. As a result of the lack of testing, hundreds of thousands of newborns annually are afflicted by life-altering conditions that, in some cases, lead to a premature death. We believe this presents a significant opportunity for PerkinElmer to make a difference. And we are investing to expand who we test, how we test, and for what disorders we test.","For example, many specialty and top pharmaceutical companies are increasing their focus on developing therapeutics for rare, early childhood diseases. As more treatment options become available for these rare diseases, we are developing this critical screen test needed to implement them.","Many times these tests are developed in partnership with these pharmaceutical companies, enabling early disease detection and ultimately providing more children with the opportunity for a healthy start to life. We are particularly excited about the development work currently underway for assays that detect spinal muscular atrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and lysosomal storage and immunodeficiency disorders.","Also within reproductive health, we are investing in prenatal testing. We recently announced our acquisition of Vanadis Diagnostics, which is developing a novel NIPT platform based on digital analysis of cell-free DNA. After a period of investment, we will be able to offer our customers a next-generation solution that gives wider access for NIPT for expecting mothers, with a cost-effective simplified workflow that many biochemistry laboratories can easily run.","In emerging market diagnostics, we see significant opportunities to leverage our channel and capabilities by expanding our infectious disease testing portfolio. We're developing new tests, including multiplex bead-based genotyping assays for respiratory panel, hepatitis B and C, and HPV, as well as an HIV quantitative viral load PCR assay. We're also continuing to expand our Haoyuan blood screening business in China and leveraging our medical lab in Suzhou to expand its testing menu.","Turning to the rapidly growing food safety segment, we are prioritizing our efforts to strengthen our franchise through the success of our Perten acquisition and by expanding our detection capabilities to better help customers analyze food quality and authenticity.","This year, we will continue to invest in our detection solutions and leverage our extensive application knowledge and proprietary library of sample calibrations. These investments will bolster our position as the market leader in protein and moisture analysis, enabling robust quality of valuation to be performed across each step in the supply chain of food products.","Recently, we were able to transform our benchtop infrared technology used to determine food moisture levels and batch analysis and deploy it as an online continuous analyzer to measure quality in the production of final products. We're also working with a large number of major global food producers to ensure that food supply is genuine, unadulterated, and free of residues and other contaminants. We believe this capability will increasingly become more important as governmental regulation and public concerns grow.","Finally, in the laboratory services, we will continue to invest in our OneSource and informatics capabilities, as pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers seek to outsource their laboratory services to drive efficiencies and externally collaborate on the scientific research through advance open innovation.","Specifically, we will invest in our leading electronic notebook platform to facilitate collaborative research and in high-value scientific applications such as our TIBCO Spotfire software for harnessing big data. In addition, we will expand our clinical analytics capabilities and develop new solutions for translational research and personalized medicine by leveraging our Signals platform, which integrates disparate data sets into a single platform for data discovery.","On the service side, we will continue to develop our integrated service capabilities which can effectively align lab operations to improve scientific outcomes. Through these investments, we look to expand our work with existing and new pharmaceutical and biotech customers, as well as establish our service in additional end markets.","To fund these potential significant opportunities, our 2016 operating plan incorporates an increase in R&D, while also generating healthy margin and EPS growth. While Andy will discuss our 2016 financial outlook in more detail, we are forecasting overall end market conditions to be similar to what we experienced in the latter part of last year, with some minor puts and takes.","Consequently, we are guiding adjusted earnings per share of $2.65 to $2.75, which represents constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% at the midpoint, based on corresponding organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%. Despite our plan to increase R&D by about 10% or 40 basis points of revenue, we are forecasting constant currency adjusted operating margin expansion of 50 basis points.","I will now turn the call over to Andy to discuss our financial results and operating plan in greater detail.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our fourth quarter and full-year results, as well as details around our 2016 first quarter and full-year guidance.","Given that foreign exchange has had a material impact on our financial results throughout 2015, I will once again provide much of my commentary on a constant currency basis in order to better portray our year-over-year results.","For the fourth quarter and full year of 2015, foreign exchange negatively impacted revenues by $32 million and $142 million respectively and negatively impacted fourth quarter and full-year adjusted earnings per share by $0.08 and $0.25 respectively, versus the comparable period a year ago.","For the fourth quarter, adjusted revenues were approximately $608 million, which represents cost of currency revenue growth of 5%, organic revenue growth of 3%, with FX negatively impacting revenue growth by 5%.","Adjusted earnings per share was $0.86, up 11% on a constant currency basis from $0.85 in the comparable period a year ago. Please note, since we provided fourth quarter guidance in October, foreign exchange further impacted fourth quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share by approximately $5 million and $0.02 per share respectively.","The trends we saw through the first three quarters of 2015 continued through the fourth quarter. Looking at our end markets, we continue to see strength in pharma and biotech, stable academic and government spending, healthy demand in diagnostics and food testing, and stable but somewhat slower growth in our environmental, safety and industrial markets.","Looking at our geographic results for the fourth quarter, we experienced high-single-digit organic revenue growth in Asia, while the Americas grew low-single-digits and Europe was essentially flat due to very difficult prior period comparisons, specifically in our research and analytical equipment businesses.","In the BRIC region, fourth quarter organic revenue increased double-digits versus the same period last year, driven by strength in China, partially offset by weakening demand in Brazil and Russia.","Switching to the segments. For the fourth quarter, Environmental Health organic revenue grew approximately 5% with Human Health increasing 2% as compared to same period a year ago. From an end market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 60% of reported revenue for the fourth quarter of 2015, with Diagnostics representing approximately 27% of reported revenue, while Life Sciences Solutions represented approximately 33% of reported revenue.","Fourth quarter 2015 organic revenue growth from our Diagnostics business increased mid-single-digits as compared to the prior period, driven by strength in our prenatal screening and infectious disease franchises. Medical imaging grew low-single-digits in the quarter as demand for our CMOS and our new cassette panel was offset somewhat by weakening demand in radiography and radiation oncology end markets.","Looking at the performance of our Diagnostics business in China, our Haoyuan blood screening business had an excellent quarter, which included a significant number of instrument placements, and we look forward to helping ensure a safe blood supply in China in 2016 and beyond. Overall, our Diagnostics business in China finished the year with broad-based growth and delivered a double-digit growth performance in the quarter.","Organic revenue in our Life Science Solutions business grew low-single-digits in the quarter, driven by strong U.S. sales and continued robust growth in our OneSource multi-vendor services offering, despite a very difficult prior-year comparison.","Geographically, within LSS, Japan continues to be weak and was a major drag on overall organic growth. In contrast to Japan, we were encouraged by the double-digit growth we experienced with our key global pharmaceutical and biotech customers. We've now reached the one-year mark of the combination of our research, informatics, and OneSource businesses, and we believe that we are uniquely well positioned to serve our customers.","Moving to Environmental Health, which represented approximately 40% of reported revenue, revenues grew 5% organically for the fourth quarter of 2015. Our fourth quarter reported results benefited from broad-based demand with particular strength in food, as well as incremental licensing revenues.","We are pleased to report that the Perten business had a very good year with solid organic revenue growth, good margins, and strong cash flow. We successfully achieved our year-one deal model expectations and we look forward to building on this momentum going forward.","As Rob mentioned earlier, we had a strong performance in 2015, and I want to go over the highlights now. For the full year, we reported approximately 7% constant currency revenue growth and 4% organic revenue growth with foreign exchange representing a headwind of approximately 6%.","Full-year adjusted revenue was approximately $2.26 billion, as compared to $2.24 billion in 2014. Full-year adjusted earnings per share was $2.55, up 13% on a constant currency basis from $2.47 in 2014.","Looking at our geographic results for the year, we experienced mid-single-digit organic revenue growth across all major regions. In the BRIC region, full-year 2015 organic revenues increased approximately 6% compared to 2014.","Looking at our emerging market organic revenue growth in total, it was once again up 7% for the full year, which is consistent with our performance over the last several years, a testament to the criticality of our products and solutions that we provide.","As to our operating results, full-year adjusted gross margins were 47.6%, up 20 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by volume leverage, mix, and productivity gains. Full-year adjusted SG&A was 24.4% of adjusted revenue, down 50 basis points on a constant currency basis over the same period a year ago, driven by the success of our indirect spend initiatives.","Full-year research and development spending was higher by approximately 20 basis points as compared to 2014, driven by increased investment in new products. Overall, we were pleased with our operational performance for the full year as we expanded our constant currency adjusted operating margins over 50 basis points.","Our full-year net interest and other expense was essentially flat at $42 million, and our full year adjusted tax rate was just over 19%, better than expected for the year, due essentially to the geographic mix of earnings and to lower tax jurisdictions.","Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the year with approximately $1 billion of debt and nearly $240 million of cash, and we exited the quarter with a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3 times and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.7 times.","Turning to cash flow. I am very pleased to report that we had a very strong performance, growing approximately 30% in the fourth quarter. We experienced robust working capital improvement with strong cash collections and lower inventory requirements. Excluding the $20 million of discretionary pension funding we talked about earlier in the year, operating cash flow for the full-year 2015 was $307 million.","To wrap up 2015, we're pleased with our performance as revenue grew organically 4%, operating margins expanded 50 basis points, and adjusted earnings per share grew 13% on a constant currency basis. Looking ahead to 2016, we continue to believe we're well positioned to deliver another solid financial performance. However, we continue to see the macroeconomic outlook as mixed.","For the full-year 2016, we expect reported revenues to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.32 billion, up 2% to 3%, representing organic revenue growth in a range of 3% to 4%, with foreign exchange representing a headwind of approximately 2%. Full-year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.75, which represents approximately 6% to 8% constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth or 8% at the midpoint.","Implicit in this guidance is constant currency adjusted gross margin expansion of approximately 70 basis points. As Rob mentioned, we are increasing our research and development spending in 2016. This incremental 40 basis points in R&D spend is expected to be partially offset by lower SG&A spend of 20 basis points. As a result, we expect to report full-year 2016 constant currency adjusted operating margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points, while reported adjusted operating margins are expected to expand by approximately 40 basis points.","Our full-year guidance also assumes an adjusted tax rate similar to 2015 or approximately 19.5% and a weighted average share count of approximately 111 million shares, which assumes we deploy approximately half our free cash flow on share repurchases in the year.","For the first quarter of 2016, we're forecasting reported revenues to grow organically about 3% or $530 million to $535 million and first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.51.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you for taking my questions. On Human Health, that was where my model was a little bit off for the quarter. I think the organic growth came in around like 2%. And I was thinking it was going to be in the 3% to 4%. What was the driver of the lower performance in Human Health in the quarter?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think it was fundamentally \u2013 comparisons to Q4 last year, we had very strong growth in Human Health last year in a couple of the areas and I would say that was probably the overlying issue.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. And I think, if you recall last fourth quarter, we talked about some revenue being pulled in, which created this very difficult comp. It was about $5 million. So, that obviously was another piece that we had to compare against in 2015.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, essentially, when you look at the full year, Human Health and Environmental Health both grew about the same. So PerkinElmer was a 4%, Human Health was 4%, and Environmental Health was 4%. So, in any given quarter, there can be some sort of above and beyond either because of comparison purposes or, as Andy talked about, things can move in and out of the quarter. But actually it was fairly consistent when you look at the full year.","Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then the first quarter versus the full-year guidance on the organic growth, I think the first quarter's 3% and then for the full year it's 3% to 4%. Can you comment a little bit about the cadence as you go through the year as you expect a little bit more of a back-half weighted? And then, maybe a little bit about the seasonality around customer order patterns in the first quarter? And is there typically little bit more of conservatism from some of your customers in the first quarter knowing that they can put some orders off into the rest of the year?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think as we think about the cadence of the growth, clearly it'll be a little stronger in the back half. Some of that is just a function of we've got some new products coming out as we saw in 2015. I think, again, we had some large sales in the first quarter of last year that we're sort of cycling up against, particularly in the area of informatics.","And so, I think as we think about it, we'll see it a little bit stronger. I think we're also a little concerned about the economic conditions in the first quarter relative to what we see for the full year.","Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Rob, I actually wanted to jump off on that, the point that you just alluded to, as you referenced macroeconomic conditions in the first quarter. It would be helpful if you could just isolate what you've seen in terms of the macro impact on the outlook and how that's evolved over the last 90 days or so. And then, to the extent you're looking for improvement over the balance of the year, can you give us a little bit more of a view on why it is that you're embedding that in the outlook?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So maybe it'd be helpful to just sort of walk through the end markets a little bit, both from an application perspective and a geographic. But I would say, just specifically with regard to the beginning of the year versus the latter part of the year, I would say it's fundamentally in a couple of areas. I think as we've talked about in the past, medical imaging I think has a little bit of a stronger headwind in the first half of the year. So we think they could be down sort of high-single, maybe low-double-digit. And we believe we'll see that recovered in the back half.","And I think you'll also \u2013 when we think about Japan, Japan I think again we expect to see a little bit more challenging in the early part of the year. And we think that's going to moderate here in the back. One of the reasons is because, again, we get easier comparisons in the back part of the year. So I would say those are the big contributors.","But to just sort of walk through the end markets in particular, I think in the case of the pharma\/biotech market, we saw a good 15%. We grew sort of high-single-digits. We think that continues to be a strong market for us, maybe gets a little bit difficult from a comp, particularly on the OneSource service side. But we've got some new systems coming out in the sort of middle of the latter part of the year. We've got some new liquid handling, some cellular imagers, and some reagent kits that we're excited about. So we see that probably improving in the back half but moderating, but continuing to be a pretty strong market for us.","Academic was sort of low-single for us last year. We think that improves a little bit clearly in the U.S. because of the NIH budget, but continue to see probably flattish in Europe. That probably stays fairly consistent through the year.","I think, in the food market, we've seen good strength there, probably mid- to high-single-digits for 2015. We think that continues. The Perten integration going well. We started to go up against some difficult comps in China because China was particularly strong for us. But we think that probably stays fairly consistent through 2016.","I think the area that we're probably most concerned about is the industrial end market. And for 2015, it was sort of mid-single for us. I think, going into 2016, we think it's probably going to moderate here a little bit. And so I think we're a little concerned, particularly in the first half of the year. And so we're calling that to be sort of more low-single-digits with probably more pressure in the early part of the year and maybe improving here a little bit in the back.","And then finally, on the Diagnostics side, I think we feel pretty good about that. Throughout the year, that was strong for us in 2015 and we think that continues to be strong, whether it's newborn, whether it's our infectious disease in emerging markets or prenatal. We think they all see pretty good strength here going into 2016, probably both in the first half as well as the back half.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then I'll dovetail on that very briefly here. As it relates to China and the hospital environment in China, are you seeing any signs that that has stopped the sort of pace of improvement that we've seen here lately? Or is that continuing to get a little bit better?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I think, for us, we continue to see nice growth in China. Now, some of that may be distorted because of the strong wins we're seeing in the blood screening area that Andy alluded to. We're seeing very nice interim placements there, and so we're quite excited about. So it may have to do with our mix of business, but we continue to forecast a strong growth in China. And of course, on the newborn side, we continue to see nice growth there as well.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Really helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Miroslava Minkova with Stifel. Your line is open.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Let me start with the top-line growth outlook. I appreciate all the commentary on the end markets. However, historically you have started with a slightly higher, more like in a 3% to 5% growth range. And you've talked about accelerating growth towards the mid-single-digit average. Can you maybe sort of give us the puts and takes a little bit? Why 3% to 4% this year? Is it all about the industrial markets? And how much would that be weighing on your overall top line?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think that's probably the majority of the caution, I would say, going into 2016 year as we're \u2013 as I said, industrial for us grew mid-single-digits in 2015 and. as we sort of look at it right now, we're a little concerned about that. So we think that's going to be in the sort of more low-single digits. So I'd say that's probably the largest contributor to it.","I would say also on the margin, I think we've talked about that medical imaging will probably be a little slower than what we've seen historically. So I would say those are the two changes. But as we think about the 5% versus 3% to 4%, we still feel like it's in that sort of 3% to 4% range. So I wouldn't say \u2013 I wouldn't read a significant deceleration into that.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And you gave us a lot of color on the areas where you're investing. You've stepped up R&D investment over the past year and it sounds like you're stepping them up again in 2016. Can you give us your thoughts about should you be sustaining these investments in the context of the current macro environment? And how should we think about your product flow in 2016? Can you sustain this as it has been the last few years? Or should we be seeing a more cautious stand, given where industrial markets in particular are?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would say it's a couple of things. First of all, as I sort of alluded to a little before, we see some great opportunities in some of our end markets, so whether it's in the reproductive health, whether it's in food, whether it's emerging diagnostics or the laboratory services. And we think it would be unfortunate to not invest in those opportunities because we think there'll be potentially significant growth down the road. That's number one.","I think the second thing is we're starting to see I think good insight into the opportunity to expand gross margins. I think it's an area where, if you look over the last couple years, while we've had good operating margin expansion, it's largely come from leveraging of our operating expenses. And as we've done some factory rationalization in shipping in the past, we're now sort of going into the factories themselves and driving Lean initiatives and focusing more on the supply chain. And so I think we're more confident that over the next couple years we'll be able to see improved gross margin and use that to sort of, in some ways, invest more in the businesses.","And I would say the third aspect of it is I think we're trying to be more focused on where we're investing. And I think what you'll see going forward is a more concerted effort to invest in those areas where I think we've got leadership positions and terrific capabilities. And so I think it's a combination of all those things.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Sounds good. And maybe if I could sneak in a final one. The foreign exchange surprise on the bottom line, you called that out, of about $0.02 per share. It seems like at least relative to my motto, that wasn't that big of a difference on top line. Was there something about the mix of currency that happened this quarter? Where was the surprise?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think if you look at relative to when we guided in October until the end of the year, you saw some significant movement on foreign exchange, not only with some of the major currencies, but probably in particular in the emerging markets. So I think when you look at our split of our international, of course we've got a fairly heavy concentration in emerging markets, and if you look at the movement that's occurred in the fourth quarter, it's been much more significant on the emerging market side.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you, guys. And I'll get back in queue.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good afternoon.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Derik.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, a couple of questions. So, looking at the \u2013 if I heard you right, Andy, you said 40% reported operating margin expansion in 2016. So, that's about 18.1%-ish in 2016. So can we talk a little bit about forward operating margin expansion, and that 20% target? I mean, obviously, FX has been a huge hit to the margin target that you laid out back there (35:02). So can you just put this in terms of thinking about the longer-term trajectory, where's this going? Is 20%, 22% still in the cards?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think it is. I think we've made a conscious decision, though, as Rob mentioned, to invest some of that back. Our goal is not to get to 20%, 22% at all cost. So we're investing some of that back this year. But I think, underlying all this is the fundamental growth that I think still supports the 60 basis points to 80 basis points. And I think we're going to derive potentially more upside from that with some things that are going on in our gross margin that Rob just mentioned.","So I think, at this stage, it may not be completely linear, but I think two things. One is we're going to continue to do the things that drive operating margin, whether that be Lean or indirect spend. But I think a lot of these investments that we're making in new products are going to start to convert into revenues that are going to be higher margin as well.","So I think, if you look at it from a three-year or four-year point of view, which is the way we look at it, we still feel very, very good about our ability to hit that 20% to 22% operating margin.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. So I want to talk a little bit about the acquisition you just did, the Vanadis for the NIPT technology. So, a couple of questions on this. First one is, what's going to be the incremental R&D spend to sort of get that to market?","I mean, I know just looking at the white paper that they have out, I mean I know there's a proof of principle. And they've had some clinical trials \u2013 clinical data that's out. But it still actually looks like it's a ways. Like, what's the investment, what's the timeframe before that's going to be ready for prime time?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I would say, if you look at the incremental R&D investment we're talking about this year, probably half of it or so is coming from Vanadis. And we're quite excited about the opportunity here. And the way I would describe it is, I think we understand the screening market probably better than anybody, with our work in newborn and prenatal. And our sense is, it's critical to focus on the workflow.","So, rather than just looking at the detection technology, you've got to look at sample collection all the way to the patient report. And while we feel that NGS is identified with NIPT, it's identified a significant need and opportunity to provide an alternative to invasive screening.","Our concern all along has been that the complexity of NGS, at least how it's done today, is not conducive to sort of large scale population screening. And therefore, we thought, and we've been looking for and continue to look at different technologies in a way that's sort of democratized non-invasive screening. And our sense all along is it's got to be a simpler format, a simpler work flow and one that can be sort of deployed into the labs that are out there today.","As you may know, there's probably 1500 biochemical labs in the world doing clinical tests either through newborn or prenatal. Our sense is probably 100 or less than 10% are actually doing some kind of NGS per clinical testing. So, clearly, we need to define or I think there needs to be a simpler work flow and that's what excites us about Vanadis. It's simple, it's automated. You use basically one instrument. But to your point, it's early and so we need to invest, but we're quite excited about it. And it fits well within our current prenatal capabilities and channel.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No. I mean, certainly, it fits in with your work flow. I mean the readers and microplate reader. Just the question I have on it, I guess, from a technical standpoint and maybe you may need to go with this offline, is that I know it does a \u2013 you take the cell-free DNA fragments and you convert them into circles like that. And I guess it's like what's the efficiency in terms of doing the conversion and the rolling circle like this? And then we can \u2013 this is may be too technical, but I'm just curious to see if it's high enough efficiency to sort of deliver the counts that you need on this.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think our guys have looked at it. And, of course, the other thing, it uses imaging technology with fluorescence, and we understand that well. But to your point, it's early days and we'll continue to invest in it, but we're quite excited about it. And this is a team that's been successful in the past and so we're feeling pretty good about.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. So, first topic is margin expansion. You've guided us to model, I think it's 50 basis points of constant currency operating margin expansion. This is a bit below what I think many were expecting. So, two parts to just trying to get at this topic. One, does this guidance fully capture the margin relief associated with the inventory issues you're working through last year associated with the Waters' LC deal?","And then, secondly, keeping in mind that part of the reason margin isn't higher is that you plan to hide an investment in R&D. You've been talking about your R&D investment leading to new product acceleration at the top line. Really is that being a major driver to revenue growth or revenue acceleration? It's not apparent based on recent results and your guidance that this is happening. So can you just talk about whether you did hit your 2015 new product revenue target of $35 million and what's embedded into 2016 revenue guidance for new products?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay. Doug, this is Andy. Maybe I'll take the first part of the question and Rob will take the second part of the question. Our stated goal is and continues to be we think we can, with mid-single-digit growth, drive operating margin expansion in the 60 basis points to 80 basis points, some cases higher.","We made a conscious decision this year because of a couple of what we think are very promising R&D programs to invest. And so, that is really the headwind to the margins. We're going to continue to try to drive more, but I think we feel like it's prudent to come out with a number that we feel like that we're comfortable with, at least at this point in the year.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And what I would say is, first of all, relative to the NPIs, I think we've talked about that we've exceeded the $35 million that we laid out early in 2015 from the new product. I think it was probably closer to $40 million actually when you look at the results. And I would say, as we go here in early 2016, we think we'll do at least that amount, if not more. So I would say the new products are doing well and we're getting them out into the marketplace.","I think the thing to consider though is, and I've sort of mentioned this in the prepared remarks, is we set some goals together \u2013 put some goals out there in January that talked about 3% to 5% EPS growth margin expansion. And despite some of the challenges from an economic perspective, we met or exceeded all of those.","So I would say the NPIs are doing well, but of course some of the things where some of the other end markets have been a little bit more challenging from a macroeconomic perspective is offsetting the progress we're making on the NPIs.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And one more. The commentary on industrial exposure, I mean I think we're all hearing what's going on in the news and seeing some of the data. But your commentary is a bit more negative than I think what we've heard from others in the group thus far. Your percentage of sales exposure isn't all that different from the diversified tools peers.","So I'm just trying to get at what's driving this for you? And why would this be tougher in Q1 and improve over the year? Sorry to be basic about this, but it's just hard to understand why this would be a temporary cyclical industrial concern. Is it comps? Or is it something else? Thank you.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So maybe I'd sort of clarify. So let me separate. The industrial concern is one of a full-year concern. And as I said, it's as simple as we grew mid-single in 2015 and we think that moderates to low-single. So, that's not necessarily a Q1 issue. The Q1 issue is more tied to medical imaging and some sort of large revenue recognition that we had in informatics in the first quarter. So those two are separate. The industrial one is more of sort of an annual issue.","I don't know if it's unique for us based on our product mix, but we are a little concerned about it. To your point, it's not a huge exposure for us. But on the margin, it could be 30 basis points or 40 basis points of growth there. And then, I think the other one is we're concerned about the comp on pharma. And so, instead of growing high-single-digits as we did in 2015, we probably think that moderates to sort of mid-single.","Those are basically the two things as we look into 2016 versus 2015 that we think are different.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. It's actually Patrick Donnelly in for Tycho. Maybe just looking at the China screening market, can you talk about the impact from moving \u2013 the Year of the Goat last year was a bit of a headwind, moving through Year of the Monkey this year. Maybe just talk through how the birth rates were impacted last year and what kind of tailwind that could lead to screening revs this year?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, if we look at 2015, births in China were down about 10%. So we think it recovers that and maybe goes a little bit more. It's a little hard to parcel that out specifically because you've also got the one-child relaxation. But our sense is you will see births up this year relative to China, and whether that's high-single-digits or low-double-digits, it's probably in that type of range.","Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, staying in China, just on the nucleic acid testing market, there was a delayed implementation there. Can you just talk through where we stand with the tenders and what the impact on 2016 could be from that market?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So we saw a very strong tender activity, particularly in the fourth quarter. And so, to a large extent, while we slowed down early in the year, I would say they sort of more than made up for that with the strong activity in the fourth quarter. And I think as we \u2013 or as Andy mentioned in his comments, we are very pleased with our win rate there. So our expectation is as we sort of get to the latter part of 2016, we'll start to see some of the ramp up in the reagents.","Normally what we've seen historically there's probably a six-month implementation to when they get the instruments put in place and sort of they run some controls and tests and those types of things. So our expectation is we'll see the benefits of the win that we saw in fourth quarter in the latter part of 2016.","Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Are you still thinking that business could ramp to call it $50 million over the next three years?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Yeah.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That's right. Yeah.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We feel good about that.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We're north of $10 million this past year and with these placements in the reagent flow coming through, it'll ramp really quickly.","Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan Groberg with UBS. Your line is open.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Andy, just I wasn't sure I exactly understood your answer. So, for 2017, do you still think you're going to do 20% operating margin?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","2017? No, I didn't \u2013 I actually wouldn't respond to that. We were talking longer term. But I would say, given the investment and depending on where FX is, I think it's still the goal. But I think if FX continues to be a headwind, it's going to be a difficult goal. And again, as I mentioned before, we're not really trying to get to 20% just to get to 20%. We're trying to do it in a fairly logical, methodical way and invest back. And again, we made a conscious decision for 2016 to make those investments.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Sure. I get that. Your target before had been 20% and from your previous answer it wasn't clear to me. So, yeah, we should adjust for FX and maybe some of these investments in terms of what we're thinking about for out margin in 2017.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think that's fair. I mean, if you go back to our 18% guidance, I mean we came in at 17.6% that year and the difference was FX. So, I mean, there are going to be things that impact our ability to get there, but that's still our goal is to stripping that out and get to 20%.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say, John, we're trying to control the things that we can control, and obviously FX is a difficult one to do. I think if you went back and tried to do it on sort of a pro forma basis based on a euro of $1.25 or something when we set this up, my sense is we probably could get to the 20%. But as we sit here at $1.10 for the euro or whatever, I think that's going to be more of a challenge.","The other thing is, when recently in January we came in and rather talked about a 2017 target, we've talked more about a longer-term 2020 target and felt like we could go another 400 basis point to 22%. So I think that's how we're modeling it. As we model that, we had R&D going up the 6% of sales or a 50% increase in R&D, and the way we're offsetting that is we expect 300 basis points of gross margin expansion and about 150 basis points of SG&A.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for the clarification. And then, Rob, PerkinElmer has obviously been on a journey for a while and I think you made a distinct point to say, look, you're not trying to be all things to all people. You want to focus in the four key categories where you think you can be a real leader in your markets.","And I'm just curious, as you've done the analysis and thought about the strengths that you want to have as a company and the leadership positions, how does \u2013 is it about throwing more money in some of these categories? Is it about being smarter in some of those categories? Is it about \u2013 is there more you can do from a business development standpoint, maybe divesting out of certain assets and utilizing those funds to invest more of the M&A to increase your competitive position? I'm just kind of curious internally how you kind of come to the decision to jack to boost the R&D spending?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, first of all, I think it's all the above. I mean, but some we have more control over than others. So, in some of the more attractive areas or areas where we have stronger positions, we'd like to be more active on the business development side or M&A side, but again that's hard to predict. So we'll continue to look there. But, in the meantime, we'll try and control the things we can control. And so some of that is where we see opportunities and we want to be able to do that.","But, as I mentioned before, this is always going to be a balance for us. I mean, we're not \u2013 it's going to be rare in a situation where we would come out and say we're not going to grow margin or EPS at all. But I think we're constantly trying to walk a balance between making sure we're returning cash to the shareholders and expanding operating margins, but at the same time investing in those areas that we think have great long-term prospects.","So it really gets down to focus and prioritization. And so one of the things I was trying to lay out earlier is to say, look, I think you're going to see a much more differentiated and focused investment profile at PerkinElmer going forward. And I think the four areas that I identified are ones that are clearly getting a disproportionate part of the investment. And for the foreseeable future, I think that'll be the case.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","And just one last one on that, a bit of a follow-up. You mentioned, Andy, I think 50% of your cash flow to buybacks. Should we assume \u2013 is there anything in the pipeline that you think could happen from an M&A standpoint? And should we assume that those four categories that you listed is where you'd be most interested from an M&A standpoint as well? Or is there a chance you'd go to a new pillar?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think that's right. I mean, this is half our free cash flow we still have. As I mentioned, we're 1.7% net debt to EBITDA, so we still have some leverage as well. And we think we have a number of things in the pipeline. So I would say it's really no different than any other time we've gone to it in a year.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is open.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","I'm just going to touch quickly on a question that was sort of just asked. But as you think about the sort of transformation of the asset, and it's very clear you're kind of prioritizing growth here and that obviously makes sense given what longer term drives value.","I guess, as you've seen some of the transactions already year-to-date in the market within or around some of the areas that you play, I guess when you think about your ability to execute at least maybe something moderately larger. Because it's been a bit of time since we've seen you do something more than sort of a small tuck-in. Is it always price, is it sort of a debate internally on fit, is it maybe not the right time?","I'm just trying to get a sense for \u2013 again, given just the multitude of stuff that we've seen, I'm not asking you to comment on anything specifically, as you think about it, the various reasons? And then what's likely in your mind changed to allow you to maybe do something a little bit more substantial? Or are we okay with sort of just the small tuck-ins?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I would say, first of all, it starts with strategy and fit, right? I mean I think, when we think about our acquisition pipeline, we set forth our priorities or what our highest priorities are and then we look for the assets that will continue to build our capabilities in those applications or end markets that we think are most attractive and fit best with our strategy. So I think it starts there. Then, of course, if you decide a strategic fit, it then gets the valuation and can we get good financial returns.","And of course, one of the things we're always looking at is the alternative is either to invest back in the company or quite frankly invest in PerkinElmer by buying back stock. So, that's the process that it goes through. But, clearly, it starts with a strong strategic fit and attractive assets.","I mean, as you pointed out, I mean I think going forward, and I think we've said for some time, probably the more likely scenario is we do more sort of bolt-on transactions, and maybe bolt-ons by their nature hopefully get bigger. But as I think, when we look at the opportunity or the alternative to do something larger, either because of fit, strategy or valuations, we don't see much out there quite frankly.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Makes sense, Rob. And maybe I can just sense from the degree of the questions, obviously maybe modest disappointment on sort of the 8% FX neutral growth. I mean, it seems to me in this environment that that's a reasonable outcome given the investments. But I guess, as you think about the go-forward, I'm not asking for specific long-term guidance, but one would think, again to my prior point, the investments you're making should ultimately yield better top line and then hopefully then more margin expansion.","So, I guess, as we think about the next few years, obviously going forward, I mean clearly your goal is to be at a materially higher earnings growth rate, correct? I mean, I guess when you were debating this with the board, was the trade-off, yes, we may be less on currency neutral this year, but the hope is this will yield a better outcome than where we were maybe prior to these investments going forward?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think, absolutely. I mean I think the goal is that we make some investments this year, but that puts us in a stronger position going forward. And so the thought here is that, as you go out a couple years, both the top line and the corresponding EPS growth accelerates. And so, I mean that's the purpose of sort of taking it up.","So, again, it was just some significant opportunities we saw in the marketplace and we think now's the time to make the investment. And even though, let's say, relative to our historical track record the EPS growth is a little lower, we think it's the appropriate investment to make. And over time, we think this will yield significant financial returns and a stronger company.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Makes sense. Thanks, Rob.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dane Leone with BTIG. Your line is open.","Dane Leone - BTIG LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Just a point of clarification in terms of the commentary. Do you guys consider 3% mid-single-digit growth or low-single-digit growth?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I mean, generally the way we think about it is we would say sort of 4%, 5% and 6% as mid and 1%, 2%, and 3% as low.","Dane Leone - BTIG LLC","Okay. So, kind of in that context and in line with some of the other questioning on the call, how do you think about the natural growth rate? You guys have been kind of on that mid- to low-single-digit rate for a while now. And arguably, by comparison, other peers in your group kind of have put up some higher growth, even despite being conservatively larger.","Do you feel that you might just be kind of investing in structurally lower growth markets and maybe you need to kind of consider or reconsider where you're kind of focusing over the long term for exposure?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I guess I would maybe initially take exception to your premise. So I guess, if I look back six years, I can only think of one year where we grew less than 4%. So I would say five years of the last six years we grew mid-single-digits.","Dane Leone - BTIG LLC","Okay. I mean, do you think that kind of 4% is the right growth rate?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think you've got to look at it, first of all, if you go back a couple years it was higher than that, but I think you also need the consideration is, if you look over the last couple years, I'm not sure the macroeconomic environment was one that, when you look across the globe, particularly lately in the emerging markets, it's been a little challenging. Of course, 28% of our revenue \u2013 and this is something we've worked on because we think longer term it's got strong prospects, but with 28% of our revenue in emerging markets, places like Brazil, Russia, et cetera, that's created a little bit of a headwind.","So, actually, I feel pretty good with despite what we've seen in some of the challenging macroeconomic environments that we've been able to put 4% organic growth up. Feel pretty good about it quite frankly.","Dane Leone - BTIG LLC","Okay. So, in terms of the growth rate, do you think 19% without the FX adjustment is the right operating margin if we look to 2017 now?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I don't know that we want to get into sort of forecasting 2017 or 2018 or 2019. I mean I think what we've said is here's our forecast for 2016. I think, going forward, our expectation will be we'll continue to invest but we'll get, hopefully, good gross profit and gross margin expansion. And again, we've set a goal out there by 2020 to be at 22%.","Dane Leone - BTIG LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. First question...","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Bill.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi, there. First question, Rob, I guess, can you help us think a little bit about the academic market in Japan, kind of what are you seeing and are we starting to see any funding shake loose?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the academic market in Japan has been challenging for us, probably all of 2015. I was there a little while ago and I would say I'm not optimistic we're going to see a big turnaround there anytime soon. I would say, maybe the back half. I would say the only thing that's potentially happening is the comparisons obviously get easier this year. So maybe we'll see some release of some funding, but I think it continues to be challenging.","I think what we're seeing in our business is the consumables still to do okay, but I would say in the capital equipment area is where the challenge has been. And unfortunately, in Japan, for us it's probably more of an instrument play than it is a consumable play. So we're hopeful that we'll see some improvement soon, but I'm not optimistic at least in the first half of the year.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it. Understood. And then, and you can probably categorize this as somewhat of an oddball question, but it's certainly garnering a lot of press. So, Zika virus, if we think about newborn screening, kind of how much exposure do you have in South America and are you guys keeping an eye on this at all? Thanks.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, Brazil for us is not a large, that's probably the majority of where our newborn screening business is. We're growing in Mexico. But I would say there's sort of pluses and minuses, I mean obviously to the extent it reduces birth rate, that's not great. But I would tell you it is increasing sort of awareness of the whole sort of newborn health and newborn screening. So we're actually getting a number of inquiries as to sort of the opportunity to focus more and more on the newborn screening in Latin America. So it's obviously an unfortunate situation currently, but I think longer-term it is raising some awareness.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon, guys. Appreciate you guys taking the question.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","There's been a lot of \u2013 yeah, there's been a lot of inquiry around M&A so far, but I was interested in maybe exploring divestitures. I think you guys probably don't get enough credit for having been proactive, modifying the portfolio over the years. I'm curious if divestitures are in any way part of the operating plan over the next few years to hit your goals on the financials.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think as we become more focused and prioritize our investments, I think there probably will be a couple product lines that over the next year or two years probably become strategic for us. So, I mean, I don't know if it'll be a significant amount of revenue, but I wouldn't be surprised if in 2016 and probably in 2017 you see a little bit more focus on the portfolio, which will entail disposing of some of the product lines.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then maybe a follow-up on the organic growth side. You had a lot of questions around the sort of sustainable organic growth rate. Do you guys need to do M&A to hit that mid-single-digit range that you aim for, just in the context of the current macro? Or do you think some tuck-in M&A would be needed to get you to that mid-single-digit range? Thanks.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I don't think so. I mean I think as we look at the portfolio we have and we look at the end markets, and I think one of the things we didn't do (1:03:24) is just sort of shift the weighting a little bit. And obviously that's \u2013 part of the way we're doing that is through investment. But we have a number of our businesses and product lines that are growing well into the high-single-digits and low-double-digits. It's just that we've got to grow out in some of the areas that are a little bit slower growth. We've talked about it in the past.","I mean we've got a strong position in radiochemicals and radiometric detection. It's a great business. We make a lot of money. But that every year probably grows low to mid \u2013 or declines low- to mid-single-digits. And so we've got a couple of those that obviously put a little pressure. But so over time as we shift the weighting to the higher growth areas, I think mid-single-digit is the appropriate number for us.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks a bunch.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Afternoon. Thanks for the question. Rob, just to go back to the industrials, are you able to put some numbers to the impact of what's going on in the energy sector on your GC and your ICP-MS franchises? I do appreciate that the exposure is smaller, but kind of just trying to better understand the effect that rate closures and oil prices are having, as we read what our energy guys are publishing.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say the industrials exposure for us across the company is probably in the maybe 10% or so. So it's not a huge number. If I was sort of prioritizing industrial exposure, it starts with sort of fine chemical and petrochemical. So oil and gas is sort of a little further down.","I think where we're seeing it though, so it's not specific to oil and gas or sort of natural resources. It's the sort of knockoff effect that I think it's having. So we're seeing the impact of some countries that are relying on oil revenue. Clearly, they're pulling in. Clearly, in the emerging markets, the lower dollar or the stronger dollar is having an impact. So I think the concern on the industrial side for us is more broad-based than it is specific to oil and gas.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Jeff Elliott with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Thanks. First one for Andy here. Could you give a guidance number for free cash flow for 2016? And then you talked about using half of that on buybacks. How should we think about the pacing of buybacks during the year?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I think, for 2016, we're going to shoot for what we've always shot for, which is one times net income. So, that'll be about $300 million of free cash. This is the first year we've had a three handle on our operating cash flow. So we hope that this year we'll have our three handle on our free cash flow.","So, that's basically $150 million in buyback. I think you'll see that through the year maybe a little bit more front-loaded, but it will probably average to a weighted average share count of 111 million shares. So you can kind of do the math on that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Leonard with Leerink. Your line is open.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks. I was hoping you could perhaps elaborate further on the sources of the 70 bps in gross margin expansion you're expecting in 2016. Rob, I think you made a comment about Lean earlier, but I thought there might be more to say.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say a number of things we're doing. Some of it is Lean and the in fact through we did get more efficiency, and where we'll see that is sort of expand our capacity. And then consequently we were looking at actually pulling some stuff that we've outsourced historically in, so we think we can get some savings there. I think clearly in the supply chain is I think we've talked about before. When we were moving in a number of the factories, we've been probably or we weren't as aggressive on the supply chains. So we're putting plans to do that.","And then I think the other thing that will help is clearly the mix shift as we \u2013 partly the new products come out also as we sort of focus on these areas that have a tendency to be higher growth and higher margin. So I think the combination of those will make up the 70 basis points. I would say we're assuming for 2016 very little price. And so I know if we can get some price, that'd be great. But our assumption is that price is pretty flat for us. And so it's really coming from productivity and mix.","Operator","And our next question is from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Rob, earlier in your dialogue, you had mentioned the software acquisitions coming together along with your other focused M&A in Life Science. Can you talk about how the software business looks, like Cambridge and Spotfire, and kind of that convergence point you're starting to see?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think it continues to perform well. It had a good 2015. I think we're forecasting probably high-single-digits for it in 2016. And our strategy in the informatics area is that we've built some great capabilities around the ability. For example, Spotfire is a very powerful tool with data. And then, of course, we've got our electronic notebook, which is great at sort of collaborating the data.","And so what we're doing now is building that bridge, because the challenge is getting access of that data sort of easily. So what we're looking to do is take \u2013 if you think about ELN as a data repository and you think of Spotfire as the ability to give you good analytics and visualization, we're now working on that sort of in between that gap. So our approach is to make sure that we get the right data to the right people very easily in sort of a scalable, very useable format. And we're getting a lot of receptivity around that, and we're building some terrific capabilities.","And then when we do that, it allows us to better leverage what we're doing on the instrument side and build that linkage. So we fundamentally create the informatics and the software to allow people to take data out of a repository, analyze it real well, and then we facilitate getting that information into the repository through our instrument in imaging and other capabilities. And we're seeing a fair amount of receptivity with a number of our customers.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Joshua Waldman - Cleveland Research","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. It's actually Josh in for Steve tonight. Just making sure I didn't miss it, did you guys provide a tax rate on the quarter?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We did. It's for the year. We basically said flat to 2015 or 19.5%.","Joshua Waldman - Cleveland Research","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Sachin K. Kulkarni - Jefferies LLC","Hi. This is Sachin in for Brandon. Thanks for taking our questions. Will you discuss the strength in operating margins you saw in the period, particularly in Environmental Health? Was it a lot stronger than we had in our model? And speaking of like the 50 bps of core operating margin expansion for the year, would you divide that up between like Human Health and Environmental Health?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. For the quarter, on the Environmental Health side, we saw a couple of things. One is we saw a very positive mix shift into MATCAR (1:11:09), and we also talked about some licensing revenue, very high margin. And then we also did a lot of work in the fourth quarter around some cost controls. And so I'd say that's about half and half.","And again, they had a fairly easy comp from a year ago. It's kind of the flip of that with Human Health where we saw very, very strong margins in the fourth quarter of 2014, so a much more difficult comp for them. So, a little bit of the comp, a little bit of the mix and some cost controls.","As far as the 50 bps, I think that it's fairly evenly split. If you look at the full year for 2015, I think both businesses contributed. I think if you move forward to 2016 and look at the margin expansion, you're going to see more of it coming out of Environmental Health because we're really making the investments in the Human Health segment.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. If you look at the four areas that I highlighted, three of those come out of Human Health: so the reproductive health, the emerging diagnostics and the laboratory services. So clearly there's much more investment going back into Human Health this year, and so the majority of the margin expansion we expect will come out of Environmental.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question is from Bryan Brokmeier with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. Rob, could you elaborate a little bit on the strengths, the level of strength you're seeing in the newborn screening market in the U.S.? And the benefit you might be seeing from any more \u2013 if you're seeing any more states expanding their test menus, including anyone yet adopting LSD screening?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I would say, first of all, the strength that we've seen historically has been probably more outside the U.S. than in the U.S. I mean U.S. is growing, but if you look at the strength it continues to be in emerging markets in China and those types of areas. What I was referring to was the number of investments that we're making in the LSDs and the TMV and those types of things, which we're excited about, but you're probably not going to see those into the U.S. market probably till end of 2016, 2017 at the earliest. So these are investments that you're probably not going to see.","The U.S., the growth there is coming from our SCIDs platform that we introduced about a year or so ago. So, like I said, we're excited about these investments. We think they continue to build out our strong position in the marketplace. But I think a number of these will not have meaningful revenue in the U.S. probably till 2017 because generally what we're doing with these tests is probably going to Europe first. So we'll see them introduced in Europe probably as a CE-marked IVD and then you'll see it later in the U.S.","Operator","Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions. So I'll now turn the call back over to Rob Friel, Chairman and CEO.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much. First of all, let me wrap up by again thanking you for joining us this afternoon. And I want to reinforce the terrific opportunity we have to continue to innovate across our capabilities of detection, imaging, software, and service to enable critical insights that will have a dramatic impact on improving human environmental health for the better. I hope you all have a great evening. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our program. And you may all disconnect.

Welcome to the First Quarter 2014 PerkinElmer Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lisa, and I'll be your coordinator for today. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tommy Thomas, who is the Vice President of Investor Relations, for opening remarks. Please proceed, sir. Thank you.","Tommy J. Thomas","","Thanks Lisa. Good afternoon and welcome to the PerkinElmer first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. If you have not received a copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our Web-site at www.perkinelmer.com. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our Web-site until May 8, 2014.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future, even if our estimates change. So you should not rely on any of today's forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date after today.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures we plan to use during this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available as an attachment to our earnings press release. To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during this call that are not reconciled to GAAP in that attachment, we will provide reconciliations promptly.","I'm now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel. Rob?","Robert F. Friel","Thanks Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that PerkinElmer is off to a solid start in 2014, delivering strong performance in the first quarter. Our financial results exceeded expectations with organic revenue growth of 5%, strong operating cash flows, a significant increase in operating margins and adjusted EPS growth of 28%.","We are benefiting from strong demand for our differentiated solutions and improving trends in many of our end markets compared to last year. Productivity improvements we made in 2013 to simplify and strengthen our operational footprint, an effective operational execution by the entire organization. While Andy will discuss our end markets and Q1 results in detail, I would like to highlight the progress we made during Q1 to improve our core capabilities of detection, imaging, informatics and service enabling us to grow our share in key end markets.","Turning first to imaging, we launched the IVIS SpectrumBL which features a patented optical imaging technology and increases in vivo throughput in preclinical imaging for drug efficacy, safety and toxicology. We also jointly opened an in vivo imaging demo lab in Fudan University's Shanghai Medical College, the first center of excellence in APAC with the ability to provide direct demonstration and training for preclinical animal models. Researchers at the lab will use PerkinElmer's bio-imaging technologies to advance the understanding of biology and find improved alternatives for disease treatment.","In detection we broadened our leading prenatal and neonatal diagnostics offerings, both in the U.S. and in China, including setting up additional lab in a lab testing for severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome where we embed a full-service operation and several PerkinElmer technicians directly into a customer's laboratory to screen new born samples using PerkinElmer's assets.","We also recently signed an agreement with the National Health and Family Planning Commission in China to be the exclusive partner in a three-year newborns training project to cover more than 600 rural communities and train more than 3,000 doctors and lab technicians. This unique collaboration which employs PerkinElmer's detection technologies, knowledge and infrastructure will not only grow our market share, but more importantly help to save millions of lives.","Additionally, we announced an exclusive partnership with Good Start Genetics to sell its GoodStart Select genetic carrier screen tests to our maternal fetal health customers in the United States. This partnership further expands our prenatal menu and enables us to leverage an already strong market for us.","Also as a prime example of how we can deliver greater customer value through linking together our complementary capabilities, we introduced the NexION 350 ICP-MS spec instrument and paired it with new workflow-based software called Syngistix. This solution enables superior levels of nano material detection and is significantly faster than anything on the market making it ideal for single particle detection and for applications within the environmental food and pharma markets. This product further demonstrates how the breadth of our product offerings can be brought to solve real issues facing our customers.","Turning to informatics, a strong driver behind the business' growth in Q1 was our ability to further deploy our Spotfire data visualization software across our instruments platforms. For example, we won business with the Genome Institute of Singapore to provide a bundled solution consisting of our JANUS liquid handling technology, EnSpire Plate Reader and Spotfire software. This integrated solution will enable the efficient discovery of next-generation cancer therapeutics and personalized genomics.","We also launched Elements, our first cloud-based scientific collaboration tool that will revolutionize how students and researchers collect and share data. Early feedback from several beta users at large universities has been very positive. We also continued our investments in mobile platforms with the INconX application for our Optima spectrometer, which enables user to remotely monitor and control the operation and analysis from anywhere in the world. In addition, we added mobile capabilities to our OneSource offering to allow the scheduling and monitoring of service calls and access to a complete history of the service records through the use of an iPhone.","While innovating across our core capabilities is critical to accelerating growth, so is providing an exceptional customer experience. During the quarter, we began to put together better processes to ensure that PerkinElmer is the easiest company to do business with in the industry, from the time a customer purchases the product through installation. Our renewed focus this year on improving the customer experience will generate even greater customer satisfaction and build long-term brand loyalty.","In closing, it was a great to kickoff the year strong and build momentum heading into Q2. Most of our end markets are experiencing improving trends with the remaining stable. Diagnostics was strong reflecting our market leadership and the attractive segments we serve. Solid mid single-digit growth in our research business reflects some recovering pharma and a continued uptake in our informatics offerings, and the environmental business experienced robust service growth and strong interest in our upcoming new product launches.","Our focus on elevating differentiated innovations and serving our customers well will continue to fuel our growth and provide a competitive advantage for PerkinElmer. Critical to this are our many employees located across the globe, who in the first quarter not only executed well operationally to achieve revenue and margin expansion but also continued to drive our strategic priorities while remaining passionate about serving our customers. Consequently, I feel good about our ability to accomplish both our short-term goals and long-term objectives as we have an incredible opportunity to grow and innovate, and most importantly make a difference.","I would now like to turn the call over to Andy.","Frank A. Wilson","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon everyone. I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, the financial summary of our first quarter results and details about our second quarter and full-year 2014 guidance and then we'll open up the call for your questions.","We are pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Reported, adjusted and organic revenues, all increased by 5% with essentially no top line impact from acquisitions or foreign exchange. Adjusted revenue for the quarter was $533 million as compared to $507 million in the first quarter of 2013. By segment, our organic revenue in Human Health grew approximately 6% while organic revenue in our Environmental Health business grew 4%.","Looking at our geographical results, organic revenue increased mid-teens in Asia, mid single digits in the Americas and flat in Europe due in part to the timing of shipments in the fourth quarter of last year. We expect to see low to mid single-digit organic revenue growth in Europe for the full year driven in part by new product introductions and an improving economy.","In China, organic revenue increased low double digits. We continue to see positive demand trends in our key environmental and diagnostic offerings, specifically our infectious disease, newborn and prenatal screening as well as applied market applications focused on food, air, soil and water detection capabilities.","Looking at organic revenue growth by product category, recurring revenue which includes reagents, consumables and service grew high single digits in the quarter while organic revenue for our instrument and component offerings grew low single digits in the quarter.","From an end market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 56% of reported revenue in the quarter and consist of diagnostics which represented 29% of reported revenue and research which represented 27% of reported revenue. Organic revenue growth from our diagnostics business increased high single digits during the first quarter, primarily driven by demand for our newborn screening and infectious disease solutions, with particular strength in emerging markets.","Not only are birth rates beginning to rebound in China as evidenced by prenatal trends we saw in the first quarter, but thereafter greater access to newborn screening in rural areas is also increasing. Additionally, we continue to gain share in infectious disease testing in China having won over 30 new Sym-Bio customers during the quarter.","Medical imaging was essentially flat in the period, but an improvement from our guidance provided in January. We continue to expect solid organic revenue growth for the year driven by emerging market investments in the healthcare infrastructure and the rising trend to advanced medical diagnostic x-ray capabilities.","Our research business delivered mid single-digit organic revenue growth in the first quarter versus the comparable period in 2013. The pharma and biotech segment contributed to this performance and is in line to grow mid single digits for the year. In academia and government, the funding remained somewhat choppy in developed regions impacting CapEx decisions, yet there are indications the market should rebound and lead to greater opportunities in the second half. The tone coming from our customers is definitely more upbeat at this time than last year and we remain optimistic on the outlook for the year.","Moving to our Environmental Health business which represented 44% of reported revenue in the first quarter, we serve three end markets, laboratory services which represented 20% of reported revenue, environmental safety which represented 16% of reported revenue and industrial which represented 8% of reported revenue. As I mentioned earlier, organic revenue in our Environmental Health business grew 4% in the quarter driven by continued strength in our services offering which was up low double digits.","On the product side of the business, organic revenue was flat in the quarter as growth in Asia was offset by softness in the U.S. while Europe was essentially flat. We're excited about our new product pipeline which will ramp up in the second half and meet strengthening demand. For the NexION [indiscernible] team aspect in particular, we continue to see investment orders and expect to ship the first several instruments in the second quarter.","Turning to our margin performance in the period, adjusted gross margins in the first quarter of 2014 were 46.8%. A higher service revenue mix, initial OneSource startup cost related to a number of new contracts in the quarter, and FX headwinds negatively impacted gross margins by more than 100 basis points. We expect moderate improvement in adjusted gross margins for the year as we launch our new products and as our revenue mix returns to a more normalized rate.","Adjusted operating margins in the first quarter were 14.7% as compared to 12.6% for the same period a year ago. SG&A and R&D contributed approximately 116 and 120 basis points to our margin improvement respectively, most of which is the result of prior year restructuring efforts as well as our shift of R&D resources to China. I would like to note that approximately half or 60 basis points of the year-over-year R&D improvement is due in large parts to the timing of new hires into our R&D center of excellence in Hopkinton. Thus R&D expense for the balance of the year will increase approximately $2.5 million per quarter.","The 2013 consolidation of R&D facilities into Hopkinton along with the consolidation of shared service operations in Krakow, Poland afford us the opportunity to more efficiently and effectively manage our SG&A and R&D spend going forward.","By segment, adjusted operating margin in our Human Health business increased approximately 320 basis points to 21% as compared to 17.8% in the first quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily a result of volume leverage, prior year productivity initiatives and restructuring activities. In our Environmental Health business, adjusted operating margins expanded approximately 80 basis points to 11.2% as compared to 10.4% in the first quarter of 2013, due primarily to these same factors.","On a non-GAAP basis, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was approximately 22% versus our guidance of 21%. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.46 in the first quarter of 2014, approximately $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range as higher sales and strong incremental margin flow-through more than offset a higher tax rate and incremental foreign currency headwinds that combined [maybe] (ph) impacting results by approximately $0.02 versus our guidance provided in January.","Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the first quarter with approximately $930 million of debt and approximately $224 million of cash. We exited the quarter with a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3 times and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.7 times.","Looking at our first quarter of 2014, cash flow performance, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $68 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $62 million representing a free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion of 118%. Looking to the second quarter of 2014, adjusted revenues are expected to be in the range of $565 million to $575 million. Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter this year are expected to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.59 which represents growth of 12% to 16% from prior year levels.","Assuming the midpoint of our second quarter guidance range, adjusted earnings per share growth for the first half of 2014 are expected to grow approximately 20% as compared to the same period a year ago, giving us greater conviction in our ability to meet or exceed our adjusted operating margin expansion guidance for the year. For the full year 2014, we continue to expect our adjusted revenues to grow in the mid single-digit range, so we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $2.42 to $2.46 from our previously guided range of $2.40 to $2.45.","This concludes our prepared remarks, and operator, at this time we would like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Doug Schenkel, Cowen and Co. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Chris [indiscernible] in for Doug today. So congrats on your quarter. My first question is, your incremental margin was strong this quarter and clearly the quarter came in ahead of expectations. How should we think about the operating margin guidance in context of the solid quarter, should we expect you to take advantage of the strong start and perhaps decelerate some investments?","Frank A. Wilson","I think at this point we only have one quarter under our belt. We feel good about it. Some of it, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is related to the timing of some hiring in R&D and some spend in the R&D area. So that will actually be a bit of a headwind in the second through the fourth quarters. But I think we still \u2013 I think we have more conviction now that we can deliver possibly north of 130 basis points, but I think it's still early days. I think if we end up significantly outperforming in the first half, we might look at some investment, but I think at this point we feel good about where we are and I think we feel good about our margin expansion opportunity. And so I think as we said in the prepared remarks, I think we feel good about possibly exceeding the 130 but have made no decisions on spending anything [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, and just one more. So OneSource and the pharmaceutical end market have been consistent areas of growth. Given the recent [flurry of] (ph) pharmaceutical activity, can you just give us an update on sort of what expected impact on your business would be?","Robert F. Friel","So as you mentioned, we've seen strong growth in OneSource, and I think the reason is because our customers are doing more outsourcing and we're seeing greater customer penetration, and when you really think about it, it makes sense for our customers, it helps them to drive productivity. When you think about the potential for further formal consolidation, that really just more further supports this outsourcing model, because when you think about it, OneSource can be helpful in harmonizing practices or simplifying the supply chain. So, we think it probably continues to drive strong growth in OneSource.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink Bank. Please go ahead.","Dan Leonard - Leerink Swann","Just wanted to talk a little bit more about gross margin. I'm trying to think about how to balance the benefits of all the heavy lifting you did in manufacturing last year with sort of the secular trend that your service business is a faster grower than the corporate average and that's a lower margin business, and you have done a couple of distribution relationships in the diagnostics side lately and perhaps those are lower margin. So just in light of the gross margin result of the quarter, I'm wondering if you could elaborate a bit more on the trajectory there.","Robert F. Friel","I would say one other thing, Dan, I think as the new products start to come out in the second half of 2014, I think that will be a big contributor to expanding gross margins. So I think you're right from the standpoint of one of the reasons you're seeing this service business outperform the product business right now is because we haven't seen a lot of the benefits in the new products [yet] (ph). So I think with the benefits of the new products, our expectation is you'll see stronger gross margin.","Dan Leonard - Leerink Swann","Okay, thank you. And my one follow-up, I guess today is another example that the market is willing to pay for deals right now. What can you comment on your M&A pipeline and your ability to do transactions in 2014?","Robert F. Friel","As Andy mentioned, another good quarter, strong cash flow, and so we're fairly active, we've got a pretty full pipeline here. So we're hopeful that we'll be able to get some deals done this year. But again as we've talked about in the past, probably nothing of significant size, I think we'd be more comfortable in sort of bolt-on, but hopefully we'll get a couple of [indiscernible] this year.","Dan Leonard - Leerink Swann","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Knight, Janney Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Paul Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott","Rob, I know the software business and informatics was, software specifically, has been a long time in development. Do you think you're finally there with Spotfire and surrounding technologies?","Robert F. Friel","Paul, I think we've made good progress in Spotfire but I think we still see a significant opportunity, continue to expand Spotfire with our instrument platform we introduced something fairly recently called Skystream which really helps pull data directly, in this case plate readers, right on the Spotfire without having to download data to a server and then subsequently upload it. So there's a lot more work we can do in making Spotfire more applicable to our instruments and then of course building out Spotfire application in some other areas. So good progress but I think we still see a pretty good runway to continue to build on our capabilities in informatics.","Paul Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott","And Rob, you're more optimistic sounding than most regarding China on these conference calls. Is it because of the high diagnostics and environmental exposure, I guess the tougher question is, is private sector such a small part that you don't see that impact?","Frank A. Wilson","I think it really speaks to where we are in the selective markets that we serve. So when you talk about diagnostics, we're obviously in and around newborn and prenatal and so we're getting the benefit of increasing growth. Obviously we have nice share there. And then I think we've got a great product offering in the infectious disease and so we're continuing to take share there. So specifically on the diagnostics side, we feel great about that.","On the environmental side, there just continues to be more focus and emphasis on cleaning up the environment. This is something that just came out recently. I think it was either in the last day or two, we're now putting a more difficult or more stringent penalties for environmental violations across the government, so whether it's monetary or actually jail time. And so I think you're going to see much more monitoring of environmental. Of course that's driving some of our growth as well. So I think potentially we're optimistic because of both the positions that we have in China as well as the markets we serve.","Paul Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott","Okay. And then lastly, is big pharma specifically big pharma, are they stable growing or what's your color there?","Robert F. Friel","I think they have stabilized and maybe even we're seeing a little bit more of an optimistic tone there. If you look at our research business, particularly the areas that we focused over the last 24 or 36 months, in the areas of imaging and informatics and microfluidics, all those areas actually grew double digit in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ross Muken of ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Ross Muken - ISI Group","So I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the gross margin line, so in terms of the year-over-year comparable pull-through, is that more a function just with some of the mix from last year given some of the disruptions you had, maybe there was a higher software component or something, because it seemed like the pull-through was a little less, I would have expected given sort of the revenue outperformance?","Robert F. Friel","I think as Andy talked about, we have a couple of dynamics going on in the quarter. First of all, at least looking at gross margin, the service business has lower gross margins but have very good operating margins. So with the service business growing sort of low double digits, that's going to put pressure on gross margin. The other thing is because we want to couple fairly significant OneSource contracts in the first quarter, there is an upfront investment associated with those contracts often in the first couple of months that we win those, and so we're making investments, et cetera, and of course that flows through gross margin. I think another big component was I think it was sort of 30 or 40 basis points of impact from foreign exchange. So we think when you sort of strip that out, the sort of core actually expanded gross margins probably 60, 70 basis points.","Ross Muken - ISI Group","","Okay, that's helpful.","Frank A. Wilson","When we gave guidance and talked about the year and the fourth quarter, we had indicated that we thought service and instruments were both going to grow about 5%, but that mix shift as Rob said does have a significant impact.","Ross Muken - ISI Group","","And the investment, that makes sense. A lot of folks have kind of highlighted weather and days impact, all sorts of messiness in the quarter. It seems like your consumable recurring revenues were kind of strong. I guess in your mind is that just a function again of some of the markets where you're seeing extra-normal growth or sort of non-U.S. based? I'm just curious like the pacing in your consumable businesses and sort of the U.S. versus ex-U.S., did you see any sort of different month on month?","Robert F. Friel","Not really. I mean it might had a minor impact but not anything of significance. So I don't think I'd spike that. The other thing to keep in mind is that a big part of our reagent revenue is the flow-through on newborn screening and babies are not impacted by weather.","Ross Muken - ISI Group","","I'm about to have one, so hopefully not. And then lastly, sorry just to be quick, I know we talked [indiscernible], where are we on sort of open the kind of buyback, I mean the sale \u2013 you buys obviously are kind of running at a leveraged position where you have some flexibility and you haven't done a ton of deal work, it's been a tough market for that in general up until recently. How are you sort of thinking about kind of the trade-off right now with the stock between M&A and share repo?","Robert F. Friel","So I think what we've said, Ross, is our preference is to try and do some of these deals to sort of build out our capabilities, but it's a point that we don't see that as likely in the pipeline, we probably get a little bit more aggressive on the stock buyback. I would say the only other thing that's out there is we continue to be on sort of negative watch for Moody's and we'd sort of like to get that behind us, but at some point that becomes less relevant.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Isaac Ro, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Just want to ask a question on academic spending. We've obviously seen some expectations set by other management teams in this space that maybe first quarter was a little soft but hopefully will pick up as the year progresses, so I'm wondering if you can share that sentiment number one, and if so, kind of what will be sort of the anecdotal items you could share if any to support that view? [indiscernible] struggling with reading the [indiscernible] on the academic picture at least in the U.S.","Robert F. Friel","I probably agree with that. I would say we didn't see it in the first quarter. Clearly it was better than it was in Q1 of '13. I would probably define it as \u2013 or describe it as more stable, but I think in the discussion, in the dialog with the customers, it does seem like there is more of an advertiser spend. I would say the pipeline, we probably have the greatest visibilities in the in vivo area and there seems to be a pretty good pipeline there in the U.S. And so, in our sense it probably improves a little bit here in the back half of the year.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","And actually on that product line, [that wasn't] (ph) really what you had of in vivo imaging product line. You had a bit of a challenge there, first quarter last year. Can you sort of talk about how that's doing year to date and maybe \u2013 what some of the key drivers are, not only for that product but also the microfluidics business, just sort of thinking about the rest of the instrumentation portfolio you guys got from Caliper, mark-to-market on that?","Robert F. Friel","So I mentioned it briefly. A couple of the areas that we've sort of really emphasized over the last couple of years, actually we did see good growth in the first quarter, so both microfluidics and the in vivo imaging grew greater than 10% or double digits. So we are pleased with that. If you look at in vivo specifically, it was very strong in U.S., not as strong in Europe. And so that's the one area where we are seeing a little bit of weakness let's say specifically in vivo area and as well in Asia. So overall double digits but a little bit of a weakness on the European side. Microfluidics again, we saw a nice growth there. That was pretty much across the board geographically.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jon Groberg of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Capital","Congratulations on a solid quarter. So, Rob, can I actually \u2013 over the last call it 12 months or so you obviously made a deal with Verinata, this quarter you did a deal with Good Start, I'm just curious, I mean you guys have your own genetics lab and sequencing lab, you have other capabilities, can you maybe just talk about how you evaluate some of these newer technologies and product offerings, when to be just a distributor for a test and why not just offer the test yourself?","Robert F. Friel","I think there's obviously a number of factors that go into that. One is how quickly the market will ramp up and probably more specifically how quickly the reimbursement will ramp up. so there is a trade off there. With some of these cases there is intellectual property that's involved. I would say that's probably more the case in the non-invasive prenatal testing area. So I would say it's a number of things we look at, which is how quickly do you think this thing has become, the market becomes sort of a contributor from a profitability perspective and our own internal capabilities and where we want to focus those. So I would say that's what we think about.","Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Capital","And where are you today or when do you expect these to potentially be meaningful contributors to your top line relief?","Robert F. Friel","I think we have talked to a fair amount about the Verinata and the non-invasive prenatal area, and I would say we continue to see a relatively slow ramp-up on the reimbursement. That sort of continues to be a challenging area. So we're not forecasting a significant impact for 2014 from that area. I think contrast that a little differently with carrier screening, because there you've got a fairly well-established medical policy, pretty good reimbursement. And that sort of fits well into our channel or call point. So I think in that instance we would be say disappointed if we didn't see $5 million to $10 million of that in the back half.","Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Capital","Okay. And then, Andy, can you just clarify, I just want to make sure I understood what you were saying about R&D again, so I think they were supposed to increase $2.5 million I think you said per quarter, but I was trying to make sure I understood exactly what you were saying, and putting that in context like, looks like your guidance for the second quarter is just a little bit light of the street, although the revenues are in line, so maybe just kind of talk to me a little bit about what you expect for margins in the second quarter?","Frank A. Wilson","Specifically around R&D, we did a lot of work on consolidation which included quite a bit of R&D consolidation into our [indiscernible] in Hopkinton. As you can imagine, as we shift that facility, as we get to hire in the Hopkinton facility, that takes time. So there was a timing effect of that in the first quarter. We hope to be fully hired in the second quarter. The impact of those hires and related expenses is about $2.5 million and that's per quarter. So the spend that you see this quarter will go up about $2.5 million each of the successive quarters this year and so that will obviously have a little bit of a headwind on the margins going forward but that's factored into our full-year outlook.","Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Capital","So just to be clear on that, so on an absolute level it's going to go up $2.5 million and then kind of stay at that level for the next couple of quarters?","Frank A. Wilson","Yes, that's exactly right. It's $2.5 million in the second quarter and it will be stable at that level in the third\u2026","Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Capital","Okay, I think there was some confusion about going up $2.5 million every quarter, okay. And then what's your margin expectation for the second quarter, your operating margin?","Frank A. Wilson","We said 130 for the year but I think operating margin we think is pretty much in line with that. Maybe \u2013 yes, I would say in line with that. Perhaps we're looking at a slightly faster ramp than we had guided in January.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Peter Lawson Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities","Just back to the pharma consolidation question, how do you see the benefit playing out, do you see it as kind of an initial dip the first few months when consolidation is announced and then you kind of see long-term effect?","Robert F. Friel","I think you have to separate it between the service business and the product business. I think what I mentioned before is really directed more on the service side with OneSource, and historically what we've seen is almost growth right out of it because not only do we do the OneSource on the sort of maintenance and repair of instruments but we do summary location efforts and recalibration certification of the instruments. So generally, when there is consolidation, the service business does better.","Contrast that with the product side of things and that's where we have seen sort of a temporary dip because what will happen or at least historically what has happened is, when two large pharmaceutical companies come together they are sort of [appraising] (ph) almost of the purchasing and then it sort of sorts out and hopefully returns to some more normal level. So I would say again based on history, service can see a little bit of a bump and we probably see a little bit of a negative impact on the product side.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities","Thank you, that's helpful. On the diagnostic side, is there any color you can give us around pricing and utilization trends you're seeing with diagnostics?","Robert F. Friel","First of all I would say PerkinElmer generally pricing was sort of flattish when you look across the corporation, sort of depending on the business. I would say in diagnostics it's probably a slight help but it wasn't significant. Utilization for us is not that significant of a measure and because where we're focused on, it is in the sort of newborn and prenatal areas, and it's not as relevant on the [churn in] (ph) infectious disease area.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","Rob, we've heard from a handful of companies about there being some slowness in the release of funds from government customers in China. To what degree are you seeing any of that in your environmental business, if at all?","Robert F. Friel","I wouldn't say that's \u2013 we haven't seen that or maybe we've seen a little bit but insignificant.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","Understood. And then, Andy, are you able to quantify the \u2013 of the $20 million of productivity and cost savings expected this year, how much of that was captured in the first quarter?","Frank A. Wilson","I think in the margin expansion we provided for the year, if it was linear, we would have captured certainly the 100 basis point the carryover. There is somewhat of a ramp in the margins during the year because of some of the supply chain initiatives we have that will improve as the year goes on. But I think of what we communicated we thought we could do, we actually did that and a little bit better and that's after taking into account the R&D upside we had.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","Okay, and then one more, are you able to quantify the impact of the lower pension and royalty payments, the benefit to operating cash flow from those, and then how should we be thinking about the free cash flow conversion for the full year after a pretty good start?","Frank A. Wilson","If you look at cash flow and the income statement or the statement of cash flows, it's actually \u2013 operating cash flows are $68 million versus $11 million and essentially the difference between those is the pension which we talked about was about $47 million and the rest was a mixture but the majority of that was what was royalty. So when we talked last year about adjusted operating cash flows, we added those back. Are you still there?","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","Yes, I'm good. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","A follow-up on the commentary on prenatal screening. I understand obviously some of the reimbursement [indiscernible] verified, because obviously you've been talking about that moving [low-risk] (ph), can you maybe just talk about your thoughts on the trajectory of that business as it moves into [indiscernible] and how you might be able to benefit there?","Robert F. Friel","So I guess, so our point of view on that is, I mean we don't think that's going to happen in the short term, but we think for the foreseeable future that is going to stay in high-risk and that you're not going to see a low risk for I would say a number of years.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay. And then just as we think about the product portfolio\u2026","Robert F. Friel","I want to say, Tycho, the way we think about [indiscernible] I think the growth is really coming from the replacement of [indiscernible]. I think that's really driving the adoption. So I don't see it, I guess in the short term here in the next couple of years really getting into the low risk [indiscernible].","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay. And then as we think about just kind of the suite of products you've introduced and obviously you had a busy year last year with these introductions, any of these [indiscernible] the ability to move the needle more? Just trying to kind of rank order some of the introductions whether it's the NexION, the AxION or the [iQT] (ph)?","Robert F. Friel","I think we'll first of all would say there's been a couple of introductions in the first quarter but I would say the more meaningful sort of needle moving [indiscernible] or probably really coming out more in the latter part of the second quarter here. I would spike out the iQT, I would also spike out the Opera Phenix, which is a new high content imager. And then probably getting into the third quarter you'll see a new suite of microfluidic products coming out that we have sort of branded touch. So I would spike those three out of the significant contributors to our revenue growth.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","And then, Andy, just one on the operational initiatives. You've talked in the past about the premature [indiscernible] expense in the year. Can you maybe just quantify what you think you can get from the direct spend initiatives and how much working cap [indiscernible]?","Frank A. Wilson","We set the initial goal for this year of $10 million. It actually \u2013 the leader of the indirect initiative reports directly. I think we have made good progress. I think we see our ways to hopefully that numbers if not more, and I think this is going to be an ongoing initiative that will continue to help us both in the gross margin on the indirect side but as we do get in to expend there, but for sure on the is SG&A.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bill Quirk, Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","William Quirk - Piper Jaffray","First off, can you elaborate on the comment you had [indiscernible] regarding the new [indiscernible] China contract, maybe just help us frame that in terms of timing, duration, time?","Frank A. Wilson","I don't think it's going to have a significant revenue impact in the short term. I mean what I would think about that is it's \u2013 we're giving them some capabilities, we're training them and I would in fact it's probably even in 2014 more of a cost than it is profit, but I think when you look out two, three years, and we've done this in other situations as well, we sort of plant some seeds and then we see probably revenue in '15 and beyond.","William Quirk - Piper Jaffray","Okay, got it. And just staying on the topic, first [indiscernible] changing geographies, early diligence around sort of the [indiscernible] birth rates in two largest states in the U.S. are continuing to be pretty positive. So can you talk guys just as a category assuming that we see these trends continue kind of what that kind of translates into for the U.S. franchise?","Frank A. Wilson","Our data would suggest that if you look over the last 12 months, the U.S. is, birth rates are expanding in sort of 1% to 1.5%. And the way I would think about that is it's single millions of dollars for revenue for us.","William Quirk - Piper Jaffray","Okay, got it. And then shifting gears last question here, just thinking about the Caliper and microfluidic business and I guess specifically around the NGS [indiscernible] side, we have certainly seen an increasing interest outside of the traditional areas of sequencing here really going back over a year now, Rob, can you just talk a little bit about how you look at that from a sales gain standpoint? Do you have to bring in some new hires to get back on some of these non-traditional accounts, they deleverage the existing team, just help us think a little bit of that.","Frank A. Wilson","When you think of non-traditional accounts, you're thinking more into [indiscernible] and those types of areas, is that trying to\u2026","William Quirk - Piper Jaffray","Both [indiscernible] but then also certainly the interest within the clinical lab has been certainly for initially a lot of oncology applications for example?","Frank A. Wilson","No I mean I think we feel right now that we've got a team that's sort of calling those accounts and so I think we don't see a big investment at this point in sort of expanding the front end there. Our decision if demand starts to pick up, we'll take a look at that, but we think we've got the appropriate capabilities to be able to going to those accounts.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Zarak Khursid of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Zarak Khursid - Wedbush Securities","As we think about this Good Start strategy and in the event that NIPT starts to move into the average risk setting, I'm just curious how you would characterize or quantify your ability to drive adoption within those plain vanilla [OB] (ph) practices out there? I know there's quite a few of them.","Robert F. Friel","As I said before, that sort of fits right into our sort of wheelhouse from a call point perspective. So we've got I think very good distribution into those doctors. And so I think that's the benefit of the collaboration. We feel good about their test and their capabilities and technology and we think it's a strong combination with our distribution capabilities. So before \u2013 well established medical policy, I think it's good reimbursement, so I think we're fairly optimistic on the adoption rate and to be a pretty good business for us.","Zarak Khursid - Wedbush Securities","How many reps do you have?","Robert F. Friel","About 40.","Zarak Khursid - Wedbush Securities","Got it, great, thanks. And then just to follow-up on the lab services side of business, anything happening to potentially leverage your business there into completely new areas of manufacturing or chemicals or anywhere else?","Robert F. Friel","I would say that the bigger focus is really sort of trying to build out the informatics side to allow us to sort of continue to expand what we're doing with existing customers. I mean we continue to try and we've had for some time move OneSource into markets outside of pharma. I would say up to this point, we've had sort of limited success there. So our focus has really been more on sort of building more businesses with our existing customers, and I think we've seen some nice success with sort of lab IT offerings I talked a little bit in the prepared remarks about, I think some mobility and mobile applications to what we're doing with OneSource, and so that's probably been a more area of focus with [indiscernible] verses expanding into other end markets.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bryan Brokmeier, Maxim Group. Please go ahead.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim","You commented on the prepared remarks about the positive trend you're seeing and the birth rates in China. Do you expect that strength to accelerate as we go further into the year? And also, is the positive trend you're seeing largely due to the Chinese calendar or are you seeing any impacts from the one child policy that you're able to identify?","Robert F. Friel","So the answer to your first question is, yes. We think that continues to accelerate into the year, and of course one of the advantages we have is being a significant player in prenatal we have some good insights to what happens in newborn. I guess that's sort of I'd say synergies of the two businesses, but we believe the trend is more driven by calendar than it is by changing the policy. I mean it's a little hard to determine precisely but we had a pretty good sense that how should we turn to a much stronger growth rate because of the calendar. And [indiscernible], the question about the one total policy is probably more anecdotal than statistical but we don't think that's having much of an impact.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim","Okay thanks. And I don't know if I invested, but did you provide the organic growth rate of the individual end markets in the Environmental Health business?","Frank A. Wilson","We typically don't provide that level of detail but we did have some \u2013 in the prepared remarks I did talk about gross rates broadly.","Robert F. Friel","I mean the way to think about it is, service was strong, product was basically flat and it was pretty much flat across most of the end markets I mean up down a little bit, but fundamentally you're up a little bit or down a little bit but whether it is industrial environment or safety, they are all around zero.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Derik DeBruin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derik DeBruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So you have a really interesting sort of aspect in the baby and women's healthcare, I mean between you've got the newborn screening business, the NTD lab, you got the core blood business, Signature or Verinata, the Good Start relationship, I guess are you trying to sort of round it out with doing like in pre-implementation generic screening and I guess Signature is done okay but I don't know how big a product that is, I mean do you need to get even bigger in the cytogenetics market, could you just talk about how you sort of want to build out the baby business?","Robert F. Friel","So we actually do some of the pre-implementation outside the U.S. So sort of add that to your collection. But yes, I mean I think as we've talked about this before, I mean the diagnostic business for us is sort of mixed, alright, and the way we think about it is at one level [indiscernible], we want to do a lot of things in and around whether you call it births or reproductive health, whatever term you are using, our view is we've got a nice position there and so we want to leverage that to continue to build that out and we've talked about at times even maybe going into early childhood with some screening analysis. So I would say that's one. And the other is infectious disease but largely focused in emerging markets and today that's mostly China. So that's how we think about our business.","Derik DeBruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess you could go upstream and do partnership with the Harmony if you wanted to but that will be there. So another question is in the software space for inspection sequencing. You acquired [indiscernible] a couple of years ago. I'm just wondering sort of how you look at the bio informatics market and how you want to sort of build out that? It's like does that become a bigger part, are there more assets out there, how do you see sort of coming into the bio informatics space and how are [indiscernible] products competing with that from Ingenuity and some of the other things that are out there?","Robert F. Friel","So I would say generally speaking, we would like the bio informatics business to be a bigger part of PerkinElmer. I think when we look at our capabilities, it starts with detection and imaging, but increasingly as those products get more and more sophisticated and generate more data, it really gets to what do you do with that data. So that's a big focus of ours and rather than say it in one specific area, whether it is NGS or imaging or protein analysis, we're really looking to do it across all those. And so, what we're trying to develop is more of a platform that allows you to take various pieces of data from various pieces of instrumentation and provide better information and analysis and makes then sequencing as a piece of that but it's only a component of what we think is a broader opportunity that being more sort of an informatics platform.","Derik DeBruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So more of a systems biology but it's integrated [indiscernible]?","Robert F. Friel","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Elliott, Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Jeff Elliott - Robert W. Baird","My first question is on the revenue guidance. I understand mid single digits, you left that unchanged, but [indiscernible] in the first quarter and then some of the new growth drivers that are coming on and looking at the commentary on end markets, I guess can you help me square the guidance staying unchanged with all the different moving pieces there? It seems like that the guidance is pretty conservative.","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I would say that, [indiscernible] single-digit but we came in at 5 in the first quarter, so the mid-single digits, probably a little bit better than we thought. I think what we said was we would do 4 to 6, we thought the first half would be a little on the 4 side and the back half would be more on the 6 side, we came in a little bit better. But I guess to my perspective, it's a little early to take up the revenue guidance. So we'll see how Q2 comes in. I would say we're sort of cautiously optimistic but I would say at this point, it's a little early. I mean there are a couple of headwinds out there that have this concern. I mean while it's not a huge business for us, the Russian currency is impacting our newborn and prenatal business there, the Indian currency is having a little bit of an impact on it. So we like to get a little bit more comfort around those types of things before we be prepared to sort of take the numbers up.","Jeff Elliott - Robert W. Baird","Got it. And just to follow up on the incremental R&D spend, can you talk about what areas you're hiring in?","Robert F. Friel","What Andy was talking about is the fact that we took a number of facilities that were sort of desperate R&Ds mostly in the U.S. and consolidated them into Hopkinton. So we sort of let engineers go in California, Chicago and places like that and we're hiring them back in Hopkinton. And so it's a number of the skill sets that we had previously. We're just sort of replacing them so as more sort of a geographic split for us. But I would say the emphasis is really around our imaging capabilities. So even in vivo imaging, the microfluidics capability is one that we sort of moved from the West Coast into Hopkinton and we're continuing to look for both chemists and biologists.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steve Willoughby, Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Stephen Willoughby - Cleveland Research","My apologies if you already talked about this but I was wondering regarding Japan, I know a year ago that was one of the three areas that you called out as an area of weakness, so theoretically [indiscernible] your comps there as well as like the tax changes that are happening [here] (ph). So I was just wondering if you could, if you haven't already, talk about your performance in Japan and then I have a follow-up.","Robert F. Friel","I would say Japan grew for us. I wouldn't call it was robust. It was sort of mid single digits. So it was obviously a nice recovery relative to the first quarter of 2013. But I would say with regard to the tax changes in April 1, I know some of the other companies talked about seeing some benefit for that. I wouldn't say that was material for us, but like I said, sort of solid mid single growth for us in Japan.","Stephen Willoughby - Cleveland Research","Got you, okay. And then on the OneSource business, I believe you mentioned you won some larger contracts more recently. Just wondering if you could provide maybe a little bit more color around that and also are those companies that you won the contract from another competitor or that these are new companies that are finally consolidating their service?","Robert F. Friel","So I would say from a [indiscernible] standpoint, although we don't get into our specific customers. It was basically around, it was a large pharma. I would say in one instance it was a competitive bid that we won and in two other cases it was where we picked up additional business with existing customers and that's [indiscernible] trends you see where some of the customers will put us in a couple of sites and as we continue to do well, they broaden it out.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Ladies and gentlemen, that's what we time for. I'll now hand back to Mr. Robert Friel for closing remarks. Over to you. Thank you.","Robert F. Friel","Great. First of all thank you for all your questions, and so in closing, let me just reinforce if I could, we are confident in our long-term plans to accelerate growth and deliver strong financial returns. We have a clear path forward and an outstanding team around the world that is committed to our mission of improving Human and Environmental Health. Thank you for your continued interest in PerkinElmer and have a great evening.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

My name is Jeff, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Tommy Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. And you have the floor, sir.","Tommy J. Thomas","Thanks, Jeff. Good afternoon, and welcome to PerkinElmer's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","If you have not received a copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com. Please note that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website until February 14, 2013.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future, even if our estimates change. So you should not rely on any of today's forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date after today.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures we plan to use during this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available as an attachment to our earnings press release. To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during this call, that are not reconciled to GAAP in that attachment, we will provide reconciliations promptly.","I am now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel. Rob?","Robert F. Friel","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to report another great quarter for PerkinElmer, rounding out an excellent year for the company, in which we delivered strong financial performance while continuing to invest in improving our growth and profitability profile.","Turning first to the financial results in the fourth quarter. Reported revenue grew 6% and organic revenue grew 3% in the period. Adjusted operating margins and EPS were roughly in line with our forecast at 18.3% and $0.65, respectively. We were very pleased to deliver such solid performance in the quarter, particularly given the tough comparisons versus the extremely strong fourth quarter we had in 2011.","Also during the fourth quarter, we made excellent progress on our productivity programs to rationalize our production footprint, shift production to lower-cost regions and better leverage our G&A expenses.","In addition, we continued to make strides in expanding our capabilities into targeted high-growth markets. For example, we completed the acquisition of Haoyuan Biotech, which is based in Shanghai and is a supplier of molecular infectious disease screening technologies. In addition, Haoyuan holds only 1 of 5 government approved licensing, allowing it to leverage its NAT technology in blood screening centers throughout China. The combination of PerkinElmer's distribution channel and capability and Haoyuan's leading automation assay technology and manufacturing expertise creates a formidable competitor in the large and growing Chinese blood screening and diagnostic markets.","Also in the quarter, we announced our entry into the noninvasive prenatal testing market through a collaboration with Verinata Health. We believe that incorporating Verinata's verified test into PerkinElmer's extensive distribution channel will further extend our leadership position within maternal fetal health and help to accelerate the broader adoption of noninvasive prenatal testing.","Now looking back at the full year 2012. Reported revenue grew 10%. Organic revenue grew 5% and we expanded adjusted operating margins by 100 basis points. This improved profitability translated into adjusted earnings per share growth for 2012 of 13%, resulting in adjusted EPS growth of over 100% over the last 5 years.","We achieved this strong performance by continuing to strengthen our organization and technical capabilities, and focusing on serving customers in attractive high-growth end markets.","Through targeted investments such as our new Shanghai headquarters and application centers and our new customer relationship center in Krakow, Poland, in addition to increasing the number of emerging market-based employees from 1,500 to 2,000, we expanded our emerging market presence, which now accounts for nearly 30% of total revenue.","On the innovation front, bolstered by a $30 million -- $38 million increase in R&D spending over the last 2 years, we have delivered breakthrough solutions across our detection, imaging and informatics capabilities. A few highlights include the introduction of our direct sample analysis for mass spectrometry that utilizes a disruptive approach to sample preparation, producing results in only seconds, allowing advanced chemical analysis of many sorts of samples.","The vector imager, which allows pathologists to examine several biomarkers simultaneously on a single sample, slide sample, has seen terrific adoption. Skin testing was introduced this year as a novel lab and lab offering in California and Florida, expanding the spectrum of available molecular assays for newborn and childhood screening. And finally our informatics team is incorporating the power of spot fire visualization software with our various Cornerstone offerings to the pharmaceutical, chemical and other industries for better management of the complex laboratory R&D efforts.","Informatics and software continue to be a major effort of R&D at PerkinElmer, as we bring useful knowledge to our customers' fingertips, through the marriage of innovative sample preparation, advanced instrumental analysis and leading information technology.","We also took strides last year to improve our operating efficiencies and align closer to our global customer base. These moves included repositioning certain manufacturing and R&D assets, as well as organizational changes to allow a more market focused approach with our customers.","One of these changes, which is effective in the first quarter of 2013, is to better align our informatics and certain portions of our service business to the end markets they serve, which should provide greater synergies and focus to both our customers and PerkinElmer. This change will result in a shift of about 7% of our adjusted revenue from Environment Health to Human Health for 2013. And our website will provide a reconciliation of these changes.","As we move into 2013, our approach will be similar to last year, and we'll focus on driving profitable growth and returns to shareholders by strengthening our organizational and technical capabilities, gaining continued traction on our productivity improvements and targeting attractive high-growth markets.","Turning now to 2013 guidance. We are currently assuming the organic growth rates in our end markets this year will be similar to what we experienced in 2012, with the exception of Medical Imaging, which due to the strong demand experienced last year, will face a significant headwind in 2013. However, we expect the investments we made in the latter part of 2012 to offset the lower growth for Medical Imaging. And accordingly, we are forecasting full year organic growth to grow in the mid-single digit range of 4% to 6%,  with a view more towards the lower end in the first half and towards the upper end in the back half.","Similarly, our operating margin expansion will be skewed to the second half of the year through the continued investment required in 2 of our productivity programs, which are scheduled to be completed midyear. In addition, we are planning to increase our investments to support several of our recent growth initiatives, including building out Haoyuan's molecular assay menu, expanding Spotfire's capabilities in life science research and investing in our prenatal channel in our collaboration with Verinata.","We are comfortable increasing our investments in both growth and significant productivity programs due to the savings we are already seeing -- starting to see, from our prior programs, as well as our confidence that our growth investments will pay dividends as early as 2014.","Consequently, despite these investments pressuring margins in the first half of the year, we believe we can expand adjusted operating margins in the 50 to 75 basis points in 2013, achieve adjusted operating margins of 18% or better in 2014, and provide a stronger foundation to expand growth and profitability beyond 2014.","Given the forecast of organic revenue growth and adjusted margin expansion, we estimate adjusted earnings per share for 2013 in the range of $2.24 to $2.32, representing an increase of 9% to 13% over the prior year. However, and more importantly, executing on our 2013 operating plan will allow us to enter 2014 much better positioned to accelerate both top and bottom line growth over the next several years.","I would now like to turn the call over to Andy.","Frank A. Wilson","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with prior quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our fourth quarter results and details around our 2013 first quarter and full year guidance, and then we'll open it up for questions.","As Rob mentioned earlier, we were pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter, delivering another solid quarter of organic revenue growth, despite a very difficult comparison to the fourth quarter of 2011.","Reported revenue for the fourth quarter increased 6%, while adjusted revenue increased by 4% to $577 million, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Organic revenue for the quarter increased 3%, as compared to the same period 1 year ago.","Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.65, driven by in-line organic revenue growth. Adjusted operating margins also came in as expected, with the impact of a higher stock price and a long-term compensation expense offset by a slightly lower tax rate.","Organic revenue increased 3% in both our Human Health and Environmental Health segments versus the same period last year. By geography, organic revenue in both the Americas and Asia grew at a high single digit rate, while Europe declined at a high single-digit rate. We continue to experience strong demand in China, with organic revenue growth in excess of 20%, with some moderation in the rest of the BRIC countries, which faced their toughest comparisons of the year. As a reminder, we will continue to cycle up against difficult emerging market comparisons in the first quarter of 2013.","Looking at organic revenue by product category. Recurring revenue, which includes reagents, consumables, and service, grew high single digits in the quarter, primarily the result of continuing demand in our Human Health segment and strength in our 1 source and informatics offerings. Instruments and components declined at a low single-digit rate, cycling up against low double-digit growth comparisons from the fourth quarter of 2011.","From an end market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represented approximately 48% of reported revenue in the quarter. We served 2 end markets in Human Health diagnostics, which represented 26% of reported revenue and research, which represented 22% of reported revenue.","Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business increased mid-single digits during the quarter, with continued contributions from both Screening and Medical Imaging. Our Screening business continues to benefit from the stabilization of U.S. birth rates and the expansion of our prenatal newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in key regions outside the U.S.","We were encouraged with our sales uptake in China, delivering organic growth above 20% in the fourth quarter of 2012. Our Medical Imaging business continued to see broad-based organic growth across all key technologies and applications in the period, with particular strength in our traditional medical diagnostic imaging offerings. We remain pleased with the growing acceptance of our CMOS imaging technology, which has benefited from numerous design wins in new high-growth verticals, such as breast mammography and nondestructive testing for industrial applications.","For the full year 2012, Medical Imaging delivered a very strong double-digit organic growth performance. Our research business was flat organically in the fourth quarter versus the comparable period in 2011, as fiscal cliff and sequestration uncertainties in the U.S., as well as weak European research markets contributed to softer demand early in the quarter. We are, however, encouraged by the research business's strong finish to the year.","Moving to Environmental Health, which represented 52% of reported revenue in the fourth quarter, we served 3 end markets: Laboratory Services, which represented 26% of reported revenue; Environmental and Safety, which represented 19% of reported revenue; and Industrial, which represented 7% of reported revenue.","During the quarter, we experienced low double-digit organic growth in the Laboratory Services segment. Within the Environmental and Safety segment, we saw flat organic growth, while our industrial segment experienced a low double-digit organic revenue decline, as both of these latter segments cycled up against double-digit organic growth comparisons from the fourth quarter last year.","We continued to see strong acceptance of our laboratory service and informatics offerings, as we help our lab customers better manage their critical laboratory assets and related data needs. Our OneSource offering continues to be a key differentiator for us, as evidenced by our ability to expand our presence with key pharmaceutical customers throughout 2012.","Turning to our margin performance in the period. Adjusted operating margins in the fourth quarter were 18.3%, as compared to 18.5% in the comparable period a year ago. This performance was in line with our expectations given the growth and productivity investments made in the quarter, as well as a very difficult year-over-year comparison, which was further exacerbated by the timing of the Caliper acquisition in the prior year.","Adjusted operating income increased 3% in the quarter to $105.6 million. By segment, adjusted operating margins in our Human Health business for the quarter were 22%, representing a decline of approximately 100 basis points, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. This decline was primarily the result of the impact from the Caliper stub period in 2011 and previously announced growth in productivity investments deployed in the full fourth quarter of 2012.","Our Environmental Health segment delivered operating margins of 19%, representing a decrease of approximately 30 basis points. This decline was within our expectations and was primarily due to the growth and productivity investments previously mentioned.","GAAP operating loss from continuing operations was $30.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, versus a loss of $25.9 million in the same period a year ago, due to charges related to trademark rationalizations, as well as the year-end mark-to-market pension plan adjustments.","On a non-GAAP basis, our adjusted tax rate was approximately 20.5%, and we expect our adjusted tax rate for 2013 to be approximately 23%. GAAP loss per share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2012 was $0.14, compared to a loss of $0.74 in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.65 in the fourth quarter 2012 and at the midpoint of our guidance range.","Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the fourth quarter with approximately $940 million of debt and approximately $171 million of cash. We continue to make progress on our delevering efforts, as we exited the quarter with a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3x and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.9x.","Looking at our cash flow performance. Full year operating cash flow from continuing operations was $154 million, as compared $234 million in 2011. Incremental cash tax payments, prepaid royalties, higher receivables due to the timing of revenues in the fourth quarter and restructuring charges related to our productivity initiatives, negatively impacted our performance in both the quarter and the year.","Overall, we are pleased with our performance in 2012, and feel we are on track to deliver on our longer-term organic growth and adjusted margin expansion targets. Looking back at our performance for the year, our reported revenues increased 10%, with organic revenue growth of 5%.","Adjusted operating margins expanded by approximately 100 basis points to 16.5% despite significant selling and productivity investments, and adjusted earnings per share grew to $2.06, a 13% improvement over the comparable period last year.","Now I'd like to discuss our 2013 guidance in a bit more detail. We expect adjusted revenue for the full year to grow mid single digits, with the second half of the year expected to be slightly higher than the first half. Regarding adjusted operating margins, we expect expansion of 50 to 75 basis points, with margin expansion to be more back half weighted due to our continued growth in productivities investments slated for the first half of 2013.","Interest expense is expected to be similar to 2012. Our adjusted tax rate, as I previously noted, is expected to be 23% for the year. And our weighted average diluted share count is assumed to be flat or approximately 115.7 million shares.","Based upon these assumptions, we expect adjusted earnings per share for 2013 to be in the range of $2.24 to $2.32. For the quarter, first quarter of 2013, we expect adjusted revenues to be in the range of $525 million to $535 million, with foreign-currency headwinds of approximately 1% based on current exchange rates and organic revenue of 3% to 4%.","Based upon these assumptions, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.48, which assumes the inclusion of the 2013 R&D tax credit, which represents less than $0.01.","This concludes my prepared remarks, Jeff. I guess, at this time, we would like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Paul Knight with CLSA.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Was the acquisition total in the cash flow statement related to the Chinese transaction?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. Yes, it was.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then the follow-up would be on the geographical growth that was a high single-digit decline in both Europe and U.S., and what was behind it? Pharma?","Robert F. Friel","No, I would say in Europe, it was high single -- in the U.S., actually, it was up, mid- to high-single. And then, of course, the Asia portion was also up high-single. And I would say, the European decline was not restricted to Pharma. We also saw it on the industrial side as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","This is Vijay, in for Ross. So my first question was -- actually, I wanted to dig a little bit on the subsegments. I mean, if you look at lab services, you did comment OneSource has been -- seen tremendous uptick from bio pharma. I mean, we've seen strong growth in that subsegment. What's sort of the outlook -- as you look forward, sort of -- how long can we expect, I guess, this strong performance?","Robert F. Friel","I think we can continue to see good growth in OneSource because what we've been trying to do particularly over the last, probably 6 or 9 months, is to look to expand that beyond Pharma. So I think we see some opportunities, particularly as we combine it with our informatics offerings to go into chemical industries and maybe some of the food and beverage opportunities. So I think we're continuing to believe that we can see mid-single growth, maybe even a little bit better than that in the OneSource area.","Vijay Kumar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And my second question was on the guidance. So, what's baked in the guidance in terms of assumptions around sequestration? And do you have anything baked in from the Verinata marketing agreement?","Robert F. Friel","So with regard to sequestration, as you probably know, that's not a -- the NIH funding is not a significant exposure for us. We think it's probably in the mid-single digit range from a perspective of revenue exposure. And for purposes over our '13 assumptions, market assumptions, we're assuming that it will look very similar to what we saw in 2012. And the way I would describe it is, sequestration clearly had an impact on slowing some of the grants and funding down, but probably not as strong a decline as you would expect under a, call it, a full sequestration. So, I mean, I guess to sort of give you some kind of sense of impact, with about 5% of our revenue exposed. If there was a 10% decline, it would be about a 50 basis point headwind on our organic growth. We're probably assuming something like half of that, which is probably what we saw in 2012. Just to give you some kind of calibration. With regard to the Verinata arrangement, and again, as I mentioned before, one we're quite excited about from a long-term implication. However, with regard to 2013, we have a de minimis impact on both the top and bottom line.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just want to touch on innovation for this year. You guys have developed a lot of new businesses and acquired other assets. Anything in particular regarding informatics that we might be able to expect from you this year, it's a little on the quiet side there since you made a bunch of acquisitions in 2011. So just wondering what's going on in informatics. And then also, on Kevin's side, with Caliper, what can we expect from this franchise this year?","Robert F. Friel","So I would say with regard to the informatics, we're quite excited about this collaboration we announced, and it started in the fourth quarter with Spotfire. So we're investing in and around that to expand out the capabilities in the life sciences area, and we're continuing to build out sort of additional generations of current software releases. So I think you'll continue to see a big investment in and around the informatics area. With regard to the LST area, maybe I'll just have Kevin talk to that specifically, with regard to the innovation.","Kevin Hrusovsky","Yes, Isaac, I think the key thing that we were very excited about is the Vectra tissue imaging, which we had very strong growth really in the second half of 2012 and that's -- our ability there is to multiplex numerous biomarkers simultaneously and companies like Genoptix and Novartis and others have now adopted it for LBT and are able to do some pretty important tests like the four score on breast cancer. And so we think that this technology is not only going to get continued adoption in 2013 for tissue, but we also are now moving it into circulating tumor cells and feel that this whole area is going to continue to broaden out and looking at multiple markers simultaneously as a way to eliminate and reduce false positives and negatives, so we're pretty excited about those advances. I'd say that's the primary area for 2013.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And I think I'll just ask a follow-up on margins. How much -- as you look at your guidance this year, how much of the margin upside versus your sort of base case scenario, would you say is dependent on top line leverage versus, maybe, other operational improvement that you're sort of working on in the background.","Frank A. Wilson","I think it's about 50-50. I think in the past, we said, we needed mid-single digit growth to drive 75 to 100 basis points, and I think where we are situated now about 1\/2 -- if we hit the volume now, about 1\/2 of that flow-through will be related to the volume.","Operator","Our next question comes line of Dan Brennan with Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you just help think about for '13, in terms of segment dynamics and what type of growth was implied in your mid-single growth across environmental and human health, and any notable tough comps we should be aware of, as you see it?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. So I would say, if you went through the sort of 3 key areas, they all were forecasting, we'll probably be in the mid-single range. I think when you think about Diagnostics, probably, the Screening business, we think will probably be a little better in '13. Andy alluded a little bit to the fact that we're seeing -- we are seeing some positive trends on birth rates in the U.S. We believe in the fourth quarter that we actually went to positive birth rates, probably about 1.5% up on a trailing 12 months. So we're expecting a little bit better growth on the Screening side. But to your point of tough comps, the Medical Imaging business saw a very strong double-digit growth in 2012. Some of that was timing oriented relative to customer ordering patterns, and that is going to be a headwind, we don't expect them to -- obviously, to be able to repeat that. And so we'll probably experience Medical Imaging, probably in the low-single digits in 2013. So when you put that together with a little bit stronger Screening growth, we'll probably be looking at mid-single digits. Again, on the Environmental side, when you look at both the service and the product side, we think that will be mid single-digits. And now particularly with the Informatics business being combined with the historic LST business, we think that's probably going to be mid-single as well.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then maybe just on the -- a little bit more color on the pacing of the investments that you've been making, are making that are going to lead to this increasing leverage in 2014. Can you help, maybe, just put a little more details behind some of these investments and kind of how they translate into margins?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. So we've been really talking about probably 3 major programs, 2 of them probably dealt more on the cost of sales side with regard to production. One was actually reducing our footprint, and the other was shifting production in the lower-cost areas. Those -- our anticipation is, will be completed probably at the end of the second quarter and so you'll see some benefit in the third and fourth quarter of 2013, and then, a full year of benefit in '14. And then the other one we've been talking about is leveraging our general and administrative costs is mostly our back-office and we're moving that in the sort of low-cost regions. That's a project that will start to skip some benefits in '13, but we'll continue to sort of drive some additional changes probably throughout the year. And you probably won't see the full impact of that in 2014. But I think when we've talked about the potential opportunity here, it's -- in those 3 programs alone, we're probably in the 50 to 100 basis point margin improvement.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Rob or Andy, is there any way you can give us a sense for how much exposure you have to the environmental issues in China, in terms of supplying product into that geography?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. So you know, we've talked about China being about 10% of our revenue. And I would say, the portion of our revenue that is at what I would call sort of the broader environmental, where you include water and soil and air and food, it's probably -- I don't know, 30% to 40% of our revenue in that area. So it's probably in the $60 million plus.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then my follow-up, how are you thinking about things like share repurchases in 2013? It looks like that's not in your guidance, but I wanted to at least take your temperature on that?","Frank A. Wilson","Well, when I gave -- this is Andy, by the way, Dan. When I gave the assumptions for guidance, I essentially said flat share count. So we obviously have some option creep during the year. So our assumption would be, we would certainly take that out. We obviously have been looking and continue to look at share repurchases. And we do that vis-\u00e0-vis with our capital review, and we are also looking at bolt-ons and tuck-ins. So I think we will keep share count flat, I think in a minimum, and we'll look at other opportunities as they come up.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","The first question is really just a follow-up to Dan's question. Could you share anything in terms of how you're thinking about M&A criteria from here? You got the debt to adjusted EBITDA down to 2.3x. It doesn't sound like you're going to move forward with a more significant buyback. It's been a little while since you've been through a period where you've been a bit more acquisitive, is this a year where we should expect more, or are you thinking more disciplines, tuck-in type deals?","Robert F. Friel","I think it's more the latter. I think as we've talked about in the past, if you go back to the '08 timeframe, we did feel there were some significant gaps in our portfolio that we needed to fill. As I sort of look at the portfolio today, I feel much better about it. So I don't see any pressing need to go out and do any large deals for that matter. And so I think what you should expect from us is probably more bolt-ons. Now relative to 2012, where we did very little, I would expect that the pace of small bolt-ons to probably increase in '13. But again, I would -- be unlikely for us to do a large sized deal in this environment.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just going back to your prepared remarks and some of the details that you provided on the different performance across subsegments. I think you guys indicated that research revenue was about flat organically, and I think you attributed this in part to concerns around sequestration and some of the concerns about austerity in Europe. I believe economic government accounts for under 1\/3 of the subsegments sales, and you talked about how small your NIH exposure is across the business in response to an earlier question. So I was hoping that you could just talk about really growth in the research subsegment outside of academic government. Was growth materially more robust? And if not, is there anything else going on there in terms of price or competitive dynamics?","Robert F. Friel","I would say the first thing is whenever you think about our Research business, you need to keep in mind that $100 million or so of our business is in radiometric detection and radio chemicals. And that was down sort of high single, low double in the quarter. And so -- and part of that is, it is cycling up against some difficult comps relative to on the detection side with the tsunami in Japan during 2011, we were selling a lot of instruments into that segment. So when you pull that out, the segment actually grew pretty well in the pharmaceutical side, call it, mid single digits. But of course, it gets pulled down by what's going on in the rad area.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Wood with Jefferies.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Andy, can you give us some parameters around cash flow for 2013?","Frank A. Wilson","Sure. I mean, we obviously are going to get the benefit of some of the AR buildup we saw in the fourth quarter, so that will help us a little bit. I think -- always going in, our goal is to deliver free cash flow equal to net income. I think it will be slightly below that in 2013. And that's because of finishing out these 3 projects that will require some restructuring that will impact cash flow. But I think beyond that, everything else should be kind of in line with what you would expect from improvement and working capital terms and kind of a 1x net income.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Understood. Can you -- are you willing to quantify -- I know you had restructuring charges in '12 related to at least 2 of those major programs. Can you qualify that? Is that spillover basically into '13 -- in the first half of '13?","Frank A. Wilson","A lot of the restructuring, especially in some of the latter phases of the manufacturing side, as well as some of the back-office consolidation really occur in '13. So it's the incremental piece that's going to impact us and that -- we have not quantified a dollar amount. There's a lot of things going on that we prefer not to. But clearly, as we wrap up these projects, there's going to be some incremental restructuring as we close some of these facilities.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But year-over-year, that number is lower, so there's less restructuring charges in '13?","Frank A. Wilson","No, there will be more restructuring charges in '13. There will. Because some of the areas that we're starting to finish up, some of the restructuring charges that began in '12 will bleed over into '13, and we also have some new restructuring charges related to some of these that will commence in the second and third quarter.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, understood. Just to be clear, we're talking about cash flow, right? I'd also love if you could quantify the P&L impact. I think you gave, it was 80 basis points last quarter. What did that do in the P&L in the quarter, and should we expect that same magnitude in the first half of '13?","Frank A. Wilson","Are you talking about the impact from these charges related to these programs that we're talking about?","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes. You called out -- I think in the third quarter, you called out 80 basis points of OP margin impact...","Frank A. Wilson","I think it was about 90 basis points in the fourth quarter. And I think we will see that continuing on into the first and second quarter. It will taper off a little bit in the third quarter as the manufacturing programs are completed. We'll still see the back-office consolidation spend continue really through the middle part of the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Andy, I was just wondering if you could give an outlook for gross margins for 2013? And what was pressuring margins in the quarter? Was it mix shift or assay?","Frank A. Wilson","It was primarily mix and some of the productivity investments we talked about. I think if you look at 2013, we don't normally give gross margin forecasts, but I think we'll see some improvement in gross margins, as these programs that we talked about are completed. And we'll see the benefit of those and then we won't see the spend associated with it as well. So we should see, maybe a little bit of pressure on the margin, gross margins in the first half and some benefit in the second half and overall, I think it will be a net benefit.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","What was the impact of mix on the gross margin? Any way of quantifying that?","Frank A. Wilson","I don't have it cut that finely, but it was a large piece of the 110 basis points.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And was there any pricing issues?","Frank A. Wilson","Not that I'm aware of. I think pricing, for us, was fairly steady.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Zarak Khurshid with Wedbush Securities.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","So with respect to Verinata, can you just describe how that agreement came to be? And you mentioned some investments there, what exactly do those entail?","Robert F. Friel","So we had been in discussions with Verinata for some period of time because being a strong player in prenatal, particularly on the biochemical screening and with the signatures arrays, and we've talked about this in the past where we also are doing some things internally around some R&D projects in noninvasive prenatal, but we're also talking to some of the outsider providers as well. And in looking at, at least our assessment of the technology was out there, we thought Verinata had the best technology and the best tests. So like I said, we've been in discussions with them for some time and consummated that with the announcement a couple of weeks ago. And the questions with regard to the investments, it's largely around just continuing to build out our channel in prenatal. I would say build out the channel and train our sales force. And so we're making some investments with regard to that in the first half here.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Great. And just as a quick follow-up, could you just elaborate a little bit on the Haoyuan molecular expansion plans for this year?","Robert F. Friel","Sure. So what Haoyuan has is -- think of that as DNA assays around infectious disease. And it's very complementary to what we do today with SYM-BIO. SYM-BIO has immunoassays, whereas Haoyuan provides the molecular test. And today, most of Haoyuan testing is done in blood banks and so our plan is to take those assays, combine them with what we do in SYM-BIO and actually go into the hospital. And what that will allow us to do is to tell the subtype with regard to the infectious disease. And so it's very complementary from a testing perspective and we think it will be very complementary to our channel access within China. Again, leveraging our SYM-BIO capabilities.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So just, actually, I just sort of wanted to keep on going with some of the questions that were just asked. Could you just talk a little bit more about what will be your sales channel for sort of the newborn screening market and prenatal screening markets? I just -- could you touch -- can you just elaborate a little bit on how you've -- what customers you're serving? How you're touching them? Basically, how you intend to go to market with this new offering?","Robert F. Friel","Is this with prenatal, specifically?","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Prenatal, I'm just -- in general discussion of your assets there, specifically, how you're going to take this new prenatal, noninvasive test to customers.","Robert F. Friel","Right. So I think you know, Derik, we call on the doctors today, the MFM's today, because we do biochemical screening with NTD. And in many instances, in our discussions with doctors, particularly where there's a high risk expecting mother, they've been asking us about NIPT. So I think this is going to be a relatively easy sale for our sales force to basically say, and to the extent that, they want to do a biochemical screen, they go to NTD. To the extent that they want to do an IPT, we give them the verifi test. And to the extent they want to do a chromosomal analysis, we -- I get them in touch with Signature Genomics. So again, it gives us this terrific complementary offering where depending on what the doctor -- depending on the test that the doctor wants to use, we can offer, again, whether it's NTD or the verifi test and they'll get all the same billing from PerkinElmer.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And how many people do have out there? How many salespeople do you have doing this?","Robert F. Friel","So on the prenatal side, we've got about 50.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And that hits all the U.S. geographies and all the major area territories?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I would say all the major areas.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And I guess -- I know there's agreements for the U.S. only, but -- so can you discuss then -- do you intend to expand it into more international markets? And then, once again, similarly, what's your channels and sort of like international markets look like?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, and I would say the other thing before with the U.S. another important point to make is, in addition to the customer contacts in the channel, I think maybe even more importantly, is we have the contracts with the healthcare providers. And so I think we mentioned in the press release that we have close to 100,000 -- 170,000 covered lives under contract. And so I think that's the other significant opportunity, or as I think we can accelerate the coverage of NIPT because of the relationships and the contracts we have with the providers. So when you go outside the U.S., so outside the U.S. on a prenatal side, we have very extensive capabilities. We're probably the largest prenatal provider in China from the standpoint of a distribution perspective, and very strong capability in Europe as well. And so the plan ultimately is to potentially extend some of the things we're doing in the U.S. into the global arena.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe -- just one on the service business. Can you just talk to the o-U.S. service priorities and opportunities, and in general, for the service business. Can you talk about margins, how do you see the margin improvement potential there?","Robert F. Friel","So, I think, outside the U.S., we continue to see good growth there. Generally, what happens is we sort of start working with some pharmaceutical companies, it's generally in the U.S. and then it gets extended into other sites that they have, in Europe and in Asia, et cetera. Also, at the same time, we've been building out our capabilities, particularly in the Pac Rim, and so we're continuing to see good growth there. So I expect that to continue. The margin on service, if we're talking about sort of traditional service, the margins there continue to be very strong. I would say above the corporate average. I would say, for the multi-vendor business, that's probably a little bit under the corporate average, particularly when we first enter into a contract. But when you look at service together, again, above the corporate average with regard to operating margins.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then on the emerging markets, for the Infectious Disease, blood testing business, are there catalyst or milestones we should be thinking about? Obviously, it's a large market opportunity. You highlighted you're one of several vendors there. How should we think about milestones to track that business?","Robert F. Friel","Well, the way to think about it, first of all, is the Chinese government has mandated by 2015 that all blood screening be net tested. And so what is occurring between now and then is various tenders that are going on. And so as we think about -- so the milestones between now and 2015, virtually all of the blood screening labs in China will have to adopt one of the 5 providers. And so I guess that's way to think about it as these -- some are obviously larger than others. But it's really thinking about how the tenders -- how we do in the tenders as we lead up to 2015.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Last one, just -- can you comment on the mid-tech tax, how you're thinking about that, that impacting numbers and if you need to [indiscernible]...","Robert F. Friel","For us, it's a relatively small impact. I think with regard to the products that, that is imposed upon, it's mostly the newborn screening in the U.S. And so first, it's going to be less than $2 million for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe just a quick one on the Signature Genomics business. Can you just update us there on a revenue  run rate? And maybe the growth that you're seeing there? It seems like there's some favorable technology trends working for you. So it would just be great to try and gauge that.","Robert F. Friel","I would say signature, on the postnatal side, it continues to see some decent growth. I think the issue with Signature has been historically and I think we've talked about this, is we've come out with a new chip in the oncology area and just getting reimbursement from the providers has taken much longer than we had anticipated. So I would say that on the Signature side, well, I wouldn't get into the specific details from a revenue growth and a revenue size because it will just sort of try to get down -- try not to get into the sort of subsegments of all the businesses. But I would say, in some areas, we're pleased with the growth, in some of the areas, we're a little disappointed, like I said, because of the uptake in the reimbursement.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. But the constitutional side of things, you would say, is probably more favorable than not?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I would say the non-oncology side is probably doing better than the oncology side, that's how I will probably describe it.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then you made an interesting comment earlier this month when you talked about the opportunity that you see in newborn screening in rest of the world areas, if things improve and will move beyond the single test. So I guess my question is, do you see momentum for that happening in a way that you think that test numbers could begin to increase? I guess how realizable is that bigger rest of world opportunity...","Robert F. Friel","Yes. So I would say, we, in fact, have been seeing that. I mean I think if you look over the last couple of years, we've gone from probably screening in 70 or so countries, and now we're doing in the low 90s. So we continue to see the adoption both in countries and even within those countries where they might do 1 or 2 sort of expanding into more tests. I mean, that's clearly the case in China. So I think the numbers you're referring to is if you look at the 130 million births across the globe generally, 122 million of those are outside U.S. and Europe. And so that's really -- we see as a significant opportunity for us. And just to sort of calibrate things, if the rest of the world adopts screening at the level of 1\/3 of what the U.S. does, it becomes a $1 billion opportunity.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So you do think though that -- I mean if you just sort of moderate the expectations a little bit, you think that, that number could start creeping up closer to 50 from 45 or so in the nearer term?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, you mean as far -- yes, I think that's correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg with Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So Rob, you talked on that growth and productivity investments this year, you talked a little bit on the productivity side and what you expect. But what about on the growth? Like, where do you expect the biggest impact in 2014 and what kind of impact could that be on the growth rate?","Robert F. Friel","So if you look at some of the areas that I identified as investments in '13, it was really around emerging markets, particularly in the diagnostic areas. So I think we would continue to see significant growth there. It was in the informatics area where I think we're still very bullish about that and we feel good about that. And then it was also in the prenatal channel. And I think by 2014, that could be a significant number for us. So rather than getting specific guidance for 2014, I think you could see an acceleration of our organic growth of beyond sort of traditional mid-single digits.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just on that prenatal channel, I know there are some questions, but just kind of conceptually, why did you partner for this test rather than just acquire someone or offer your own? It seems like the economics would probably be better to just offer your own test, no?","Robert F. Friel","I think as we looked at the landscape, obviously, there are still some technology risk with regard to IP. And I think by entering into a collaboration with Verinata, while we're -- as I mentioned before, we think it's the best technology and we think they've got a terrific test, it does lead us -- give us the opportunity to pursue other technologies down the road. If either something comes out and has a better technology, or again, depending on what happens from an IP perspective. So I think it's maintain the flexibility from a test offering perspective, but while in the short term here, getting our customers probably the best product that's on the market.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","And what kind of economics do you get when you sell the test? And what kind of add use for that?","Robert F. Friel","Well -- we're not going into the specifics of the agreement, basically, they're confidential.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. But nothing precludes you from -- if you wanted to offer your own test, from doing that. Is there some timeframe that you can't do that? Or you're webbed to this test for a certain period of time? Or there's nothing to preclude you from -- if you wanted to offer a test?","Robert F. Friel","I think the way to think about it is in the short term, I don't see us coming up with a competing test.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. fair enough. And then just -- sorry, 2 quick ones on Human Health. One, I think you had about 1 month of Caliper, right? And I think your revenues were up about $15 million sequentially. So what was the impact from Caliper and -- I'm sorry, what was the impact from Caliper? And then also, what was the asset impairment in Human Health? It seems like that was a fairly decent sized number.","Frank A. Wilson","Caliper was about $10 million in the quarter, for this year. So it's a little less than $15 million. It had no impact at all on our organic growth.","Robert F. Friel","And the impairment, the way to think about that is we've had, as you know, a number of acquisitions over the last couple of years. And for a long period of time, we are sort of maintaining the brands and the trademarks for that period of time, so Packard and Enian [ph] et cetera. We made a decision at the end of the year to sort of clean that up. And so that required a -- or resulted in an impairment charge with regard to some of the trademarks that were on the buckets, a non-cash charge. And basically, going forward, we're going to move toward the PerkinElmer brand.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott with Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","In your prepared remarks, you mentioned seeing some BRIC moderation, I'm curious what's driving that and when do you think we can see that turn around?","Frank A. Wilson","I mean, I think the biggest part of that is very difficult comparisons. I think for the most part, we didn't see anything structural or otherwise. I think we're going to see the same thing again in the first quarter. Just to give you some perspective, we were up north of 30% in the fourth quarter last year. So just -- it's really just more comparison related.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the time we have for questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Friel for concluding remarks.","Robert F. Friel","Great. So first of all, thank you for your questions and your continued interest in PerkinElmer.","In closing, as we enter 2013, I'm confident that PerkinElmer is well positioned for another year, during which we will continue to deliver strong shareholder returns and accelerate our growth through our focused approach on building our innovative capabilities in targeting high-growth markets.","Again, thank you for your interest in PerkinElmer, and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Tommy Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Tommy Thomas - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Thanks, Chris. Good afternoon and welcome to the PerkinElmer third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jamey Mock, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","If you have not received a copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com. Please note that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website until November 14, 2018.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future even if our estimates change, so you should not rely on any of today's forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date after today.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures we plan to use during this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is available as an attachment to our earnings press release. To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during this call that are not reconciled to GAAP in that attachment, we will provide reconciliations promptly.","I'm now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel. Rob?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report that PerkinElmer had another strong quarter, delivering revenue growth of 22% on a reported basis and core organic revenue growth of 7% with each of our core businesses growing organically 7%.","Including the impact of EUROIMMUN, our Diagnostics business grew organically 8% as EUROIMMUN once again grew double digits. While our organic growth exceeded our guidance, total adjusted dollar revenue of $675 million only equaled our guidance as changes in foreign currency rates relative to the dollar since the end of last quarter reduced revenue by approximately 2% or $10 million.","We're also pleased with our adjusted earnings per share growth in the quarter, which increased 23% over Q2 last year to $0.90 per share. This was $0.02 lower than our original guidance as the incremental income from the greater organic growth was more than offset by the negative impact of the foreign exchange movements previously mentioned as well as higher long-term compensation costs caused mostly by the strong growth of our stock price during the third quarter.","If we adjusted for the impact of these two unforecasted items, our adjusted EPS would have been $0.97 which would have beat our guidance by $0.05. While Jamey will discuss our financial results in more detail, we continue to be very pleased with both the breadth and level of organic growth as well as with our significant adjusted EPS growth.","As has been the case all the year, our strong top line organic growth is attributable to both favorable end market conditions and the benefits of focusing our portfolio on fewer technologies and higher growth end markets where we have differentiated capabilities and excellent customer relationships.","During the third quarter, we continued to make minor adjustments to the portfolio as we completed the sale of our multispectral imaging product through Akoya Biosciences, a portfolio company owned by Telegraph Hill Partners. We will continue to partner with Akoya on advanced tissue imaging technology to realize the potential of this technology to benefit immuno-oncology and other areas of disease research and treatments.","Also, we recently closed the acquisition of DANI Instruments. Based in Milan, Italy, DANI brings advanced capabilities in gas chromatography to help accelerate our workflow solutions in food, pharma and environmental end markets. We also continue to add access to a broader suite of potentially disruptive technologies and capabilities through our ongoing investments in smart technology companies and licensing efforts.","While both our organic and inorganic investments over the last couple years have been largely focused on increasing our growth profile, these moves have also resulted in our portfolio of technologies that are increasingly more synergistic and capable. It is clear to us that technologies, applications and customer needs are converging across DAS and Diagnostics as our customers' businesses evolve an alliance between therapeutics, diagnostics, food and digital health are intersecting.","As we continue to both add and focus our capabilities, the opportunities across PerkinElmer expand, allowing DAS to become an enabler of the sciences of diagnostics and vice versa. Creating a culture and organizational nimbleness to facilitate this as seamlessly as possible and respond quickly to these opportunities will provide, in our view, another lever to further support our customers and enable incremental growth.","To that end, we recently brought together our top 175 scientists, engineers and product managers with a particular emphasis on our new acquisitions to discuss opportunities to accelerate collaboration around several key areas including assay development, genomics, automated workflows and digital solutions. To give a sense of these opportunities, we see the ability to more comprehensively pull together our immunoassay development capabilities across the company, including our life science lyse reagents, our EUROIMMUN antibody and antigen development expertise, our automated newborn screening assay platforms and our lateral flow technologies from both Bioo Scientific and our Tulip immunodiagnostic business in India.","Another example of this is the development of assays for Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya viruses using our dried blood spot technologies as well as rapid lateral flow tests created by combining EUROIMMUN's antigen capabilities with lateral flow technologies from Tulip. These arboviruses are a substantial health threat in emerging markets and the introduction of these tests are enabling customers in rural areas to more broadly screen potential patients at risk for these dangerous infectious diseases.","In the food segment, we're looking at ways to leverage and combine our diagnostic focused applied genomics technologies in automation, liquid handling and molecular testing with our broader DAS food analysis capabilities. For example, we are developing genomic and molecular solutions to enable new applications including the rapidly growing area of cannabis testing, where we are creating a comprehensive analysis suite from extracting to analysis for pathogen detection and for active ingredient and strain characterization.","With the recent legalization of cannabis in Canada and other countries expected to follow soon, we see a significant market opportunity to support both the testing and basic research around cannabis.","As I've mentioned previously, this convergence of technologies applications and customer demands will be ignited by the move to digital and the power of data. Therefore, we are also looking at ways to build and expand our digital capabilities across the company.","This includes establishing common instrument and big data platforms to collect data and then discover insights that will ultimately better inform us and our customers. An important part of generating these new insights is use of artificial intelligence or AI. We've made several investments across the company in this area both in terms of external partnerships and collaborations as well as internal projects in building out our own AI capabilities.","We are now driving AI across almost all of our DAS and Diagnostic businesses including for image analysis in our high-content screening and immunodiagnostic businesses, for better determining the quality of grain in our food business and for applying AI in our services business to help to optimize our customers' laboratory productivity.","By taking advantage of our capabilities and technology platforms that span applications, strong operating capabilities and joint marketing opportunities, we are confident that PerkinElmer can meaningfully help lead this industry transformation.","One of the best examples of the potential of our cohesive portfolio is the story of our Vanadis non-invasive prenatal testing solution. The Vanadis solution leverages unique highly sensitive rolling circle amplification and our validation expertise of Diagnostics with the leading image detection capabilities of the DAS business.","Furthermore, this system is totally integrated workflow that leverages our current software being used in the biochemical prenatal screening today, thus allowing lab technicians to operate Vanadis with less than one week of training.","As we have been working with our customers to install and validate Vanadis in their labs, the reaction so far has been very positive and we expect to receive CE IVD approval very soon. Because this solution removes the technical complexity of NIPT while breaking down the cost barriers, we're excited to enable more women to have access to an accurate, low-cost method of screening trisomies and improve the standard of prenatal care on a global level.","As we begin to establish our priorities for 2019, our focus will continue to be on innovation and improving our customer experience within DAS and Diagnostics. However, we are increasingly looking at driving synergies across the businesses as well.","Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities from these additional cross PerkinElmer synergies to both expand our addressable markets and drive incremental revenue growth. We also believe that this will provide opportunities for efficiencies, and most importantly, enable us to innovate at an unprecedented pace, thereby facilitating continued acceleration of top line growth and operating margins.","Before turning the call over to Jamey, I want to briefly mention our end markets and touch on our guidance for the full year. As I mentioned previously, from a macro perspective, our markets continue to experience good demand.","Diagnostics, which represents 40% of our revenue, is continuing to benefit from a growing prevalence of infectious and autoimmune diseases, particularly in emerging markets. In addition, the increasing demand for earlier diagnosis and the rising adoption of new technologies are fueling growth across all three segments of reproductive health, immunodiagnostics and genomics. Slightly offsetting this is the continued decline in birth rates, particularly in China and the U.S.","In life sciences, which represents about 35% of our revenue, we continue to see robust demand in both product sales and services within the pharma and biotech markets, particularly in the U.S. and Asia. Within our food analysis business, strong growth is being driven by the rising outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, advances in technology for food safety testing, increasingly stringent regulations and the globalization of food supply.","Lastly, our environmental and applied markets generally track macroeconomic conditions and as such, experienced stronger growth in Asia and the Americas this quarter.","As a result of these favorable market conditions as well as our product portfolio and capabilities, through the first nine months of this year, every geographic region as well as all six market segments are growing 5% or better.","Now turning to our guidance. As you recall, our original forecast back in January for this year was full year organic growth, revenue growth of 4% to 5% and adjusted EPS of $3.50. Since then, we have raised our top line guidance each quarter and again this quarter we are now guiding full year core organic revenue growth of 6.5%.","On the bottom line, we are guiding to $3.60 for the full year, which on a foreign exchange adjusted basis is $0.21 higher than our original January guidance and $0.02 higher than guidance the last quarter and represents adjusted EPS growth of 24% versus 2017.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Jamey.","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Thanks, Rob, and good evening, everyone. I want to start with the financial highlights for the third quarter of 2018. Next I'll provide some additional color on our served end markets and detail on other financial metrics. I'll finish with the financial summary for the fourth quarter and the implications on our revised 2018 guidance.","Starting with the third quarter results, we continue to be pleased with the strength in our business as core organic revenue ex EUROIMMUN in the third quarter of 2018 grew approximately 7% on tougher prior-period comparisons. Adjusted revenue in the third quarter grew 22% to $675 million, matching our revenue guidance as higher organic revenue growth offset incremental foreign exchange headwinds. Acquisitions added approximately 16%.","By business segment, Diagnostics representing approximately 40% of total core sales grew 7% organically, driven by our immunodiagnostics and applied genomics business lines. Incorporating EUROIMMUN, Diagnostics would have grown 8% organically. Discovery & Analytical Solutions, representing approximately 60% of total sales, also grew approximately 7% organically in the third quarter, highlighted by good balance of strength in both life sciences and applied end markets. I will provide some additional color on both businesses in a moment.","Core revenues saw growth in all major geographies with double digit organic revenue growth in Asia, high single digit organic revenue growth in the Americas, and low single digit organic revenue growth in Europe. This represents five consecutive quarters of organic revenue growth in all major geographies.","In the emerging market regions, we continue to see double digit organic revenue growth once again driven by China and India. On a year-to-date basis, we are pleased to have delivered 7% organic revenue growth excluding EUROIMMUN and 8% organic revenue growth with EUROIMMUN. As Rob mentioned, we have experienced broad based strength experiencing, mid-single digit organic revenue growth in all end markets and geographies.","Moving to the details of our operational performance, third quarter adjusted gross margins were up 120 basis points, with year-to-date results up 140 basis points, largely driven by EUROIMMUN. This strong expansion has enabled us to make targeted investments, specifically increasing sales and marketing resources and R&D for disruptive technologies like Vanadis, enabling a better organic revenue growth profile for 2019 and beyond.","We believe that continued mix improvements along with productivity and strong leverage continues to give us confidence in our 22% adjusted operating margin target laid out to investors in 2017.","Operationally, for the third quarter of 2018, we delivered 90 basis points of adjusted operating margins when excluding foreign exchange and unplanned incremental compensation expenses. As you may recall, when guiding future quarters, we utilize the ending exchange rates from the prior quarter. Due to the volatility experienced in Q3, particularly in China and emerging markets, the actual year-over-year foreign exchange impact on adjusted operating margins was 20 basis points. To help you more clearly understand this dynamic, we have provided a foreign exchange reconciliation sheet on our website that is part of the Q3 2018 reporting package.","The unplanned compensation expense, which had a 60 basis point impact on our adjusted operating margins, was driven by a significant share price increase during the third quarter and higher projected performance driven by stronger revenue growth and an improved gross margin outlook.","As Rob mentioned, operationally, adjusted earnings per share would have been $0.97, however, the impact from foreign exchange headwinds of $0.03 and unplanned compensation expenses of $0.04 resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $0.90, an increase of 23% on a year-over-year basis.","Looking further into the key drivers within our segments for the third quarter of 2018, let's start with Discovery & Analytical Solutions. Our results were driven by balanced strong high single digit organic revenue growth in life sciences coupled with mid-single digit organic revenue growth in the applied market verticals.","Life sciences strength was driven by continued performance in the pharma biotech end market. Core pharmaceutical sales in our spectroscopy and chromatography product line saw good growth and we are especially enthused to see our customers focus more on their core drug discovery efforts, an area of strength for our portfolio.","Our reagent products and instruments for high throughput screening have benefited from a renewed focus on small molecule research. Our new in vivo imaging products launched late last year at the World Molecular Imaging Congress saw a very strong quarter of growth and were a key driver of the over-performance in DAS. Finally, we once again saw strength in our OneSource service business.","We experienced solid growth in Q3 from applied markets, driven by strong food product performance in spectroscopy, LC mass spec and Perten. Total food was up low double digits. The environmental and industrial segments combined to deliver strong organic revenue growth of 6%.","Switching to Diagnostics, core organic revenue growth grew 7%, driven by double digit organic revenue growth in immunodiagnostics and applied genomics with low single digit organic revenue growth in reproductive health.","Looking further within our Diagnostics business, we continue to see strong results at Tulip and Haoyuan, driving high teens growth in our immunodiagnostics segment. We experienced a good quarter in our genomics business as strong front-end sample prep results helped drive double digit organic revenue growth.","We continue to build on our momentum in the genetic testing business despite the near-term disruption from the implementation of a new lab information management system and feel good about the progress we've achieved toward our $50 million revenue goal by 2020. EUROIMMUN continues to impress with low teens organic revenue growth through the first three quarters of 2018.","Looking at disease modalities, autoimmune is approximately 60% of sales and their core capabilities helped drive 16% organic revenue growth through the third quarter. Autoimmune diseases unfortunately remain under-treated and under-diagnosed and some studies have shown that the annual incidence rate to be approximately 10%. Infectious disease, allergy and instrument sales for antigen detection represent the balance of EUROIMMUN sales and were also steady growers with combined double digit organic revenue growth. For the full year of 2018, we continue to expect approximately 15% organic revenue growth from EUROIMMUN.","Geographically for EUROIMMUN, high incidence rates and incremental global customer wins helped China and Germany experience organic revenue growth of low double digits and high teens respectively and combined with building momentum in the U.S. driven by menu expansion at a large reference lab, has enabled the organization to see continuing revenue growth into 2019.","Looking at below the line items, adjusted net interest and other expense for the third quarter was approximately $15 million and our adjusted tax rate was approximately 12% driven by discrete items. Looking ahead, we now see a full-year adjusted tax rate at 15% and 14% in the fourth quarter of 2018.","As Rob mentioned, we have sold our multispectral imaging business to Akoya Biosciences for approximately $37 million, resulting in a GAAP pre-tax gain of approximately $13 million. This business had year-to-date revenues of approximately $23 million and we have posted another reconciliation on our website to help you adjust your financial models. Based on certain ongoing service agreements, interest expense reduction and other revenues, we expect negligible adjusted EPS from this transaction in 2018.","Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion of debt and $150 million of cash. We exited the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.1 times, and we remain on track to finish the year below 3 times.","Turning to our cash flow performance, our third quarter operating cash flow from continuing operations saw strong sequential and year-over-year improvement. However, on a year-to-date basis, higher inventory levels driven by stronger organic revenue growth, overseas production moves to further increase our manufacturing localization and added inventory needed for our distributions center strategy as resulting in increased working capital use in 2018. We expect to make further progress in the fourth quarter, but forecast some of this improvement in inventory normalization to extend into 2019.","To wrap up the third quarter and year-to-date results, we continue to be enthused by our performance, which has resulted in 7% year-to-date core organic revenue growth and 25% adjusted earnings per share growth.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2018, we continue to believe that we are well positioned to drive solid organic revenue growth and provide strong financial results for our key stakeholders. For the fourth quarter 2018, we are forecasting reported revenues of $745 million, representing 16% reported revenue growth versus the comparable prior period.","Our guidance assumes approximately 5% core organic revenue growth, $102 million in sales from EUROIMMUN and core foreign currency headwinds of approximately $12 million on a year-over-year basis. EUROIMMUN had approximately $14 million of sales in Q4 2017 stub period that you need to back out to arrive at our quarterly revenue guidance.","In terms of adjusted earnings per share guidance, we are forecasting $1.16 for the fourth quarter, which represents 20% growth versus the comparable prior period. This forecast includes an additional $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange versus our August guidance as you will see on the foreign exchange reconciliation sheet posted to our website.","We are once again raising our full year 2018 core organic revenue growth guidance to 6.5%. This guidance continues to exclude EUROIMMUN which would add another 100 basis points. We now expect reported revenue for the year to be approximately $2.768 billion, a reduction of $12 million from the previous revenue guidance of $2.78 billion due to incremental foreign exchange headwinds of $21 million offset by improved organic growth in the third quarter.","Our revenue guidance incorporates EUROIMMUN sales of approximately $364 million, essentially the same as our previous guidance. We now forecast adjusted earnings per share of $3.60 for 2018, a reduction of $0.05 from the previous adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.65, driven by unplanned compensation expense of $0.04 and incremental foreign exchange headwinds of $0.07 offset by improved organic revenue growth of $0.02 and a lower tax rate of $0.04.","As I recap on our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance, we improved on our initial $3.50 guidance with $0.15 from better organic revenue growth, $0.15 from lower taxes offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of $0.11, $0.06 from higher interest expense and $0.03 from a higher share count to arrive at $3.60 of adjusted earnings per share or 24% adjusted earnings per share growth for the full year.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time we would like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Daniel Brennan with UBS. Your line is now open.","Daniel Gregory Brennan - UBS Securities LLC","Great, guys. Thanks for the question and congrats on the quarter.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Thank you.","Daniel Gregory Brennan - UBS Securities LLC","So Rob and Jamey, so on the DAS business, again another really strong quarter, another acceleration on a stat comp basis. You gave a lot of details in the prepared remarks, but could you tease out a little bit more what's enabled this growth? Because I kind of think this collection of businesses wasn't normally a 5% plus grow and that's what you've been putting up. How much of it's dependent on new products? How much of it is maybe a different commercial strategy, maybe some acquisitions? Maybe you can just tease out some of the drivers and how sustainable that is?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, Dan, thanks for the question. And I think you had a couple. But first of all, I would say, as Jamey mentioned, the performance first of all was broad-based, with really all the key end markets growing sort of high single digits or better.","But I think to your point, it's really broader than that. There's a lot of factors that are impacting the performance. I would say first of all, the markets are good. Obviously pharma and biotech are increasing spending, particularly, we're finding, in the drug discovery area. Food continues to see good growth because of whether it's expanded regulations or increasing consumer awareness.","But it's really broader than that for things like we're seeing nice growth from new products. We mentioned a couple particularly in the life science area this quarter. And the way I would think about it is, 2017, we really focused on significantly refreshing the analytical portfolio and that's continuing on nicely in 2018. And then earlier this year, we really focused on the life science area. So you saw some new products come out in the imaging area. Clearly on the reagent side, we've sort of refreshed there.","I would say the other thing that's helping our performance is our decision to narrow our focus on selected end markets where it's really contributed to both a more concentrated marketing and customer engagement approach. And again, focusing on those areas that inherently are higher growth.","And then finally, on the execution side, I would say particularly in the commercial organization, we've created much better alignment between product management. And actually, during the earlier part of this year we completed a \u2013 we trained the entire global sales force on a standardized, what I'll call is a lead-to-close process. And we're seeing that really improve our win rates.","So it's really a combination of things, but at the end of the day we feel very good about the performance of DAS. The team's executing well. They're at 7% organically year-to-date. And I think they go into 2019 with terrific momentum.","Daniel Gregory Brennan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you for that, Rob. And then maybe just as one follow-up kind of unrelated. But just can you just elaborate a bit on EUROIMMUN in the U.S.? Certainly Germany and China were strong and U.S. represents such a big greenfield opportunity. So now that you've had the business for a while, how should we think about the U.S. opportunity unfolding? Because I think when you did the deal, you contemplated this could be as much as like a $300 million market eventually for you. Thank you.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, I think we continue to feel very good about the opportunity in the U.S. and I think it is a significant market opportunity. I think the question is how long it takes to ramp up, and of course, it's coming off of a relatively small base. So we continue to see very strong growth rates in the U.S., unfortunately off their relatively low base. But I would say as we sort of go into the anniversary here, we haven't seen anything that diminishes in any way the opportunity, and probably in many ways, we see greater opportunity, I would say globally, but specifically in the U.S.","Daniel Gregory Brennan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. I'll start with one for Jamey on operating margins. About 150 basis points below with what we've been modeling. I guess that was all stock-based comp, is that the right interpretation? And how should we think about that going forward? And any guidance you can give us on the tax rate for 2019 given the leverage you saw this quarter and what you talked about for next?","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. Sure, Tycho. Yes. On the operating margins, it was about 60 basis points in the quarter related to stock-based comp and then another 20 basis points of pressure related to foreign exchange. So absent that, we would have been at about 19.9%.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then on the...","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, on the tax rate moving forward?","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Correct.","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. So as I said in my prepared remarks, I think we're now at 15% for the year, which is down 200 basis points since 2017. Some of that is more profits in low tax jurisdictions and some of that are some discrete items. So we're looking at it for next year, but it's a little too soon to call the actual guidance for next year I'd say.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. And then, Rob, just a follow-up on EUROIMMUN. Oh, go ahead.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","No. I was going to say, I know you asked a question relative to the incentive comp and how do we think about that sort of going forward. And maybe I'll just take a second to explain it because it may be a little unique. But so, if you think about our incentive comp for our officers, it's very largely performance-based; probably depending on the officer, anywhere from 60% to 70%. And we're talking about these three-year long-term performance based. It's all tied to the stock price, or at least some portion if it's tied, and it's mostly equity. However, there is a component of it that is paid in cash. And unlike the equity component, our accounting policy requires us to revalue the cash component each quarter depending on changes in our stock price.","So if you look at that cash component, and as I know you're well aware, our stock price increased over 25% in the third quarter. So normally in any given quarter, if our stock's moving around a little bit, it's not a material item, but because of the magnitude of the move, it's required us to record an expense as Jamey talked about.","Going forward, we generally don't model a lot of expense in there because obviously it's tough to predict our stock price. So going forward, we really wouldn't normally model much and again if the stock price moves 5%, it's not material. So, but like I said with the strong movement in the third quarter, that's what yielded the significant incentive compensation expense.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just one follow up on EUROIMMUN, you talked about I think some assay development initiatives at the beginning of the call. Was that specifically EUROIMMUN and any you're moving already to chemiluminescence versus ELISA given that's where kind of the majority of the market is today?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, so my comment on the assay development, although I talked about a specific instance where we're using EUROIMMUN antigen. It was really more broad based that says, say to imply that we're looking more across the company now and largely because some of the acquisitions we've made recently, so whether it's Bioo, whether it's Tulip, whether it's EUROIMMUN, we're finding that we've got significant opportunity to leverage those businesses whether it's their diagnostic businesses, the capabilities can go into DAS, so for example in the food area on the molecular side and vice versa.","And the specific example was one where we took capabilities from EUROIMMUN, capabilities from Tulip and our blood spot capability in newborn and really created not only a new product, but a new application that allowed us to go into a market that we're seeing nice growth in. So we're going to continue to look at opportunities to do that.","Specific to EUROIMMUN, the one thing that were quite excited about, and I think we've talked about this a couple times, they have very good capabilities in recombinant antibodies and antigens. So it allows us to get very specific antibodies for our assays, furthermore allows us to drive in the sort of new novel targets and gets faster time to market. So the point was just to say we're increasingly looking to leverage that and we think there's a significant opportunity as we go into 2019 and 2020 to benefit from that.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon. This is Chris on for Doug today. Thanks for taking my question.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Hi, Chris.","Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC","So I just want to start in Diagnostics. Diagnostics core revenue growth excluding EUROIMMUN has been accelerating as well. I know you have a number of new growth initiatives in the segment such as NGS testing, Vanadis and Tulip, so I'm curious as to how these are contributing to the solid core revenue growth rate? And can you also speak to just the sustainability of these trends?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, so as I mentioned it's coming from a number of areas. So our core, what I'll call our core immunodiagnostics which does not include EUROIMMUN grew high teens. And as I think you know that's mostly focused in emerging markets. So Tulip continues to grow double digits and our historical, call it Sym-Bio business or China diagnostic business continues to do quite well. In the applied genomics, we're also seeing very strong growth. That also grew double digits. That was fairly broad based geographically.","And so I think those contributed the majority of the growth. I would say when we look at our reproductive health, newborn only grew, I think it was 3% this quarter. I think year-to-date it's sort of mid-single and that's fundamentally because we're seeing some fairly significant headwinds from birthrates. So, the U.S. is down low single digits. Europe is down low single digits, China, we think is down, depending on the region of the country, anywhere from mid to high single digits.","So, the fact that newborn is growing, let's say, year-to-date in the mid-single digits, we feel pretty good about because clearly it's not sustainable to have those types of negative growth rates. So we're actually sort of as we go into 2019, we think we've got pretty good comps relative to the birthrates and we combine that with the success we're seeing this year with menu expansion and further penetration of newborns. We're quite excited about that. So, we think the bottom line is it is sustainable and when you put in the areas like the genetic testing and some of the other things we're doing, we think it potentially accelerates into 2019.","Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And just one follow-up question. To be clear, has there been any change in margin expectations separate from FX and compensation? Just based on your prepared remarks, it sounded like you were making some incremental investments due to the core revenue strength. Thanks.","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","No. No change in expectation. As I mentioned, foreign exchange had a significant impact as well as the incentive compensation, but the fundamentals are still there and we still see strong operating margin expansion in the 70 to 90 basis point range excluding foreign exchange and incentive compensation.","As for the investments we made, yes, I mean we are increasing R&D and sales and marketing resources, so R&D has gone up from 6.3% of revenue to 6.8% this year and then sales and marketing has also increased year-over-year. So we're continuing to think that that's going to improve the organic growth profile of the company.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. So, starting off, Rob, appreciate the comment that Diagnostics could accelerate into 2019. Would you care to comment on DAS into 2019? Is there anything we should be mindful of from a comparison standpoint whether it be on the pharma services business or anywhere else? Or do you think, or anything on the new product cycle front that we should be thinking about as we look at our models?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","I don't think so. As Jamey alluded to, it's a little early to talk about 2019. But I think from a trend perspective, we think the markets still look attractive here. We're continuing to come out with new products. We've got some clearly that we expect to get out in the earlier part of next year. I would say, obviously, the second quarter has got a little bit of tough comps and say did 10%, but I don't see anything sort of systemic that should create any significant headwinds for DAS.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. And then for my follow-up, Rob, I appreciate those comments on the cannabis industry at the start. So I was hoping you could perhaps quantify the opportunity there from an analytical instruments standpoint?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Well, I would say we're seeing very significant growth. But again sort of similar to the EUROIMMUN U.S. number, it's starting off of a relatively low base. But we think we've got probably, if not the, one of the most expansive capabilities when you look at the need to look at pesticide analysis and quality control of the cannabis. And so I think we could probably double the business going into 2019 off of right now it's probably about a $10 million business. It probably doubles in the 2019. Ultimately though, it's probably a $50 million to $100 million opportunity for us.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And that's helpful context. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Charles Steinman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. This is Charlie on for Patrick. Appreciate the guidance raise for organic growth. Just curious as we look out to 4Q, obviously a bit of a step down. Is that mostly just a product of the comp from last year? Or are there any kind of changes you're making in terms of the outlook by end markets?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","No. I would say, it's mostly attributable to comp. We're going up against I think a 7% number in fourth quarter of 2017. So we just want to be cognizant of that.","Charles Steinman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks. And then for Vanadis, recognize that the CE Mark hasn't come in yet, but are you still expecting, I think you'd called out a $5 million contribution previously for this year? And then as we think about going into 2019, what kind of ramp should we be thinking about for next year? Thanks.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So let me just spend a second on Vanadis. So I would say, we continue to go through the normal process for CE Mark approval. We've received I would say a couple of recent questions from the regulatory body and we've responded as quickly as possible. And I would say at this point we don't anticipate any problems with approval. Right now we understand the instrument and reagent reviews are complete. But the software is taking a little bit longer.","And I think as we've mentioned previously, we decided to use our LifeCycle software for Vanadis result reporting. And we felt this would provide an easy transition of the technology for recurring customers who use the LifeCycle for their biochemical prenatal testing. So the software now will not only incorporate risk factors, biochemical data and relevant maternal information, but also have the Vanadis data and we think this will give very complete information to the health care providers.","Unfortunate as I said, I think that's slowing down the approval a little bit, but we do think it's imminent here. But relative to the revenue side, I would say while its timing is somewhat later than at least originally anticipated, we continue to ramp up both the operations, the service capabilities. We're still on track to install the Vanadis in I think it's 10 labs this year. And beyond that, we'll work with biochemical customers in Europe to convert.","I would say on a revenue standpoint, we, in the fourth quarter forecast, we have taken it down a little bit. And what we're doing is we're focusing more on placing the instruments into the labs and I think as we mentioned before, a lot of these are reagent rental based, so we do think the revenue will be lower than what we initially anticipated. We don't think it impacts the 2019 ramp, and of course it's built into our forecast that Jamey talked about.","With regard to the 2019 revenue, again as we mentioned before, it's a little early to start talking about specific numbers in 2019. But clearly when we give guidance, we'll try and be specific as to what numbers to assume for Vanadis.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Good afternoon.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Rob, nice to see I guess more portfolio pruning if you will. Would be curious to what extent you see an opportunity or scope for additional divestitures similar to the multispectral imaging unit. And then given the balance sheet should be coming in south of 3 turns of net leverage at the end of the year, be curious how you're thinking about the M&A pipeline here?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So yeah, I mean, I think we've talked about before that somewhere in the sort of $50 million maybe $100 million revenue. So we continue to sort of I would say pressure test the portfolio to make sure that we've got the right group of assets. Could there be another one or two product lines that go, possibly, but I think I've been fairly consistent. I don't see any significant divestitures of the assets that we have today.","With regard to the pipeline, I think we continue to look at sort of bolt-on deals. I mentioned the DANI acquisition. It's a relatively small company in Italy, but we're excited about the capabilities they have, particularly around gas chromatography and more specifically in sort of headspace and auto sampling technologies. So we'll continue to do a number of those things.","I mean if you look at we did SSI in China, we did RHS in Australia a little earlier. I mean we'll probably spend $100 million this year. And hopefully in 2019 we'll step it up a little bit. As you point out, we're getting very comfortable with the balance sheet as we expect to end year under 3 times EBITDA. And particularly on the DAS side, we're focused in food and building out our reagent capabilities.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. And then a couple of housekeeping items for Jamey. What should we pencil in for free cash flow for the year as well as CapEx? Would be curious what's pulling that CapEx number higher this year and if you expect that to continue in 2019? And then any update on net interest expense for 2018?","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah so, Brandon, as I mentioned on the last call with regards to cash flow, we always have a stronger second half and in the third quarter that played out with adjusted free cash flow of just over $80 million versus the first half of $50 million. So penciling in for the year, there's probably a little bit of pressure versus our original 365 due to what I talked to in my prepared remarks. We've got the moves in Singapore, which is now planned to move in the first quarter, the moves in China, higher organic growth rate. Now we're not giving up on the goal but there might be $25 million to $50 million of pressure to that number. But we don't think it's anything structural and it should be corrected in the coming quarters here.","With regard to CapEx I'd pencil in $75 million to $80 million. I think we're roughly $60 million through the first three quarters so it shouldn't be too different from that. And then the last one was interest expense, is that right?","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. Net interest and other.","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Expense, yeah. So I think it will be pretty similar to the third quarter here. So, net $14 million or $15 million that we experienced in the third quarter, interest expense and other income, that is.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Mitchell Petersen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. This is actually Mitch Petersen on for Jack this afternoon. It looks like Europe took a step down in the quarter in terms of growth. I was just hoping you could unpack what you saw by end market there. And comment on if you're seeing any particular areas of weakness there. Thanks.","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. No, I mean, a little bit of this was a tougher comp year-over-year. But we had softer \u2013 it was a little softer in applied markets. Industrial down 3%. Food, we had some droughts in Europe, so that took a hit. So while food was up 10% or double digit overall, in Europe it was down pretty significantly due to the droughts in the summer here. And then we had pretty tough comparisons in pharma biotech year-over-year and in informatics. So I don't think anything structural though.","Mitchell Petersen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then on EUROIMMUN, I was hoping you could provide some more detail just on the cost and margin opportunity there. Where are margins today in relation to the Diagnostic average? And where do you think you can get those longer term? And what are some of the cost levers that you can pull to get you there? Thanks.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yes. So, I think as we mentioned, when we acquired EUROIMMUN, it was around 20% operating margins. Our Diagnostics business last year was in the low 30s, so that gives you a sense of sort of the opportunity. I would say throughout the year, and I would say this has largely been through the volume leverage, because I think as we've talked about, we haven't really done much from an integration perspective there, particularly on the cost side. So, we've seen a couple hundred basis points of margin expansion in EUROIMMUN just from the volume leverage and they continue to have very favorable mix. About 90% or 91% of their revenue is reagent based. So, I think we can just through volume leverage get that up to sort of mid maybe even high 20s. And then as we get into sort of maybe not 2019, but into 2020, we'll look at driving some synergies across the business from a cost perspective.","Mitchell Petersen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good afternoon. Thanks. Follow-up on Vanadis, Jamey, what is the assumption for the margin impact from that platform when it launches? I think it carries a pretty good profile once it's up and ramped. But I'm just curious about what you should expect on profitability in the immediate term when we do see the regulatory announcement.","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","I think it will depend, Dan, on how much we \u2013 as Rob mentioned, we think it's going to be more of a reagent rental model. But we're really figuring that out with customers right now, and it depends on how much they'll take on instrument sales versus reagent rentals. If it's more reagent rentals, we think that's accretive. If it's instrument sales, we might have to wait a little bit until some of the samples get processed. So, it's a little tough to tell for 2019 at this point.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. If you just had to use your baseline guess right now, I mean, what do you think the chances are that post the announcement, you end up talking about there being some dilution from the product just based on previous expectations?","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","If you're referring to the fourth quarter, Dan, I don't think it's going to be very material at all. As Rob mentioned, he said we're going to be less than $5 million. We've taken that down quite a bit. So in the guidance for the fourth quarter, it's very, very nominal. If you're referring to next year, that's a little tough.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe, Rob, on the expanded sequencing business, can you just touch on where you are with the validation of the NovaSeqs that you bought? I don't think you mentioned that. Is capacity a bottleneck there at all? And then how do you think you exit the year just in terms of the split between samples that are coming from patients versus pharma? And then maybe how does that change in 2019?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yes. So, we're clearly at a run rate sort of north of the $10 million that we talked about. So the demand for that business continues to be very strong. Jamey mentioned the fact that we put a new LIMS system in and that sort of closed a little bit of a bottleneck, but we're catching up with that. The five NovaSeqs have been added to the lab. They're in the process of being validated. I mean, I think that's probably going to come online either late in the fourth quarter or early 2019.","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","The only thing I'd add to that on the LIMS is \u2013 so that is how we work with customers from a receiving of a sample perspective. So that helps open up the intake. We still have one piece of software on our reporting system that won't be done until the first quarter, which really kind of rounds out our software implementation.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon here. And thanks for the time.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Good afternoon.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I had a question on EUROIMMUN. I wonder, Rob, now that you've had the business for roughly a year, if you could just take a step \u2013 I mean, we've talked about some of the regional opportunities, automation opportunities, a lot of the skill set there that might have been incremental to your thinking when we, back in the summer of 2017, were talking about the growth outlook for that business. Can you just talk about how your thinking has evolved on a medium-term growth outlook for EUROIMMUN? And then, sorry, while we're at it, Jamey, any chance you have the EUROIMMUN ex currency or core growth for the quarter?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","You want to...?","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yes. Core growth for the quarter ex currency was up 11%. And then year-to-date we're up 13%.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So, Steve, with regard to the growth, I mean, we've said for a fair amount of time that we think EUROIMMUN probably grows mid teens and our expectation is they'll achieve that in 2018. So, we don't see, or at least I don't see any reason why that changes over the next couple years.","With regard to growth, I would say the one thing that has changed since we've owned EUROIMMUN is our belief that the EUROIMMUN capabilities can drive incremental growth in the core PerkinElmer businesses. And I think that's been the biggest change as we sort of have a better appreciation for what their capabilities are, and as I sort of tried to give an impression in my prepared remarks is, we think increasingly that these assets as well as some of the other acquisitions we've made are very synergistic across whether it's therapeutics, diagnostics, food. I mean, there's clearly a blurring of the capabilities and technologies being used in those end markets. And I think we feel better about the opportunity for EUROIMMUN to enable incremental growth in what historically were the PerkinElmer markets.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just one clarification for Jamey. Jamey, and I should say thanks, Rob, for all the detail that you gave on the impact of the LTPP on comp expense in the quarter. Jamey, I just want to make sure that as you make the comment about expectations for the company to hit the 20%, beyond 2020 that is, margin goal, that number one, we expect this comp issue to be something of a one-off; we're kind of back to trend beyond this year.","And then number two, I wonder if you could sort of elaborate on what it is you've seen in your first several months here as CFO that gives you comfort giving us commentary about confidence in the medium-term margin plan? Thank you.","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, sure. With regards to the LTPP being a one-off, assuming a normal stock price increase, then it will be a one-off. If it drastically increases like it did in the third quarter then obviously we'll have an additional expense to that.","But what gives me confidence is, I mean, if you look at this year, we're going to be up well over 100 basis points excluding foreign exchange. And if you look at what we posted on the website, our foreign exchange this year will have an impact of an increase in revenue of $20 million and then a $0.10 pressure on EPS. So absent that, we're in the 120 to 150 range. So assuming that happens two more years in a row here, and we have full expectations that we're going to continue to grow, then that should replicate in the next couple years.","And I'd say it's driven by three things. One is the mix of businesses. So as the Diagnostics business grows faster, a la EUROIMMUN and the rest of the core, then that should have increased opportunity on our op margin line. Number two is the volume leverage. I've mentioned in the past that we don't have a lot of infrastructure that we need. We have a good base to be able to take advantage of. And three, we've got a lot of discipline around cost out. We've got a whole team, particularly on the DAS side, but also on the DX side that's working on product pare downs, different sourcing, value engineering.","And so I think as we look at the margin expansion, we think it's about a third, a third, a third in each of those categories, mix, leverage and then our cost out activities that we're driving.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good evening.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Good evening.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So actually I just wanted to follow up on Steve's question there. So I thought you said earlier in the quarter call that EUROIMMUN was tracking at 15%. Did I mishear that? Or that I think?","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yes. For the year, we're expecting 15%. So in the fourth quarter we're expecting it to be north of 20% in EUROIMMUN because we've got, as we look at our order book, we think that that's what it'll deliver. So year-to-date 13%, the fourth quarter in which we expect, as I said, I think is $102 million of sales. That gets you to the year of 15%.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Okay. And just you've done those three acquisitions and you gave us the divestiture amount. Can you tell us what incremental revenues are from the three acquisitions that you've done?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yes. So I think DANI is like about $10 million. SSI is less than that, probably more like $5 million.","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","RHS.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","And RHS was...","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","$1 million or $2 million.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, less than $5 million.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And pretty much everything else I wanted was asked so I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Your line is now open.","Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Just one from me. With the guidance range for core organic revenue growth for the year, what are the new assumptions for DAS versus Diagnostics? It sounds like most of the upside is in DAS. Is that right?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","You mean for the year or for the fourth quarter?","Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","For the year.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","You mean relative to the original guide, that's correct. I mean, where we're seeing most of the over-performance is in the DAS side relative to our guidance at the beginning of the year. That's correct.","Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi. Good evening. I have two questions for you. First, there was a comment regarding the LIMS system install in your genomic services business. Is the disruption that you've mentioned, are you through that now or is that something that lingers into the fourth quarter?","And then secondly, Rob, the increased stock comp expense, that it looks like you've done most mark-to-market, at least a portion of it. Will you get some of that back here in the fourth quarter now that the stock is lower than probably where it was during the third quarter?","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","I'll take the LIMS one. Hey, Steve. So as I've tried to mention earlier, there's really two portions to really complete our software package in genomics testing. One is the LIMS system which is up and running now. That will increase sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, the ability for us to take intake samples. And we do have a little bit of extra revenue in the fourth quarter as a result of that. But we're really not humming until the first quarter when we finalize our, what we call our ODIN system, which is really a reporting system. It's as opposed to the geneticist looking and writing out separately one by one every single sample. It's more of an automated system. So once that's really up and running, then it's kind of the flood gates open here, let's say.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","To answer the second question, yes, theoretically, if the stock stays exactly is where it is, we're down, I don't know, 6%, 7% from when we closed the quarter, at least when we closed the books. And so yes, the way it works is every quarter we revalue the cash compensation liability to whatever the stock price is.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to CEO and Chairman Rob Friel for any further remarks.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Well first of all, thanks for your questions and your interest in PerkinElmer. As we head into the end of the year, I continue to be very confident in our ability to drive our strategy and build upon the terrific momentum we've seen so far, which I think sets us up for an even more successful 2017.","Before I close the call though, I would like to mention that as I think some of you know, Tommy has recently been promoted to the CFO of our service business within DAS. And therefore this could be his last earnings call as Vice President of Investor Relations. I wanted to thank him publicly for his terrific efforts over the last six years, as he has both contemporized our Investor Relations function as well as increased the visibility of PerkinElmer within the investor community.","And while he tries to take more credit for the stock appreciation than he deserves, I must admit his impact was not insignificant. While he leaves big shoes to fill, we hopefully will have someone in the role by early next year. In the meantime, we've asked Tommy to do double duty. However I'm confident our service business will get lots of Tommy's attention, as I know he has many ideas to help elevate its performance.","With that, let me close the call. Thanks again for joining us this afternoon and have a great evening and hope you enjoy what's left of Halloween.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

And with that, I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Tommy Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Tommy J. Thomas","Thanks, Regina. Good afternoon, and welcome to the PerkinElmer's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","If you have not received a copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com or from our toll-free investor hotline, 1 (877) PKI-NYSE. Please note, this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website for 2 weeks from today.","Before we begin, we need to remind you, everyone, of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings.

Rob?","Robert F. Friel","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon, and thank you, all, for joining us today. I'm pleased to report another excellent quarter for PerkinElmer, in which we continued to make strong progress against our strategic priorities and also delivered solid financial performance exceeding our forecasted revenue growth and adjusted profitability.","During the third quarter, our adjusted revenue grew 11% year-over-year, which represents the 10th quarter in a row that we have reported growth of 10% or higher.","Organic growth for the quarter was 6%, and over the last 10 quarters, our organic growth has averaged over 7%. While Andy will get into specific details of the organic revenue growth, I would like to mention a couple of the key drivers of this strong performance.","Our Human Health business experienced 10% organic growth, with both our diagnostic and research businesses benefiting from strong demand in emerging markets, especially in Asia. In particular, our newborn screening, medical image and infectious disease testing all experienced double-digit growth in the quarter.","In our Environmental Health business, the majority of our growth came from the service business and the sale of environmental analysis products into emerging markets.","Our adjusted operating margins increased another 60 basis points in the third quarter after funding our planned spending increases on several initiatives to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, reduce our administrative costs and expand our capabilities into the emerging markets.","Marking this 10th quarter of consecutive double-digit adjusted revenue growth, I wanted to take a moment to give my perspective on why I think we've been able to continue delivering consistent and differentiated growth despite a choppy macroeconomic environment.","When signs began appearing in late 2008, that uncertain times might be on the horizon, we made a conscious decision to not back away from our long-term vision of the company's portfolio, geographic focus areas and critical mission. As a result, over the last 3 years, we have made important investments in every aspect of our business through acquisitions, acceleration of R&D spending and operational improvement initiatives. Ultimately, our performance over this period is an incredible tribute to the dedication and the excellence of our people.","Internally, our culture is now one where we all are deeply motivated by advancing our mission of improving the health and safety of people and the environment and energized by the positive difference that is being made.","The strength of our organization, our steadfast commitment to growth and our operational excellence have been critically important to advancing our mission, as our growth and increased profitability enables us to invest in new innovations and capabilities to solve our customers' needs.","In the past year, we've increased our spending in research and development by over $20 million to bolster our innovation efforts. And since the beginning of 2009, we have increased R&D spending by over $40 million, which represents approximately 10% of our increase in revenue during that time.","This increased R&D spending has resulted in a strong pipeline of new products and services that have been major contributors to our strong organic growth over the last several quarters. In addition to higher R&D spending, we also have continued to make significant investments to accelerate operational improvements and expand our capability to better serve our customers.","For example, in the third quarter, we opened our new Shanghai headquarters, which quadruples our footprint in this critical location and features 3 new state-of-the-art centers dedicated to developing application solutions to address the needs of our growing Chinese customer base.","In addition, our new diagnostics, R&D and manufacturing facility outside Shanghai, in Taichung, received the manufacturing certification from the SFDA. This site has now begun production of high-quality diagnostic reagents and testing instruments for the rapidly growing emerging markets.","During the quarter, we broke ground on a new global Personalized Health Center of Excellence in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, establishing a centralized location that brings together some of our best minds to focus on solving critical needs for our research customers.","We also opened a new customer relationship center in Krakow, Poland to position PerkinElmer to capitalize on the rapid growth and business potential that we see in Eastern Europe, while enabling us to leverage the recent economic competitiveness.","And finally, we've accelerated our progress in realigning our manufacturing assets to improve efficiencies and to better reflect our changing geographic distribution of revenue.","During the third quarter, we also began a number of new initiatives that will continue to fuel our growth. I thought I would give you an example of these initiatives in each of our 3 key end markets.","In diagnostics, we partnered with one of our customers to establish a lab in a lab to provide realtime PCR assays to help diagnose SCID in newborns. SCID is a terrible disease that attacks the immune system and can make children extremely vulnerable to infectious disease. However, with new advances in recent years, children with SCID can now be successfully treated, and screening for this disease has begun in several U.S. states.","In the research area, we announced the strategic relationship with TIBCO for exclusive licensing rights of its Spotfire data visualization and discovery software. Spotfire and our other informatics offerings are critical solutions for our customers, as they harness and extract value from the big data they are producing with exponential speed.","And in the environmental market, we are collaborating to embed our ultrasensitive air analyzers into air monitoring systems to detect the existence and concentrations of potentially toxic compounds.","These activities, as well as many others, are what inspire us and also give us the conviction to once again raise our adjusted revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year.","We are still in a challenging economic environment. Fortunately, we've been able to do well due to our long-term commitment to serving our customers, strength in several key end markets, our differentiated product offerings and an organization that is focused on making a safer, healthier planet.","I would now like to turn the call over to Andy, who will provide more details on our financial performance in the quarter and full year guidance.","Frank A. Wilson","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon.","Consistent with prior quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, as well as the financial summary of our third quarter results. And then we'll, as usual, open it up for questions.","As Rob mentioned, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter, delivering another solid quarter of organic revenue growth.","Reported revenue for the third quarter increased 13%, while adjusted revenue for the third quarter increased by 11% to $514.8 million as compared to the third quarter of 2011.","Organic revenue for the quarter increased 6% as compared to the same period a year ago.","Adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.45, driven by stronger top line growth, partially offset by productivity and growth investments deployed in the quarter.","By segment, organic revenue increased by 10% and 3% in our Human Health and Environmental Health segments, respectively, versus the same period last year.","By geography, organic revenue in both the Americas and Europe grew at a low single-digit rate, while Asia grew by more than 20%.","We continued to experience strong demand from emerging territories with organic revenue growth in the BRIC countries, up greater than 20%, despite a growth comparison of more than 20% in the prior period.","I'd also like to note that the majority of our businesses in emerging territories, specifically, the BRIC countries and especially China, continued to experience strong demand, reflecting the strength of PerkinElmer's brand and product portfolio, as well as the attractiveness of the verticals we serve.","Looking at organic revenue by product category, recurring revenue, which includes reagents, consumables and service, grew mid-single digits in the quarter, while instruments and components grew at a low double-digit rate when compared to the third quarter of 2011, primarily a result of strong demand in Human Health.","From an end market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represented approximately 50% of total revenue in the quarter. We serve 2 end markets: in the human health diagnostics, which represented 28% of total revenue; and research, which represented 22% of total revenue.","Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business increased low double digits during the quarter, with notable contributions from both our Screening and Medical Imaging businesses.","In our Screening business, we continued to experience solid demand across most major segments of the portfolio. This business is continuing to benefit from the stabilization of U.S. birthrates and the expansion of our prenatal, newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in key regions outside the U.S.","We are extremely pleased with our sales uptake in China and feel that we are well positioned from a geographic and end customer perspective to continue driving strong organic sales in the region.","Our Medical Imaging business continued to see broad-based organic growth across all key technologies and applications in the period, with particular strength in traditional medical diagnostic imaging offerings.","We continue to be pleased with the exception -- acceptance of our CMOS imaging technology, which provides us access into new verticals, including mammography, dental and orthopedics.","Organic revenue in our Research business rebounded from the second quarter, growing at a high single digits in the quarter, the result of strength in automation, High Content Screening, imaging and liquid handling capabilities, as well as somewhat easier year-over-year comparisons.","Moving to Environmental Health, which represented 50% of total revenue in the third quarter, we served 3 end markets: Laboratory Services, which represented 25% of total revenue, Environmental and Safety, which represented 18% of total revenue; and Industrial, which represented 7% of total revenue.","During the quarter, we experienced high single-digit organic growth in the Laboratory Services business, low single-digit growth in the Environmental and Safety segment and a low single-digit decline in organic revenue growth for the Industrial segment.","We remain pleased with the performance of our Environmental Health business. In China, organic revenue, once again, grew by more than 20%, benefiting from our market-leading environmental product applications.","In addition, we continue to see good acceptance of our laboratory service and informatics offerings, as we help our lab customers better manage their critical laboratory assets and related data needs.","Now looking at our margin performance in the period, adjusted operating margins expanded approximately 60 basis points in the third quarter to 15.2%, while adjusted operating income increased 16% in the quarter to $78.3 million.","We are pleased with our adjusted operating margin improvement in the quarter, particularly given the growth and productivity investments made during the quarter, as well as a difficult year-over-year comparison, resulting from the impact of a significantly higher stock price on our stock-based compensation expense.","By segment, adjusted operating margins in our Human Health business for the quarter were 22%, representing an increase of approximately 180 basis points as compared to the third quarter of 2011. The combination of volume leverage, favorable mix and productivity gains contributed to the strong performance.","Our Environmental Health segment delivered adjusted operating margins of 12%, representing a decrease of approximately 30 basis points. This decline was within our expectations. It was primarily due to the growth in productivity investments just mentioned.","GAAP operating income from continuing operations was $43.2 million in the third quarter of 2012 versus $36.1 million for the same period a year ago. Our GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 8%. And on a non-GAAP basis, our adjusted tax rate was approximately 22%, which is slightly lower than our previous guidance communicated in August. We now expect our non-GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 22%.","GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2012 was $0.25. Adjusted EPS was $0.45 in the third quarter of 2012, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range for the quarter of $0.42 to $0.44 and a 5% improvement over the same period last year.","I want to point out that our third quarter 2012 EPS results include approximately $0.02 per share of incremental interest costs related to the terming out of our variable debt in the fourth quarter of 2011, an excess of the funding requirements needed to fund the Caliper acquisition.","Our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter of 2012 was approximately 115 million shares, and our ending share count was approximately 114.2 million shares.","Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the third quarter with approximately $930 million of debt and approximately $171 million of cash. We continue to make progress in our delevering efforts, as we exited the quarter with a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3x and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.9x.","Looking at our cash flow performance. Year-to-date operating cash flow from the continuing operations was $113.8 million, as it compared to $151.5 million in the comparable period of 2011.","Operating cash flow performance in the quarter was affected by restructuring payments, higher working capital needs, including incremental needs related to the previously announced manufacturing moves to Singapore and China and royalty payments related to Spotfire licensing.","Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter, which represented the continuation of the momentum we experienced in the first half of the year.","Looking at our performance for the first 9 months of 2012, organic revenues increased over 5%; adjusted operating margins expanded by approximately 150 basis points to 15.8%; and adjusted earnings per share grew to $1.41, a 17% improvement over the comparable period last year.","Now I'd like to discuss our fourth quarter 2012 guidance in a bit more detail. But before I do, I want to remind everyone of our performance in the fourth quarter of 2011. As you may recall, we experienced a particularly strong finish last year due to the timing of the Caliper acquisition and the strong year-end demand across most of the portfolio. In fact, roughly 2\/3 of our businesses experienced double-digit growth in the fourth quarter of 2011, which resulted in adjusted operating margin expansion of 250 basis points and adjusted EPS growth of 38%. Consequentially, this performance creates a very challenging year-over-year comparison. Despite this challenge, we still believe we can grow revenue organically, expand operating margins and grow our earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2012.","As the fourth quarter guidance, we now expect fourth quarter adjusted revenue to be in the range of $570 million to $580 million, with foreign-currency headwinds of approximately 1% based on current exchange rates and organic revenue in the range of 2% to 4%.","Regarding adjusted operating margins, we expect modest margin expansion in the fourth quarter due to very difficult comparisons related to the Caliper stub period in the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as the ongoing growth in productivity investments we mentioned previously.","Based on these assumptions, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2012 to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.66. And for the full year, we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance from a range of $2 to $2.05 to a new range of $2.05 to $2.07.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And gentlemen, your first question today comes from the line of Paul Knight with CLSA.","Bryan Kipp","This is Bryan Kipp on behalf of Paul. Just to start off, how has pharma performed as an end market? Has it been stable for you all, worse or improving?","Robert F. Friel","Sure. I would say what we saw in pharma was actually -- as Andy mentioned, we saw our Research business up high single digits. It was driven to a large extent by growth in Asia. I would say we continue to see softness in the Americas. Europe was, I think, in sort of low mid-single digit growth, but we really saw the strength in Asia. And in our case, the strength was much stronger in instruments than reagents. So I would say a little bit better than what we've seen. But again, the majority of the strength is coming from Asia.","Bryan Kipp","Okay. And just an additional question. We saw -- it looks like a 400-bp fall in adjusted Environmental op margin. You guys kind of alluded to that a little bit. Can you give any more color on that and just any specific analytical instruments that were better or worse in the quarter?","Frank A. Wilson","Two questions. I'll answer the first part. Maybe Rob can answer the second part. This is Andy. In the quarter, we had talked about deploying some investments, and these really center around the movement of some of our manufacturing operations to China and Singapore. And those expenses hit gross margin in the quarter and were predominantly within Environmental Health. In addition, there were also some costs related to our shared service consolidation. We've now or -- now up and running with our shared service center, and so both Environmental and Human Health were impacted by those costs. So the combination of those 2, plus some of the instrument revenue and the mix towards instruments, really contributed to that performance in the quarter.","Robert F. Friel","But I would say, overall, the performance of Environmental actually came in pretty much what we thought. And when we look at back at the end markets, environmental analysis was actually strong, sort of mid-single-digit growth, again, predominantly outside the U.S. Services did well in the quarter, and to the -- the only area where we saw a little bit of weakness, and particularly toward the end of the quarter, was clearly on the Industrial side, which, as Andy mentioned, is less than 10% of our revenue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with Macquarie. Well, we'll go ahead and take a question then from the line of Ross Muken with ISI.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So on Asia, I mean are you surprised with sort of the success you've had there? I mean, obviously, we've seen all the data on some of the challenges, particularly in China and even in other parts of Southeast Asia. And so, I know it's more on the healthcare side. I mean, can you sort of tease out between the 3 segments? Is there key there, your Life Sciences, Environmental, Industrial, kind of what you saw on some of those key countries?","Robert F. Friel","Ross, actually, we saw a pretty good growth across all 3 of the end markets, and I was just there a couple of weeks ago. And you continue to see a lot of emphasis in investment by the Chinese government, first of all, in improving the access to healthcare for all the citizens there. So we see a significant amount of investment. There, we saw a growth both on the newborn side, as well as the infectious disease, a very strong growth. On the research side, we continue, as I mentioned, to see strong traction there. And I think a lot of that is coming from the multinationals that they continue to build capability in that part of the world. And similarly, we saw a good growth on the environmental side, as I think they recognize is that is going to continue to big a big barrier to their continued industrialization. And so they're investing money in cleaning up the environment. So I would say, across the board, we saw a continued growth throughout China.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And in general, on the P&L, I mean you guys have just been really killing it all year. You outperformed peers on organic. You've done well on the margin. The one thing we haven't seen from you guys in a bit has been on the capital deployment side. There, we've been mainly focused obviously on debt pay-down. Andy, where are we getting with the leverage? Do we feel like you guys could be back in market buying stock at some point? Is that the focus? Is M&A still more on the radar? Where are we sort of with that part of the equation?","Frank A. Wilson","Well, I think if you look at our debt to EBITDA, as we exit the third quarter, we're essentially where we were before the Caliper acquisition. So I think we're in a pretty good spot from a leverage perspective. I think we continue to evaluate opportunities more from -- on the M&A side more from a bolt-on perspective. And we also are socializing the opportunity to buy back some shares. We -- as indicated before, we'd like to take out some of the float -- or some of the creep that's come in to the stock. So I think the opportunity to do that is -- has increased, just given our de-leveraging. I think we have been very active on the M&A side. So I think it'll be something probably moving into '13. There could be something small between now and then.","Robert F. Friel","Yes. Ross, what I would say is, and I think we mentioned this, in the early part of the year, we took some time to focus internally on making sure we got the integration of the acquisitions because, as you know, we're quite active in '11. And we also wanted to bring the debt burden down a little bit. I would say, probably in the last couple of months, we've ramped up the M&A activity, and we've started to fill up the pipeline. And I wouldn't be surprised to see a couple of bolt-on deals here may -- possibly getting done in the next couple of quarters.","Frank A. Wilson","Yes. I think the only thing I'd add do that, Ross, is our authorization for a buyback expired in October, and it was renewed for another 2 years.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","A question on the investments you're making to leverage the business. How should we think about the timing of when you're going to harvest those investments? So you mentioned you're already up and running with the shared service organization. Does that mean those investments are now going to decline and we're going to see growth in the fourth quarter or beginning of '13? Or just pacing of that.","Frank A. Wilson","Yes. I -- when I said we were up and running with our shared service center in Poland, we've established that shared service center. We're making the investments now. Those investments will continue through early part of the second quarter, so we'll start to see some savings from that really in the second half of next year. I think on the facility move, I think you're also looking into '13, probably maybe a little early in the year but a 2013 situation where we'll start to see some of those savings come through the numbers. But there's still some more investments, and I just want to make sure that that's clear, that we will continue to be making some investments probably up through the second quarter of 2013.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then my follow-up question, Rob and Andy, are you managing the business any differently in front of the uncertainty around the fiscal cliff in the U.S.? And if you are, and in what -- in what fashion?","Robert F. Friel","I don't think so. I mean, I think when we look at the -- at least, first, we started with sequestration and I think we've talked about this in the past that the impact was -- it's relatively small. I think what we said is when you look at NIH, it's probably 5% or less of our revenue. So obviously, we're conscious of it, but we're not seeing really any significant impact or pullback at this point. Having said that, I don't know that I would attribute to the fiscal cliff. But clearly, we'll continue to manage it in light of a fairly uncertain global economic environment. So I don't know if I'd call out either the fiscal cliff or the sequestration as an issue. But I think we are conscious of some real uncertainties, so whether it's Europe, whether it's some of the concerns in emerging markets, as well as some of the issues we've seen here in the U.S. So I think we have been conscious of growth opportunities as we get into '13 here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Zarak Khurshid with Wedbush Securities.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes, Zarak Khurshid of Wedbush. I guess so much for hard landing in China. Dovetailing on that prior question, can you just talk about strategically -- would you say you're pushing or investing more aggressively into that region more than you originally anticipated, say, 6 months ago? And then kind of as you look further out, what are the fears for that region around kind of competition or sort of knockoff products or patent infringement, things like that?","Robert F. Friel","So I would say, the answer to your first question is we continue to accelerate our investments in that part of the world because we continued to be encouraged by, as I mentioned before, the opportunities across all our end markets. So I think that the answer to your question is yes. And I talked a little bit about the investment in both real estate from the standpoint of a much larger headquarter facility. We're putting a global software development there. We're adding application, a laboratory there. We're expanding manufacturing and R&D capacity there. And I would say all is -- mostly for China, we also see it as an opportunity to leverage that into other emerging markets because, obviously, the beneficial cost position. I would say the biggest concern or barrier we see there, quite frankly, is management talent. As we continue to expand, as we continue to put much more capability there, it's really having the management capability to absorb the additional capacity. And so we're spending a lot of time. We've -- as part of this additional investment into our headquarters, we actually put, as part of that, a development and learning center that we now have in our China headquarter facility. And like I said, that's the area we're spending a lot of time on. From a patent infringement, and those type of things -- we're not as concerned about that. And we have some, actually, R&D capabilities in China that we continue to expand upon.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just as a follow-up, on the free cash flow side of things, can you just talk a little bit about the Spotfire license? Should we expect that to continue? And what do you think kind of the run rate is for, say, maybe this year or next year? Normalized...","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I mean, specific to the Spotfire license, the way that transaction was established was, in a large extent, a prepaid license agreement. And so there'll be continued payments for the next couple of years. And as we continue to distribute that and sell that product, we'll sort of work off that prepayment.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Can you quantify it?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I would say we're not really, at this point, talking about it. It's not a significant amount of money, but we're not really talking about the -- at sort of the agreement with our partner, not to get into specifics of the financial arrangement.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jon Wood with Jefferies.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So Andy, I appreciate some of the color on cash flow, but third quarter is particularly weak. Can you guys still do about 100% of adjusted net income? Or is that too much of a stretch at this point?","Frank A. Wilson","I would say our performance year-to-date is in line what we expected. I think, given the investments we're making with some of these initiatives, some of them requiring capital investments and restructuring investments, it's got to be tough to get to 100%. I mean I think we'll have a very strong performance in the fourth quarter, both in working capital and free cash flow, as we start to normalize some of the working capital because of the manufacturing moves. But -- I mean we are consciously spending on these initiatives. So I would say, this year, it may be a little short of that. But I think our long-term goal is to always be north of 100%.","Robert F. Friel","Yes. So Jon, one of the things, and you probably have an appreciation of it, as we move some of our manufacturing facilities, we're clearly building some excess inventory to give us some leeway there, as we sort of train people in other areas. So some of that's going to clearly carry over into the early part of 2013. And so that additional investment in inventory, while we think it's appropriate, while we continue to make these moves, probably is going to make it difficult for us to achieve what we've historically been able to do, which is to match our free cash flow with our net income.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, very good, understood. A follow-up, can you call out the Caliper -- how the Caliper business did on the top line, as well as any comments on kind of costs rationalization or where you are you on the -- in the actual integration there?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. The Caliper business continues to perform very well. We're ahead of the model from a profitability and accretion perspective. It - quite frankly, it's really becoming quite difficult to sort of track the revenue, because we're in the point now where -- we've even got to the point where we're substituting products, so in the liquid handling, the JANUS for the Zephyr and FMT versus the Spectrum. So it's not really that meaningful anymore, but I would tell you that, again, they're doing well relative to the organic growth calculations for PerkinElmer. They added slightly, but I would call it less than 30 basis points.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I had 2, one on Diagnostics and the other one on margins. On Diagnostics, could you maybe just give us some color on the overall volume environment and your sense of birthrate, how that's driving the business both domestically and abroad?","Robert F. Friel","So in the U.S., based on our numbers, we would say birthrates are up about 1% over the last 12 months. So obviously, we're not having the headwind that we had over the last couple of years. It's obviously driving some nice growth there. And outside the U.S., while birthrates have been positive, what's really driving the growth is much higher adoption. And for example, we saw in the quarter, as we do in every quarter, we continue to add additional countries or regions. So we saw some wins in Europe, parts of Germany, Norway and Italy we added. And of course, we continue to see strong expansion in Middle East and particularly, as I mentioned before, in China. So outside the U.S., it was clearly much stronger. But we also saw good growth in the U.S. as well because of back to a positive birthrate.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Daniel Brennan with Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe the first question would just kind of be more on the economy and the end markets, maybe an update on the pacing of demand. As you exited the quarter, looking towards Q4 -- I didn't hear, in your guidance, the Q4. Cited very tough comps but still generating good growth, but didn't really hear anything too much about the economy. Most of the companies are at least kind of referencing conditions. Are you seeing any impact? Is there any -- instrument is also growing greater than -- reagents was kind of interesting. We'd love to take get your take there.","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I wouldn't suggest that we're sort of immune to what's happening in the overall global economy. But I would say, because I think some of our end markets are more resilient than some of the others, we're not being as impacted. I would say, as the third quarter played out, the industrial end markets -- clearly, we saw some softening there as we got into the later part of Q3. Other than that, and as we said, that's less than 10% -- other than that, I would say, our end markets were fairly consistent through the quarter. So I would say a little softening on the industrial side. Other than that, fairly consistent.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then maybe on the Screening business, Andy gave kind of an interesting conversation on our conference about China and kind of a number of tests that are being done there today and what the opportunities. So I'd love to hear your kind of thoughts maybe within China, kind of where you guys are today and kind of maybe where you envisioned, maybe on a test basis, kind of growing that up kind of -- what's the opportunity to look at a few years? And kind of what would -- kind of how would that translate into a growth impact?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I would -- in China, specifically, the opportunity, number one is on the newborn side. And obviously, they have a lot of births there, in the sort of 15 million to 16 million births per year. Currently, depending on where you are in China, it's anywhere from 2 to 4 tests. And as you probably know, in the U.S. right now, the standard of care is 29. So there's a significant opportunity to continue to expand, not only the number of children that are tested but also the amount of tests. So we're excited by that opportunity. And then also on the diagnostic side where -- largely, what we're doing there is infectious disease for hepatitis B, C and HIV are our larger tests. We're seeing a nice opportunity there, particularly this year, because what you've seen is, for surgeries now there that's done in China, they're now requiring 5 tests for various infectious disease, and that's driving a lot of our growth. So we continue to see a nice runway to continue to expand diagnostic test, particularly in the verticals that we serve within China.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a first cleanup question, could you increase the pace of restructuring this quarter to compensate for the fact that you delayed some of the productivity spend and investment that you had planed originally in Q2? If I remember correctly, your operating margin benefited by about 80 bps due to those delays, so I'm just wondering whether there was a full catch-up this quarter. And what's the right way to think about the pacing of further investment heading into Q4?","Frank A. Wilson","No. I think that the -- from a restructuring perspective, there was a fairly small impact. From an overall productivity and growth initiative perspective, that really is being spread over 2 quarters, so we saw about half of that in the third quarter. We'll see the other half in the fourth quarter.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Yes, really what I was trying to get at is, were margins almost artificially, in a way, depressed this quarter because you delayed some of that spend from Q2 into Q3?","Frank A. Wilson","Yes. I mean if you look at our remarks in expansion of 60 basis points, about 80 of that -- on top of that, we had about 80 basis points of margin contraction due to our investments in the quarter. And that there was also, as I mentioned, in my prepared remarks, a fairly significant comparison on our stock-based compensation due to the change in stock price. So those 2 items were the 2 kind of significant spike-outs that I would mention, and combined, would have said we were up about 150 basis points.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And sorry to beat a dead horse on the Environmental Health, specifically, the Industrial subsegment. But Environmental Health did come up a little bit light of Street consensus. I'm just curious, relative to your internal plan, was this also the case? And if you came up a little bit lighter than planned here, was it truly all industrial? And if so, is it fair to conclude that there were really no changes in competitive or pricing dynamics?","Robert F. Friel","As I sort of alluded to before, Industrial -- or Environmental came in about what we thought. We probably would've pegged that in Q3 about 3% to 4%. If you look back in Q3 of '11, it did have a fairly difficult comparison, particularly in the instrument side. We saw a very strong growth on the instrument side in Q3 of last year, so we knew we were cycling up against that. So maybe Industrial was a little bit lighter than we thought. I would say, overall, it's probably about down mid-single-digits. But when you look at the rest of the business, on the instrument side, we saw a good growth. And as I mentioned, service was up mid to high single digits.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Ramesh C. Donthamsetty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Ramesh in for Tycho. It looks like, excluding Caliper and obviously, you mentioned that the Research or the Life Sciences business is merging with Caliper quite nicely now. But it looks like some of the other sort of legacy Research businesses, the radiochemical business perhaps, the high throughput screening, those businesses may have done better or at least stabilized a little bit. Can you talk just about how those trended in the quarter?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I think that's fair. I mean when you look at high single digits for the Research business, clearly, the -- I would call the historical PerkinElmer businesses have done better in Q3 than they've done over the last couple of quarters. Again, it's getting a little hard to sort of parcel that out as precisely as we've had historically. But I would say, a couple drivers to that. One is they did have some fairly easy comparisons. They were actually down low single digits in Q3 of '11. I would say, that's one thing. Second is -- I mean whenever you're dealing in sort of the research, particularly with high-end instruments, you're going to have some timing, sort of fall in and out of a quarter. And clearly, we were a little short in Q2. I think we recovered some of that in Q3. And then the other factor is we are seeing a benefit from the PerkinElmer instruments of having the Caliper products sort of in our tool chest, if you will. And as we go out there, we can talk about some of the exciting products for Caliper, as well as some of the exciting for PerkinElmer. I think we are getting some ancillary benefit of a pull-through on the -- on historical PerkinElmer products.","Ramesh C. Donthamsetty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just a follow-up, guys, on the software business and informatics. I guess, how are you approaching integrating Geospiza and maybe Cambridgesoft into the Life Sciences business? And how a PKI informatics is going to work, I guess, under the still of the Environmental Health umbrella?","Robert F. Friel","So what we are in the process of doing is taking a lot of -- virtually all of the informatics and Geospiza and merging it with the research. And that's something that we'll -- we're in the process of doing now. So probably going into 2013, we think it makes a lot more sense to have the informatics business more aligned with sort of the Caliper and the research businesses. And so, I think you'll see that coming out into '13.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A lot of my questions have been answered, so I'm just going to fish around the edges here. So when you look at your mix of business geographically, and also your manufacturing, I guess, where do you see the business in -- from a, particularly from an emerging market, international -- non-U.S. non-Europe sort of standpoint now and, say, 3 years from now? And I guess, how much of your manufacturing footprint are you going to be able to move over as well? I'm just trying to get a sense of what -- how much more opportunity there is in those markets for you.","Robert F. Friel","Well, I think from a revenue perspective, we talked about private emerging markets being around 28%, and given the growth differential we're seeing now, and I think we'd continue for some period of time. In addition to sort of our investment priorities, I could clearly see that gets to mid-30s over the next couple of years. From a manufacturing perspective, we're clearly under-weighted in the Asian region right now, and so that's why we've embarked on this initiative to move a lot more of the production there. And again, not primarily driven by costs, really it's trying to get better alignment between where our manufacturing is and where our customer base is. And so I think we've got a fair amount of opportunity. We've, like I said, embarked on a couple of these now, where we'd like to be fairly better aligned. So we've got 35% of our revenue there. At least 30% our manufacturing is coming out of there, and that's really the intention. So we have a roadmap right now over the next couple of years that will be much better matched between our revenue profile and our manufacturing cost profile.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great, that's actually very helpful. When you look at the -- sticking with the China theme, when you look at the infectious disease testing that you're doing there, it's like -- what's the basis of your platform? And I guess, who are you running into from a competition standpoint? Are you running into the [indiscernible] of the world, for example? What's just the lay of the land there?","Robert F. Friel","So our assays are fundamentally around fluorescence or time-resolved fluorescence. It's the technology. We're generally targeted the Tier 2 hospitals. And so that's where we're getting good inroads, because we provide sort of a cost structure base on China but bringing sort of technology and brand associated with a multinational. And so we can price the products a little bit above the locals and under the sort of classical international companies. And that's what's allowing us to take a lot of share.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And one final question, speaking on the competition. You know, we've obviously seen lot of changes in the -- some of your traditional businesses, in chemical testing, in environmental as you've seen some obviously varying [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] expansion. What's the pricing environment going on in that space? Are things fairly still rational?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I think they're rational, but they're tight from the standpoint of a lot of people. If you're talking specifically around the analytical or instrument space, there's more supply than demand. And particularly, as we see the industrial end markets starting to look like slowing, I think that's only going to get worse. So I think it is a difficult pricing environment. But I would say, people are still rational. But it this -- I would say price discounting is accelerating.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Dan Arias of UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Andy, I'm not sure if I missed it, but can you parse out instrument growth or decline specifically for Environmental and Human Health?","Frank A. Wilson","I didn't give that breakout. I'm mean, overall, instruments were up 10%. And I would say the Human Health instruments were kind of high single and environmental were low single. And most of the growth in Environmental Health instruments were in emerging territories.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then on the emerging territories, and China specifically, just given the way that you're talking about investments and expenditures there, do you think that margins stay above the corporate average for the foreseeable future? Or does that gap start to close and come down to the mean over time?","Frank A. Wilson","I'm sorry, could you repeat the question? I didn't quite understand the first part of it.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just looking at the margins in China and the way that you're investing there and how that looks relative to the corporate average.","Frank A. Wilson","Well, they've been in line with the corporate average. And if anything, they've actually been improving. We obviously have lower gross margins but have a lower cost base as well. So they've been in line. I think, over time, with some of the manufacturing moves and some of the infrastructure moves, I think we will see China margins ahead of company average.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I guess one last one, I think you get this question pretty consistently. But on OneSource, what are the pricing and market share change dynamics looking like in that part of the business?","Robert F. Friel","Say that again, I'm sorry, I missed the beginning of that question.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","In the OneSource business, I'm just curious about pricing and market share changes. Obviously, you have a big competitor that seems like they're doing well. But clearly, it's doing well for you as well. So I'm just trying to understand the business a little better, the market a little better.","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I mean, I think the dynamics in this environment right now is sort of similar as I mentioned on the analytical instruments. It's sort of an aggressive pricing environment. And we're -- we've got a very good position with a lot of our customers. And so I think we feel good about our capabilities there. But I think there is continued pricing competition there, particularly across some of the bigger contracts that are up for bid. Fortunately, because in a lot of cases, we're the incumbent. I think we understand the opportunities there, and I think -- feel we're in a very good position to be able to identify where we can take efficiencies and work within -- partner with our customers to sort of drive those savings where we sort of both benefit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier with Maxim Group.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Can you quantify or provide some qualitative comments on the benefit that your microfluidics business is realizing from the recent Ion Proton commercialization?","Kevin Hrusovsky","Yes. Bryan, this is Kevin Hrusovsky. We're actually continuing to make great headway on all aspects of our microfluidics relative to sample prep. We actually have had, in the last 2 quarters, continued build-out of our platforms, both from a sample prep and quality control. And we've made it agnostic to Life and to Illumina, as well as some of the newer entrants. We're feeling pretty good that, that will only help. So the more traction they get, we do believe it's going to be a positive for our business.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Any way to estimate for every new sequence there -- every new desktop sequence there that is sold out in the market? You got maybe 20% of those or 40% of the new placements?","Kevin Hrusovsky","Yes. We've got some algorithms that we built basically to try to test the market, but it's too early for us to be able to know how we're going to secure that. But we do think it's going to be north of 10%. But we're just -- at this point, it's premature.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the Environmental side of the business, did you see any material benefit in the quarter, Rob? Do you see any material benefit in the quarter from the Chinese food labeling law that takes effect in January 1? And do you expect to see any material improvement in the fourth quarter?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I would say that something we've seen for the last couple of quarters. There's the new regulation where they've got to put nutritional labeling on their food now. It's something that's driven our growth probably since Q2 of this year. So I think clearly, we're seeing a benefit in China as a result of those new regulations.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Rob, the softening you saw in the Industrials business, is that continuing for Q4?","Robert F. Friel","Say it again, Peter, I'm sorry I missed the...","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Sorry, that softening in that Industrials business, does that continue into Q4?","Robert F. Friel","You mean the -- yes, I think we have seen that continue sort of from an industrial perspective. As I said, it was -- we started to see it sort of mid-Q3. And I would say, it continues here in Q4. So our assumption in our guidance is that the industrial markets will be soft, and in fact, will probably be down year-over-year from a revenue perspective.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And have you made any changes in the sales force around that business? Is it that concerning?","Robert F. Friel","I wouldn't say we're at the point now we're sort of adjusting our sales force. And again, a lot of our sales force is based on technology to some extent. So we look for other markets to sort of focus some of the products in. But at this point, we're not making changes to our sales force.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then were there any pricing pressures across the various business lines during the quarter?","Robert F. Friel","We talked about that a little bit earlier, where I would say, clearly, in the environmental area, on the instrument side, we continue to see fairly severe discounting going on relative to the competition. So I think that's an area we see a lot of pricing. Outside of that, I would say, in the Human Health area, where I think the products are much more differentiated, less so.","Frank A. Wilson","One thing I -- while we have a brief moment, one thing I'd like to add and just clarify, I know this is going to come out in the -- in print. But the question around instruments, total PKI was up high single digit, environmental Health was up low single, and Human Health was up low double. I just wanted to clarify because I think my comments before didn't make a lot of sense.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","I'm just wondering, on China, it sounds like a lot of the growth there was driven by instruments. So I'm just wondering what your thoughts for on the sustainability of that going forward and if anything was kind of onetime or anything like that this quarter.","Robert F. Friel","Well, I would say, if you look at the growth in  China, it was really across the board both instruments and reagents. So we saw it on the instrument side. I would say, when you look in research, it was largely on the instrument side. But clearly, when you go into diagnostics, that's largely a reagent business anyway. And when you go in the environmental side, it was a little bit of both on the service as well as the instrument. So it was fairly broad-based from both instruments and reagents. With regard to your question, if we see it's sustainable, we do. I think we continue to feel very good about our position there, our product offerings and our organization in China. And so we continue to expect that China will continue to provide good growth for us.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then just one other thing was with acquisitions adding 18 points to your Human Health business, were there any other acquisitions in there other than Caliper? Because just doing the math, it seems like Caliper probably didn't grow that much, is that correct?","Robert F. Friel","Well, the answer to your question is, it was only Caliper is in the acquisition number.","Frank A. Wilson","All the informatics acquisitions anniversaried in the second quarter.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. So it was just Caliper.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jeff Elliott with Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the strength, the traditional medical imaging that you called out. And just to follow-up on the tax -- on the manufacturing moves, can we see the impact on the tax rate as you expand overseas perhaps?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I think it could. I mean, as we put more and more of our profitability outside the U.S., clearly, we have a lower tax rate in Asia than we do in both Europe and the U.S. So I think it does provide some downward pressure on the tax rate. With regard to the medical imaging, we actually saw a nice growth really across all aspects of the business. So radiology, both oncology, and I think any spike-out in particular, while small numbers, our new entry into CMOS with our Dexela acquisition actually saw a very strong growth. And as Andy also mentioned, it gets us to new couple of other end markets that we're quite pleased about. So in the medical imaging area, we actually saw a nice growth across all of our end market applications.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And I know you have the Investor Day coming up in December. Just curious, any kind of early highlights you can share with us?","Frank A. Wilson","I think we're still trying to finalize those plans. Nothing has been set on stone. So we'll have to get back to you on both dates and content.","Operator","You have a follow-up question from the line of Jon Groberg.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So just following up on what you said, Andy. This is going to be my question. As Human Health instruments grew low double digits but Rob talked about...","Frank A. Wilson","Low single... They were low single digits. I'm sorry, Human Health was low double digits, yes, correct.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","It was low double digits. I think I got you, right?","Frank A. Wilson","You did.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So -- and you already talked about the decrementals [ph] in Environmental. But I guess my question is, it seems -- normally, we think about if instruments grow faster than consumables, that actually is a negative mix on margins. But Human Health is where you saw, obviously, some good margin expansion. So if you can just maybe talk about what happened with mix, was that -- is that imaging strength? Or is there something else going on in Human Health?","Frank A. Wilson","Well, I think we saw a pretty good performance across the board. I don't know if there was anything in particular that spiked out on mix.","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I would say the other thing is when you look at particularly the research area, you don't see as much disparity on the margins. I think classically, the big disparity we see between reagents and instruments is more on the diagnostic side, where a lot of cases, you're placing the instruments and then getting the reagents. When you look more on the research side, there's -- I mean, clearly, reagents are still more profitable. There's a much closer sort of match there between what the gross margins are. And so consequently, a lot of the instrument growth was driven by the research side. And so therefore, I don't think it was as detrimental on our gross margins as you might think.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","All right. And then it seems like -- it seems fairly interesting. And then one more on Human Health, as you look out to '13, are you guys anticipating any impacts from the medical device tax? I know a lot of the diagnostic stuff is overseas in China, and so I'm just curious what you're...","Robert F. Friel","Right. Yes, I mean our calculation right now says it's a relatively minor impact for us, again, because a lot of our business is outside the U.S. I mean, I would say it's, right now, sort of less than $5 million is the impact. But we continue to sort of try and understand some of the issues that regulations are still yet to be forthcoming on.","All right. So with that, let me wrap it up. First of all, let me thank all for you for your participation and continued interest in PerkinElmer. As we look to close out another strong year, I just feel great about our future because of our ability to grow, and most importantly, our dedication to making a lasting difference in the world. And I think we've got a great organization, and I'm quite excited about the future at PerkinElmer.","So thank you, all, for joining us, and have a great evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for your participation today.

My name is Jasmine, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Tommy Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Tommy Thomas","Thank you, Jasmine. Good afternoon and welcome to the PerkinElmer second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me in the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. If you have not received a copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website until August 13, 2015.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future, even if our estimates change. So you should not rely on any of today\u2019s forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date after today.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures we plan to use during this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available as an attachment to our earnings press release. To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during the call that are not reconciled to GAAP in that attachment, we will provide reconciliations promptly.","I\u2019m now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel. Rob?","Robert Friel","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019m pleased to report we deliver strong quarter financially achieving good growth on the top-line and continuing to expand both growth and operating margins, enabling us to exceed the high-end of both our revenue and EPS guidance range. In addition, we may notable progress against our operational and strategies priorities positioning us to deliver on our longer term objectives of accelerating revenue growth and profitability.","While Andy will provide details on our financial performance, on a constant currency basis revenue grew 8% consistent of 4% organic growth and 4% from recent acquisitions while our adjusted earnings per share grew 12%. During the first half of the year, adjusted operating margins have increased 90 basis points and adjusted EPS is up 15% both on a constant currency basis against this factor of the strong financial results, I would like to briefly discuss some of the highlights from the quarter as well as touch on a few areas of potential macroeconomic headwinds.","First, I\u2019d like to emphasize the growth of our new products. We continue to be very pleased with our Research & Development efforts as investments made over last year or so are starting to manifest in a number of successful new products.","During the first year for the year we increased R&D spending by over 10% on a constant currency basis and continue to believe driving innovation into the market will be a key component through accelerating our longer term growth.","In particular, many of our recently introduced products within the research market are gaining traction including the upper Phoenix high content imager and our labchip touch Microfluidics offering for NGS sample prep which resulted in our research business growing high single digits last quarter. In addition to the growth of new product, our OneSource services business once again delivered very strong results.","Our former customers continue to view OneSource as a trusted partner capable of meeting their needs for a wide range of services from instrument maintenance, asset management or lab relocation to scientific and lab IT consulting services.","Our growth in pharma and biotech has also been boosted by our decision early in the year to integrate onesource and a room for nice offerings into our research sales organization. This allows us to more effectively deliver complete innovative solutions tailored to the specific needs of our customers, while building even stronger longer term customer relationships.","During the second quarter, we grew revenue from our top 20 global pharma and biotech accounts double-digit versus the second quarter of last year and the recent announcement of our strategic collaboration with Albany Molecular Research is a prime example of the early success from this approach. PrekinElmer will be providing scientists working in AMRI's drug discovery center at the Buffalo Medical Innovation & Commercialization Hub with solutions to support cutting edge research.","Most importantly these offerings scientists working in AMRI's drug discovery center at the buffalo medical innovation and commercialization up with solutions to support cutting edge research.","Most importantly these offerings span the breadth of our capabilities and include cellular imaging solutions, analytical and visualization software and onsite technical and service support. Another highlight in the quarter was a continued global expansion of our diagnostics business which achieved key milestone in supporting the rapid adoption of newborn screening and emerging markets. As you may recall, four years ago we helped Egypt establish the world's largest newborn screening lab and we are pleased with the recent decision to expand the screening menu to include PKU testing for over 2 million birth each year.","Also during the quarter, we continue to see strong demand in China for our newborn screening offering and we experienced sequentially growth in our Haoyuan blood screening business in China. We are closely tracking order rates as government mandates for nucleic acid blood testing take effect and we continue to believe we are well positioned to capture a significant share of this market.","On the environmental health side, all of our new products introduced at Pittcon are now in the marketplace and coaster new manage is encouraging. In addition, our ICP-MS has experienced good growth and demand remains high for our unique metal particle detection solution and multi element analysts capability. Furthermore, the integration of Perten is effectively complete and our consolidated food analysis offerings are capturing greater mindshare with customers in this attractive segment.","While we are excited about our myriad of opportunities, we see going forward, we are mindful of the macroeconomic environment that while consistent with our outlook from the beginning of the year still presents some challenges and concerns. In China while we continue to expect double-digit growth from our diagnostics offerings, ordering patterns with environmental end market and government tenders continue to be choppy.","Additionally, Japan's academic funding environment has also become difficult to predict and Europe remained soft but stable as it wrestles with the mixed economic outlook and the implications from a Greek bailout.","The macro concerns aside, I remain confident in our ability to executive and drive both revenue growth in margin expansion in the second half.","Therefore looking at our guidance, we are reconfirming our previously stated guidance of mid-single organic growth for the full year and modestly raising the bottom end so that our adjusted earnings per share guidance is now $2.55 to $2.60 which represents 13% to 15% constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth. I would now like to turn the call over to Andy.","Andy Wilson","Thanks Rob and good afternoon everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I will provide some additional color on our end markets, provide a financial summary of our second quarter results and details around our third quarter and full year 2015 guidance. Given the impact of foreign currency on the comparability of our results I will once again provide much of my commentary on a constant currency basis in order to better portrait the results of the year. As Rob mentioned we reported 8% constant currency revenue growth and 4% organic revenue growth in the quarter with foreign exchange representing a headwind of approximately 7%.","Adjusted revenues were 564 million in the second quarter as compared to 557 million in the same period a year ago exceeding the high-end of our guidance revenue range driven by broad based demand.","Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.60, up 12% on a constant currency basis from $0.59 in the comparable period a year ago. Our quarterly results were $0.02 about the mid-point of our guidance range driven by favorable mix and continued operating leverage. Looking at our geographic results globally, we experienced mid-single digit organic revenue growth across all major geographies in end market. We saw improved results in Europe and stable demand in China where we continue to be encouraged by the resiliency of our serve markets. ","As to our operating results, second quarter adjusted gross margin were 47%, up 50 basis points on a constant currency basis driven primarily by volume leverage, mix and productivity gains. Second quarter adjusted SG&A was 24.2%, 50 basis points below the same period a year ago, the result have continued operating leverage from our indirect spend initiatives.","Research & Development spending in the second quarter as a percentage of revenue was up 40 basis points as compared to the same period a year ago driven by continued investments and innovative new product development and incremental investments at Perten. We expect full year R&D spending to increase over 2014 levels by 30 to 50 basis points.","Overall, we were pleased with our operational performance in the second quarter as we expanded our constant currency adjusted operating margins over 50 basis points. For the first half of 2015, constant currency adjusted operating margins have expanded approximately 90 basis points. Net interest and other expense in the second quarter was approximately $11 million, up from 9 million in the comparable period a year ago, driven primarily by the impact of foreign currency. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was approximately 20% and we expect our adjusted tax rate for the full year to be approximately 21%.","Switching to the segments. Second quarter organic revenues and our Human Health business increased approximately 5% Environmental Health organic revenues grew approximately 3%. From an end market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 61% of reported revenue in the quarter with diagnostics contributing 28% segment revenue and research generating 33% of segment revenue.","Organic revenue growth from our diagnostics business increased mid-single digit despite a high-single-digits comparison in the second quarter last year. Our results were driven by strength in our newborn and infectious disease testing solutions, which continue to see strong uptake throughout emerging markets offset by a low-single digit organic decline in medical imaging due to difficult prior year comparisons and customer ordering patterns. While we are really encouraged by the broad acceptance of our new [indiscernible] offerings, we believe the second half will remain challenging for medical imaging.","We experienced a strong performance in China growing double digits in the quarter during part to the continued ramp of our Haoyuan business. We believe that the conversion of a ELISA base testing to nucleic acid testing for the screening of blood represents a significant opportunity for PerkinElmer. While we are somewhat more optimistic on our outlook for the second half of 2015 as the government begins to enforce regulations to better secure the China\u2019s domestic blood supply.","Organic revenue and our research business grew high-single-digits in the second quarter driven by ongoing success from our recent new product launches including the Opera Phenix strengths from our automation systems offerings, strong growth in OneSource multi-vendor services and someone easier prior year comparison.","As Rob mentioned, we are pleased with the early success from our new go-to-market strategy and research and the increased traction we started to see with our Pharmaceutical and biotech customers. We are seeing an improvement in global academic and government end markets with Japan being the exception while pharma and biotech remain stable. We continue to expect research sales to grow low-single digit for the year primarily impacted by the steep declines in Japan.","Moving to our Environmental Health business which represent approximately 39% of reported revenue in the quarter, revenues grew 3% organically in line with our expectations. Our second quarter reported results benefited from increased demand in an around environmental and through the applications driven to a large extent by success from our inorganic and chrom offering in the addition of Perten. We\u2019re pleased to report that Perten had a solid quarter as their sale cycle closely follows the harvesting season, we expect sales and profitability to increase sequentially in the third quarter as a result of these seasonality.","Turning to balance sheet, we finish the second quarter which is under 1 billion of debt and approximately 200 million of cash. We exit the quarter with a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.2 times and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.8 times. Turning to cash flow we have a strong quarter with adjusted operating cash flow from continuing operations are 71 million versus 54 million in 2014.","Despite higher working capital, primarily result of the timing of additional inventory requirements supporting our new product introductions. As we get to the seasonally stronger second half, we expect inventory levels to moderate in our working capital metrics to improve. Looking ahead to the third quarter in the balance of the year, we believe we\u2019re well positioned to deliver a solid operational performance.","As we exit the second quarter and move into the second half of 2015, we\u2019re mindful of the mix macroeconomic picture. Our dollar strength is continuing to present modest headwinds and emerging markets specifically South America and parts of Asia while [indiscernible] demand continue to be mixed in Japan and China.","As a result, we expect reported revenues for the year to begin the range of 2.25 billion or 2.3 billion which represents approximately 7% constant currency growth at the mid-point. Our guidance continues to reflect organic revenue growth from approximately 3% to 5%. We\u2019re tightening our adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2015 to be in a range of $2.55 to $2.60 with a mid-point of approximately $2.57 which represents constant currency earnings per share growth as 13% to 15%.","Implicit in this guidance range is adjusted operating margin expansion of 30 to 50 basis points. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $42 to $44 million and our adjusted tax-rate is expected to be 21% with a flat weighted average share count of approximately 113.5 million shares.","For the third quarter, we're forecasting reported revenues to be in the range of $550 million to $560 million which represents approximately 7% constant currency revenue growth and organic revenue growth of 4% to 5%. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.60 which represents 12% constant currency adjusted earnings growth at the midpoint.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator at this time we\u2019d like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Please proceed.","Dan Arias","Good afternoon guys. I want to talk a little bit about China as we just take, as to little bit of what you saw on the environmental side and then on the blood screening side of things, it sounds like things are picking up there, I just point that you are thinking that you actually will have all of the donated blood in China tested molecular I mean as you assumption that compliance does go to a 100?","Robert Friel","I think our view is it go to 100, but its probably going to take 18 months to two years to get fully implemented. As you know the law was suppose to be effective at the first of this year, but I think our view its taken some time to get all the labs setup to be able to do that and so I would say the enforcement is fairly lacks, but I would say probably late \u201916 is our best guess of when that occur and probably what you will see is it will occur first on the east coast and you will see it move it across to the west.","But we\u2019re starting to see as I think if we have mentioned on the last call, we saw the move from sort of the regional governments to the federal government and while we think that's delayed it a bit in the implementation which you will see is bigger tender and we\u2019re starting to see that coming out and as sort of mentioned in the prepared remarks we feel good about our ability to win share there.","With regard to it sort of the border China, I would say first all, we continue to believe that both access to healthcare and the clean water and food will be high priorities and continue to strong organic growth, so I would say we continue to feel like high single-digits probably make sense for us for 2015, and we just go buy end market for us diagnostics, I think Andy talked about this continue to be strong we saw good double-digit growth in diagnostic supported by [audio gap] three pieces of the business, newborn, infectious disease and blood screening. On a research side also pretty good growth there and it was sort of mid-single maybe little bit better than that and environmental was up low single and what we saw was really almost a tale of two cities.","In the area food and environmental, we saw strong growth sort of mid-teens and in the area of sort of more industrial, we actually saw some headwinds there from the stand-point that they are -- our business there was not significant decline in the quarter. So we just sort of put really together you saw environmental in the sort of low single-digit.","Dan Arias","Okay. That's great color appreciate that. And then Andy on the expense line if I remember correctly I think you are kind of optimistic about the ability to drive some savings on the indirect spending side of things this year, are you realizing the level that you are hoping there and I guess when you look at the back half of the year to the extent that you are seeing in those savings, are you more likely to invest those or might you let those flow through? Thanks.","Andy Wilson","Sure, well I think half way through the year, I feel like we\u2019re on track, we were looking at $10 million boggy year-over-year. We aggregated the first half at 6 million, I think we\u2019re started to gain some momentum the roll out is now global and we\u2019re seeing a fairly significant uptake with the organization around it we are spending a lot of time now on upside services, and I think what you are going to see is the impact of that not only on the expense side, but you should start to see on the working capital side, because I think if you look at our payables we saw little improvement in accounts payables and part of that's due to our renegotiation, some contracts with vendors as part of this indirect spin process. So I think we feel like that we\u2019re pretty much on track I would say.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi [indiscernible] Will you give us an update on the M&A pipeline? How are you thinking about your capital deployment priorities here, with the balance sheet position under two turns of net leverage?","Robert Friel","Thank you, first of all, we feel good about the pipeline I think our hope and expectation is -- we able to do something roughly toward the end of the year. It\u2019s always difficult to predict those types of things, but I think we feel like, we will be able to put some capital to use here on the M&A, which I would say we have a preferences deployed in that matter, but if we find ourselves in a situation where we are unable to do that for let say for a period of time then we got to probably do share buybacks.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks very helpful and we give an update on the water partnership, how is that initial rollup progressing and do you soon vision that being roughly mutual to net revenues for the year?","Robert Friel","Yes, we mentioned last quarter I mean water partnership I really think that is more of a longer term strategic move, I think is a number of reasons to do that one was, first of all enable our partners to simply their workflow around sort of one software which is in power, it allows us to focus our resources in areas where we can be more differentiated and hopefully it allows us to drive some incremental revenue by first of all supplying waters LC products to some of our customers maybe driving more incremental products by allowing us to package arranges with our customers where there is multiple analytical techniques and also was getting GC on in power I think there is an opportunity to hope for the -- to sell more into the pharmaceutical industry.","Having said that in the short term there is some investment, there is clearly some disruption, there is training required of the sales people, so as I think we mentioned last quarter, we don't really expect to see much of an impact in 2015, and really look towards \u201816 and post to really drive some incremental revenue growth.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Ross Muken","You spend a lot of time on sort of the macro and you are cautionary and it is helpful because it\u2019s obviously something more or less look at broader spectrum and focus but was there anything pasting in the business whether is in China or elsewhere that gave you a bit caution or maybe in some of the additional industrial markets or is it just sort of recognition of all the data that we\u2019ve look at and now one into coming ahead of yourselves given some of those volatility standpoints?","Robert Friel","Well, I would say those are couple of things we sort of mentioned affect Japan still seems to be difficult to predict on the academic funding side. Well, the budgets been improved our experience has been that\u2019s been sort of spotty in challenging. So well, it\u2019s a not a big part of our business it\u2019s something that we\u2019re a little cautious about. I\u2019d say the other area that we\u2019re cautious about is on the medical imaging side and we\u2019re seeing some of the revenue challenge is there particularly in the back half.","So that was other two areas that I would say we\u2019re little concern. The medical imaging is probably not macro, it\u2019s probably more customer ordering patterns. But I would say on the Japanese side that\u2019s macro indicator. And I would say the other one I would probably put out or again small for us, but obviously the economic condition in Brazil is challenging. So those are two I would expect on the emerging markets that we\u2019re just looking at order and patterns we\u2019re little concern about.","Ross Muken","And on the research side, if you had to tease out boxes versus reagents versus services, anecdotally, how would you feel about those three buckets?","Robert Friel","Well, I would say we were pleasantly surprised on the box side. I mentioned some of the new products, but if you look at our cellular imaging, the microfluidics and automation we saw very strong growth there. So we are pleased with that service also did well OneSource at a strong quarter and I would say the reagents was just sort of laagered in the quarter.","Ross Muken","And Andy just remind us days impact in Q3, I talk that was where you guys pickup quite a bit of volume or at least the extra week. How do we think about that in the context that the core guide?","Frank Wilson","I think that first half is very hard to predict exactly what the impact of that\u2019s going to be, I mean what happens every six years. And I would say its factor into our guidance, I think that you look at the mix of our revenue a lot of it\u2019s not impact of other days. So I would say that in my opinion it\u2019s in the numbers, it maybe a percent or so. But if we do better than that obviously we\u2019re not going to be engage by our existing guidance.","Robert Friel","See in our opinion there is a lot of debate on this internally is any point we do this every six year. So I would say this is under core competency I was trying to predict what the impact will be. But our viewer is even when you look at our reagent business. A lot of our business is in sort of daily or weekly orders. Even though is look at the newborn screening side, it sort of bundle purchases. So I would say we\u2019re enabling we\u2019ll be conservative year, but we\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re not going to see a significant pick-up from the additional days, particular when you look at the how they fall within the calendar.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Bill Quirk","Just a question for you, I guess going back to Japan. You mentioned couple of times in the call, it\u2019s obviously a pretty difficult research environment to predict. So I guess two part question, one I seen the guidance assumes some ongoing challenges there? And then I guess second piece of that is I guess how you thinking about the longer term here are you inherently assuming that we should be some release the fund to bounce back in 2016?","Robert Friel","So I would say the answer your first question is yes. We\u2019ve assume fairly modest revenue for Japan for the remainder of the year. And I would say beyond 2015 will just sort of assess there when we get there. I mean is it fair assumption to say that some point the funds will be released and maybe we\u2019ll see a catch up. But I guess we\u2019ll just sort of call that as we get in the \u201916, but our assumptions for the remainder of \u201915 is that we\u2019ll continue to see challenges and we\u2019ve got basically no growth assumes for the remainder of the year.","Bill Quirk","And then secondly, I guess back to newborn screening in China. Just help us think a little bit about I guess from a parameters of that growth. Is this still largely initial adoption or are you seeing any sort of menu expansion maybe in some of the wealth your coastal areas?","Robert Friel","So I would say, it\u2019s a little bit of both. I mentioned this quarter that we got our GSP which is are automated platform certified by CFDA. And I think that\u2019s allowing us to obviously sell more those and penetrate by allowing in automated platform, it\u2019s allowing some of the areas within China to expand our menu. And so it\u2019s a combination of the menu expansion as well as adoption. But I would tell you right now is that China is probably close to 85% adopted so we have been pleased to see that good portion of the children in China now been screened.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.","Doug Schenkel","My first question is just I guess a follow up on the macroeconomic dynamics in China and Japan that you have talked about and have come up a bit in the Q&A, just to be clear, have you changed what you embedded into guidance for growth in these markets? And if so what are the offsets?","Robert Friel","I would say China, no; Japan, yes. And I would say the offsets have been a little bit on the pharmaceutical and research side. And we have seen clearly some growth there and again some of that is I think new products and we believe our execution within the combined entity now, some of that is clearly a stronger market. So I would the strength on the research side is offsetting some softness in Japan and Brazil. But again just to reiterate, Japan for us is probably going to be somewhere around 2% to 3% of revenue. So it's not a huge number.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. And then this incremental and sovereignty is the right way to describe it on the macroeconomic backdrop. Does it impact how you think about spending heading into Q3, hold back a little bit or is it really business as usual? ","Robert Friel","No, I think it's been usual I mean if we look at the half I mean we feel pretty good about where we are right now, I mean the organic growth is particularly, if you look at Q2 came in a little bit at the high side. We are looking at a backhit that we feel pretty good about, we are getting good traction in the new products. So I think we are still moving forward from an investment perspective and we monitor it as we see bookings from it during the quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone of BPIG. Please proceed.","Dane Leone","Thank you for taking the question. I just want to maybe get some more color in terms of the gross margin line for the quarter. I understand FX may have been a little bit more, but usually you guys are kind of flattish 1Q to 2Q, I guess anything kind of puts and takes in terms of what's maybe depressing that a little bit and expectations for the back-half?","Robert Friel","I think if you look at it on a constant currency basis we were 50 basis points, which is a little bit more than we have seen historically, a large piece of that some productivity initiatives, we put in place some of those items, supply chain we have talked about that before. We are starting to see some traction there. And that was enough to offset basically inflation in a slightly non-GAAP mix. So I think we feel pretty good about our ability to sustain it going forward as we continue to get traction with some of these initiatives. And then some of those same people are working at initiatives around the SG&A piece. So we hope to drive productivity improvement on both groups and operating margin.","Dane Leone","Okay. And just want to clarify the geographical comments. You said, I think broadly mid single digits across everywhere. Is there any kind of more - color you could provide Americas versus EU versus APAC?","Robert Friel","Well, I mean place that we saw sort of across the globe is I think when you talked about all the regions sort of in the 4% to 5% range which was great from an organic perspective maybe just to give you some color inside that if you look we are seeing Asia, but if you talk about China, Indian career was strong, they were double-digit as well, Japan obviously was within we talked about that. And so I would say within the U.S. we saw a good growth on the research side as sort of alluded to that. But again it was pretty broad based.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Veechow with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Steve Veechow","Two verifying points for me. One on the office transition, I am curious are you seeing any impact on the transition on the existing chromatography business you are working through anything there. And then second question for me is actually on - what are you seeing in terms of IP licensing trends there? Thanks.","Robert Friel","So on a chromatography side I guess I -- liquid chromatography side actually is a headwind in the quarter, because you can imagine as we transition over the ability to continue to sell on the chromatography is challenging so if anything it was a little bit of a headwind on the gas chromatography side, we do expect in the future to be able to hopefully sell some incremental products there but I would say not noticeable in future.","So again if your overall the transition in a short term is going to be a little bit of a headwind but obviously we think it won\u2019t it makes a lot of sense and hope we drive some good incremental revenues as well as I think its roughly it will be helpful from our customer perspective.","Andy Wilson","I think you also see a little bit of the issue in working capital, we\u2019ve seen as increased inventory and as I explained some of the new products, this would be a part of that as we start to build the channel with some of the new LCs.","Robert Friel","On caliper side, and I think as we talked about this we continue to see a little bit of a headwind every quarter at some of those royalties roll off and I think in this quarter as well there is a little bit of headwind of a couple of million dollars and that will probably continue to probably this year maybe third quarter this year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Leerink. Please proceed.","Dan Leonard","So I have a follow-up on inventory, I appreciate the commentary on new products sales I\u2019m curious in the first quarter I think you called supply chain effort, I think the driver have increase the inventory and I\u2019m wonder if you can give us an update on those efforts?","Andy Wilson","No it was not supply chain effort, it was actually, it was the new product launches that we put out it at Pittcon then demo inventory and the build around that, what I called out on a first quarter I believe was around Ocean freight. And that ocean freight is the build of inventory that basically stay but it happened in the first quarter, so that -- and that allows us to reduce our overall freight cost, so I think from a P&L perspective it's a good thing, but there is a pickup of inventory as you put the stuff and ship it overseas.","Dan Leonard","Okay. Understood and then my follow-up question, do you have any update on the long term growth outlook from medical imaging, it seems like it has been lumpy for a couple of years now?","Robert Friel","I think our view as -- that's a business that shouldn\u2019t probably grow mid single-digits when we look at the sort of adoption rate of digital and x-ray and then the growth prospects with our CMOS business, I think unfortunately we\u2019ve had a situation where some of our customers most notably of -- so built some inventory and start work out off a little bit as you know this is the one business in PerkinElmer really the only business in PerkinElmer where we\u2019re component supplier as compared to sort of an end system supplier so we\u2019re at a little bit of the mercy of the customers and sort of how well they are able to sort of predict their end market demand and so I think that's why you see some of these lumpiness, orders, in hindsight they are artificially strong because our customers are sort of building inventory and then we have to work some of that off and so I agree with you its clearly more lumpy than we would like I think the underlying market is probably not as lumpy as that but again being a component supplier it makes a little challenging.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Please proceed.","Paul Knight","Hi Rob and Andy and Tommy. Congratulations what I\u2019m sure was not an easy operating environment I think Dan had touched on the environmental side and the operating margin you are posting that was 13%, what are you shooting for in that business in a normalized environment?","Robert Friel","Paul, I mean it depends the time horizon we\u2019re talking about here but I think ultimately we like to see this business get up and 17%, 18%, obviously that's going to take some time to do that but we look at the opportunities within this business and I think one of the big drivers will be and we\u2019ve talked about this in the past as we\u2019ve got a get a greater consumable component to the business and something that the team is working on but I think for us to those types of operating margins, it will take a better mix between instruments and consumables.","Paul Knight","Can you talk about consumables in service Cross Lab growth was [what again] and is it M&A or what you want to do on the consumable side Rob?","Robert Friel","Yes, so one source was up double-digits, in the teens, we continue to see good progress there and I will be like to do is trying to pull in more consumables that are supportive of our instruments in some cases may you have to be on others, but I think because we have the one source engineers in the lab the ability that sell consumables, present some opportunities for us and so some of that organically but I think a lot of we\u2019ll have to be done inorganically.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Miro Minkova from Stifel. Please proceed.","Miro Minkova","Let me start with the environmental health products, do you have announced that Pittcon and that you are rolling out, maybe tell us or help us understand was there any benefits from these products in the quarter that you just reported and when might we see it and what are you expecting for the back half of the year?","Robert Friel","Yes, I would see in the most recent Q2 there is minimal benefit on the environmental side, most of the new products were the ones that were launch late \u201814, early \u201815 on the human health side, and we\u2019re starting to see some good traction in this, you can appreciate a lot of times when you come out with these new products it will take a quarter or two to really get some traction in the market place. So minimal impact in Q2, I think you will see the majority in the back half what we\u2019ve said with new products for the full year it was [indiscernible] made it in the 30 to $35 million impact with all company, I think we feel very good about that and just expect will be at high end and maybe even higher than that and so rather get into specific products I would just say we continue to feel very good about the progress and I would say we\u2019ve not be surprised to do better than hop into the range here.","Miro Minkova","Sounds good and the medical imaging business is going back to the question asked by Dan earlier, can you help us understand do you need this in your portfolio and how does it actually fit in with the rest of what PerkinElmer does?","Robert Friel","Well, I think when you think about imaging is an important component of what we do, so if you think about it sort of high level, where I think about PerkinElmer, we take samples we do take in analysis and then we provide answers and knowledge and so anything we can do to continue to drive our capabilities around the ability to [indiscernible] image I think its helpful and so leveraging that capability across as many end markets as possible I think its helpful.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Isaac Ro","Hi guys thanks for the question, its Joe in for Isaac. Just back to the macro and maybe just focusing on Europe, can you just talk about what\u2019s the big thing your expectations for the region for the second half of the year?","Robert Friel","I think when we went into the year, we saw that and Environmental was up low single-digits and we saw little bit of improvement here relative to that in the second quarter. So what our expectation in the back half is similar to what we saw so to low single.","Isaac Ro","Great thanks and then maybe just back to the China diagnostics market, can you maybe parsed out the growth between the newborn and screening and over the contrition from blood screening that drove that double-digit number and then maybe how we should be thinking about that on a go forward?","Robert Friel","I mean what I would say is all three components in China did very well, I mean if you look at the growth rate I mean clearly the blood screening is growing much faster but its all of a very low base, I don't know how meaningful that is but I would just say if when you look at double-digit growth in China you see that across all components. So its again fairly broad based.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Please proceed.","Derik De Bruin","A lot of my questions have been answered, so I'm going to ask some weird ones, so bear with me. So the -- I was at the AAC Speed conference earlier this week and I was struck by the number of Asian and Chinese diagnostic companies that were there. What is the landscape for -- in the blood screening market? And also for your other products that you sell? I'm just curious -- you talk about competing for large tenders, are you treated as a foreign company, even though you have a Chinese business? Is there some potential bias against you, given the number of Chinese companies that are there? I'm just wondering, are you at a disadvantage because you are not local or do they view you as local?","Robert Friel","So specifically with blood screening, there have been five companies that have been approved by the Chinese government that can provide products for new clinic asset blood screening. Two of them are international and three of them are considered local Chinese. We are considered one of the local Chinese, because we ended this business through the acquisition of a Chinese company. One of the things we actually had some discussions with the government officials at the time with the acquisition that was clear that we will be treated as a local Chinese company. Because again what there, I think most interested in is employment and because the products are developed in Made in China and obviously with Chinese employees I think that\u2019s my sense is that\u2019s why we get the designation as we go.","Derik De Bruin","And you\u2019re talking about moving to molecular screening. I\u2019m just curious, is that going across other segment with the diagnostic market for example, are you seeing a greater push for NIPT using molecular in China? And I\u2019m just curious, also just on the NIPT, in general or I just on the newborn business in general. Are you seen any impact from NIPT screening going on in the states?","Robert Friel","So I would say in the newborn side, no. We\u2019re not seen much of push there. I think in the NIPT, I think still challenging from a cost perspective, so you\u2019re not seeing huge adoption. However, we do believe that the NIPT market will be very attractive in China eventually, because there has not been a very large biochemical screening business. So consequently they don\u2019t need to sort of swap, so they skip generation of products. And so we do think once the costs it\u2019s down to an acceptable level within China, we think that\u2019s going to be an attractive market.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Please proceed.","Steve Willoughby","I have a couple of here quick one for you. First Andy, what are your assumptions now as a relates to FX on both the top and bottom-lines?","Frank Wilson","No change from the guidance we provided at the end of the first quarter. The other mix and the rates are pretty much inline. So we\u2019re sticking with the $0.23 of impact that we talked about in the first quarter.","Steve Willoughby","And then secondly I know in the past couple of quarters, there has been some talk about which start expecting some increase in R&D spending. And why was up modestly versus what you spend in the first quarter I\u2019m sure FX has some impact on that. Can you just maybe provide a little bit more color as a relates to your expectations and increasing R&D spend?","Robert Friel","I think, I mentioned so if you look on a constant currency basis, we\u2019re about little over 10% up for the year. And our goal is eventually get R&D to be about 6% of revenue. And so we\u2019ll look it sort of move that up depending on how we feel about revenue and profitability. But that\u2019s our goal, our goal is get up to 6% of revenue and then when you consider effect it service is about 25% that would take us to about 7.5% on product and we think that\u2019s probably the right level. It varies a little bit by \u2013 it varies in some cases a lot by business and obviously application, but we think for PerkinElmer a sort of awaited average of 7.5% on product is probably good level.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Jeff Elliott","First question is on OneSource. You had some nice growth there. How much of that is the combination with the Informatics piece, versus other demand you are seeing in the market?","Robert Friel","Well, it\u2019s a little difficult to parts that out. I would say, my sense is probably more demand right now, because we feel good about the combination with informatics in the product side of the business. I mean, it\u2019s difficult to say that because we just at the beginning of the year that we saw material impact in Q2. So but I mean, I think our expectation is and we\u2019re having some good discussions with the customers and clearly what it\u2019s allowing us to do is where were strong as an informatics customers to bring in OneSource in vice versa. And so I think going forward we\u2019ve got some, where we\u2019re optimistic, but I would say the impact in Q2 I would say it\u2019s probably fairly minimal. But the reason why it\u2019s hard to part out, right now as I said, I mean it\u2019s a combined sales force So it's a little difficult to keep that way.","Jeff Elliott","And then a follow-up on the China newborn market, you said, 85% adoption, but how many test per birth are you seeing right now?","Robert Friel","About 4, I mean as there is a couple as I mentioned with JSPs now are and expanding that so we\u2019ve got some that high single-digits but on average its probably about four.","Jeff Elliott","And what do you think that has over the next two or three years?","Robert Friel","I think those things are always difficult to do, because you are trying to predict the uptake but I think it goes up, it\u2019s a acquisition of how quickly, I mean the other opportunity is mass specs goes into that market place as you know you have the ability to jump up fairly significantly but I would say in two years, I\u2019ll be disappointed for not pushing low end to double-digits.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Zarak Khurshid with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed.","Zarak Khurshid","Wondering if you could tell us how much, if any, of the research business is actually automation, sample prep, Informatics, or anything else, sold into more of a routine diagnostics or applied channel and if there is any positive trends related to that?","Robert Friel","I would think in the diagnostic area, its relatively small and we\u2019re starting to make some enrolls into the applied area but I would still say relative basis, still relative in minor.","Zarak Khurshid","Understood and then just a quick one on good start what\u2019s happening with carrier testing? Thank you.","Robert Friel","I would say we\u2019ve been a little disappointed in the uptake there and I think we\u2019ve talked about this in the quarter as well, I mean I think we\u2019ve found a challenging from a pricing perspective where is some of the competitors are out there guarantying a low number relative to out of pocket and we find that to be challenging from a regulatory perspective, I\u2019ll just put it that way.","And so consequently we are having a difficult time finding it at least within our business practices to be competitive.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Peter Olsen with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed.","Peter Olsen","Hi Rob, just what worries you most when you look at the business then for the next 12 months what part of the business worries you the most? And just kind of a follow-up in the coming you might around the research side of the business? What will be the products that help you during the quarter? Thank you.","Robert Friel","So I would say going back to my comment before I think the medical imaging always a little bit because I feel little bit less in control there, because again we\u2019re a component supplier now we do have some insight, let\u2019s say a quarter out but that one is again as we reference before is a little bit [indiscernible] than we would like and that's the one that if you little bit less in control from the standpoint of driving demand. The second part of your question was -- I am sorry when I was most excited about?","Peter Olsen","Just the research products that kind of help you during the quarter, you talked that research type in stronger and --","Robert Friel","Yes, so I would say that there are couple of the Opera Phenix which is a imager, a high-content imager, we continue to see very strong adoption I think we\u2019ve got a nice value preposition here for the customer I think we\u2019ve gain a nice value proposition there for the customer, I think we very pleased with that. I spiked out the new microfluidics which is a larger touch, I think we\u2019re seeing some nice adoption there in the area of biotherapeutics and also on the NGS side, because it goes into sort of quality control on the sample prep and obviously with the ramp up in all the NGS, that\u2019s pointing nice demand as well and the other area is we\u2019ve seen good growth in-vivo. So a number of areas that we\u2019ve been very pleased with on the research side.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Tycho Peterson","Thanks, hey Rob just on the informatics business I know you talked in recent quarters about the -- to kind of build out there bit more and just hiring maybe just talk a little bit about where you are that build out and I guess you know competitively do you feel like you\u2019ve got critical math, means it still going ASMS and seeing what others are doing in terms of pulling data off in NGS system and in that aspect, kind of aggregating it all. Do you need to be doing more along those lines?","Robert Friel","So that\u2019s in area we have been sort of investing both in sort of mostly in people and I\u2019d say we\u2019re making grew progress there, we still got way to go, I mean I still, these people are a difficult to find and attract, but I\u2019d say we\u2019ve made some progress there. I would say in summary we feel very good about our capabilities clearly on the analytic side and the visualization side, I think we\u2019re very strong in the chemistry by the chemical side of things.","I think the areas where we need to invest a little bit is on the biological side and as we\u2019ve talked about in the past we\u2019re trying to build a lot of capability in the cloud. But I think we feel good about the progress we\u2019re making, I think they\u2019re still more to do. I think the other thing is when you go to around the place is like ASNS or ACC. You continue to reinforce the importance of informatics and the capabilities that we\u2019re building, because clearly and whether it\u2019s research environmental or diagnostic it\u2019s going to become increasing more important.","Tycho Peterson","And then I guess as you mentioned ASBC, I mean one of the other big trends this year was just kind of to push to point of care by the [indiscernible] and others. Can you maybe talk about how you view that market? Is it an interesting opportunity to be doing more in the physician's office and is there risk of displacement for your plate readers, some of these former business competitors that are pushing into these markets?","Robert Friel","So I mean, I think we view as an opportunity within emerging markets, I think the challenge for us has been trying to find a technology that is both sort of sensitive and output at the same time cheap enough and so the users low energy and all the needs that are require to work in the environment of emerging market. So I think it has a potential to be very attractive market. But I think it\u2019s got to be the right product, the right technology and up at this point this it\u2019s been challenging sort of find the right one that on.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s question. I\u2019ll now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Robert Friel for closing remarks.","Robert Friel","Well, thank you very much. And I want to appreciate everyone taking the time this morning. We feel good about our progress year-to-date and believe we are well position to deliver on our full year financial commitments and continue to make progress on our strategic priorities.

Revenue for the fourth quarter after adjusting for incremental foreign exchange headwinds came in as we expected. However, our operating margin expansion, adjusted EPS, and cash flow all exceeded our expectations, reflecting better operating efficiency in our manufacturing facilities and improving mix with increased sales of consumables.","As you've seen this afternoon, our financial results now have our Medical Imaging business classified in discontinued operations and our segment reporting now reflects the new organizational structure we announced in Q4 last year. Based on this split, our Diagnostics segment grew organic revenue by 7% in the fourth quarter and Discovery and Analytical Solutions, or DAS, declined 1% organically, resulting in the overall corporation growing organic revenue by 1%.","For the full year, we grew organic revenue by 2%, as Diagnostics grew 8% and Discovery and Analytical Solutions was flat. During 2016, we expanded adjusted operating margins by 140 basis points to 18.6%. At the same time, we increased R&D spending as a percentage of sales by 50 basis points to further fuel innovation and increase our ability to introduce solutions-focused new products. I was also particularly pleased to see that we drove significant gross margin improvement of 110 basis points, which we have highlighted as a critical component to our future margin expansion plans.","On the bottom line, we grew full year adjusted earnings per share by 12% to $2.60, or $2.76 if the results of Medical Imaging are included. Moreover, in 2016 we delivered very strong operating cash flow of $350 million, or $324 million from continuing operations. Overall, our positive performance last year was a result of both our strategic investments and operational initiatives, even amid pockets of challenging macroeconomic conditions and incremental foreign exchange headwinds.","Since 2010, our adjusted operating margin has expanded 600 basis points, resulting in an increase in adjusted EPS and cash flow of over 130% during this period of time. During the year, we returned over $180 million in cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and signed or closed four acquisitions representing about $350 million in value.","We closed Vanadis in July last year, giving us access to a potentially disruptive technology in the area of non-invasive prenatal screening. And we have since significantly ramped up the investment and market awareness of this exciting technology. We acquired Bioo Scientific, expanding our food detection capabilities as well as our genomics offerings for enabling next-generation sequencing. Our acquisition of Delta Instruments also broadened our food franchise, with market-leading analyzers for dairy testing.","In December, we signed a contract to acquire the Tulip Group, which closed this week positioning PerkinElmer as a significant in vitro diagnostic provider in India. Based in Goa, Tulip is one of India's largest domestic providers of diagnostic reagents, kits, and instruments to a customer base of 30,000 diagnostic labs and government and private healthcare facilities.","As you recall, we've been actively examining our portfolio to more acutely position PerkinElmer for accelerating growth. I feel we made significant progress in 2016 in our evolution, as we took important steps to fundamentally shift our portfolio and organizational focus. We've become much more discriminating with incremental investment dollars and are directing more resources towards our key focus areas of reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics, food safety, and pharmaceutical services.","During the year, we announced three divestitures: NTD Labs, LABWORKS, and Medical Imaging to better sharpen our focus and allow us to redeploy $300 million in areas more aligned with our growth priorities. To facilitate and accelerate this evolution, we created a more effective operating structure to align with our customer requirements.","By forming two distinct segments \u2013 Discovery & Analytical Solutions and Diagnostics \u2013 we've created larger, more unified R&D commercial teams in VAS to better facilitate a realignment of the business. Diagnostics can now focus its effort on our clinically oriented customers and opportunities to expand our addressable market.","In addition, by combining our key capabilities and talents in the genomics space, we are already unlocking technical and commercial synergies in a meaningful way. This allows us more precision in our commercial structure and customer approach.","From a global accounts perspective, because we now sell into end service or end markets with one organization, we are better equipped to offer a full suite of solutions for our top customers. For example, our OneSource service and informatics teams now seamlessly work together with what was once our former and environmental health commercial team to strategically partner with key pharmaceutical accounts, regardless of the number of departments or labs that might be involved and the spectrum of customer business challenges to address.","The power of our combined service and informatics offerings is helping bring drugs to market faster, while also improving the productivity capabilities of 8,000 labs around the globe. Another important priority last year was to continue to step up our efforts in fostering innovation. As I mentioned previously, in 2016 we increased our spending on R&D as well as made a number of organizational changes and invested in new tools to facilitate growth.","During 2016, we launched several novel products, building upon our core capabilities in detection, imaging, informatics and service, including the QSight triple quad, the Operetta CLS High-Content Imaging System, Avio 200 ICP-OES, Signals for Translational, and a cloud-enabled version of ChemDraw. In addition, we are expanding both our menu for newborn screening and our geographic reach, as we win new and incremental business around the globe.","Most recently, we won our first contract for SCIDs testing in Spain. And as I reflect on the year, we are most proud of the difference we are making on the lives of newborns and their families, having now cumulatively screened 560 million babies and helping save an average of 70 babies every day.","Another important aspect of our growth priorities last year was an increased focus on our customers. During 2016, we made a number of investments to get closer to our customers, including the opening of customer knowledge centers in Taipei and Singapore and the launch of our diagnostics lab in Chennai, India.","During 2016, we achieved a 10-year milestone with our largest pharma customer, surpassing 300,000 service events and 6,000 e-notebook users at 14 global sites. And in China, our clinical lab in Xuzhou, which provides hospitals and patients with lab services for newborn, prenatal, and infectious disease testing, reached a run rate of 160,000 tests annually by the end of 2016.","Our continued success requires us to consistently improve how we manufacture and deliver solutions to customers. And I'm pleased to report that we have made significant progress this year in advancing operational excellence. Our global operations team's goals to reduce waste, lower material costs, infuse Lean principles into our processes and increase productivity across manufacturing have contributed to meaningful product quality improvements, gross margin expansion, and improved customer service.","As I mentioned previously, we experienced a significant gross margin increase through a number of actions, including a reduction in material costs by 4.5%, the localization of production in China, and supplier consolidation. Other cost of sales was reduced by 50 basis points as a percentage of sales through the increased focus on quality, better absorption and reduced cost. Through the implementation of Lean manufacturing principles, over 50,000 square feet of space and 117,000 labor hours have been freed up to create capacity for growth and to in-source selective components. Clearly, 2016 was a year in which we elevated PerkinElmer's technological, operational, and organizational capabilities.","We enter 2017 with a number of exciting developments that will strengthen PerkinElmer's future growth and profitability. The sale of our Medical Imaging business will strengthen PerkinElmer by reducing revenue volatility and enabling us to focus our efforts and investments on core Diagnostics and Discovery & Analytical Solutions opportunities.","For 2017, our strategic priorities have evolved to not only enable us to meet our financial objectives, but just as importantly help us increase our impact on the world. First, this year we are amplifying how we innovate through more targeted R&D as well as innovating alongside external collaborators across our end markets.","A key differentiator for PerkinElmer is the incremental value we bring to our customers by providing them with complete solutions, uniquely developed to meet business critical needs. We remain committed to innovating across our core capabilities and product lines and maintaining gross share across our served market. Second, essential to creating breakthrough solutions is understanding our customers' most difficult problems and most challenging needs.","By evolving and innovating how and where customers need us, we will be better positioned to enhance the customer experience and increase long-term customer loyalty. Third, from an operational standpoint we will continue to implementation of Lean to support product quality improvements, expand gross margins, and even augment our customer service processes.","Furthermore, this year our goal to advance our operational excellence will pair with our objectives to widen PerkinElmer's global reach and diversity of talent.","Turning now to our guidance. We are forecasting overall end-market conditions to be similar to what we experienced in the latter part of 2016. However, we are increasing our organic revenue forecast to 4% to reflect a strong pipeline of new products, and the fact that the majority of the organizational realignment is behind us. Consistent with our goal to achieve 22% adjusted operating margins in 2020, we are forecasting adjusted operating margin expansion of 70 to 90 basis points, and at the midpoint of our guidance, adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% on a constant currency basis or 8% on a reported basis.","So before I turn the call over to Andy, let me reiterate our takeaways from the year. We executed well to deliver strong financial performance, continuing a trend of significant margin expansion and EPS growth. Through organization and portfolio changes, we are better positioned to grow and we have strengthened our operational capabilities.","And I'm confident that we have built a strategic and leadership foundation to accelerate the evolution of PerkinElmer, while at the same time delivering on our commitments to all of our stakeholders.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Andy.","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide for additional color on our end-markets, a financial summary of our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results, as well as details around our 2017 guidance for the first quarter and full year.","Given that we have announced a new segment reporting structure of Diagnostics and Discovery & Analytical Solutions, as well as the pending divestiture of our Medical Imaging business, we've uploaded restated historical financial data onto our website at perkinelmer.com to help you reconcile our results with your models. In addition, as Rob mentioned, we posted a brief slide presentation, entitled Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Release, which I will be referring to in my prepared remarks. Both of these presentations can be found in the Investors section of our website.","My commentary today will focus on these new segments and, unless specifically noted, will exclude the results of Medical Imaging, which is now reflected in discontinued operations. As a reminder, effective October 3, 2016, the company's Diagnostics business, focused on reproductive health, infectious disease, and oncology, became a standalone segment seeking to better meet the needs of clinically oriented customers in regulated markets.","In addition to our chemagen DNA extraction portfolio, our oncology offering incorporates a combination of NGS-enabling technologies, including microfluidics and automation previously accounted for in our life science and solutions business.","The remaining products within the legacy of life science and solutions business were combined with our environmental health business to form the Discovery and Analytical Solutions segment, focusing on life sciences, food, industrial and environment markets.","For the fourth quarter of 2016, we reported organic revenue growth of approximately 1%. As we mentioned on our earnings call in January of last year, we had a significant licensing revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 that created a headwind of approximately 1%. FX negatively impacted revenue growth by 1.3%, and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures in the quarter was de minimis.","Referring to the slide presentation I just mentioned, if you turn to page 3, adjusted revenue from continuing operations was $567 million. On a pro forma basis, including $35 million in revenue from the discontinued Medical Imaging business and the negative impact of approximately $10 million of incremental currency headwinds versus our original fourth quarter guidance, adjusted revenues would have been $612 million.","Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $0.83, as compared to $0.81 in the comparable period a year ago. On a pro forma basis, we delivered $0.89 per share, reflecting approximately $0.03 per share for the discontinued Medical Imaging business as well as approximately $0.03 a share for incremental foreign exchange headwinds since we last gave guidance.","As Rob mentioned, the trends we saw through the first three quarters of 2016 continued through the fourth quarter, specifically ongoing strength in our four key areas of focus, including reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics, food and biopharma services, we saw improving demand as well in the academic and government markets.","Analytical equipment sales into industrial and environment end markets remains sluggish, but stabilized somewhat in the quarter. Looking at our geographic results for the fourth quarter, we experienced high single-digit organic revenue growth in Asia, flat revenue growth in Europe, and low single-digit declines in the Americas with continued weakness, specifically in industrial.","In the BRIC region, fourth quarter organic revenue increased high single digits versus the same period last year, driven by continued strength in China diagnostics and analytical equipment sales as well as double-digit organic DAS sales growth in India offset by declines in Brazil and Russia. On a positive note, organic revenue declines in Brazil and Russia look to be stabilizing.","As to our operating results, fourth quarter 2016 gross margins were up 90 basis points, driven primarily by mix and continued productivity improvements, a result our successful Lean initiatives. For the fourth quarter, adjusted SG&A was down 80 basis points, driven by the success of our indirect spend initiatives, while R&D spend was up 120 basis points, this was prior to the same period a year ago, primarily a result of ongoing investments in Vanadis. As a result, our overall adjusted operating margin from continuing operations expanded by 60 basis points.","Switching to the new reporting segments for the quarter, Diagnostics organic revenue growth grew approximately 7% as compared to the same period a year ago. Strength in reproductive health in both China and the Americas was a key driver of this growth and was augmented by demand for our advanced genomic solutions, which was up high-single digits.","Organic revenue in our Discovery and Analytical Solutions business was down modestly as compared to the prior period. Overall revenue was impacted by low teens growth in food, mid-single-digit growth in academic markets with expected declines in industrial and environmental. Pharma and biotech experienced low single-digit growth, driven once again by strong OneSource results.","As Rob mentioned earlier, we've made significant strides in reshaping the company in 2016 for all of our stakeholders, and I'd like to go over some of the highlights for the year.","Turning to slide 4 of the presentation materials, for the full year 2016, we reported approximately 2% organic revenue growth, with foreign exchange representing a headwind of approximately 1% with minimal impact from acquisitions and divestitures. Full year adjusted revenue from continuing operations was approximately $2.12 billion as compared to $2.11 billion in 2015.","On a pro forma basis, including $146 million in revenue for the discontinued Medical Imaging business and $10 million from incremental FX headwinds, adjusted revenue would have been $2.27 billion.","Full year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.60, up 12% from $2.33 in 2015. On a pro forma basis, including $0.16 per share for the discontinued Medical Imaging business and $0.03 per share from the incremental FX headwinds, full year adjusted earnings per share would have been $2.79 per share.","Looking at our geographic results for the year, we experienced double-digit organic revenue growth in Asia, flat organic revenue growth in Europe, and a low single-digit organic decline in the Americas, again driven largely by softer industrial sales.","In the BRIC region, full-year 2016 organic revenues increased low double-digit compared to 2015, with low-to-mid-teens organic revenue growth in China and India, flat revenue in Russia, and soft demand in Brazil, which was down double-digits.","Looking at our total emerging market sales, organic revenues were up high single-digit for the full-year, and sales in these regions have been consistently resilient over the last four years, a testament to the criticality of the products we sell into these parts of the world.","Turning to slide 5, as to our operating results, full-year reported adjusted gross margins were 49.4%, up 110 basis points. As Rob mentioned, this increase was driven primarily by a continued mix shift into our focus growth areas and productivity gains which contributed to a mid-single-digit reduction in material cost as we shift procurement activities to lower cost countries and continue our ongoing supplier consolidation.","Strategy deployment and Lean activities further expanded gross margins by an additional 50 basis points as we were able to drive better out-of-box quality, and reduce overall manufacturing expenses. We are in the early innings of strategy deployment in Lean, and we remain confident in our ability to continue to expand gross margins by more than 50 basis points per year.","Full-year reported SG&A, adjusted SG&A was 24.9% of adjusted revenues, down 80 basis points over the same period a year ago, driven by indirect spend initiatives and prudent cost controls. As noted earlier, full year research and development spending was higher by approximately $12 million, as compared to 2015, driven primarily by investments and innovative new products including the Vanadis non-invasive prenatal screening offering; and the IONICS mass spectrometer focused on food and environmental safety applications.","We are very excited about the potential these technology acquisitions represent and continue to be encouraged by the progress made in expanding our addressable market.","Overall, we were pleased with our operational performance for the full year, as we expanded our reported adjusted operating margins over 140 basis points, in spite of incremental R&D investments of 50 basis points as referenced earlier.","Below the line, full year net interest and other expense was up modestly to $45 million and our full year adjusted tax rate was approximately 18%. Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the year with approximately $1 billion of debt and nearly $360 million of cash. We exited the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 1.6 times.","Turning to cash flow, I'm very pleased to report that we once again had a record quarter of operating cash flow from continuing operations and a full year of $324 million, up 22% over the comparable period in 2015.","We experienced continued working capital improvement with better cash collections and lower inventory requirements. Free cash flow for 2016 including Medical Imaging was also very strong at $319 million, up 23% versus the prior year and 6% ahead of our full year free cash flow commitment of $300 million.","As we look ahead to 2017 and beyond, we believe we can continue to realize additional gains in this area through the expanded use of Lean tools to more effectively leverage our working capital needs.","To wrap up 2016, we are pleased with our strong operational progress in a slow growth environment, driving adjusted earnings per share growth from continuing operations up 12% as reported. Looking ahead to 2017, we continue to believe we are well positioned to deliver another solid financial performance and see a path to improving organic growth driven by continued mix, new product introductions, and more favorable comparisons.","As a result, looking at slide 6 of the presentation, we expect full-year 2017 reported revenue to be in the range of $2.19 billion to $2.2 billion. And as Rob mentioned, this represents organic revenue growth of 4%, which includes approximately $40 million in foreign exchange headwinds and approximately $30 million from our recent acquisition of Tulip, an India-based diagnostics company.","Full-year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85, which represents approximately 8% to 12% constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth from continuing operations.","On a pro forma basis, including 16% of earnings per share related to our Medical Imaging business, which is now a discontinued operation, adjusted earnings per share would have been $2.91 to $3.01. Implicit in this guidance range is adjusted gross margin expansion of approximately 60 basis points and continued SG&A leverage with a modest increase in R&D resulting in adjusted operating margin expansion of 70 to 90 basis points.","Our full-year guidance assumes net interest expense and other of $50 million, an adjusted tax rate of 18%, and a weighted average share count of approximately 110 million shares. For the first quarter of 2017, we are forecasting reported revenue to be in the range of $500 million to $510 million, which represents organic revenue growth of 2% to 3% with FX representing a headwind of approximately 2%.","Note in the first quarter of 2016, Medical Imaging's contribution to revenues and adjusted earnings per share was approximately $41 million and $0.05, respectively. As a result, our first quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.52 to $0.54.","This concludes my prepared remarks. We'd like to open it up for questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Yeah. I want to get your perspective on the industrial end-market and just what the performance was in the quarter and then your outlook for 2017 and whether \u2013 within that, whether you saw any improvement in terms of the order book in the fourth quarter?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So for us the industrial end-market was down in 2016 sort of depending on whether it's Q4 or the full-year somewhere between 3% to 5%. And I think, as we mentioned in the beginning of the year, we experienced strong growth in the industrial market in 2015. If you recall, I think we were up mid-single-digits, so we actually anticipated industrial being sort of flat to low single-digits, but I would say we were disappointed by the fact that we ended the year actually down, like I said, sort of in the 3% to 5% range.","I think part of that was market, part of that was execution on not getting a couple of new products out, particularly in the back-half of the year, as we would have liked and so consequently, I think that that cost us a couple of points of growth.","As we think about 2017, we're forecasting industrial to grow low single-digits, and I would say that's not as much of a market phenomenon, although I would say we are seeing some early indications that that market is improving, but we attribute the improvement in 2017 more to our own execution from the perspective of getting the new products out. One of the products that actually slipped was the NexION, which is a new ICP-MS, that was actually launched two weeks ago. So we feel good that got out in the marketplace and it's getting good receptivity in the market. So I would say for 2017, we're anticipating an improvement in industrial growth, but the majority of that should come from our own execution as compared to the market.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Yeah. That's great color. And then, Andy, I think I caught the share count guidance of 110 million. Maybe could you just walk through some of the proceeds for Medical Imaging, and then what you're assuming in terms of capital deployment for the year?","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Well, I think at this stage, we are anticipating closing sometime after April, so we still have some time to decide what we want to do with those proceeds. It's about $265 million of proceeds; we've announced that. And I think at this stage, we noted the dilution that was provided, and I think we believe that we will cover the majority of that dilution either through share buybacks or through acquisitions, and then I will probably have more to say on that as we get closer to closing on the sale, and we'll be very transparent with that communication.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the 4% organic growth expectations for the year. How much do you guys expect from new products? You do a pretty good job typically quantifying that. And then it sounds like, Andy, you mentioned that academic got better, which is somewhat in contrast to what we hear from peers, so just wondering if you can elaborate on that?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So as I think about the move from call it 2% in 2016 to 4% in 2017, the majority of that is going to come from, like I said, execution and getting our new products out. So we talked about 2016 of a number of around $40 million. I would say, we probably at the end of the day, fell a little bit short of that. I would say we felt pretty good clearly through the first nine months, but, as I sort of alluded to before, in the back half of the year we had a couple things slip. Two particular products, one actually shipped as I mentioned two weeks ago and one actually started shipping this week, so we feel good about the fact that they're out.","But I would say as we think about 2017, really starting with the products that are shipping now and really looking more in the sort of Q2, we think we're going to have another strong year of new products and actually probably something closer to $50 million as compared to the $40 million that we expected in 2016. So that is a big contributor to the improvement in the growth year-over-year.","As we think about it by market, I mentioned the fact that we're looking for a fairly significant improvement on the industrial side. I would say the other market that we're looking for is environmental, which historically has been a good market for us. It was also down in 2016 and our expectation is that returns to a positive grower. So I would say that's really the majority of the improvement when you think about the 2016 to 2017 increase in organic growth, and a lot of that we believe will be fueled by new products.","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","On the academic side, I mean we had a fairly easy comp, we did see some \u2013 and some of our instruments are typically high-value instruments and we saw some growth in our high-content screening pathology products, which were beneficial in the quarter. This was probably our best quarter in academic for the year.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, as Andy mentioned, a lot of our academic exposure is in more of the Imaging area, which is, as you know, Tycho, are large ticket items. So you can, from quarter-to-quarter, you can see things move around because of the lumpiness of those orders in sales.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then lastly, can you maybe just give us a framework for M&A this year as you think about it?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Well, I think we want to do \u2013 I think we mentioned the fact that we did four deals in 2016 with about $350 million of value, and of course that includes the earnouts as well. I mean we'd like to do more than that this year. As Andy mentioned, we've got \u2013 we think a very strong balance sheet. We'll have the cash coming in from Medical Imaging. So we think we're well positioned financially to be aggressive. I think the other side of it is, I think we feel very good about the sort of operational capability and organizational capability we have, so that we could take on additional complexity. So we've got a pretty full pipeline and I would be disappointed if we weren't able to do more significant M&A in 2017 that we did in 2016.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey. Good afternoon. My first question is on the fourth quarter and then I want to come back with a follow-up on new products. So, first on the fourth quarter. Under the new reporting segment structure, organic growth was 1%. This was with Medical Imaging eliminated as a drag on growth. You guided investors to model low single-digit organic revenue growth and most were looking for around 2% with imaging as a drag. So, I'm sorry if I missed it, but could you just walk through where you came up a little light of growth expectations in the quarter or were there timing dynamics, is that why you feel at least in part confident that you can see the acceleration of growth that you're guiding to in 2017.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Actually, when you look at the guidance that we put out \u2013 I guess it was in November \u2013 we talked about low single-digit growth. Actually, the numbers I think were 0% to 2% is actually what we were guiding to do, so when we came it an 1%, we felt like we came in at about where we had sort of guided.","To your point, Medical Imaging was a headwind, but really doesn't round either sort of up or down. We would have been 1% with or without Medical Imaging.","But having said that, we guided $610 million to $620 million, and I think Andy showed a chart that said we're $612 million, so I would say we are sort of at the bottom end of our guidance, but I think within the amount we talked about. I would say to the extent that things were a little light, they were on the DAS side, and clearly some of the end markets that we've seen all year, so industrial was down sort of mid-single digits, environmental was down mid-single digits, so those are the two that have been the challenging headwind all year, and that was again the case in the fourth quarter.","I contrast that with the areas that we saw good growth in year continued to do very well, so we talked about the fact that Diagnostics was up strong, OneSource had a good quarter again, even against a pretty tough comp, and food was strong in the quarter as well.","So I think the areas that have done well continued to do well and the areas that were challenging continued to be challenging in Q4. And as I mentioned before, the idea is to turn that around. Some of that I think will be helped by having the realignment behind us and I think the other thing will come from getting some of these new products out into the marketplace.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Super helpful, Rob. And then actually, a good segue to the new products. I just want to see if, one, you'd be able to just provide a little more specificity on what the key new product drivers will be in 2017 and in the context of looking at growth and then just from a math standpoint, it sounds like you guys did something like $30 million to $40 million in new product revenue in 2016 and you're targeting something like $50 million in 2017. So that's obviously around $20 million incremental on that line; that's 75 bps of revenue growth. So is the balance of the 4% target for the year just attributable to better execution and end-market improvements? Is that the right way to think about it?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, I think that's exactly the right way to think about it. And again, when I talk about the improved end-markets, my assumption is most of that's going to come from better execution. So we're not really building a lot of I would say market improvement relative to sort of external factors. With regard to the big drivers, I would say in 2017, so we mentioned the fact that two weeks ago, we introduced a product called the NexION 2000. We're quite excited about that; that's the new ICP-MS, that's actually there's been some interesting write-ups about in some of the trade articles, so we're excited about that.","We actually introduced the Operetta CLS, which is a high-content imager. That came out in September of last year and that started gaining very nice traction in the marketplace; it's got some unique, I would say, competitive differentiation. It's got this water-immersion lens and very fast mechanics in harmony software. So we feel good about that. We introduced the Avio 200; that was also in the back-half of 2016. That's an ICP-OES and we think that's got the lowest cost of ownership on the market and probably the best analysis uptime. So we're excited about that one, and again that will continue into 2017. And then another product that we're just introducing now is a new quantitative pathology called the Vectra Polaris and we've got significant expectations that \u2013 it's the only platform on the market that can detect up to seven colors or in essence six biomarkers on a single tissue section, so that's another one that we feel good about. So there's a couple of other ones later in the year, but those are the ones that I think will \u2013 should drive the majority of the $50 million of incremental revenue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Wow, that's a new one. So a couple from me, one on tax and then one on Vanadis. Andy, I wonder if you could just give us a little bit of scenario analysis or war-gaming on the possibilities, as you think about the potential impact for tax reform. Are there scenarios that we might be concerned about, including border adjustability and can you give us a sense for what you think a sort of middle-of-the-road outcome is?","And then I guess for Rob on Vanadis. You guys continue to sound excited about the product, sounds like you're getting more excited about it as you see more data. I think you saw a pretty significant amount of data here within the last couple of months. Can you remind us how you frame up the Vanadis opportunity and strategy? Is this an emerging markets product, a global product, is this a product for a subset of disorders or is this a broad NIPT offering? Thanks so much.","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Maybe I'll start with your question around taxes. As you know, there is still not a lot of clarity around how this is going to settle, although we do hope that there is some movement on tax reform. Right now, we've kind of looked through and done an analysis of the three plans that are out there, the Trump plan, the House plan and there is a third. And they're all fairly similar. I think we do feel like there will be a lower tax rate overall, corporate tax rate, whether it's 25% or 15%, no one really knows. Obviously that's going to be a net positive for us. We do pay taxes in the U.S. As far as being a net importer or exporter, we are a net exporter. We have a fairly large significant amount of revenue that is exported out of the U.S. So that will also be a net positive.","And then the third piece, I guess, is around repatriation. A repatriation holiday would obviously be helpful. We have been very successful in the past without one. We've been able to utilize some of our tax attributes to bring money back overseas with very limited cash taxes.","So all-in-all, I think we feel like it's going to be a net positive. We've done some detailed analysis and based on what we know today, it's probably about 1 percentage point to 1.25 percentage points to our current tax rate.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","And Steve, let me take the second one on Vanadis, and I think you're probably interpreting our tone appropriately. I think we do get increasingly excited about the opportunity here. To answer a couple of your questions, we do see this as more of a broad-based offering as compared to going after specific disorders. When I say broad-based, it's really going to be targeted at sort of 13, 18, 21s, right. The key aspects of prenatal screening. I think the thing that excites us about it is the fact that we believe it's unique in that it is a product that's actually been designed from the beginning for screening.","What we're finding \u2013 what we believe is some of the applications now are things that were, say in the case of NGS, probably designed for different applications that are trying to be applied in IPT and population screening. And then that \u2013 I mean it's got to meet a couple criteria, right. It's got to be simple to use, it's got to be automated, it's got to be accurate, and it's got to be fairly cost effective. And I think that was when Vanadis was put together in design, they were sort of after those characteristics. So I think it's unique in that way relative to what's on the market today.","Relative to our sort of how we're thinking about rolling this out from a market perspective, it's going to be driven to a large extent by regulatory requirements. And so the way we think today is initially it will go into Europe as CE IVD, and there's probably some 70 countries that provide some nice opportunity. Simultaneous with that, we'll be seeking CFDA approval in China and in fact we're going to see if we can get this fast-tracked because of the need there as well as we think the uniqueness of our offering. And then probably, and of course as you know that's a significant market, and then probably the third market will be in the U.S., and it will probably be offered there as sort of a kit. But that's probably a little farther out.","And we're quite excited about it; we believe we're still on track. We'll see some initial beta units at key opinion leaders, starting in sort of mid-2017, and we still think we're on track for CE IVD approval in early 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon. Thanks, guys. Rob, just going back to the 1% organic for the quarter, can you comment on growth if you just look at the group of businesses that you're investing in heavily versus the group that's less of a priority. How does that split look?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. So it was high-single; it was sort of 8% to 9%.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And then if you care to touch on where, I mean, obviously I guess we can do the math on what that means. But, just sort of maybe the outlook on the less prioritized stuff, I mean, how do you think about that in 2017, as you \u2013 as the portfolio ...","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","I mean, I think there's three ways to get that growth up. One is we've got to get sort of innovation in new products out. We've got to execute better in the marketplace. And probably the third aspect of it is we will continue to look to prune some of the products that we think are just not a great strategic fit for where we want to take the company. So I think it'll be a combination of all three of those. It's obviously \u2013 the first two are more within our control. But we'll look to use all three of those levers.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonathan Groberg with UBS. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. So, Andy, on the \u2013 I just want to make sure I'm 100% clear hear. On the Medical Imaging, the $0.16 is your \u2013 it's discontinued, so if the full-year impact is $0.16 and what you're assuming in your initial outlook here is nothing is done with the cash at this point?","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","That's correct. So the guidance we provided assumed no use of those proceeds. And as I mentioned earlier, we will \u2013 as we get to the point where we close on the sale of the Medical Imaging business we'll be very clear as to how we employ that. But our intention is to cover the majority of the dilution with either buybacks or acquisitions and we'll be more transparent on that as we move forward.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. Jon, the way I think I would describe it is that, again, because we don't know when it will close, what we've said is think of it as $0.16 impact. So if it closes a third of the year, let's say, that means $0.05, assuming it's linear, will run through our earnings but through discontinued operations. And so I think what Andy is implying is that that $0.11 that's left we'll look to cover the majority of that either through acquisitions that we do or through share buybacks, so that if you look in total between the earnings that run through discontinued and things we do to offset the dilution when it's sold or maybe even before it's sold that we're guiding to say, look, the majority of that $0.16 we looked is offset, it's just that we can't give you a specific split until we know when it closes.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","I just wanted to make sure we were crystal clear on what that $0.16 was. And then on the \u2013 I know we've cut this a few different ways, but did I miss, if you just looked at it by your new reporting segments, Diagnostics and DAS, how you're thinking about those growing to hit the 4% next year?","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Sure. Right now, we see the Diagnostics business really growing at a 7% or so high single-digit type growth rate and then 3% for the DAS business. That gets you to the 4%.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the questions. Could you give us a sense of where you are at now with the portfolio as far as the pruning and the divesting goes. Is there \u2013 like how much left do you think you have there and is it a big chunk or is it more product line coming out here or there?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","I think there was \u2013 a question that's always difficult to answer because I think as the company evolves, I think we'll continue to get more discriminating against the sort of products and the technologies we have.","So \u2013 but I would say, with regard to sales like Medical Imaging, I know, I wouldn't anticipate as we think about 2017 here that we would see another divestiture of that size for 2017. There will be some product line pruning, but I don't think anything of the size of call it $150 million in revenue.","Now when we get into 2018 and to 2019, possibly, and I think that will also be dependent on how successful we are on the acquisitions side.","Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And the 70 to 90 basis points of operating margin expansion you're expecting in 2017, how much of that is just simply mix coming out of Medical Imaging? Was that at or above company average margins?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Well, when we moved Medical Imaging to discontinued now, it doesn't have any impact, right, because we're now comparing numbers in 2016 and 2017 that don't have Medical Imaging in them. So the 70 to 90 basis points has no impact from Medical Imaging leaving.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi, good evening. Two different questions for you. First, just your thoughts on your outlook from a geographic standpoint. And then secondly, last quarter, you talked about how some of your product lines were emphasized versus deemphasized and you might have seen a little bit increased employee head count turnover. Just was wondering if you continued to see that through the fourth quarter, if it had any impact on results? Thank you.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So I'll take the second one and then maybe Andy will do the sort of geographic split. So I think that it's hard to tell that answer, right, I mean, we don't have a precise way of measuring, but clearly, when we made the decision, call it sort of third quarter to start to focus on some areas and deemphasize some others, there was some transition within both the sales force and the product manager. I would say the majority of that's behind us. Now we've communicated it, I think, to the people that it impacted and they didn't like it. I think the majority of them have left or got sort of comfortable with the situation. So I think that the majority of that's behind us.","It clearly impacted us in Q3 and it probably had a residual impact in Q4 as well. I think we mentioned this before \u2013 one of the reasons we announced the realignment on October 1 was we wanted to try and get all of this behind us. So as we entered 2017, any disruption as a result of this \u2013 again, it's hard to make the disruption zero, but I think to a large extent, that's behind us. So as we forecast here, and as we enter 2017, our assumption is the organization is well aligned in support of how we're running the company right now, and I don't anticipate any disruption in 2017 as a result of the strategic decisions that were made last year.","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","And I'll answer the other part of the question. By major geography, our expectations, at least that are reflected in our guidance, are the Americas essentially mid single-digit with the U.S. part of that being really low to mid single-digit. Europe we are assuming is going to be low-single digit with high single-digit growth in the APAC region.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Andy, I was hoping get a little bit of color from you, as you think about the post-divestiture portfolio, what the incremental margin framework we should put in mind, as we think about a long-term model for the business. Obviously, the fixed cost coming out of the company with the Imaging sale will be pretty reasonable and I just thought it would be helpful to have a framework for incrementals.","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","I think that, as Rob may have mentioned, I think as we look forward, we still believe we can drive 70 to 90 basis points of operating margin expansion consistently. I think that, if you look at this year it was a bit higher, and I think that there'll be years where we are able to drive more than that. I don't think the framework has really changed dramatically without Med Imaging on the bottom-line, but I think it has on the top. I think we're going to have less volatility, and I think net-net over time, we're going to have a steadier and hopefully a better growth rate organically.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So, Isaac, I would say the incremental flow-through is, within the company, is largely dependent on where the growth is coming from. So one of the reasons why the operating margins was as strong as it was in 2016 was because the growth was coming from the Diagnostics side. So I think when you see growth on the Diagnostics side, generally that's got sort of a 45% incremental flow-through or so associated with it.","When the growth occurs on the DAS side, it's lower than that; it's probably in the low 30s. So I think as \u2013 and of course Medical Imaging was different, but again that's sort of out of things. So I think that's really the determinant of the incremental flow-through; it's really where the growth is coming from.","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","And I think our expectation is that most of the growth is going to come from our focus areas, and those are typically higher margins.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, guys. Follow-up here would be on the food safety business; obviously, that's just a great place to be. You guys have done well there. Can you give us a bit of a mark-to-market in terms of roughly how big that business is today for you guys as a percentage of total sales or something in that neighborhood?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","It's about $175 million for us right now. To your point, I wish it was a lot larger.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Well, you have time for that to happen now that you can keep working on it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Couple questions from me. I guess first off in China, have you by any chance seen any impact from some of the new food regulations, and if so, is this contributing to some of the food safety strength? If not, potential driver in the future? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, I do. It's hard because it's so new. You're talking about the regulations now requiring almost like farm-to-table type of analysis. And I think our leaders there think that there has been some incremental growth attributable to those regulations. So we're fairly optimistic that that will continue to be a driver to the food business in China. But I would say it's in the fourth quarter probably some of the strong food revenue growth was attributable to \u2013 clearly it was in China and I think some of it was the new regulatory standards that have come out.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Okay. Fantastic. And then just staying OUS, appreciate the Tulip color around the contribution for 2017. Can you help size the total opportunity in India for us, Rob? Thanks.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Well, I think when you think about the diagnostics market in India right now, it's relatively small in the scheme of things, right. And we've seen some numbers that says, if you look at the diagnostic tests per capita in India, they are 100th the size that they are in the United States. So when you think about the size of the population, as the sort of technology evolves and I think costs come down, I think that can be a significant opportunity.","But just to give you a sense, the diagnostic market in India is probably $1 billion and growing very quickly. So the nice thing we like about Tulip is it gives us significant distribution capabilities. I think I mentioned on my prepared remarks some 30,000 customers. And so we see two great opportunities, one is at some point to take some of the product offering that we have in China, and run that through the channel in India and then also use that channel to help drive our reproductive health growth. And then we'll continue to be aggressive to look at other types of products that we can go through the channel, but we thought it was important to get good access to a market that we're quite excited about.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Luke Sergott - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys, this is Luke in for Ross. I guess, just looking at now that you have the kind of a greenfield in front of you at 2017 and you're looking at bolstering your high gross businesses. I guess looking at the Diagnostics, I know you're not going to give framework on the size of the deal, but just kind of areas where the portfolio you'd like to fill in?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So, I think, Luke, to your point, I mean Diagnostics is a high priority for us. If you look at the three areas that we play in right now, anything we can do in reproductive health we would like to do. We've got a nice franchise there. I would say also in infectious disease in emerging markets, so we talked a little bit about Tulip, anything we can do to sort of continue to bootstrap those capabilities. And then we'll continue to look for opportunities in the oncology area around enabling technologies. So we think we've got some nice capabilities in the front end of the sequencers, so whether it's DNA extraction or automation or sample preparation. So I would say those are the three areas that we're focused on.","The other thing that we continue to look at it is opportunities to expand our addressable market. I would say, when I think about our Diagnostics business, it's a very strong business, but the addressable market needs to be bigger than it is.","And so we'll look for adjacencies that we can sort of leverage some of our capabilities into some markets that allow us to grow. What I would say right now, our addressable market in Diagnostics is probably in the $3 billion range, and we've got to make that much larger.","Luke Sergott - Evercore Group LLC","Great. That's very helpful. And I guess, turning to biopharma, it's been really strong across all of your peers and with you guys as well. Can you just talk about the order trends that you've been seeing in there at the end of the quarter. If you saw any pause within the larger pharma versus smaller pharma or CapEx spend versus consumables, it would be great.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So as we think about biopharma, I would say the OneSource side, or the service aspect of our business has been very strong; the product side of it is a little mixed, so we have not sort of enjoyed the growth that I would say some of our peers have. And to some extent that's a function of our product mix, right.","So I would say on the imaging side, things are going well, and some of the reagent areas, things are going well. But when you get into the plate readers and the radio chemicals and radiometrics that becomes a little bit more challenging. So our growth for biopharma has been low single-digits, maybe in some quarters mid-single digits, but we unfortunately have not seen some of the growth as I mentioned that others have.","But to answer your question specifically, we have not seen any indication that it's slowing. We believe pharma will continue to have a strong 2017. It will probably manifest for us, again, more on the service and informatics side than on the product side.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Good afternoon.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So could you just give us some \u2013 first a housekeeping question. So based upon your commentary on Medical Imaging's impact organic revenue growth in Q4, is it safe to assume that when we look at the organic revenue growth in the prior quarters in Q1 for Q3, it's similar to what you reported?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. I think in a given quarter, it may \u2013 I mean, it may have caused a percent, but think of it as about 7% or 8% of our revenue and it was generally down anywhere from mid-single digits to low-double digits, so when it's \u2013 obviously, when it's down mid-single digits, it's less than a percent, but there was \u2013 I think Q3 in particular it may have been down low-double digits and at that point, it probably moved it a percent or so. So depending on how it did in the quarter, it could have \u2013 it could have moved our organic growth a point.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And can you just give a little bit more color on Tulip and the opportunities there and long-term goals, what you can do with the margins and just a little bit more color on that business?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Well, it's about \u2013 I think it was $35 million in revenue or so and, as I mentioned, it closed this week, so we'll get 11 months or so of the revenue. The margins are, I would say, better than \u2013 around corporate average maybe a little bit better than the corporate average. Maybe there is an opportunity to improve those, but I think really the focus is going to be on growth, how do we accelerate the growth. As I mentioned, we think the IBD market is around $1 billion or so and we think that's going to grow fairly significantly. Their offerings are really around call prevention screening and diagnosis for infectious disease, so things like malaria, HIV and hepatitis, so very synergistic with what we do in China with our SYM-BIO acquisition we did a number of years ago. And as I mentioned, the strong products and channel access to over 30,000 customers, diagnostic labs, government, private healthcare facilities, et cetera. So we're quite excited about it.","I would say the other thing is, if you go over the last couple of years we've built a nice team within India, within PerkinElmer, and so we feel very good about the ability to integrate this and leverage the capabilities there. I think they've got like 350 sales people and so we'll look to grow that quite significantly. It's a business that has been growing I think low double-digits, and we'll look to accelerate that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Brokmeier with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi, good afternoon. You had previously indicated in the past that you had about $1 billion in M&A capacity. Now you have the additional $265 million from the Med Imaging business, or you will soon. Would you say that you have $1.3 billion of capacity or is it even higher than that since you've strengthened your balance sheet and cash flow over the last year?","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","We have approximately just under $1 billion of leverage through our revolver, and then we've talked about our cash as being north of $350 million. So you layer on top of it the $265 million and so we're really around $1.5 billion of available, and then if you throw on top of that our free cash flow generation, it's higher another $300 million or so.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","And staying on M&A, are you focused on accretive deals and could you more broadly remind us of what the criteria is that you focus on?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, I would say it starts with, obviously, strong strategic fit, and then we generally look at return, so when you think about it cash-over-cash returns. We are generally looking at something that exceeds our cost to capital and depending on the size of the deal it'd be anywhere from three to five years, and for a larger deal we might stretch out for a period of time. Our cost of capital is probably in the mid to high 8's. So we probably look to find something that gets us returns of 10% or so in that time horizon. I mean, I think in this environment with interest costs where they are, most things are accretive. So I think it's, I would say, unlikely that we would do something that wasn't accretive. But again, the real criteria is what kind of financial returns and how does it improve our businesses.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Catherine Ramsey with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Catherine Ramsey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, guys. I was curious what newborn screening contributed from a revenue ...","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Catherine, can you speak up a little bit? I can just barely hear you.","Catherine Ramsey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Oh, yep. Is this better?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Okay. Yeah. Yes, much better.","Catherine Ramsey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. I was curious what newborn screening contributed from a revenue perspective in 2016. And then could you walk us through your assumptions there for 2017 and what kind of China menu expansion and India penetration are embedded in those?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yes, so newborn screening grew low double digits in 2016. So it was a significant contributor to the growth of Diagnostics. It is the largest business within Diagnostics. So it's done quite well. And our expectation is it will continue to grow in 2017. We are expecting to see a moderation of growth in China. We saw mid-teen birth growth in China, birth rate growth, and that was partly due to the relaxation of the one child, but probably more significantly as a result of what I'll call sort of the zodiac year and what our expectation is, as we think about 2017 is the year of the rooster that it will be \u2013 it will go back to sort of a moderate sort of normal growth rate probably in the sort of low-to-mid single digits.","Catherine Ramsey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then just quickly looking at the fourth quarter again, its decline in DAS, can you parse out the performance in instruments versus recurring revenue. I know, you touched on pharma briefly, but was the decline there mostly capital purchases getting pushed out?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yes. It was mostly on the instrument side. Where we saw growth was on the service side. Instruments was negative and consumables, and reagents on the DAS side was sort of up slightly, the majority of the growth on the reagents and the consumables comes from the Diagnostics side.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference over to Rob Friel for closing remarks.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc.

Sir, you may begin.","Tommy Thomas - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Thank you, Heather. Good afternoon and welcome to the PerkinElmer third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","If you have not received a copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com. Please note that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website until November 16, 2017.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon, and also, those in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future even if our estimates change, so you should not rely on any of today's forward-looking statements as representing our view as of any date after today.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Rob?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased with our performance in the third quarter as PerkinElmer delivered revenue and EPS at the high end of our previously communicated guidance range, and we continue to make excellent progress on our strategic priorities.","Similar to previous quarters, I will briefly review our financial results, discuss overall market conditions and update you on our progress during the third quarter relative to our strategic priorities, while Andy will discuss our financial results and future guidance in more detail.","Turning to our financial results, we generated revenue of $550 million during the third quarter, which represents growth of 8% over Q3 last year on a reported basis and 5% growth organically. Adjusted operating margins expanded by 30 basis points to 19.3% and adjusted earnings per share was $0.73, representing growth of 14% over Q3 last year.","Year to date, our financial results are tracking favorably to our original guidance in the beginning of the year. And based on our fourth quarter guidance, we are on track to exceed our full-year guidance communicated back in January for both the top and bottom lines, delivering organic revenue growth of 4% and increasing adjusted earnings per share by low double-digits.","Markets continue to be favorable. For the first time in over five years, during the third quarter, we experienced positive organic growth in every region of the world and every end market in which we operate. Looking specifically at our end markets, pharma biotech grew mid-single digits as strength in service and high content imaging was offset from continuing headwinds in our radionucleotide business. Diagnostics also grew mid-single digits as emerging markets continue to outpace developed markets.","Our food business was very strong, growing over 20% due to several key customer wins and strong performance from recently introduced new products. Both environmental and industrial markets grew low single-digits as environmental is continuing to see strong growth in Asia, positive results in Americas, offset by declining revenue in Europe. Our sales to academic customers are \u2013 also grew low single-digits and recovered from a slow start to the year as funding outside the U.S. has improved.","Turning now to our performance against our strategic initiatives, within Diagnostics, we continue to make good progress strengthening our core areas, while expanding our addressable markets. In Q3, we launched our new mass spec platform, QSight, for the clinical market and have received a very positive response from our customers.","During the third quarter, QSight was registered as a Class 1 instrument with the FDA. In addition, we have completed CE marking for the European market, enabling the instrument to be used in clinical applications beyond newborn screening, and we are diligently working to extend our existing and new clinical assays on QSight.","Moreover, our Diagnostics portfolio continues to address the escalating demand for greater access to quality healthcare across emerging regions. The performance in our Tulip Indian diagnostics business is encouraging on both the top and bottom lines as we expand Tulip's in-vitro diagnostics offerings throughout India. These solutions add in the prevention, screening and diagnosis of communicable diseases such as malaria, HIV and hepatitis, which are critical issues in that part of the world.","Turning briefly to our cord blood and cord tissue banking business, you may have seen earlier this year the announcement of newly published research that shows encouraging developments related to the use of a child's own cord blood to treat cerebral palsy. The Phase II clinical trial led by Duke University, and with participation from some of our ViaCord families, will hopefully drive greater awareness around the potential of cord blood and cord tissue by helping further penetrate this market over time.","We also continued to make good progress on the key growth initiatives for our Diagnostics business that I've discussed previously and thought I would provide a quick update. As I've mentioned before, Vanadis is our solution for prenatal screening that leverages high precision imaging in an automated platform, enabling a much more efficient and less expensive option versus current NGS-based NIPT testing alternatives.","In the last month, we have submitted an article with data demonstrating its performance, which should be published before year-end, and we expect another article to be submitted before year-end. One research system has been installed in Europe and another will be installed shortly. These units will continue to generate more data on the Vanadis platform as we continue to validate the assay.","To date, the results look very encouraging and compares very well to the current commercial NGS alternatives. As a result, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the potential for Vanadis and remain confident that our commercial launch date for the first half next year will be met.","Our PerkinElmer Genetics offering of whole genome sequencing services has begun testing samples and we have already signed a number of contracts with both academic institutions and rare disease pharma companies. During the third quarter, we also announced our collaboration with In-Depth Genomics or IDG. PerkinElmer Genetics is supporting IDG's program which brings genetic diagnosis to patients across a wide range of neurological conditions.","We will provide clinical whole genome sequencing, interpretation services and diagnostic reporting to IDG and IDG will then use the de-identified genomic and clinical data to support their R&D, generating a better understanding of the cause of hundreds of rare diseases. We continue to be excited about our pipeline of opportunities as we focus these capabilities around our reproductive health business and rare diseases.","And finally, one of our major priorities for the remainder of the year is the closing of our acquisition of EUROIMMUN, which will augment our immunodiagnostic offerings with autoimmune and allergy testing. Over the past few months, we've made great progress working towards this closing and we have also used this period to facilitate collaborative discussions between employees of both companies to explore future opportunities. It has been an exciting time and we are very much looking forward to uniting as one organization.","The only remaining hurdle is regulatory approval in China and we are still planning for a Q4 closing. As currently, our commitment for EUROIMMUN's minority shareholders continues until the end of this year. If we determine this is unlikely to occur, we will either purchase those shares outright or simply extend the timing of the shareholder commitment. I look forward to communicating the closing as soon as it happens. And after spending time with leaders and employees at EUROIMMUN, I am ever more encouraged by the opportunities presented by this combination.","Moving to the DAS business, which was created about one year ago, we've undertaken a number of significant actions to achieve our objective of accelerating profitable growth by disproportionately investing in the most attractive market opportunity, while continuing to improve commercial execution.","Year to date, we have launched 11 new imaging and detection instruments which are generating significant interest among customers across the environmental, food, industrial and life science research markets. Several more are still in development and slated to launch over the next couple of months.","Looking specifically at our food franchise, which is focused on adulteration, quality and safety testing capabilities, we continue developing new innovations while also seeking to acquire attractive assets to expand our $200 million-plus food portfolio.","During the quarter, we won a number of large tenders spanning the U.S., Australia, Europe and China that reflect a high demand for unique applications utilizing Perkin and Delta technologies. These include whole grain analysis, the establishment of product quality grading based on sugar content, and the measurement of food fermentation for textile production, just to cite a few.","On the services side, our OneSource business continues to win competitive tenders with key pharma customers due to the breadth of our offerings which range from asset management to scientific services and lab location. A strong indication of the faith the market has in our offering was evidenced by a recent significant win, which represents the largest initial contract in the history of OneSource.","Also, during the third quarter, we have initiated the implementation of new technology-based solutions to improve our customers' experience and provide additional insights into their lab operations, as well as facilitate our ability to expand in the higher margin service offerings.","From an operational execution standpoint, we are making good progress on the third component of our strategy, which is focused on continually improving our operational execution and strengthening our margin profile. In particular, our utilization of lean manufacturing methods has resulted in a 13% reduction in our manufacturing floor space globally since the end of 2015.","In addition, during the same timeframe, material costs have been reduced as a percentage of revenue by 700 basis points to 24% of total cost of sales. Through these initiatives and others, we remain confident in our ability to improve product gross margins significantly over the next several years.","Also, I recently attended the opening of an important expansion of our Chinese manufacturing facility to broaden our capabilities to produce several of our DAS product families. By better aligning our manufacturing footprint with the location of our customers, we should facilitate future growth in this important area of the world. These operation improvements, as well as our ability to leverage our SG&A costs, have enable us to make additional investments in R&D in 2017, which we believe will translate into increased revenue from new products in 2018 and beyond.","Relative to last year, investments in research and development have increased 12% or 40 basis points as a percentage of revenue, enabling us to accelerate R&D innovations for solutions and serve higher growth markets.","So to summarize, during the quarter, we continue to meet or exceed our financial commitments. However, more importantly, the combination of the successful execution of our strategic growth initiatives, favorable market conditions and the opportunities afforded by the upcoming EUROIMMUN acquisition, reinforces our belief that the growth of both our top and bottom line should accelerate in 2018 and beyond.","I'll now like to turn the call over to Andy.","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, as well as details around our guidance for the fourth quarter.","We were pleased with our continued performance in the third quarter, as adjusted revenues from continuing operations grew 8% to $555 million. Foreign exchange represented a tailwind of approximately 100 basis points, with acquisitions adding approximately 200 basis points resulting in an organic growth of approximately 5%.","By business, Diagnostics, representing 30% of total sales, grew 5% organically both in the third quarter and year-to-date, driven by growth in our emerging market diagnostic offerings and sales of our advanced genomic solutions.","Discovery & Analytical Solutions, representing 70% of total sales, grew 4% organically in the third quarter and 3% on a year-to-date basis, driven by new product introductions and an improving macro environment. I'll provide some additional color on both businesses in a moment.","We experienced healthy growth across all major geographies with high single-digit organic revenue growth in Asia, mid-single digit organic revenue growth in the Americas, and low single-digit organic revenue growth in Europe. In the BRIC regions, we continue to expect strong and broad based organic revenue growth with continued double-digit organic revenue growth in China.","As to our operating results, third quarter adjusted operating margins expanded 30 basis points to 19.3%, driven by continued SG&A leverage, partially offset by increased R&D investment in the quarter and year-to-date. Adjusted operating margins have expanded over 40 basis points year-to-date. As a result, adjusted earnings per share from our continuing operations for the third quarter of 2017 was $0.73, a 14% increase versus the prior year and at the high end of our guidance range. Year to date, our adjusted earnings per share has increased approximately 10% in spite of a 12% increase in R&D investments, which I will talk about more shortly.","Looking further into the key drivers within our business segments for the third quarter, let's start with Diagnostics, third quarter results were in line with our expectations, driven by strength in our advanced genomics, Varian sample prep business in the Americas and our emerging market diagnostic offerings, which continued to outperform. Our clinical labs had another strong quarter growth as they continue to gain traction addressing customers' needs, while out Tulip business, serving the Indian market, continues to exceed expectations.","As mentioned earlier, we continue to ramp R&D spending, which has increased on a year-to-date basis driven by investments in both businesses. Within Diagnostics, investment spending continues to be focused on Vanadis' Smart NIPT and our new mass spec for newborn screening. We're pleased to report that this newborn screening tool was well received at the recent Association for Public Health Labs Conference and is set for a fourth quarter launch. While as Rob mentioned, Vanadis, our innovative NIPT solution, continues to track to internal plans with data we recently submitted for publication.","Switching to our Discovery & Analytical Solutions business, third quarter results often played out as expected and were, once again, driven by a very strong growth in our key focus areas of food and pharma biotech services, as well as strength in environmental offerings, while revenues from industrial and academic and government grew low single-digits.","Looking at key products, growth continues to be driven by the new ICP-MS for food and environmental applications, while very strong overall growth in food was driven by Perten and pharma biotech results were once again driven by a solid OneSource performance. We are very pleased that our OneSource team continues to drive industry-leading growth, with an expansion of services into existing customers, coupled with a number of significant new customer wins year-to-date. We now believe the double-digit growth OneSource has experienced in recent quarters will be sustainable for the near to intermediate term.","In terms of increased R&D spend within DAS, we have been focused on developing new products, targeting inorganic applications and have secured a number of wins with recent launches in ICP-OES and ICP-MS product lines. We are also excited to be taking new orders on our newly launched gas chromatograph, an imaging instrument that should help drive organic growth acceleration in 2018.","Looking below the line, adjusted net interest and other expense for the third quarter was approximately $11 million, tracking in line with our initial guidance. And while our year-to-date adjusted tax rate is approximately 17%, slightly below our January guidance, we expect the full-year tax rate to be approximately 17.5%.","Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of debt and $709 million of cash, and we entered the quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of approximately 0.9 times. As we have previously mentioned, we expect to use a combination of cash and incremental debt to fund the acquisition of EUROIMMUN. We will communicate these details upon closing.","Turning to cash flow, year-to-date operating cash flow from continuing operations was $165 million. And as we look ahead to the balance of 2017, we believe that we will continue to efficiently manage our working capital requirements and drive approximately $300 million of adjusted free cash flow for the year.","Looking to the fourth quarter of 2017, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver a solid finish to the year. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting reported revenues to be in the range of $613 million to $618 million, which represents organic revenue growth of approximately 4% to 5%, and adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.93 to $0.95. As Rob mentioned, this represents organic revenue growth of approximately 4% for the year and full-year earnings per share growth of 11% at the midpoint of the updated adjusted EPS range of $2.87 to $2.89.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Heather, at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from William March with Janney. Your line is open.","William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hey, guys. How are you?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Good.","William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","First question, could you maybe just talk a little bit about the whole genome sequencing business that you just launched, specifically, who are your target customers for this product? Are there some cross-selling opportunities with the existing diagnostic portfolio? And then, maybe just the margin profile of this business versus the core diagnostic business?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, sure. So, it's targeted at three customers. First of all, our reproductive health area, and in that area I think there is a lot of cross-selling opportunity. So, I think as we talked about last quarter, our newborn screening business very often is reflexed into NGS for confirmatory testing. So, one of the things we're doing is we're now doing some of the confirmatory testing with our newborn screening customers.","The other area where we see good synergies with our reproductive health business is in the ViaCord area where we have some 350,000 cords that are stored, and of course, ongoing business, where we see interest very often where those customers would like to have some whole genome sequencing done. So, I would say that's the first area that we're focused on.","The second area was the one that I mentioned in the prepared remarks where we're doing work with IDG and they're having us do some whole genome sequencing with regard to neurological disorders.","And then the third area I would mention would be in the pharmaceutical area, particularly in the orphan drug, where we're working with several pharmaceutical companies to help them particularly identify potential patients for clinical studies.","So, I would say that's the initial focus of the business. We're seeing early days but good update. And while it's a startup right now, we do anticipate as we get the higher volume that we can get the operating margins equal to or maybe even a little bit better than the company average.","William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Got it. And then, maybe just if you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing geographically in terms of \u2013 I know you had a difficult comp last quarter in Asia, whether that low double-digits we saw this quarter, if that was a tough comp or just kind of more commentary on what you're seeing on each of the three geographies? Thanks, guys.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So as I mentioned before, this is one of the first quarters in a while where we actually experienced growth in all three regions, so whether it's the Americas, EMEA or APAC. And so, if I look at each of those, I think the U.S., we continue to see generally pretty good growth across all areas with maybe the exception of academia was a little light. But other than that, we see good growth in Diagnostics.","So, I would say if you look at newborn, first of all, while births now have sort of more flat in U.S., I would say prior to this quarter, we actually saw them down a little bit, we think, now. At the end of the third quarter, if you look on a trailing 12-month basis, it's more sort of flat. But our ability to continue to expand the menu and expand what we do, also mentioned the genetic testing business that we're now seeing good growth on the Diagnostics side, pharma continues to do well and the environmental and safety areas.","So, I think good demand within the Americas. I think when you look at Europe, again, probably not as strong as U.S. but good strength on the pharma aside, I would say we saw a pickup on the industrial markets in Europe and food was very strong. And then, of course, the highest growth area for us was in APAC, obviously, led by China. China was up sort of mid-teens for us, and that was pretty strong across the board with possibly the exception of industrial, and that was really more of a comp issue. I think last year, if you look at China, our industrial business was up high-teens.","So as I sort of mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing pretty good strength, again, across the globe and across all the application areas.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Dan Arias with Citi. Your line is open.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks. Rob, on Vanadis, as you guys get ready for commercialization there, can you just talk about how broadly you're thinking that will be in Europe? Is it going to be a meter rollout next year or should we kind of think about UK, France, Germany, all seeing availability fairly quickly?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. I think, as you mentioned, that will be Europe first. I think it will be somewhat metered by the tenders. That's one of the things we're looking at relative to the potential for revenue in 2018 and we want to try and time that at least as best as we can to some of the tenders in some of these countries.","So I think initially, if you look at 2018, that'll be a large determinant to how quickly it gets ramped up in the market. But again, the intention would be pretty broad based across Europe. Again, one of the important aspects of this is because this goes in, as we've talked about, into more of the biochemical markets, we've got a very strong commercial footprint in those markets already, basically, the leader in biochemical screening. So, we think this will be something we can penetrate relatively quickly. So, it will really be more gated by the timing of, again, the tenders, more than anything else. Again, just to remind, our plan is to have CE marked, so it will give us access the markets actually, other than just Western Europe.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's really helpful. And then, apology if you touched on this during the prepared remarks but how did EUROIMMUN do organically during the quarter? And now that you've had a chance to sort of think about that business, what are you thinking about in terms of the timeline associated with bringing that portfolio to U.S. in a meaningful way?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So, EUROIMMUN continues to do well. So if you look at the results through three quarters, they continue to grow organically in the high-teens area. I would say they're growing in 2017 in excess of what we assumed in the model.","And so, one of the things we have been spending a fair amount of time on over the last several weeks is how we can be prepared to penetrate the U.S. market sort of as quickly as possible. And so, that will be clearly one of the top priorities that we've identified in the collaboration and synergy discussion. So, the plan would be to try and really drive growth in the U.S. relatively quickly.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good afternoon.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Good afternoon.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, on the newborn screen aspect, I believe that you historically have partnered with Waters in the area of mass spec for that market. I'm just curious, could you just remind us on that relationship, and I guess, does anything about that relationship change as you sort of launch your own system?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. So, you're right. The relationship historically was that we used the Waters mass spec in our solution. I mean, fundamentally, everything else that was in the solution, and again, when we service our customers, we go from the filter paper to the puncher to all of the sample preparation information to the detection information as far, and then, also the software and informatics.","So moving forward now with the QSight, the plan would be to replace the Waters mass spec with the QSight. And so, going forward, it will be an exclusively 100% PerkinElmer solution.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And I guess, just sort of staying on that as a follow-up, it's like how much of the market is mass spec-based versus biochemical-based, the typical immunoassay screen-based for that market? These questions are like penetration mass spec in that market and what's the opportunity.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Are you talking about globally or China? I'm sorry...","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'm talking about globally, on where mass spec is on a global basis in terms of being used...","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So, I would say if you look outside the developed markets, mass spec is relatively small from a penetration perspective. But of course, today, the developed markets are a large piece of it. So from an opportunity perspective, I would say roughly 30% of the market today is probably covered by mass spec, and again, the current market, and probably 70% is more biochemical. When you look at the opportunities going forward to expand the market, most of the emerging markets don't do mass spec today. They do just biochemical.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Charles Steinman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hey, guys. This is Charlie Steinman on for Patrick. Thanks for taking the questions. Just regarding OneSource, was hoping to get a sense of an increased penetration of potential customers who hadn't outsourced before? And then, also on OneSource, if you've seen any pull-through on the product side from those relationships?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So on the first one, yes, we continue to see penetration of incremental customers particularly outside the U.S. And so, I think that's a good significant component of the growth going forward. And on the second question is it's sort of early days there. I think that's a more significant opportunity for us going forward. So, we're hopeful, as we get into sort of 2018 and later, that we'll be able to get more pull-through on the PerkinElmer products.","Charles Steinman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, maybe a little more of a high level question, but you've had a nice acceleration on the Diagnostics side of the business and clearly, that's been a focus. I'm curious just what, on the DAS side, ramps that growth up over the next one or two years?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So, I think it's combination of things. And first of all, as we've been focused on new products, so we've got to get some new products out into the marketplace, and I mentioned I think over the last nine months or so, we've got 11 new imaging and detection products out in the marketplace (32:26). That's one.","The other thing is I think disproportionately investing in those areas where I think we've got both greater growth opportunities and stronger competitive positions. And the ones I would specifically spike out would be food, in the pharma services area, some of our imaging capabilities, and maybe, finally, the inorganic applications like ICP and ICP-MS. So, making sure we're really sort of focusing in those areas.","And then, the other area is just expanding our capabilities. So, I mentioned the fact that we just very recently opened up a manufacturing line in China for our DAS products. And I think locating more of our capabilities closer to our customers where else to be more nimble and respond more quickly, and also, starting to adopt more of our products to the needs of those specific geographic regions. So, I think those are the three key areas that I think we can sort of drive higher organic growth for DAS.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. A couple of things. Rob, how much of the logistics shortfall came through this quarter? Can you just quantify that? And then, your guidance implies doing 5% organic against a modestly tougher comp in the fourth quarter. Maybe if you could just tell us where you're seeing the improvement in trends coming out of the quarter and what gives you confidence in hitting the fourth quarter bar?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. So, I think we felt like we got all, if not, 95% of the revenue that we missed in Q2. I think I mentioned last quarter is because the majority of the shortfall was on the instrument side, I think we felt actually by the latter part of July and maybe it spilled into early August, we had shipped all that. So, I think that was helpful to achieving our sort of the top end of our guidance relative to this quarter.","I think relative to the areas we're seeing, I think it starts off with getting the traction on the new products, and so, that's driving food. I think we mentioned a couple or at least one nice win in OneSource, so I think that'll help us here in the fourth quarter as we start to ramp that program up. And I think some of the things that we've got in place on the Diagnostics side. I think we'll see it on the genetic testing side, some improvements, where we've got some expectations at QSight, starting to see some nice growth in the fourth quarter. So, we think we've got pretty good alignment to the growth targets that we've laid out for Q4.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And low-single digit growth in industrial, I guess, seems a little bit light relative to what we see on the PMI side. Is there room for improvement or upside on the industrial front (35:18)?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. I think there is. I mentioned before that we had a pretty tough comp in China relative to Q3 last year, it was up high-teens. So, I think a little bit of that was a comp issue. But I think your question implies that we're seeing some recovery in the industrial end markets and we would agree with that. So, I think we would be disappointed if we didn't see industrial start to pick up here, not only in Q4 but as we get into 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. First one is for Andy. Andy, I don't want to leave you out here. I wonder if, at the margin line, if you could give us a sense for the impact year-on-year from currency and from anything else inorganic, M&A or other, so we can get to an organic year-on-year margin.","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. I think maybe I'll start with EPS and then \u2013 because I don't really have it quite cut by operating margin at that level. But from an EPS perspective, we went into the year expecting an FX headwind, and at this point in time, we expect FX to be an $0.08 tailwind.","So, if you look at our guidance, with a midpoint of $2.88, it's about $0.08 higher than the January guidance we provided. So that, obviously, is a benefit. And then, we have spent back quite a bit on R&D which resulted in about $0.03, but we covered that with the operational beat thus far.","So I think all in all, FX for us for the year will be $0.08. The amount of revenue year-to-date just, for example, on the M&A side, is a little over $40 million, and it's about $0.02 in the second half and I would think that will continue in the fourth quarter. The Bioo and the Delta acquisitions both fall off at that point.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And sorry, is that all inclusive of...","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","That was all in our guidance at the beginning of the year, yes.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then, there's been a lot of commentary on this call, in the Q&A and the prepared remarks about new products and great to see a lot of those coming through. In past years, at times at the outset of the year and over the course of the year, though, you've talked about the dollar contribution from those products. I wonder if you could put those numbers on the new product flow this year. And then, considering that some of these products have launched here relatively recently here during the second half, I mean, how is that driving your thinking about new product contributions for 2018? Thanks.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Steve, I'll take that. And that's a great question because it has been an important initiative of ours and a focus of ours. So if you look at new products, we started off the year and said, we're looking at about a $50 million help from new products, sort of incremental. And if you sort of track it through the year in the first quarter, we think it was in sort of the $13 million range. For the second quarter, it was about $21 million. We think the third quarter is maybe just a tad above that, maybe more like $22 million for the third quarter. So actually, through the nine months, we're now a little bit above our target of $50 million.","So to your point, we feel good about the progress we're making here. And I think that, ultimately, is the lifeblood of our growth. The key is to make sure we're in attractive end markets and that we're bringing innovation to our customers to drive the incremental growth. And so, we continue to be very pleased with that.","As we think about into 2018, I mean, we'll give 2018 guidance obviously, sort of in the earlier part of next year but we continue to be optimistic. And because as we get traction this year, it reinforces our confidence in, first of all, the process of how we're driving new products, and just as importantly, the team. So, the other aspect is over the last maybe 18 months, we have been upgrading the leadership of the R&D organization and it's great to see that it's making a difference.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. So, two questions. 2017 seems to be a bit of a reset year from an R&D as a percentage of revenue standpoint. How do you think about leverage on that line going forward? Are you thinking that will continue to go up and you're going to continue to aggressively invest or would you get leverage beyond 2017?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","No. I mean, I think when we set the targets out for the 22% operating margin couple of years back, we targeted sort of 6%, 6.5% R&D spend. And I think year-to-date, we're at 6.3% or something like that. So, I think we're pretty comfortable with that number. And then, when you think about it relative to product revenue, it gets you up in the sort of 7.5%, almost 8% area. So, I think we're fine there now.","Of course, with EUROIMMUN coming into the company, they do spend more as a percentage of R&D. So you will see, in fact, the R&D percentage go up, but I think that's just sort of a math exercise with EUROIMMUN coming in. But I think for the, I'll call it the historical PerkinElmer portfolio, I think where we are now seems pretty good relative to our ability to invest in the areas that we think are important and drive the organic growth that we've talked about.","Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","And then, just to kind of expand on it a little bit, we have a framework and a road map to get to the 22% by 2020. And it's really, it's a combination of R&D investment, but it's also some of the gross margin expansion efforts that Rob discussed, as well as the accelerated organic growth from some of our R&D investments and we still think that we have room to really leverage SG&A. So, I think we're right in line, as Rob said, and I think we were able to make those investments and still achieve our longer term goal.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, just one follow-up question. So, I'm trying to understand all the pluses and minuses on the top line and it sounds like you're coming in better in 2017 year-to-date on new products, and that's a good guide, but year-to-date organic growth is about 3 points. What are the offsets? Is it something besides RAS, is maybe newborn screening a bad guy and that can turn into a good guy in 2018? What color can you offer there?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","No. I don't think there's any bad guys in Diagnostics right now. I mean, generally, we feel like Diagnostics is on track to do the sort of 6% or 7% organic that we've talked about in the beginning of the year. I think the offsets are in the areas where we haven't sort of invested in the new products within DAS. So, we thought a fair amount about the organic portfolios, so ICP, ICP-MS, even AA. I think the areas that hopefully we'll be able to focus more on in 2018, in the areas like some of the chromatography areas, some of the areas around thermal and material characterization.","So, I think there are some areas where we're probably may not making the \u2013 or we're not growing with the market because, again, we focus some of our investments in some of those other areas that support the food area or support pharma, et cetera.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Emily Stent with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First off, looking at the pharma end market, can you break out how much growth you saw from capital equipment versus recurring revenue?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","I would say if we include in recurring services, that would be basically the majority of the growth. I would say on a product basis, we were relatively flat, when you look at things like high content imaging doing well and a couple of other imaging products being offset by radiometric detection and sort of drug discovery. So, product was relatively flat. Services was the majority of the growth.","Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. That makes sense. And then, with Andy set to retire next August, how's the CFO replacement search been going and when should we expect to hear an update?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Well, I'll start off by saying it's going to be impossible to replace Andy. But having said that, it's going well. I mean, it's early days. We've hired a search firm. We've seen some preliminary list of very qualified candidates. And so, I think we feel pretty good about the ability to get a very strong person in here. I think the nice thing is because of Andy's willingness to give us a fair amount of time, I think we should be in good shape as we get into sort of middle part of 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Good afternoon.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, wanted to focus on the growth in the food end market. So, I think I caught 20% in the prepared remarks. I think it was expected to swing into the teens but that feel be a little better than we're looking for. Maybe just elaborate on the trends you're seeing there.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. So we continue to see strong growth in China, which is probably expected. We saw a particularly strength in Europe this quarter, very strong growth. And I think we just continue \u2013 I think it's a combination of we bought Perten, we bought Delta, we bought Bioo, and we've been in the process of trying to get those integrated, and then, also, leveraging some of the channel, historical channels of PerkinElmer and it sort of takes some time to do that and I think we're starting to see some nice traction there. And we're getting into some of the larger food customers and once we're in there, we're able to leverage additional products. So, either PerkinElmer products or pulling Perten and Delta through or vice versa.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Do you think double-digit growth can sustain into the fourth quarter and may be into 2018?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","I would say we target food in sort of high single. I think in given quarters, we could probably see something in the teens. But I would say built into our Q4 guidance is food in the sort of low double-digit range.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rob Friel for closing remarks.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Great. Well, first of all, we appreciate your questions. And again, we feel good about our financial performance year-to-date, as well as the progress we continue to make on our strategic priorities. Thank you for your interest in PerkinElmer and have a great evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Tommy Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Tommy Thomas - VP Investor Relations","Thank you, Whitley. Good afternoon and welcome to the PerkinElmer first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","If you have not received a copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com. Please note that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website until May 14, 2015.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future, even if our estimates change. So you should not rely on any of today's forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date after today.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures we plan to use during the call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available as an attachment to our earnings press release. To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during the call that are not reconciled to GAAP in that attachment, we will provide reconciliations promptly.","I'm now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel. Rob?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today.","I'm pleased to report that we had a good start to what we believe will be a successful 2015. Our financial results were strong with organic revenue growth within our expectations and adjusted EPS significantly beating our guidance.","Adjusted revenue in the first quarter was $527 million representing constant currency adjusted revenue growth of 5%, comprised of 2% from acquisitions completed last year and 3% organic revenue growth in the quarter.","While Andy will provide additional color on our revenue performance in the quarter, I was pleased, that we experienced growth in every business and across all major geographies. While the strong U.S. dollar offset some of the operating performance in the quarter, constant currency adjusted operating margins expanded 130 basis points, and constant currency adjusted earnings per share grew 19%.","During the quarter, we also made significant progress on our growth initiatives across each of the businesses. In Environmental Health, we launched a number of new innovative products across our three product platforms, including the first entirely corrosion-resistant flame atomic absorption spectrometer available on the market.","The new PinAAcle 500 Health Science is working with highly corrosive environmental samples, detect minerals and metals for a variety of applications including testing drinking water and detecting elements in food samples for nutritional labeling.","In addition, we introduced the first fast flame autosampler, which allows dramatically higher throughput and the lowest cost per element of any similar analyzer on the market today.","We also launched the Spotlight 150 and 200 series microscope IR analyzers incorporating innovative flexible automation and software analytics allowing for simpler, faster contaminant analysis. Many of our new Environmental Health products were launched at the March Pittsburgh Conference under our theme of Instruments of Change, which focused on how PerkinElmer makes a positive impact on the world through innovative science platforms and exceptional service.","Reinforcing our growing reputation for innovation, a number of our scientists and products were recognized for outstanding achievements, including the award for Best New Spectroscopy Product.","Also during the quarter, we announced a strategic alliance with Waters Corporation to strengthen our chromatography portfolio for PerkinElmer's non-pharma customers. Of note, our new HPLC and Altus UPLC liquid chromatography solutions will help sciences in the environmental, industrial and applied markets better detect adulterants, contaminants and plumes.","In addition, PerkinElmer will standardize on liquid chromatography and gas chromatography portfolio on Waters Empower Software. This will enable customers to simplify their workflows by unifying their chromatography data onto one platform and providing greater confidence in their analysis.","We're also pleased by the traction we're seeing in the successful integration of Perten Instruments and our progress in further penetrating the multibillion dollar global food testing market.","In addition to driving strong growth in the quarter, Perten was recently selected by the Canadian Grain Commission as its preferred near-infrared grain analyzer. In Human Health, we received market authorization from the China Food and Drug Administration to offer our automated high throughput Genetic Screening Processor, the GSP, and an assay for the detection of congenital hyperthyroidism. We have additional GSP assays pending approval with CFDA that will further expand our menu for newborn screening in China, and enable a wider range of testing for life threatening disorders in newborns. We continue to make good penetration in other emerging markets with additional recent wins in India where we now expect to screen nearly one million babies this year, and our recent contract win in Mexico is ramping up nicely. In March, we announced an exciting collaboration with Johnson & Johnson's Innovation. J&J's life science incubator labs or J-Labs chose PerkinElmer to outfit its entire lab in South San Francisco, California. By providing our imaging and detection solutions plus onsite staff training and support for the resident biotech companies, we are helping to kick start their research. This new venture is a testament to J&J's belief in our capabilities and applications expertise to help advance cutting edge science.","From a commercial perspective, our decision early in the quarter to move the OneSource Services group into our Human Health business is already paying off. As you may recall, the intent of this move was to better serve customers in the growing pharma and biotech markets by delivering more complete solutions targeted towards their specific needs. Early success in aligning our internal expertise and leveraging our strong customer relationships indicate that this will change \u2013 this change will contribute to solid organic growth in 2015. Stepping back and assessing the broader macro environment, growth across our geographies is fairly mixed, but remains in line with our expectations at the start of the year.","In the U.S., while the strong dollar is posting substantial headwinds against the top line, it is proving to be the healthiest geography as growth steadily returns. Europe is stable and showing some increased demand, but the region is still working through its current economic challenges. APAC remains stable overall; however, Japan and Korea face weakened environments and despite China's overall economy slowing, we continue to believe we will grow high single digits there, given the critical segments of the economy we serve.","Consequently, I remain confident that we can continue to leverage market opportunities across our businesses and drive profitable growth. Based on our performance in the first quarter, we are raising our expectations for constant currency adjusted EPS growth for the year to 12% to 15% from the previous 11% to 13%, while maintaining our outlook for constant currency adjusted revenue growth of 7% to 8% and organic growth of 3% to 5%.","I would now like to turn the call over to Andy.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks Rob, and good afternoon everyone. I'll provide some additional color on our end-markets, a financial summary of our first quarter results and details around our second quarter and our full year 2015 guidance.","Due to the recent volatility of movement in foreign currencies, I'll be providing my commentary on a constant currency basis which assumes FX rates are the same year-over-year in order to better portray the results of the quarter.","Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures are included in our first quarter press release, and have been posted to our website. I'd like to begin by saying; we're off to a solid start in 2015. As Rob mentioned, we reported 5% constant currency adjusted revenue growth and 3% organic revenue growth in the quarter, with unfavorable foreign exchange rates representing a headwind of approximately 6%.","Adjusted revenue was $527 million in the first quarter as compared to $532 million in the same period a year ago. And since we last provided adjusted revenue guidance back in January, unfavorable foreign exchange rates have negatively impacted our top line result by an additional $4 million.","First quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.50, up from $0.47 in the comparable period a year ago, and we had constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth of 19%.","Our quarterly adjusted EPS was $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance range, driven by strong incremental margins, favorable geographic and product mix as well as the timing of certain expenses in the current quarter.","Looking at our geographic result, we were encouraged by balanced growth across all major geographies and end-markets with improved results in Europe and stable demand in China.","Our first quarter organic revenue increased mid-single digit in the Americas, low-single digits in Europe and Asia with China growing at a high single-digit rate as expected.","As to our operating results, first quarter adjusted gross margin was 47.7% representing constant currency adjusted gross margin expansion of 100 basis points. Our results were driven primarily by favorable mix, success with our Asia supply chain initiatives and year-over-year improvement in our OneSource business primarily related to new customer startup cost in the first quarter of last year.","For the full-year, we continue to forecast constant currency adjusted gross margin expansion of 70 basis points to 80 basis points. First quarter adjusted SG&A was 25.9% of adjusted revenue and a constant currency adjusted SG&A reduction of approximately 70 basis points from the prior period as we continue to benefit from the impact of successful indirect spend initiatives.","Research and development spending in the first quarter was 6.1% of adjusted revenue and a constant currency adjusted R&D increase of approximately 50 basis points from the prior period, driven by our ongoing investments in innovative new product development.","The majority of the increased development spend came at our Environmental Health business, supporting a number of new product introductions and incremental investment at Perten.","As Rob mentioned, we launched a number of new products at Pittcon earlier this year. We're excited about the second half revenue opportunity and we continue to expect full year R&D spending to grow over 2014 levels.","Overall, our operational performance in the first quarter was strong, as we expanded constant currency adjusted operating margins by approximately 130 basis points, driven by an improved gross margin and the success with the previously mentioned indirect spend initiatives. We continue to feel good about our ability to expand constant currency adjusted operating margins in the 80 basis point to 100 basis point range for the rest of 2015.","Net interest expense in the first quarter was approximately $9 million flat versus the comparable period a year ago, and our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was approximately 22%, which was slightly higher than we previously guided due to the geographic mix of our profits in the quarter. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate for the full year to be approximately 21%.","Switching to the segments. First quarter organic revenue increased approximately 4% in our Human Health business and approximately 2% in our Environmental Health business. From an end market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 62% of reported revenue in the quarter with diagnostics representing 29% and research representing 33% of reported revenue. As a reminder, we now report our OneSource multi-vendor services business in research.","Organic revenue growth from our diagnostics business increased mid single-digits off a high single-digits comparison in the first quarter a year ago. Our results were driven primarily by strength in our newborn and infectious disease testing solutions, which continue to garner strong demand throughout emerging markets as well as medical imaging, which had organic revenue growth of mid single-digits. In addition, birth rates in the U.S. stabilized showing modest growth versus a year ago. We had strong performance from our diagnostics business in China with double-digit organic revenue growth in the quarter, while our Haoyuan business continues to ramp.","We remain optimistic around the Chinese nucleic acid testing opportunity ahead of us, but the near-term uptake is moving slower than expected, a result of the government moving to a centralized purchasing model versus their traditional provincial model.","Organic revenue in our research business grew low single digits in the first quarter, driven by our recent new product introductions including the Opera Phenix as well as improved demand for our innovative automation systems and our OneSource and informatics offerings. We're currently seeing moderate improvement in the academic and government end market, a field that we have not yet seen an inflection point, while pharma and biotech remain stable. We continue to expect research sales to have low single-digit organic growth for the full year.","Human Health adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 22%, up 270 basis points over the first quarter of last year due primarily to a positive mix shift into informatics and reagents and improvement in OneSource profitability and the timing of expenses in the quarter.","Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represented approximately 38% of reported revenue in the quarter, we had organic revenue growth of 2% in line with our expectations. Strength in the U.S. was partially offset by softness in Asia-Pacific in spite of the good performance in China. From an application perspective, our first quarter reported results were driven by improved demand in the industrial end market, driven to a large extent by success in our Mat Car (15:30) offerings and Perten.","As Rob mentioned, the integration of Perten Instruments continues to go very well and we're on track to deliver the $0.04 of accretion from the acquisition for the full year as previously guided.","Environmental Health's adjusted operating margins in the quarter declined 270 basis points versus the first quarter a year ago, driven primarily by foreign exchange headwinds, the seasonality of Perten's profitability and the timing of selling and R&D investments supporting the new product launches previously mentioned at Pittcon.","For the full year, we expect Environmental Health adjusted operating margins to expand 80 basis points to 100 basis points. Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the first quarter with approximately $1 billion of debt and approximately $170 million of cash. We exited the quarter with a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3 times and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.9 times.","Adjusted operating cash flow from continuing operations was $62 million. This performance excludes $24 million in voluntary pension funding payments made in advance of upcoming interest rate and mortality table assumption changes. We do not forecast making additional voluntary, funding payments in the year.","Looking into the second quarter and the balance of the year, we're well positioned to drive significant operational performance. We anticipate similar market and geographic growth rates as in the first quarter. As in 2014, our strong incumbent physicians coupled with the annualization of new product launches from the second half of 2014 and additional launches in the second half of 2015, give us confidence in our ability to deliver mid single-digit organic revenue growth in the current economic environment.","Looking at the impact of foreign currency translation, the stronger dollar is now expected to negatively impact full-year adjusted revenues by approximately $137 million and impact adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.23 in total or an incremental $37 million on the top line and approximately $0.08 per share on the bottom line from initial guidance.","As a result, we now expect reported revenues for the year to be in the range of $2.24 billion to $2.29 billion and approximately 7% constant currency revenue growth at the midpoint. Our guidance continues to reflect organic revenue growth for the full-year of approximately 3% to 5%.","We now expect adjusted earnings per share for 2015 to be in the range of $2.54 to $2.60 with a midpoint of $2.57 and constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to 15% up from 11% to 13% as previously guided.","Implicit in this guidance range is adjusted operating margin expansion of 30 basis points to 50 basis points. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $42 million to $44 million. Our adjusted tax-rate is expected to be 21% with a flat diluted weighted average share count of approximately 113.5 million shares.","For the second quarter of 2015, we're forecasting reported revenues to be in the range of $550 million to $560 million representing approximately 7% constant currency revenue growth with organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%.","Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter are expected to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.59 or 10% constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth at the midpoint.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Whitley, at this time, we'd like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon, guys.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","So maybe on the environmental business, seemed like in general China had a pretty good quarter, but we only had sort of the low single-digit growth. So if we look at some of the culprits on that side of the business, what are you pointing to and how is it, how did it sort of trend over the course I guess of the quarter?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I would say on the environmental side, first of all, within China, as you mentioned we saw probably within the Environmental mid-single and that was pretty good strength on the Environmental industrial side, but we continue to see sort of slowing demand or challenging demand on the food side. So China while it was up high-single digits for PerkinElmer was more mid-single digits on the Environmental side. If you looked across more globally, we saw good growth in the U.S. sort of I would say low-single digit in Europe (20:18). And think about it from a trending perspective, what we saw was fairly stable demand through the quarters. I wouldn't say it was necessarily improving through the quarter, but fairly stable, as we look to early Q2 here we're seeing a little bit of an uptick.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Got it. And maybe, Rob and Andy, as you were thinking about the obviously the core underlying performance was quite good on EBIT and earnings. The FX headwind obviously everyone's dealing with, you guys took a lot of cost measures out last year. You obviously have a pretty robust still balance sheet capability and as you were thinking about what measures you could do to kind of offset that given how well the rest of the business is performing, how did you sort of weigh maybe trying to mitigate versus this is sort of the reality of the strong dollar?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would say on the margin, well, obviously we're trying to be prudent with our expenditures, but at the same time, to the extent that we see opportunities to either innovate with our products or to expand the markets, we're going to continue to invest. As you saw in our financials, R&D was up. That was our plan to increase R&D this year. So while I think we're cognizant of what's happening in the foreign exchange markets. At the same time, if we see strategic opportunities, we're going to continue to focus on those and spend the money. What Andy made some comments around was the indirect spend and we'll continue to focus and drive those. So I would say the areas that are not customer facing, the areas where we're not seeing opportunities to drive innovation in the marketplace, we're going to try and be prudent on. But, I think for the strategic opportunities to increase the top line, we're going to continue to invest.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, how are you doing?","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Just wanted to start off with a little bit of the comments you made regarding new products. Obviously, you had a slew of them at Pittcon and you mentioned them on the call. So I wonder if you could maybe quantify how much top line contribution you expect to see from new products?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I think in the beginning of the year, we said probably something in the $30 million to $35 million range is what we thought we'd get from new products this year. I think we're still on track to do that and maybe we'll do a little bit better. But, I would say that's the range that we're focused on for 2015.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got you. And then, on the gross margin line, that was obviously pretty strong and just wondering if you could break that down a little bit. Number one, how much of the improvement year-on-year was due to mix? And then, as part of that conversation, was wondering how much FX actually held back gross margin this quarter? I imagine it would have been even better if it hadn't been for currency? Thanks.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Currency was about 30 basis points, Isaac. So without the impact of currency we would have been 100 basis points of improvement. We were actually at 70 basis points on a post currency level. I would say, some of the efforts we had around supply chain, were a piece of that and I would say, that's probably a little less than half and the remainder would've been the positive mix we saw and to the diagnostics and informatics business as well.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks so much, guys.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink. Please proceed.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you. I have a working capital question. It looks like the inventory days were higher than they've been in quite a long time, was there any specific driver for that?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. There were a couple of things. On the working capital \u2013 on the inventory side, we've done \u2013 we've initiated a project around reducing transportation costs so there is a one-time pickup of the inventory. It's really around ocean freight so we have a bit of an inventory build there. There were some related as well to Perten. But I think you should see from these levels, those inventory turns should improve each quarter. In addition, we \u2013 as Rob mentioned, we introduced a number of NPIs at Perten and there is a fairly meaningful amount of demo inventory required as we roll those out. But I think, overall we still \u2013 we still think we'll make some pretty decent traction on inventory. I mean if you look at our receivables, we made some tremendous progress there so it was able to offset some of that inventory, but we still have work to do.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Got it. And then my follow-up. Can you quantify the anticipated benefit from the Waters collaboration? I know they made an attempt to quantify it on their call and I was wondering what you thought the flow through would be for PerkinElmer? Thank you.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I think, when we look at 2015, we think for us, it's going to have a relatively modest top-line improvement. Now as we get past 2015, we're quite excited about the collaboration. But keep in mind, in most instances at least early on this is a substitution for us because we provide effectively our own HPLC today and we're going to swap that out for Waters. So when you really think about that collaboration, it was done, I would say for sort of three reasons. One is, it really enables our customers to simplify their workflow by unifying their chromatography data on one platform, which is Empower. So going forward now when we sell our DC or LC, it'll be sort of standardized on Empower. The other was to sort of give our non-pharma customers access to UPLC from Waters. And the third one was we \u2013 it allows us to focus our R&D and software resources in the areas where we can better differentiate ourself. So I think that's how we think about to get it (26:06). Again, it's hopefully a lot of benefit to our customers, but I think in the relatively short-term here at least as we think about 2015, it's probably more of a substitution than it is incremental.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Dan Arias with Citigroup. Please proceed.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, hi. Thanks for the question. Rob, just wanted to ask a little bit on OneSource. You mentioned that that move was paying off already. So I guess, what is the expectation for growth there this year?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, if you look at OneSource I think, we continue to believe it's a sort of mid to high single digit grower, but I think the opportunity we see is to really pull some of the products through, because historically, we've had I'll call it enterprise relationships with our customers at both the OneSource level and at the informatics level. And I think, what we're seeing now again, it's early days, but by combining OneSource and informatics and getting those enterprise level relationships we think, there's an opportunity to pull through some of our products in the research. So while we're always looking to try and drive more growth within OneSource, I think the real opportunity from a growth perspective I think will be from more pull through from the product side.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Okay. And then maybe on the blood screening business in China, can you just sort of give an update on how that's tracking, how are you finding pricing to be there? I think you're kind of positioned in between the high-end pharma guys and the local so has there been any attempt by the other players to sort of adjust based on what you're seeing in the market? Thanks.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would say, first of all, we continue to be very enthusiastic about that opportunity. The tenders are being delayed a little bit. So I would say, the growth was strong in Q2 \u2013 or Q1, but we continue to see that be a significant ramp into the back half of the year. As far as our competitive situation, we continue to serve \u2013 win probably more than our fair share from the standpoint of \u2013 as you know there's five competitors. We're probably winning at a 30% to 35% of the tenders. And so, we feel good about that and we think this could be a significant opportunity, not only in the back half of 2015, but going into 2016 and later on.","With regards specifically to pricing, we are not seeing dramatic pricing changes by either the international competitors or the local competitors for that matter. So I think we still feel like we've got a great spot relative to, as you pointed out, being in between those two sort of competitors.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Miro Minkova with Stifel. Please proceed.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon guys. Rob, a question on guidance. Your guidance for the full year, maintaining the organic revenue growth outlook of mid single-digit implies perhaps a bit of an acceleration the second half relative to the first half. Help us understand what is driving the acceleration \u2013 possible acceleration?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think the majority of that's coming from new products and \u2013 as I alluded to a little bit in the prepared comments, particularly on the Environmental side, we're pleased that at Pittcon and this is the last quarter, we're able to introduce some 12 new products. So I think that's really what we're attributing to the majority of the pickup in the back half.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks so much. And on the newborn testing initiatives in India, I think you mentioned you plan to screen about a million newborns. Is this a change from your expectations and then maybe update us on where that screening initiative is?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I would say it's a little bit better than we thought going into the year, and of course India presents a terrific opportunity from a newborn screening perspective. 27 million children or babies are born there every year. And so, we've had discussions with the national government there and we're cooperating in what I would call a sort of a private-public relationship or partnership where we're trying to encourage them at sort of the federal level, but at the same time it's administered at the state level. And so, I would say historically we've had some small pilots. But what we've seen in the first quarter is this ramp up to sort of a bigger volume. And as I mentioned, we're now probably going to do close to a million children, so a huge opportunity out there. But like anything, this probably will take a little time to sort of ramp up, but I would say relative to the beginning of the year, this is probably better than we thought.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, sounds good. And I'll get back in queue. Thank you.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of (31:09). Please proceed.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Thank you for taking the questions.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Unknown Speaker","Congrats on a good start to the year. So if we think \u2013 just sticking with the theme of the back half weighting, are those new products that you introduced \u2013 are those actual orders in the funnel or is that in anticipation of building the funnel over the next couple months here? And when we think about the impact kind of flow through on margins, again it seems like the back half EPS weighting on the updated guidance is a bit heavier in the back half. How do you think about product mix kind of affecting the gross margin in the back half of the year?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all on your initial question, those products were introduced at Pittcon, a majority of those are shipping now or will be shipping in May, several of them we started to take orders. And so, I would say we feel pretty good about the acceptance out in the marketplace and the ability to sort of drive that incremental growth in the back half of the year.","With regard to margins, I think anytime you introduce new products, clearly the objective is to put products out there that have better cost positions or better features for which we can hopefully get better gross margins or better price, and clearly that's the intention with these products. So I think some of that is, the new product coming out with higher gross margins. I think the other thing is just, naturally if you look in the fourth quarter because our calendarization suggests that we've had higher volume. Historically, you will see higher operating margins in the fourth quarter of the year just because of the seasonality of our revenue. So I think it's part of that and I think it's the new products.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Great. And then from a strategic perspective, how are you thinking about the business into this year, maybe a little bit more volatility we've heard some of your competitors saying things might be brightening up in terms of competition with some of the private investment firms, in terms of looking at the M&A funnel. Are you guys in a mode where all options are on the table or things might be getting a little bit better or still looking at kind of strategic tuck-ins into the organization?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You know, first of all, I think we look at everything. We look at all opportunities to sort of make PerkinElmer better. I think generally we focused on smaller bolt-on acquisitions because quite frankly I think the probability of that happening is higher. But quite frankly we will look at small deals, we'll look at medium deals, we'll look at large deals. I just think as I said, the probability of the smaller deals happening are probably higher.","Having said that, I think there is \u2013 for a long period of time there has been a lot of competition in the marketplace and I think what we've historically said is, for us to be able to successfully acquire and integrate deals that make sense for PerkinElmer and their shareholders is, we've got to have good synergies and those synergies have to either be from a channel perspective or operations or technology or et cetera. And so what we're generally looking at is acquisitions that are close to what we do today or adjacencies where we can leverage the current assets of PerkinElmer. And I think in those instances we can be very competitive on price.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Great. Thank you. I'll jump back into the queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with UBS. Please proceed.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the quarter.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Rob, following up on your comments around Waters, I mean, and just if I'm interpreting it correctly, you're kind of saying look, we don't have as much scale specifically around chromatography, they kind of have better scale at least on the liquid side, you can better utilize your resources elsewhere where you have more differentiation. I guess in that vein, just how are you thinking about scale generally as far as PerkinElmer goes and given what you've seen happen in the industry?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think generally what we look at is to have scale in the relative markets in the way that our customers buy products, and I think that's what we've been talking about for some period of time. So for us, it's scale is important, relative market share is obviously very important, but it's how do you define the market. And I think in some instances, when you look at how we define the market, we think we have significant scale. And so, the obvious example is, we don't define the market that we think \u2013 or do we think the market should be defined as diagnostic testing. We think the market should be defined as newborn testing or prenatal testing, because we believe that's how the customer buys. And in those instances, we have high.","So if you look at diagnostic testing, we would have very small market. If you look at newborn screening or newborn diagnostics, we have very high market, and similarly that's what we look at how the customer buys, or in the case of people want to do imaging. Again, we have very high relative market share. When we moved into some of the environmental or analytical instrument applications, I think it was helpful to have some of these complementary detection capabilities. Of course we feel we have got good scale in ICP or ICP-MS or spectroscopy, et cetera. But in the area of chromatography which I think is complementary in some instances to these techniques or technologies, we didn't have a lot of scale. And so therefore, we thought the partnership with Waters made a lot of sense. And again, it's focused in a market segment or market segments that they don't participate in today. So it's in the sort of more industrial and environmental end-markets.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Sure. So would you expect kind of what you did with Waters to be a one-off or are you kind of focused on the areas as you define them, you want to really be number one in those areas, and could we expect other types of agreements like the one with Waters?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think generally what we look at is again based on how we define the relative markets we'd like to be one or a close number one. If we feel at some point we can't get there then we probably should either exit it or find a better or different way to get there. And then in case of liquid chromatography we didn't see a path to get there and so this was an alternative way of sort of continuing to participate in the marketplace. I think that is how I would sort of describe it, but as far as a one-off I would say there are many other opportunities to do this, but I would say it's probably more sort of in the minority generally speaking we would prefer to get there organically.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And if I could, just one quick one on China, again on the blood screening, I think one of the opportunities that exist in China wasn't there something like 400 different blood banks or just a bunch of tenders and I think Andy you mentioned that they are moving now to more centralized purchasing. Is that a tailwind or a headwind for you guys in that market? Thanks.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So that is really more of a timing headwind. It's really not as far as our ability to catch those tenders it's really a neutral, but just as far as how quickly those tenders are issued and approved that gets slowed by this change.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Andy, you mentioned timing of expenses in the first quarter benefiting EPS, can you elaborate on what those were and do those shift into 2Q now?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, it's in our guidance, but it was basically continued hiring. We have a number of positions both on the commercial side and the R&D side we're continuing to ramp and we had forecasted that those would ramp a little bit quicker than they did. We still expect to fill those as we move, and we have been filling some of those thus far in the second quarter. So I think that will normalize through the year and that additional cost is in our guidance.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","And then in terms of the EPS guidance for the year, Andy could you help me reconcile something? So it looks like the GAAP EPS outlook went up by $0.02, but the non-GAAP number came down, I think, $0.05 or so at the midpoint and the amortization anticipated for the year is looks like meaningfully lower. Can you help me just bridge the delta on those components?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Let me get back to you on that because I don't have that in front of me, but I can get that to you very quickly.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then, I guess, any update in terms of the operating or free cash flow metrics for the year? Had you previously contemplated the pension payment in the first quarter?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We had contemplated a portion of the pension. We're still looking at $300 million for the year, and we still feel confident in our ability to generate that type of cash flow. So I think that's the overall metric hasn't change. As I mentioned earlier, we have some work to do around inventory. I think that's going to be helpful. I think we've got plans and leadership in place to do that. So I think nothing has really changed overall. And the pension funding itself, we really like to stay at around 80% on a funding basis and that just gets us back to that kind of comfort zone on funding. We don't have any more mandatory payments until late 2017 early 2018. So we're \u2013 but we're just trying to make sure we're conservative in our estimates around pension costs.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Super. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.","Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","So I guess my first question is a follow up on Waters. You've indicated that you expect Waters or the Waters deal to not meaningfully impact guidance, because it's initially at least for this year, it sounds like a substitution, is how you phrased it I believe?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Our understanding is that, this allows you to move a bit upstream with your product offering, and the types of applied customers you are addressing in that channel. If I remember correctly, from a few days ago, Waters guidance includes, what sounds like about $20 million in revenue associated with this deal for the balance of the year. When you kind of assume there is some sort of mark up here that would seem to translate into something like call it $22 million to $25 million in revenue for you guys. If we're thinking about it the right way, I guess, what I'm wondering is there really that much revenue to substitute with overlapping products, and how does this substitution impact margins? And I guess kind of the final part of the question is, was this contemplated in original guidance or is this, should we view this as a new development in the context of the full-year?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Let me try and hit a couple of those. So it was contemplated in the original guidance, I mean this is something we have been in discussions with Waters, and hopeful that we could get it sort of concluded before peak time which we were. With regard to margins, we think this is going to be probably neutral maybe a little helpful to margins, and I think the reason for that is that, as I mentioned in the prepared comments is, from a gross margin perspective it's maybe neutral or a little lower, but of course we can eliminate a fair amount of operating expenses associated with that. So I talked about sort of R&D that we spend today, also software engineers that we have that are associated with our, we have our own chromatography software. So we think from an operating margin perspective it could be neutral to accretive to us largely because of the operating expenses that we can reduce as a result of not having to support both the software and the production and R&D of the product.","With regard to the sort of how much incremental revenue is to us versus Waters, it's really difficult for me to comment on Waters. So I'll leave that up to them and I don't know if it's $20 million for 2015 or $20 million annualized, but again that's \u2013 again I'll leave that to them. I just I think when we look at the opportunity in 2015, and again I emphasize, I think we're excited about the opportunity. We just \u2013 I guess, we're being somewhat cautious in sort of trying to build in a lot of revenue upside. Now, as we get into 2016, I think we are quite excited about the opportunity from the standpoint as you point, we can go upstream a little bit particularly with the UPLC and selling more of our GC that will be tied to Empower, but I think for 2015 right now, we don't see this is a huge incremental.","Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That's really helpful color. Maybe just a couple quick ones on the quarter. Obviously, a really strong growth in operating margin quarter despite coming in at the lower end of your organic revenue growth guidance. Can you comment on whether there was anything notable that benefited margin? One thing that's come up a little bit over the last few quarters is lumpiness in licensing revenue, as we think about microfluidics and imaging, anything notable as it compared to say Q4 or Q1 levels of last year?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, specifically on licenses, actually that was a headwind for us in the quarter. So that as I mentioned before certainly around gross, around mix and the other items, I think were the primary drivers. And actually one other item I didn't mention was OneSource. There was fairly significant improvement in OneSource gross margins from the first quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year. If you look at or listen to an earlier question about, have we done anything? We really tried to accelerate some of the initiatives around supply chain on the gross margin side and around the indirect spend so that we can reinvest back in R&D and selling. So, I think we were particularly successful in the first quarter. Hopefully that'll continue through the next three quarters, but those were kind of the key drivers.","Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier with Maxim Group. Please proceed.","Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC","More on the Waters agreement, just wondering you talked a little bit about moving upstream, but I was curious in terms of geographies. Do you see the U.S. or China or what geographies do you see as being the greatest opportunity for you to sell into?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think we feel good sort of from a global geography. I mean if you look at the distribution of our business, clearly we've got strength in U.S. and Europe and China. So I think this is going to be hopefully helpful business across the globe. So I don't think I would spike down in any particular region or geographic area where I think this is going to be helpful.","Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC","Okay. And given the currency environment, have you made any changes to your capital spending or operating expense changes, and how easily can you make changes in the near and intermediate term?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think Andy alluded to a couple things. I think we've accelerated some of our actions around trying to get after sort of indirect cost and supply chain. But I would say, generally speaking, our approach has been, let's continue to stay on plan relative to our investments particularly in the areas of growth.","Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Bryan A. Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hi guys this is actually Bryan Kipp on behalf of Paul. Rob I just want to dig in a little bit into your research commentary. I think that you said for the full year low single-digit growth and I'm just thinking in context to your commentary around OneSource and Opera Phenix, if I just kind of do back of the envelope suggests that close to 50% of incremental could come from that 20% contribution on that side, so what's kind of the underlying dynamics going on there? Is it just academic and government pressure or is it kind of a new product cycle you guys need to have or go through to kind of reignite growth there?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think as we've talked about research in the past I think the thing to recognize is we've got a big radio chemical business that creates a fair amount of drag. As we get into the back half of the year we did have a nice introduction of Opera Phenix in the back half. We're going to cycle up against that now, hopefully we'll continue to grow that. And I would say the third area I would speak on when you're talking about research is Japan. I mean we didn't talk a lot about Japan, but clearly when I think about the first quarter the area that was and although we were at our sort of guidance range it was at the bottom end of the guidance range I would probably attribute that to a weaker Japan than we had expected. I mean we would have forecasted Japan sort of flattish for the first half, and it was down high single digits. And so we're a little cautious about how quickly that returns. I know the budget was recently approved here in April, but again based on what we're seeing and also when we sell into Japan that's probably one of the areas where the currency change is impacting us strategically. I would say if I was going to spike out one area where the strength of the dollar has been somewhat challenging from a strategic or a competitive perspective I would say Japan.","Bryan A. Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","If you get Japan to kind of come back around, I mean you can't control that, I understand, but, and the currencies kind of stabilize, can you get it back to the mid single-digit with your underlying portfolio or you think it kind of stays...","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think we can. And I think one of the things that we'll be able to, hopefully if we do that it'll be because we'll get the traction on the OneSource informatics and pull through of the products. I think that will be clear and then we continue to see good traction on the new products. So if our goal is to get that up to single digits \u2013 mid single digits. But I think for purposes of guidance, we continue to sort of forecast it in the low single digits.","Bryan A. Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","All right. And I just, one quick additional one. Did you guys see any net benefit from extra days in the quarter? And kind of what pricing conversations are you having? Are you more skewed towards new products or are you able to get some pricing here with the FX volatility?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We did not have any extra days in the quarter, I think we communicated it on our January call that we would have extra days in the third quarter of this year. But from a pricing perspective, we continue to be able to get pricing specifically on the reagent consumable side, it becomes a little tougher on the instrument side. But I think overall, it was fairly modest in the first quarter but we continue to try to get it wherever we can.","Bryan A. Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Appreciate it. Thanks again, guys.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliot with Baird. Please proceed.","Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Thanks guys. Just a follow up on OneSource. Can you talk about the competitive environment there? I guess what are you seeing from a win rate or a retention perspective?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well OneSource was strong in the quarter. I mean one of the things that now clearly with the restatement of those answers you get pretty good transparency in what OneSource was doing. But I think what you would see is that, OneSource on sort of a currency neutral basis grew mid-teens. And so, clearly we think we're continuing to do well there. We did have a couple wins from the standpoint of Gilead and Boehringer. And so I think the competition continues to be tough and challenging, but I think we continue to do well.","Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then, Andy, can you provide any color on the indirect spend initiative, I guess how much are you forecasting this year in terms of improvement? And then is there opportunity on the direct side of spending? You talk about indirect a lot, but how about on the direct side?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, that is actually the natural next step and we're \u2013 we've created a team to actually start to generate some efforts around the direct side, which we do think that there is opportunity in. I think on the indirect side, we've looked for a $10 million plus savings year-over-year. I think we're well on track for that, hopefully we can exceed that, but we've got dedicated resources, dedicated purchasing people, and I think we've got an organization that's really rallied around this, because it really does allow us to reinvest back.","So I would say, I feel as good if not better than I did going into the year on the indirect spend side, and I think the additional opportunity as you mentioned is direct side, so hopefully we'll have more to talk about that in the next couple of quarters.","Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Can you comment on performance of the recent acquisitions Ceiba and Perten, and are you still kind of assuming 7% to 8% growth for Perten for the year?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we were very pleased with Perten. We think the integration is going well. Perten actually grew sort of low double-digits in the first quarter. So we think they're well on track to probably exceed sort of the model we set out there and I think Andy mentioned the fact that we expect to probably do a little bit better than the $0.04 accretion that we talked about. So, I think, things are going well with Perten and I think we continue to see more opportunities with the synergies between what Perten does and what PerkinElmer does. So historically they've been a significant player within the grain area. We see rolling out then to things like edible oil and a number of other areas where the combined competencies of the twp companies can be quite powerful in the marketplace.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then just looking at some of the businesses, medical imaging rebounded a little bit. You guys have called out mid-single-digit organic growth. I mean I feel like that business hasn't grown in a while. How much of that was a comp issue versus potentially a recovery in the market?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think most of it, Tycho, was more of a comp issue. I think it's obviously it's a fairly choppy market and I think second half they are saying some headwinds. But overall if you look at \u2013 broadly at the market, it's under some pressure, but I still think we feel like we can have positive growth for the year in that business.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think the first quarter last year Tycho, they were sort of flat to down slightly.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yep. And then just a little \u2013 lastly a general question on the informatics business. I mean I'm trying to string together a couple points here, but I think you've talked about the need to hire additional software folks and maybe that's taking a little bit longer. We periodically get questions about just the fact that a lot of your software isn't up in the cloud and how do you kind of adapt? And do you need to kind of evolve faster on the software informatics side? And a third segment of that line of questioning, you do obviously have a tomo product with Dexela I think, maybe just talk about expectations for that for tomo synthesis.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Okay. I didn't hear what you said on the third one. Okay, so with regard to the informatics idea, I agree with you. We've talked about the fact that we've got to get a cloud product with regard to our electronic notebook and quite frankly most of what we do. We have a product right now out with the academic customers who are working on one I would call it sort of in process with regard to pharma. So we continue to make progress on there and to Andy's point earlier we continue to look to hire software engineers to sort of accelerate. That's an area where I think we clearly want to accelerate our spending from an R&D and engineering standpoint because we continue to see significant opportunities within the informatics business I would say both to sort of drive more of historical PerkinElmer products, but also to build out and continue to expand the core informatics capabilities and business. So we'll continue to invest on that.","And the last question was on the tomo product. And I think that's a relatively small product for us and we really haven't been pushing that tell you the truth.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Zarak Khurshid with Wedbush. Please proceed.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon, Rob, Andy, Tommy.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions. As we think about all the productivity enhancements ongoing and planned for this year, Andy, how impactful do you think they may be relative to the big productivity initiatives over the past few years?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I would say the heavy lifting we did in 2013 and part of 2014 were probably the high watermarks. But I would say, we're probably in a \u2013 if you want to do a relative, we're probably 70% of those types of levels. It's just a different area that we're focused on whereas in 2013 and 2014, we were really looking at shrinking the footprint and rightsizing the organization. This is really looking at spend and given we have the flexibility now to look at it on a corporate wide basis, we see a lot of opportunities there. But and I think it's opportunity that we'll see over the next \u2013 certainly a couple to three years, as we start to move, and as I mentioned earlier into the direct side as well.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Very helpful. Thanks for that. And then just a follow-on \u2013 a lot of questions today on the M&A strategy, what about divestitures? How do you think about kind of simplifying the business?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I mean, I think we were always challenging ourselves from the standpoint of the portfolio and whether the rightful owner of assets. I guess my preference would be is \u2013 I'd like to sort of buy before we sell. So if we can be successful with some sizable acquisitions, I think we might look at a couple product line prunings, but quite frankly, when we look across the portfolio, we think most of the things fit pretty well, but like I said, I don't know that I want to get smaller before I get bigger.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Makes sense. Thanks. And then just a follow-up on China. Can you give us a rough sense for how large the Chinese infectious disease business can get and how much runway you think you have there over the next couple years? Thanks, guys.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I think on the infectious disease side, or is it newborn? Infectious disease, right? I would say...","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that can be a significant business for us, and depending on the timeframe, clearly north of $100 million.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Great.

This is actually Alex Nowak on for Bill.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","All right, and to follow up to your \u2013 in follow up to your previous comment what are your Japanese research funding assumptions going forward? Are you still expecting flat growth \u2013 did you bring these down following the quarter?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think what we've got for the remainder of the year is flat and may even be actually a little negative in the second quarter, quite frankly. So I would say low-single and then sort of flattish in the back half.","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. All right. Excellent. And then in U.S. newborn screening you said that the birth rates were slowing. Do you still see that there is \u2013 you can still continue your growth there with menu expansion? Or do you think this even could be like an uptick in Medicare coverage with the Affordable Care Act?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I just want to correct. I don't know that we said it was slowing. I mean, we might have said it was slow single, but I think for \u2013 at least what the data we look at says that the U.S. birth rate is sort of stable, but it's a sort of 1% to 2% range. I don't know that we're seeing anything significantly slowing. If we're talking specifically in the U.S., I think the opportunity to grow there is to expand the menu and we've talked about kids in the past. We continue to see that being adopted by states. I think if you look out a year or two probably the next series of tests are probably around LSD, but I would say for the next couple quarters, I think the majority of the growth in newborn is going to come probably outside the U.S. and probably specifically within newborn.","One of the areas we're actually quite excited about as I mentioned the fact that we got the China FDA approval of our GSP which is our sort of automated analyzer. And I think what that does is, two things for us. One is, it first of all allows us to take the number of tests today that are done manually and put them on automated platform. And as we continue to get approval of the assays, I think it will accelerate the ramp of the menu. Second, it starts to really differentiate us from the competition. So, I think we've talked about in the past that we have sort of 70% market share in China. And most cases, what we're competing against is local home brews or others that are doing manual. We don't think \u2013 clearly, there is nobody else who has a regulated or approved automated analyzer. And so again, as more and more of China moves to an automated which we think they will in order to get higher throughput, it provides us a huge differentiated advantage and allows us to ramp screening much quicker.","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay, excellent. And then real quick, how big was the OneSource business in the quarter? Thanks.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It was $29 million, but...","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","$35 million.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","$35 million.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","$35 million.","Robert F.

Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America please proceed.","Derik De Bruin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hi, good afternoon.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hi Derik.","Derik De Bruin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hey, you talked about some contract wins in OneSource, but is there anything coming up for renewal? I believe your Merck contract is coming up soon and just talk about sort of, is there anything that we need to watch out for on the headlines going forward in that business?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Derik, I am not aware of any significant contracts that are coming up in 2015, so I don't \u2013 I mean in any given year we probably got some of that because I think as you know, most of these are on a three-year cycle, so there may be some small ones, but I don't think there is anything significant.","Derik De Bruin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Great. And could you \u2013 just how big is your Japan business?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's $50 million or so.","Derik De Bruin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Great. And I guess speaking of currencies, some of your competitors had made some comments about customers losing some purchasing power, because they didn't have enough cash basically to buy products and so things were delayed. Did you see any of that in the quarter?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. Not that I'm aware of.","Derik De Bruin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","And so Andy, you talked about some of the expenses being delayed a little bit in the quarter, so should we expect to see those expenses in Q1 going in Q2?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","They'll gradually go through Q2 and the balance of units. It's really around hiring, and at any point in time...","Derik De Bruin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Got you.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We're constantly hiring, but I guess it'll be a slow ramp as we continue to bring the informatics and the R&D resources on board.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And so Derik, let me correct. So the $50 million I gave you was sort of Human Health, for PerkinElmer it's $80 million for Japan. Sorry about that.","Derik De Bruin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Got you. Great. And that was down \u2013 and that was down you said that was down high single digits, correct?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","High single-digits, yeah.","Derik De Bruin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. All right. Great. Thank you very much. That's helpful.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson with Mizuho. Please proceed.","Peter R. Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hi, Andy. Just long term, where do you think margins can eventually go?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, I think on the operating margin front, we've felt all along that we should have a two-handle in front of our operating margin. And I think we've set a goal of getting to 20% plus in 2017. I think with the volatility of currency, it makes it a bit tougher. It's still our goal. But I would say, in that timeframe or maybe just slightly longer, we still see our way to doing that. And I think we have plans in place, FX aside, that will help continue to improve our margin. So I don't think there is anything structural that would keep us from hitting those types of goals.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Operator?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Peter did we lose you?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research. Please proceed.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. A lot of them have been asked, but two things. First on Perten, can you discuss if there is any seasonality in that business as the revenue there looked a little bit lighter than I was expecting? And then just I guess if you could also reconcile the 2% addition of revenue from acquisition versus the 3% that's shown in the latter part of your press release? And then I have one follow-up.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So I'll only take the first one, and I'll give the second one to Andy. So clearly there is seasonality in Perten, and to your point, when we looked historically, the first quarter is light, second quarter starts to pick up a little bit, but their real strong quarter is the third quarter. And it ties to the sort of harvest season. So clearly, there is some cyclicality. And that's both on the revenue side, and clearly on the profitability side as well.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, the only difference I think, on the reconciliation and I'll double check for you, Steve, but there is some purchase accounting adjustments in the numbers as well as the revenues that roll up to that 3%, so there could be some rounding in there, but I'll double check that, and get back to you.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then I guess, just my other follow-up and I apologize if you already discussed this topic was just on the in vivo imaging business and how that's performing. I know that there are some patents that rolled off last year and if you guys had any color or commentary on that would be helpful.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think on the product basis, that did well this quarter and our expectation is for that to continue to do well. As you mentioned, there will be, there was some patents that rolled, or there's some royalties that rolled-off in the first quarter, there'll continue to be some that'll create a headwind in the second quarter, and then by the third quarter they are gone effectively. Right, because we anniversary the patents, the patents were expired in the middle of last year. So if you look at just the product, I think it continues to do well sort of high single digits.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue. I will now turn the call over to Rob Friel for closing remarks.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. So first of all thanks for all your questions and in closing let me just reiterate that we feel very good about the accomplishments in the first quarter, and believe we are well positioned to deliver another strong year for PerkinElmer.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Tommy Thomas, Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Tommy Thomas - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Christy. Good afternoon and welcome to PerkinElmer's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website until November 19, 2015.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future, even if our estimates change, so you should not rely on any of today's forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date after today.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures.

To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during this call that are not reconciled to GAAP in the attachment, we will provide the reconciliations promptly.","I'm now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel. Rob?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report that we delivered strong financial results during the third quarter. We grew revenue on a constant currency basis by 10% and grew organic revenue by 6% with 7% growth in Human Health and 5% growth in Environmental Health. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 16% on a constant currency basis, and we continued to expand adjusted operating margins.","Through the first nine months of 2015, we are tracking well to our financial guidance provided in January despite some incremental headwinds in a few end markets. The success we saw in the third quarter reinforces PerkinElmer's strategy of innovating across our core capabilities of detection, imaging, software and service, which allows us to build strong market positions and attractive end markets.","Our deep market knowledge and breadth of scientific capabilities means we can deliver targeted solutions to our customers, fueling breakthroughs that help improve quality and longevity of life. I would like to highlight a few examples from the third quarter, where our unique capabilities continued to support our customers in the critical work they perform. In the area of imaging, we are working with a number of top-tier research institutions in cancer immunotherapy through advanced research and the interaction between mechanism of host and disease.","Using PerkinElmer's vector multispectral imaging platform combined with our novel multiplex labeling reagents and image analysis algorithms, these customers are now able to visualize and quantify the complex relationships between cancer and immune cells in samples of diseased tissue. Critically, these interactions are shedding light on important biological pathways at the heart of immuno-oncology such as PD-1 and PDL-1 that are enabling some of the most promising new cancer treatments.","Additionally, during the third quarter we expanded our relationship with the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Science in Victoria, Australia. Researchers there are relying on a number of our analytical instruments and lab automation systems to study the impact of inhaled oxytocin on preventing or treating postpartum hemorrhage, a leading cause of mental mortality or maternal mortality.","In the area of research, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies recently purchased our suite of high content imaging and informatics solutions to screen their vast libraries of compounds and assays, the activity of small molecules and biologics on suther (4:33) phenotypes.","PerkinElmer scientists and engineers have developed a way to read out this activity at the cellular and sub-cellular levels and combined with our advanced machine learning based software, we're enabling this customer to automate and rapidly deploy image analysis across large numbers of samples.","The key element behind our ability to meet customers' big data challenges has been the development and validation of enterprise informatics solutions to enable the integration and management of these rich, complex, multivariate data sets. I've shared this particular example because it reinforces the value of offering unique imaging and detection capabilities as well as the analysis visualization and collaboration software to understand, interpret and share relevant information.","Increasingly, our research customers are realizing the value in our full solutions that draw upon our entire portfolio, including informatics, OneSource services and advanced imaging and detection products. In the third quarter alone, business with our top research global accounts, which comprised about 10% of our sales grew mid teens. This ability to combine detection analysis software and service has been one of the cornerstones of our newborn screening business for many years and is why PerkinElmer solutions and expertise are vital components in global healthcare agendas.","Our newborn screening franchise continued to make good progress in the quarter to support customers' needs to expand screening. In Kyrgyzstan, a new program was established that will serve about 250,000 births per year. We also helped to bring skin testing to more countries piloting menu expansions, and in our medical lab in Suzhou, China is meeting pent-up demand for neonatal, prenatal and infectious disease screening across China.","During the third quarter, we continued to introduce new products into the market, as we are committed to both responding to and anticipating change through a relentless focus on innovation to solve customer challenges. In the third quarter, we debuted our Opal tissue staining kits, which are part of our new Phenoptics workflow offering and includes staining capabilities, imaging technologies and image analysis software to help customers in the fast growing area of quantitative pathology. As I mentioned previously, these capabilities are enabling researchers, oncologists and pathologists to better characterize immune cells and tumor cells within tissue in ways not previously possible.","During Q3, we also launched Signals for Translational, which is a cloud-based informatics platform for pharmaceutical researchers that aggregates, manages and analyzes experimental and clinical data from multiple sources. Signals for Translational helps scientists better progress from data acquisition to biomarker discovery and validation as they develop drugs tailored to patient's individual needs. And with the growing majority of top global pharmaceutical companies engaged in translational work. We see PerkinElmer's Signals platform as a key enabler in this field.","In addition, we introduced the TGA 8000 analyzer for advance materials characterization. This is a prime example of how we are evolving our detection capabilities so that PerkinElmer customers can better progress from samples to answers and insights. The TGA's range of applications includes determining contaminates in products or in their packaging. To answer an increasing need across the customer base, this instrument runs on new software for high sensitivity thermal analysis and features remote status monitoring.","As we move ahead, we see clear opportunities that benefit from positive long-term trends across human and environmental health. In the near-term however, we are balancing our long-term enthusiasm, while closely monitoring several areas of uncertainty. Among the strongest tailwinds are the biotech and pharma markets, where our global account approach and product offerings give us access to attractive areas bolstered by heavy customer investment.","Additionally in China, while the overall economy is slowing, the criticality of our solutions directly address long-term priorities for the country. Last week's announcement of the end to the one child policy should noticeably boost our business over the next several years. Furthermore, the government's focus on ensuring a cleaner environment, safer food and overall access to healthcare will hopefully translate into positive impacts for both local funding and China's next Five Year Plan.","In Europe, a number of countries' economies are stabilizing, although the current immigration issue could redirect spending in certain sectors. And lastly, the US is on track for solid growth as we close out the year.","On the other hand, a significant headwind in the short-term is Japan's deteriorating economy as funding delays are causing very weak academic and government spending. Our medical imaging business also faces tougher market conditions than it has in years past. More recently, customer ordering patterns for this business have become incrementally challenging, creating further softness in the fourth quarter.","Furthermore, as you're all aware, the strength of the US dollar is posing challenges for emerging countries such as Brazil. This is coupled with the drop in oil prices, forcing oil-producing countries to normalize demand, potentially softening future revenues and curtailing research and spending on improving healthcare.","On balance, we are optimistic about the macro conditions but recognize some markets remain challenging. Based on our guidance for the fourth quarter of 3% to 4% organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $0.86 to $0.89, we would deliver full-year results of 8% revenue growth in constant currency, organic revenue growth of 4% and adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis of approximately 13%.","However, just as important as these financial results, we continue to make excellent progress in advancing the strategic priorities of the company and improving our operational and technical capabilities. Our success to date positions us to deliver on our commitments to our customers and shareholders while driving our mission to improve human and environmental health.","I would now like to turn the call over to Andy to give more color around our Q3 results and fourth quarter guidance.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our third quarter results and details around our fourth quarter 2015 guidance. Given the continuing impact of foreign exchange on the comparability of our results, I'll once again provide much of my commentary on a constant currency basis in order to better portray the results in the quarter.","For the third quarter, we reported approximately 10% constant currency revenue growth and 6% organic revenue growth with foreign exchange representing a headwind of approximately 6%. As we have previously communicated, there was an extra week in the third quarter and we estimate the impact of that extra week on organic revenues was approximately 2%.","Adjusted revenues were $563.6 million in the third quarter as compared to $542.9 million in the same period a year ago, driven by broad-based demand. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.60, up 16% on a constant currency basis from $0.57 in the comparable period a year ago. Looking at our geographic results, we experienced mid single digit organic revenue growth in the Americas and Asia and high single digit organic revenue growth in Europe.","Year-to-date, organic revenue growth has been mid single digits across all three regions. We are pleased to report that our results in Europe have shown positive organic growth in the last five quarters and we expect demand in Europe to remain stable for the balance of the year. In China, revenues grew high single digits organically and we remain comfortable with our full year outlook of high single digit organic revenue growth.","As to our operating results, third quarter adjusted gross margins were $47.2%, up 40 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by volume leverage, mix and productivity gains. For the nine month period, gross margins improved by 50 basis points on a constant currency basis.","Third quarter adjusted SG&A was 24.8% of adjusted revenues, essentially flat over the same period a year ago. For the first nine months of 2015, SG&A is down 50 basis points on a constant currency basis, the result of continued operating leverage and from our indirect spend initiatives.","Research and development spending in the third quarter was up modestly as compared to the same period a year ago, driven by continued investments in innovative new product development and incremental investment at Perten. Year to date R&D spending is up approximately 30 basis points on both a reported and adjusted basis as the impact from FX was immaterial.","Overall, we were pleased with our operational performance in the third quarter as we expanded our constant currency adjusted operating margins over 50 basis points and approximately 70 basis points year to date. We're encouraged by our third quarter margin expansion given the difficult comparison from the prior period.","Net interest and other expense in the third quarter was approximately $12 million, impacted by higher than expected foreign currency losses in the period offsetting a favorable adjusted tax rate for the quarter of approximately 19%. We expect our adjusted tax rate for the full year to be approximately 20.5%, which is consistent with our performance year to date.","Switching to the segments, third quarter organic revenues in our Human Health business increased approximately 7% and Environmental Health organic revenues grew approximately 5%. Year to date, organic revenues have increased 5% in our Human Health business and 3% in our Environmental Health business.","From an end market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 61% of reported revenue in the quarter with diagnostics contributing 28% of revenue and research 33% of revenue. Organic revenue growth from our diagnostic business increased high single digits off a double digit comparison in the comparable prior year period. This was driven by continued strength in our newborn screening franchise offset by flat organic revenue in medical imaging due to difficult prior year comparisons and customer ordering patterns.","We continue to be encouraged by the broad acceptance of our new cassette and CMOS offerings, but expect a challenging fourth quarter due to softening demand within the radiology and radiation oncology end markets. We expect these conditions to persist through the first half of 2016, but anticipate the softness to be partially offset by demand for our new cassette and CMOS product launches.","We once again experienced strength across our diagnostics offerings in China, growing double digit in the quarter with a strong performance in our newborn screening and prenatal business. As Rob mentioned, we're pleased that China has announced the elimination of the one child policy, and we believe that this should have a positive impact for our diagnostics offerings over the next several years. Our Haoyuan blood screening business had an excellent quarter of growth, albeit off a low base. We're hopeful that the adoption and enforcement of nucleic acid testing begins to ramp more quickly in the coming months, but visibility as to the exact timing remains unclear.","Organic revenue in our life science solutions business grew high single digits in the third quarter, driven by strong instrument sales and high content screening and imaging, strength from our informatics offerings and robust growth at our OneSource multi-vendor services in spite of a very difficult prior year comparison. We continue to be pleased with the double digit growth we're seeing with key global pharmaceutical and biotech customers, the result of our efforts since early this year to better combine our research, informatics and OneSource multi-vendor service offerings into targeted solutions.","Globally, we continue to see stability in academic and government end markets, while pharma and biotech markets have improved with the exception of Japan, which continues to experience weak demand.","Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represented approximately 39% of reported revenue in the quarter. Revenues grew 5% organically. Our third quarter results benefited from increased food and environmental demand with stability in industrial end markets, driven to a large extent by success from our inorganic, Perten and material characterization offerings.","We're pleased to report that Perten had another good quarter. I recently visited with the team in Sweden and came away more bullish about the opportunity to expand our addressable market as we look to develop more dedicated food analyzers combined with our FTIR capabilities with Perten's core technology. We believe there are a number of additional cross-business opportunities as Perten benefits from the broader global reach and footprint of PerkinElmer.","Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the third quarter with approximately $1 billion of debt and nearly $200 million of cash. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million of our outstanding shares for a total consideration of approximately $72 million. We exited the quarter with a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3 times and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.9 times.","Turning to cash flow. We continue to see strong cash collections, offset by additional inventory requirements. Year to date adjusted operating cash flow from continuing operations was $189 million, essentially flat versus the same period a year ago. The increase in working capital reflects additional inventory related to new product launches, including our relationship with Waters, as well as normal seasonal patterns. We expect these levels to decline over the balance of the year and continue to expect our full year adjusted free cash flow to net income ratio to be consistent with our guidance provided earlier in the year.","Overall, we are pleased with our year to date performance as revenues grew organically 4%, gross and operating margins expanded 50 and 70 basis points respectively and adjusted earnings per share grew 15%, all on a constant currency basis. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we believe we were well positioned across the majority of the portfolio to deliver another solid top and bottom line performance despite a couple of areas of softness, specifically medical imaging in Japan as well as the strengthening of the dollar.","As a result, we now expect our fourth quarter reported revenues to be in the range of $610 million to $620 million, which represents approximately 7% constant currency revenue growth and organic revenue growth in a range of 3% to 4%. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.89, which represents approximately 9% constant currency growth at the midpoint.","For the full year, we're narrowing the range of our adjusted earnings per share to $2.56 to $2.59, with the midpoint maintained at $2.57, representing 13% constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth. For modeling purposes, you should focus on the midpoint of the revenue adjusted EPS guidance ranges, as our most likely view for the fourth quarter.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Christy, at this time we could open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Your line is open.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. I guess my first question is really on capital deployment. So Rob, you've talked about having $1 billion of M&A capacity for the next few years. You've talked about the deal pipeline being robust, but acknowledged that valuations are still pretty high. I think while it's only been a few quarters since you outlined some of the criteria, the activity has been somewhat limited. Would you be willing to share how you're thinking about the deal pipeline today and when you might pivot to other ways of deploying capital, if the opportunity to pursue M&A remains limited?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So as you mentioned, we continue to feel like we've got a good pipeline. I would say it's again as you mentioned, I think some of the valuations have been a little challenging. So one of the things, I think Andy talked about it, we did buy some shares back in the third quarter. I think it was about $70 million or so we spent on share repurchasing. And the way we're thinking about this is, obviously as the deployment of the capital from an M&A perspective gets delayed, obviously in the quarters we continue to generate more cash flow. So we're getting more comfortable with the idea of saying we can take shares out and still maintain significant capacity to do M&A. So that's why you saw in third quarter, we started to get a little more aggressive on the share buybacks. And so I think if we continue to be unable to do some things on M&A perspective, we would continue to return the cash back to shareholders through share buyback.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Is there some point where you might thinking about doing something more meaningful in the form of a buyback?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think we continue to feel pretty optimistic about our ability to do some things on the M&A perspective. So hopefully, we'll see how things change, but as of right now, I think given our view that we think we can get some things done here, probably unlikely to see something where it would be a big share buyback, but I think doing a little bit of both I think is probably what I would expect going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. This is actually Joel Kaufman in for Issac. Just to start off first with margins. Obviously the margin story has progressed nicely over the past couple years. Could you maybe just clarify exactly what are the key operational initiatives you guys are focused on going forward to drive that next leg of margin expansion aside from driving just top line growth?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, I think a key part of it is the leverage we're going to get from the top line. We've always said that's really about half of what we think we can deliver from a margin expansion perspective. We also have talked quite a bit about indirect spend. Year to date we actually on a constant currency basis have saved $10 million year over year on our indirect spend initiative. So we're actually a little ahead of schedule there. Obviously, all this has been impacted somewhat by the change in FX rates, but I think overall we still feel comfortable with that cadence of 60 to 80 basis points, 70 to 100 basis points of margin expansion going forward, assuming reasonable growth.","We also have rolled out some lean initiatives. I think that's going to help drive some of the progress on the gross margin side, specifically within the factory. So I think you're going to see really three pieces, continue tight controls over SG&A. I think you'll, it continue to see margin expansion on the gross margin side through factory enhancements and efficiencies. And then the leverage we get from the top line and hopefully that's also going to end up continuing to be a positive mix as we're seeing Human Health grow at a faster pace than Environmental Health and they have higher margins.","Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. And then just one on Europe, appreciate the comments you guys made earlier there and calling out the strength and in the region. Should we be thinking about that as just easing comps or a broader improvement in underlying demand?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I actually think it's a little bit of both. I mean clearly we're getting the benefit of a difficult 2014, but I think at the same time, we mentioned the fact that we are seeing some stabilization in demand, and so I think going forward, we feel pretty good about the pace of growth in Europe. I would say the only area that we're sort of watching a little closely here, and again I think we called that out a little bit, is with the recent pressure on the immigration, we're a little concerned that you could see some shifting of prioritization and to the extent that that may impact some of the incremental spending going into healthcare and research. But generally speaking, we feel pretty good about the demand profile in Europe.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Bryan Brokmeier of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi, good afternoon. Furthering the question on M&A. Have you seen, you said you've seen challenging valuations, but some other companies in the space have talked about seeing some of those valuations come down, start to pull in a little bit. Some companies are starting to be a little bit more reasonable given the pullback in the space. Are you seeing that as well? And then secondly you also I believe talked about having about $1 billion in capacity to do M&A. Is that still how you'd look at it despite the recent share buybacks and sort of other things you've done with your capital deployment?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I would say on the valuation side, possibly, I mean probably for us the fact that the IPO market is getting a little bit more challenging probably with the smaller private companies, I think that's helpful. I think for some of the more public companies, I don't think the valuations expectations have changed much at least from my perspective. With regard to the $1 billion, I mean the way we think about that is both our borrowing capacity as well as our free cash flow generation over the next couple years. And I think the combination of those two leads us to believe that we could probably spend up to $1 billion.","Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Great. And what areas that you most focused on? You recently I guess that's been about a year now since you did the Perten acquisition. But is food safety still an area where you're focused on or are you more taking a look at on the Human Health side such as diagnostics and your biopharma business?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I think first of all, one of the good things I think about PerkinElmer is both businesses I think have attractive aspects from an end market perspective. So clearly the environmental side, whether it's food or even in some of the applications within water, I think we continue to be \u2013 I think are very attractive. On the Human Health side, I think both the area of diagnostics, anything we could do to expand our franchise there. And selectively within the research areas again and then I would say the other area which really cuts across both is the area of software and informatics. So I think across the majority of the businesses, we would looked to be adding there from a bolt-on acquisition perspective.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mira Minkova of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good afternoon guys. Thank you for taking my question.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Maybe, let me start with your organic growth guidance for the fourth quarter. It seems like a bit of step down versus what you've done in the last couple of quarters, 3% to 4%. Appreciate that you had mentioned the comments on Japan, medical imaging. Is there anything else that we should be considering that may be happening in the fourth quarter, and also what are you assuming for budget flush there?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So first of all, we're not assuming any budget flush in the numbers that we are forecasting. But I would say probably three things, and you mentioned two of them. One is clearly medical imaging and Japan and we probably think those combined are probably a 150 basis point headwind. And then I would say the third thing is if you recall, we had fairly strong Q4 last year. So we are cycling against a pretty strong comp. So, I would say the combination of those three things is something that we're considering when we give the guidance.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Got you. And on the change to the one child policy in China, obviously that you called it out, it must be a good thing for you. Help us, if you could please remind us how big your China neonatal business is right now, and how would you think about the impact?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So first of all, I would say I think the impact longer term is going to be very helpful. When you think about 17 million children born in China, the potential for that to grow and maybe grow fairly significantly I think is real. I think the real question is, how long or what's sort of the ramp, and of course I think that's a difficult thing to quantify in the short term.","One of the things we have done is we've gone back and you may recall in November of 2013, there was a relaxation of the one child policy for parents who were only children. And if you look over the last two years, there has been about 1.4 million of those parents that have applied for second children. That represents a little bit more than 10% of the parents that were actually eligible to do that. And if we go back and look at our business, that probably tracks pretty well that we think that had about a 12% to 15% impact on the growth in the newborn screening business. So again, if that's sort of a proxy of what's going to happen this time, you're going to see an increase, but it's going to be a fairly slow ramp. Hope that's helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, with all the focus on new products, I guess can we get an update on what you're seeing in contribution from all the new products you launched earlier this year?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we feel very good about the progress there. We talked about it in the beginning of the year, about a $30 million or $35 million contribution incrementally in 2015, and we think we're going to exceed the top end of that range. As we look at through the Q3 and what our expectations are for Q4, we think we'll be north of the $35 million incremental benefit.","Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And do you have any anecdotes about the kind of synergies you now see (32:33) informatics and some of the other businesses? I know you've kind of moved around different pieces of the business lately, but an update on the synergies you're seeing there?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah well, a couple of them I sort of mentioned in my prepared remarks when I talked about the progress we're having with the sort of pharmaceutical companies. When we think about historically, we would have provided them say imaging equipment and now by packaging that together, we have customers now that are not only ordering our imaging equipment, but ordering some of our software, specifically sort of high content imaging software as well as Spotfire licenses and even in some cases enterprise related software. And if you look at the key global accounts, the top 20 global accounts where we've combined our informatics, OneSource and product offerings, those customers are growing mid teens through the first three quarters of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Arias of Citi. Your line is open.","Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys. This is actually Bryan Kipp on behalf of Dan. Rob, question for you. I mean on the margin \u2013 Rob or Andy. On the margin front, I mean strong organic. I know the mix was probably a little bit less favorable just because it was 61% versus 62% last year. But was still surprised by the soft incremental contributions here despite the strong organic pull through. So what were the dynamics there that maybe softened that? Was it one-time items? Was it mix, or was there something else in there?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I would say first of all, if you look at the beat on the top line, that fundamentally came in two areas. One is OneSource, and I think Andy talked about this was very strong. So we saw very strong growth in the OneSource offering. Again potentially benefited from the point earlier, where we're sort of combining it with OneSource in the product offerings and that has lower incrementals.","I would say the other thing to point out is when we talked about the incremental higher revenue from the additional week, that also comes at relatively low margins. Because if you think about it, you're amortizing the cost sort of again 1\/52 over that period of time, and the revenue for those additional days is much lower. So again the flow through on the incremental revenue from the week and the incremental revenue from OneSource lowers the flow through. Having said that, if you look at our EPS growth on a constant currency basis, it was still 16%.","Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Appreciate it, and a two pronged one. One, the Europe comment that you had, are you guys seeing any softness because of a massive influx of refugees or is that just kind of a long tail? And the other thing is, can you just contextualize maybe the Opal tissue contribution cloud-based stuff, the launch that you did in 3Q with next year? Just early color, market, addressable market size, et cetera.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah so I would say, so first of all, I don't know that we're seeing anything directly from an orders perspective, but I would say we're hearing it in discussions with customers. So I would say it's a concern; at least it's a concern of the customers. But I wouldn't say we're seeing any hard evidence of that today. But I think obviously something we're aware of. I think with regard to the imaging opportunities, I think the way we think about that today is largely in the research use only, and I think in that, it's probably a $30 million to $40 million market opportunity for us. I think the greater market potential is to get it into the clinic. And that's something we're talking about and discussing internally, whether we make that investment or partner. But I think the significant growth opportunity there would be more in the clinical side. But having said that, we do see a nice $30 million to $40 million market on the research use only.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Rob, we've seen in the market more entries into the service side of the business. Are you seeing greater competition because of your success in the service strategy you deployed quite a while ago?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know that we're seeing any more competition. I guess my view is the competition has always been pretty formidable. But as I sort of mentioned before, we continue to do quite well. OneSource had a very strong quarter in Q3. And if you look at sort of year to date, they're growing well in the sort of mid teens or better. So we continue to do well and I think it has to do with not only I think the reputation and execution capability of the team, but also as we increase our capabilities around software informatics and again package it with this global account focus. We continue to see significant opportunity to grow that business.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","And then lastly on the reagent side, I know that's been lower growth that you've liked in the past. How do you feel about your product mix now on the reagent side of your portfolio?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I would say on the Human Health side particularly on research, that's been a real area of focus from an R&D perspective, sort of late 2014 and 2015, and we saw nice traction this quarter. So I think our reagents were up about, I'll call it low to mid teens in the quarter. Obviously diagnostics was strong; we saw strong in research. I think environmental is still an area, and it's less research and it's more consumables. We're seeing decent growth there, but we still need to get that up as a percentage of our revenue. But we were pleased with the performance, like I said particularly on the research side this quarter as some the investments we made in research and development were providing us benefits.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hello.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hello.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hi, Derik.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can you hear me? Hey.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can you give a little bit more color on the medical imaging business? I mean are those products a little bit higher margin? and I guess what overall percentage of your sales is the medical imaging business?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So medical imaging is probably I think call it 8% of our revenue, depending on the quarter, but in that sort of general range. If you look at medical imaging, you can think about it in three markets, there is the radiology market, there is an oncology market, and then there is I'll call it an industrial market. And roughly speaking, we'll call that a third, a third, a third. We continue to do very well in the industrial market. I think that's a combination of some new products we've gotten out there and I think we continue to capture share there. I think the challenge that we face is more in the radiology and oncology.","And I would point out a couple things. First of all, obviously this is a business while we continue to think is very attractive, has a demand profile that's probably more volatile than the rest of the other PerkinElmer businesses, largely because it serves a more capital-intensive end market. So again, while we think it's an attractive business, clearly differentiated capabilities and overall serving attractive markets, it is going to have a little bit more volatility because of the capital intensity of their customers.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. That's helpful. And did I hear you correctly, you felt like the medical imaging business would be down in at least until the second half of next year?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we believe it will be down in Q4 and we're not really getting into 2016 guidance now. But I would say it's probably going to be stronger in the back half of 2016 than it is in the front half. Unclear whether it'll actually be down in the first half of 2016.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dane Leone of BTIG. Your line is open.","Dane Leone - BTIG LLC","Hi. Thank you very much for the update. So kind of a bigger picture question here. You guys have a good diversity of businesses, where you are a leader in those businesses and that's served you guys pretty well, especially over the last couple quarters versus peers in terms of some volatility. I guess the strategic question is, you guys have flexibility and can be pretty nimble into moving into new markets. What's the appetite for moving into some of the higher growth, higher margin markets more aggressively like clinical diagnostics, perhaps point of care, molecular or more of the core genomic space?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I guess the way I would describe that is, when we think about sort of philosophically the portfolio in businesses that we're sort of attracted to, I would say we think about a couple things. First of all, is it a business that fits well with PerkinElmer. And what I mean by that is, is it consistent with our mission and vision around human, environmental health. The second thing is, is it attractive from the end-market, again does it have differentiated capabilities, are the financial returns attractive, and then finally, are we appropriate owners, meaning can we make it better, are we willing to invest in it and what does it do for the overall portfolio.","So I think a number of the areas that you mentioned, I think probably fit all those from the standpoint it's consistent with the mission, obviously attractive growth, in some cases we'd have to understand and make sure the financial returns are appropriate. And I think a lot of them would fit well with what we do. So whether it's additional investments in clinical diagnostics or et cetera. Just finding the right assets and making sure the returns make sense relative to the price. But I think all those areas and a majority of those areas are ones that I think we would find attractive, if we thought the asset fit well with what we're trying to achieve and we could make sense out of the financial returns.","Dane Leone - BTIG LLC","So if we think about the success that you've had with the Caliper transaction, moving into new markets or adjacencies, do you think it's a better strategy to work in maybe a smaller part of the market and then broaden out, say like starting in single cell and then broaden out, or go with a very broad platform technology to kind of make the first footprint there?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well it's a little hard to generalize overall, but I would say our success has been generally more in areas that are sort of more niched, where we can be differentiated based on capability and rather than taking on some of the larger players in let's say molecular diagnostics or some of the broader areas.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for all the color here and thanks for taking the questions. Just two pretty simple ones from me, one for Rob and one for Andy. Rob, the commentary that you gave on the health of the different end markets was really thorough and really helpful. Would it be fair to say that as we roll it all up, I mean thinking about where we are at health end markets as we look out over the next several months, is it in total roughly the same in terms of the end market growth outlook as a year ago, the moving parts or the sub-components just differently mixed in terms of what's a growth driver or not? And if not then how might you compare the profile, the aggregate end market growth now to a year ago?","And then my second question for Andy, I wondered if you can give us any sense, based on what you're seeing right now in terms of currencies, what the currency impact on the model might be in 2016, broad strokes, top line margin, earnings impact. If you have any rough sense, it would be very helpful. Thanks guys.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So let me take the first one. So I would say, if we're talking about markets from a geographic perspective, I would have a tendency to agree with you, which is there is sort of pluses and minuses. But I would say the geographic end markets, meaning sort of North America, Europe, emerging markets, sort of puts and takes, but they're probably fairly consistent with what we would expect it in total.","When I think about the sort of application or the end markets from a customer's perspective, the one exception I would say would be in medical imaging. So I think diagnostics is probably about what we thought, maybe marginally a little bit better. I think research maybe is marginally a little bit better. I think environmental is probably okay and maybe the industrials are a little bit more challenged. So maybe that all balances out. But I do think particularly in the back half of the year, medical imaging is probably being a little \u2013 we're finding the markets a little bit more challenging. So on the margin, if you think about that being 8% of our business or so, it's creating a little bit of a headwind, call it 50 to 100 basis points.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And Steve on your second question, we're in the midst of rolling up our annual plan right now, and obviously the distribution of that revenue and profit is going to have a significant impact on the impact of FX. I will say for the fourth quarter, given where the euro is right now and where some of the other currencies, larger buckets are, it's probably a $0.015 to $0.02 of headwind for us in the fourth quarter that's factored into our guidance. But that's how I would characterize it at this point.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Hey guys. Rob, you've been around in business for a long time. I guess, how would you characterize where we are in the cycle? I'm thinking more in the environmental businesses and maybe some of the industrial pieces, where we are in this cycle versus maybe the last cycle. It seems a bit tough to figure out with the US stronger and obviously all the emergings challenged. I mean I guess one, how has it made you think about the positioning of that part of the business longer term, and where you want to play and where you don't want to play? And two I guess, how does it make you think about investments in some of those emerging markets that are kind of going through a recession or recession-like behavior as we speak?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I would say if we're talking about environmental specifically, and we can talk about the other, but the environmental specifically, I think there is parts of that market that continue to be challenged. Right, so we talk about the industrial end markets. And so consequently, what we've talked about and what you've seen us do is to become more focused on where we're going to invest. So if I go back a number of years ago, we were investing across the broad range of technologies and capabilities with environmental. And we would argue that we probably had 12 different product lines across environmental and of course the service applications as well.","I think as we have gotten more concerned about the \u2013 and I would say most importantly the industrial side \u2013 when you look at things like \u2013 although we're not big in oil and gas, obviously petrochemical and fine chemical \u2013 fine chemicals is an area for us, and some of the offshoots of those, that we want to get more focus in areas both from a technology perspective and an application. So obviously our move with partnering with Waters, where we just said, it doesn't make sense for us to continue to invest in liquid chromatography. We're not strong there. And so that's how I sort of think about it. So I think on the environmental side, what you will see us is more focused, invest in areas where we think we have strong market shares or strong technology capabilities. And in the other areas, we'll either partner or sort of deemphasize.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Perfect. Thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Good afternoon everyone. This is actually Alex Nowak filling in for Bill today. So we have seen some slowing US birth rates in our recent checks. And I was just wondering, can you offset the slowing growth with either menu expansion within the space or from an increase in the number of tests (49:50) the Affordable Care Act?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I would say our data doesn't necessarily support a declining birth rate. Our data would suggest that birth rates are sort of stable, maybe increasing slightly. But the answer to your question is that, yeah, we're always looking to continue to expand the menu. And of course we've got broader offerings that we can provide, whether it's in the software side or continue to build out additional capabilities that we can offer the lab. So I think there is always an opportunity, or we believe there is always an opportunity to continue to grow the business almost irrespective of the birth rate. But having said that, our data would suggest that US birth rates are, like I said, flat to up slightly.","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay great. And then this one might be a little hard to tease out since China is ramping so rapidly. But two questions. First in China, did you see any slowdown in the birth rates because of the Year of the Goat. And then second, does it set you up for an easier comp to allow you to repeat the screening performance from this year or even accelerate it?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, the answer to this question is yes on both. We did see a reduction in birth rates because of the Year of the Goat and we do believe that will provide an opportunity to accelerate growth in 2016.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Zarak Khurshid of Wedbush. Your line is open.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi there everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. First on the macro tone in the Chinese business, we've seen some wobbles there from a number of other players. Can you just talk us through the hospitals and end markets there and why you may or not be as sensitive to a harder landing in the region?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So if you think about our diagnostic business in China, it's fundamentally \u2013 I'll call it four businesses. You have the newborn business, which I think continues to grow because you've got adoption rate. So more children are being screened and you've got menu expansion, almost irrespective of birth rates. And we talked about that on the prior question. So I think we can continue to grow there because as we've said on calls in the past, they're still doing only a handful of tests in China. And we're optimistic there for a couple of reasons. We're starting to get some traction around mass spec. And we've mentioned in the past that we got CFDA approval for our GSP which is our automated workstation there. So we think we can continue to drive good growth there and in fact we've seen \u2013 I think in third quarter was sort of mid teens. So we feel good about that.","Similarly, same dynamics I would say on the prenatal side. So I think we continued both the penetration and the ability to do more there. And similarly, we saw similar type growth on the prenatal side. And then the third area would be in blood screening. And as Andy mentioned, it's off of a low base. But we're going into we think a pretty significant tailwind as the government will start to enforce the mandate of that screening and of course we're one of five that have the capability to do that.","So last year, it would be on the infectious disease. That's probably the one area where potentially you'll see some slowing on if there was an overall sort of economic slowdown potentially. But again, we see a lot of opportunity to continue to penetrate and expand there. So, but I would say of the areas that we operate in, in the event there was a \u2013 use your words \u2013 hard landing, I would think that's the one that probably is most susceptible to some impact.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. And then a follow-up on one of the last philosophical M&A questions. Given your experiences with Signature Genomics in the past and also NTD Labs, what's your appetite to own a diagnostics lab service business? Thanks.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well of course, the two ones you mentioned weren't great, although I think NTD had done okay. I think the issue with Signature was not necessary the lab per se, it was the reimbursement side of things. So I don't know that we would have a particular issue with a service lab per se. I think we just got to make sure that the reimbursement is clear. And so, and of course, outside the US we continue to be quite excited about opportunities in places like India and China. So I think the service lab would be something we would look to invest in, if as long as we had clarity around the reimbursement.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hey guys. This is Steve Breman (54:52) on for Tycho. Thanks for taking the question.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Unknown Speaker","First wanted to ask on the softer spending just in Japan, which is obviously continuing to be felt throughout the sector. Can you just give us some more color on what you're seeing kind of on the ground floor and is there any hope for any type of recovery in 2016?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So yeah, I think there's hope for recovery in 2016. I would say we're not very optimistic with hope in 2015, because it just seems like the spending is just not being released. And so particularly on the research side is where we see it challenging. And so I would say at this point, we're not expecting any recovery or clearly in Q4. And like I said, we're in the process right now of thinking through 2016. But yeah, I think there's a possibility you could see some recovery in 2016. So we'll just have to wait and see, but I would say clearly not for the last quarter here.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. And then I apologize if I missed this, but do you have any updated thoughts on China's new Five Year Plan as the broad themes begin to be disseminated? Obviously still waiting on a lot of details, but seems like environmental initiatives are going to be a key part, so if you could just briefly talk about how that might benefit you.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's our sense. As you probably know, I don't think they're going to make it public until March, I believe, so we're waiting to see. Our sort of intelligence and the people on the ground tell us that some of the key areas that we're focused on will continue to be a high priority, so whether it's environmental, whether it's food safety, access to healthcare. So we feel pretty confident that will continue to be key priorities for the government, but probably until March or if they start to leak some of the information out, we really don't have any particular insight.","Operator","Thank you.

Rob?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. As we reach the midpoint of 2016, I'm pleased with PerkinElmer's performance here to date, having successfully driven growth, expanded margins and generated strong cash flow. Specifically, during the second quarter we increased adjusted earnings per share by 12% to $0.67 per share, expanded adjusted gross margins by 90 basis points, and adjusted operating margins by 50 basis points, and came in at the midpoint of our guidance with revenue of $573 million.","Our solid results reflect excellent operational execution from an outstanding team of employees around the world, as well as our focus on the most compelling growth investments and our continued commitment to outstanding service for our customers. Consequently, despite the ongoing mixed macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth this year and achieve our top-line growth targets.","In addition to our financial results, I was also pleased with the progress made on our strategic priorities during the second quarter. As a reminder, the majority of our efforts this year are focused on three areas. First, driving innovation collaboratively with our customers to better leverage combined technical and application knowledge to create truly differentiated solutions, resulting in tangible customer value. Second, investing where we believe, we have the most significant opportunity to increase, maintain, or capture leading share positions. And third, continuing to drive operational effectiveness to advance our competitiveness and improve profitability.","Turning first to innovating with our customers, a good example of this approach is a recent collaboration with the Genome Institute of Singapore, focused on advancing precision oncology. The institute aims to develop a high-throughput screening platform to predict therapeutic sensitivity in tumor models in real time, with the ultimate goal of translating precision oncology research results into the clinic. To do this, its researchers are utilizing a number of PerkinElmer products, including our automation and liquid handling solutions, as well as both our tissue and cellular imaging platforms.","In China, a major dairy company will now use our solutions to verify nutrients, test vitamin content, and detect heavy metals in their products. This is an excellent example of where we were successfully expanding our addressable market in the food quality and safety area by leveraging the collective strength of our inorganic capabilities with Perten and Delta's expertise into new applications and products.","In the fast-growing area of reproductive health, we are working with a number of states in the U.S. to facilitate the screening of lysosomal storage diseases, or LSDs, enabling early detection of these rare inherited metabolic disorders in compliance with the HRSA-recommended newborn screening panel.","We also recently introduced several new products to strengthen our core offerings. These include the Avio 200 ICP spectrometer, which is the smallest analyzer of its kind on the market. The Avio 200 helps the lab professionals perform complex multi-elemental inorganic analysis for applications in food quality, soil and water testing.","Additionally, in our research business, we continue to launch new assays, with over 25 new biochemical and immunoassays supporting drug discovery applications brought to market this year alone. During Q2, we launched an NGS 3K assay, which runs on our LabChip Touch microfluidic platform. This assay delivers the highest sensitivity at the lowest DNA sample concentration, providing customers with improved sample quality control for their sequencing experiments.","We also expanded our NGS capabilities with the recent acquisition of BioScientific, a company based in Austin, Texas, that provides biotechnology solutions for food and feed safety testing and life science research. The acquisition builds upon our food franchise with the addition of immunoassay-based technologies that detect pathogens, toxins and other contaminants. Additionally, Bio's laboratory preparation offering for next generation sequencing broadens our NGS workflow solutions.","To drive innovation, we once again increased our R&D spending in the second quarter and are on track to increase R&D as a percentage of sales by 50 basis points for the full year. As we have communicated previously, we are concentrating a greater portion of our growth investments in four priority areas. These areas includes food quality and safety, pharma services and solutions, reproductive health, and emerging market diagnostics, and represents roughly 40% of PerkinElmer's total revenues. The benefits of this strategy is already paying off. In the second quarter organic revenue for all four of these areas grew by greater than 10%, and in each of these areas the rate of growth increased sequentially.","Andy will cover this in more detail, but the strong growth we experienced in these businesses helped offset headwinds in the industrial (7:45) markets as well as declining demand in medical imaging. Going forward, one of the keys to our ability to accelerate top-line growth rates will be further expanding these priority areas as a percentage of total company revenue.","Turning to our progress on operational execution, we have experienced excellent gross margin expansion during the first two quarters of this year. Our multifaceted approach to achieving cost excellence, enhancing quality, and providing customers with a superior experience continues to pay off with incremental efficiencies and productivity improvements.","First, we made good progress in the second quarter with a new team implementing Lean throughout our manufacturing sites. Second, we just launched design for excellence and product lifestyle engineering initiatives to both enhance our new product development approach, as well as deploy new standards for product reliability. These initiatives involve R&D and manufacturing working together, and will enable us to deliver greater customer value and competitiveness through designing and manufacturing our products more cost effectively.","As we move into the second half of the year, we anticipate an economic environment that will provide both opportunities and challenges. On the positive side, we continue to see accelerating growth for our diagnostic business as a number of our initiatives are expanding both our share and addressable market. In addition, our OneSource business continues to benefit from the growth in pharma spending and increased outsourcing. And our food analysis business is benefiting from increased synergies across our portfolio as well as the overall growth of the market.","However, creating headwinds to these trends are continuing concerns about the industrial end markets, as GDP and PMI numbers remain concerning, as well as medical imaging continues to face declining market demand. As a result, we are maintaining our second half organic revenue forecast, and our adjusted EPS guidance remains unchanged as well.","I would now like to turn the call over to Andy to discuss our Q2 financial results and forecast in more detail. Andy?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon everyone. Consistent with previous quarters will provide some additional color on our end-markets, a financial summary of our second quarter results, as well as details around our third-quarter and full-year outlook.","Starting with the second quarter, we continue to be pleased with our operational execution. The success from key Lean and indirect spend initiatives have afforded us the opportunity to make meaningful growth investments across the portfolio and still deliver solid financial results to our shareholders. For the second quarter, adjusted revenues were $573 million, approximately the midpoint of our guidance range of $570 million to $575 million. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.67, up 12% from the comparable period a year ago, and above the high end of our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.66.","Overall, the quarter played out essentially as expected. Looking at our end markets, we saw accelerating diagnostic demand, healthy pharma and biotech sales, and strong growth in food. This strength however was partially offset by softer than expected industrial end-market demand and a weak performance in academic and government, primarily in the U.S. due in part to a difficult double-digit prior year comparison.","Looking at our geographic results for the second quarter, we experienced double-digit organic revenue growth in Asia, low single-digit growth in Europe and low single-digit declines in the Americas. We continue to be pleased with our results in emerging markets, where second-quarter organic revenue increased mid-teens compared to the same period a year ago, driven by a strong performance in China, which more than offset weak demand in Brazil. Overall, our emerging market demand continues to remain resilient.","As to China specifically, organic revenues grew double digits in the quarter, with broad-based strength from both our Human and Environmental Health segments. Within Environmental Health, our Haoyuan blood screening business had another solid revenue performance, with strength expected to continue into the second half of 2016. On the Environmental side, food and environmental testing solutions were the key contributors to Environmental Health's solid performance in China.","As to our operating results for the quarter, adjusted gross margins were 47.9%, up 90 basis points over the same period a year ago, driven by successful Lean initiatives, volume leverage and mix. We remain encouraged by the progress we're seeing from our Lean activities.","Adjusted SG&A was 24.3%, essentially flat over the same period a year ago as a percentage of adjusted revenue. We continue to believe that we can successfully leverage our G&A at a rate approximately half the pace of our revenue growth. Looking at Research and Development, second quarter spending was approximately $2 million higher than the same period last year, driven by ongoing investments in our four strategic initiatives: emerging market diagnostics, pharma and biotech services, food, and reproductive health \u2013 including R&D funding supporting Vanadis, an acquisition we announced in the first quarter.","Overall, we were encouraged by our operational performance in the second quarter as we also expanded adjusting operating margins by approximately 50 basis points, while still funding incremental R&D investments.","Looking below the operating line, second-quarter net interest and other expense was approximately $5 million and our second quarter adjusted tax rate was just over 18%. Our first-half 2016, adjusted tax rate was approximately 19.7% and remains in line with our expected full-year adjusted tax rate of approximately 19.5%.","Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of debt and nearly $250 million of cash, and we exited the quarter with a net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 1.8 times. In July, we announced the successful completion of a \u20ac500 million senior note offering. With a 10-year tenor and 1.875% coupon, we have efficiently extended our overall weighted-average debt maturities by approximately 3.8 years. While we do expect some modest dilution related to this offering, we anticipate covering the incremental interest cost through our ongoing operational initiatives.","We were also pleased with our strong cash flow generation in the second quarter. Total operating cash flow for the first half of 2016 was $128 million, as compared to $101 million in the same period last year. For the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our adjusted free cash flow commitment of $300 million. I'd also like to note that our board recently approved a new two-year $8 million share repurchase authorization that will replace the current repurchase authorization that was set to expire in October of 2016.","Turning to our segment results for the second quarter, Human Health organic revenue grew approximately 6%, with Environmental Health declining 1% as compared to the same period a year ago. From an end-market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the second quarter of 2016, with Diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue and Life Sciences Solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue.","Second-quarter 2016 organic revenue from our Diagnostics business was driven by double-digit growth in our core diagnostics franchises, with China and India both up over 25%. As mentioned, we continued to make significant progress in our Haoyuan business, with strengthening reagent demand now supporting recent instrument placements highlighted in previous quarters. In addition, we successfully captured a number of key neonatal wins in Pakistan, Jordan and Poland, which also contributed to this performance.","Within medical imaging, we see increasing demand for a number of new CMOS applications as diversification efforts within the portfolio gain traction. However, the business overall declined high single digits in the quarter due to continued weak hospital CapEx demand.","As expected, organic revenue in our Life Sciences Solutions business grew low single digits in the quarter, driven by strength in pharma and biotech and further bolstered by broad-based demand in our OneSource and informatics franchises. As mentioned, academic and government spending in the U.S. was soft in the quarter, due in part to a very strong double-digit comparison to the second quarter of 2015.","Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represented approximately 38% of adjusted revenue, organic revenues declined 1% for the second quarter. Growth was once again led by our food testing offerings, which grew double digit in China, but was offset by softer than expected industrial demand. We continue to forecast improving but modest growth for the second half, bolstered by a number of new product launches that Rob mentioned earlier.","Looking at operating segment margins, the results were essentially in line with expectations. Environmental Health margins expanded 160 basis points as strong mix, prior year restructuring actions, and solid operational execution all contributed to this performance in the quarter. Human Health margins were essentially flat, largely due to planned growth investments and mix, partially offset by the positive impact of pricing initiatives implemented at the end of last year.","Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2016, we believe we are well position to deliver another solid financial performance with an expectation for continued stability in a majority of our end markets, partially offset by softer demand from industrial end markets.","As a reminder, we are cycling up against an extra week in the third quarter of 2015, which contributed a benefit of approximately 200 basis points to our revenue performance last year. Accordingly, for the third quarter of 2016, we are forecasting reported revenues to be in the range of $570 million to $575 million, which represents organic revenue growth of roughly 2% to 3%, which is consistent with our previous outlook. Third-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.67.","Looking at our outlook for the full year, the majority of our businesses are expected to deliver solid results, and while we expect that the soft industrial demand experienced in the second quarter will continue, we continue to expect our organic revenue growth to be approximately 4% for the year, and we are maintaining our outlook for adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85, with a midpoint of $2.80.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. And our first question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great, thank you. Can you provide an update on the China blood screening? Is there future placement opportunities there? And how is it ramping with the existing instruments that were replaced in mid-2015?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, the China blood screening business had another strong quarter in Q2, it actually more than doubled. And so we're starting to see the reagent flow-through of the instrument placements in the tender that we won in 2015.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","To add to that, we are probably two-thirds of the way through the tender process, but there are still tenders out there. We continue to capture our fair share of those. And we continue to believe that we will be able to see increasing reagent flow through, and that obviously is helpful for the margin.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, got it. And then, I know Brazil newborn screening is a small piece of the business, but are you seeing any impact from the birth rate slowdown from Zika?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. I would say, clearly, our Brazilian business has been hit fairly significantly there. I think it was down greater than 25%. I guess, if there's any good news, the Brazilian business is getting so small that it's becoming somewhat irrelevant, but yeah, there's been a severe impact on the newborn screening business there.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Afternoon, guys. Thanks.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Dan.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Rob, it looks like you might have been \u2013 hey, Andy \u2013 a little bit light relative to your 4% organic forecast for the quarter, maybe a half point or so by my math. So, without splitting hairs, would you say that that was due to Environmental Health? Or was it more of a split between Environmental Health and some of the declines you saw in medical imaging? Just trying to see where you have your model.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say, it was probably a combination \u2013 it was a combination of both of those. I would say Environmental was a little light. And we continue to see challenges on the industrial end-markets. I think in the beginning of the year, we highlighted that we're a little concerned about there, and I think we figured that could be down sort of mid single-digits. We're actually seeing a little bit greater headwind than that.","And then, medical imaging also, I think we handicap that as sort of down slightly, and we're seeing again probably something like high single-digit growth declines there. We did see some offsets though, China was clearly stronger than we thought, and the majority of the diagnostic business was stronger than we thought. But as you said, on balance it was a relatively minor impact there. Maybe Andy, just want to cover that for a second?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, yeah, we gave guidance at the end of the first quarter for the second quarter of $570 million to $575 million, and if you look at the midpoint of the range, which is where came in, really to get to 4% organic you kind of needed to be slightly north of the midpoint. And in addition, in the quarter we had a little bit of a tailwind from FX, maybe it was $1 million, but in order to round up to the 4% versus the 3%, we really needed to be at the high end of the range. But just to kind of be clear, we're talking about $2 million, a little less than $2 million, or about 0.3 percentage point, which really swung the difference between three and four.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Got it. So even less than a half a point there is what we're talking about, okay. And then maybe just as a follow up, Rob, I think last quarter you quantified new product revenues as $18 million or so. Would you care to comment just on how, A, this looked for this quarter for new products, and then maybe how that number tracks through 3Q and 4Q?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, similar number. I think actually for the second quarter it was around $17 million from an incremental perspective. I mentioned the fact that the Avio 200 came out really towards the latter part of the quarter, so we're excited about that. We're starting to see early traction. And then as we get into the second half of the year, some of the new products coming out of the research area just start to gain some traction. So one of the reasons I think we feel optimistic about the back half, and sort of a slight acceleration in the organic growth rate, is because of the new products and the expectation that they'll accelerate from an incremental revenue contribution perspective.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Mishan with KeyBanc, and your line is open.","Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure.","Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, around medical and imaging, I know you guys supply into the OEMs, but do you have a sense of kind of which regions are driving the weakness? I think the U.S. \u2013 on the U.S. capital spend and hospital capital spending side has been pretty stable and robust, but emerging markets, Europe have been fairly weak. Do you have a sense of what's really causing it for you?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say our weakness is largely more in Europe than it is in the U.S. And then again as we've tried to expand out the breadth of our medical imaging capabilities, I would say clearly on the CMOS and the industrial side, we continue to see good growth. The challenge has been really more in both oncology as well as radiology. So it's sort of limited in those areas, but outside there we continue to see pretty good growth.","Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then, just to clarify, I think you said, you though that Core Diagnostics was up double digits. When you say Core Diagnostics, is that just excluding the medical imaging? And if you're able to get medical imaging back to flat, you're running it at a double-digit rate there? I'm just trying to understand...?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, yes in fact. The difference between Core Diagnostics is, it excludes medical imaging, and that was double digit organically in the quarter.","Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Stephen C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for the time here. Just a few clarifications on my end. One, the new repurchase authorization, can you give us a sense for the pace at which you're thinking about executing on that? And then second, maybe also for Andy, could you give, us in dollars or in basis points, what the contribution was in the quarter for M&A? And then I have one for Rob.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I can answer probably the first two, and then I'll let you ask Rob's question. On M&A, it was basically immaterial. So for modeling purposes, we will not have anything to really report there. As far as the other question \u2013 I just blanked on it. What was your first question?","Stephen C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Share count.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Share count. We don't \u2013 we tend to be fairly opportunistic with our share repurchase. Our first preference continues to be around M&A, and we feel like we've got a pretty good pipeline. So as far as capital deployment, that is and will continue to be our preference. I think it's just really more it was a matter of timing, we had the Board together last week, so we elected to get it reapproved. But it is a two-year timeframe for those, and so we do re-up those. But there isn't any formalized program that is being contemplated at this point.","Stephen C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then, Rob, just to sort of dovetail with that, on the last call you made a comment about a medium-term plan for mid-teens earnings growth, and I believe there was a clarification as to whether it was excluding cap deployment, and now that we have a little bit more clarity on cap deployment with the buyback authorization, I wondered if you'd just care to talk us through how that \u2013 it might or might not impact your thinking about medium-term earnings growth? Thank you.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think what you're mentioning is, on the last call we talked about sort of the business model, and I talked about how we think through the cycle, we like to be a sort of mid single, call it 5% revenue growth or organic revenue growth, and if we were to achieve that, what kind of bottom line improvement would we see there? And we said probably mid teens. And then depending on what we did with our cash flow, whether we bought back shares or made incremental acquisitions, to what extent that would add to the EPS growth or accretion.","And I think we still feel good about that model. What you're seeing in the first half of the year is sort of 3%, 4% organic growth, we're generating 12% EPS growth. So I think we feel confident if we can get the organic growth up 100 basis points or so, that we could sort of make that 15% EPS growth sort of achievable.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonathan Groberg with UBS. Your line is open.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks (28:24). On the debt that you raised, Andy, is that primarily for the buyback, or also just kind of meant to be opportunistic for other things that might come up?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","When we initially went in to this, and we're looking at our capital structure, we really felt like we wanted to have more fixed-term debt, especially given the rates, and if you looked at the Euro rates of recent, they seemed very attractive. And so the purpose at this stage or the use of the funds at this stage is really to pay down the revolver, and if you read some of the filings we're also amending and extending the revolver, so we'll end up with about $1 billion of what I would consider fixed-term debt, the tenor of this is 10 years, so we have increased those terms by about 3.8 years in total for the two debt offerings we have out there, and that leaves us with about $1 billion on the revolver for whatever purposes we might use that for.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then, Rob, is there \u2013 it feels like, from everyone that's reported to date, hearing kind of mixed messages on industrial, and I recognize that the specific exposures of each companies are not always comparing apples-to-apples. But when you think about industrial, like expand that to include food and environmental and the like, can you just give a little bit more clarity on what you're seeing? I know we all see the PMI, but just kind of what you're seeing or feeling there in that broader market. Thank you.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I would say, first of all, just for just for clarification, when we talk about industrial, we're talking about a more limited subset. So we would consider food really separate, and we would consider environmental, which for us is largely air and water, would be separate as well. So our industrial is really around sort of petrochemical, chemical, very \u2013 little bit of semicon and a little bit of oil and gas, but that's sort of the majority of our industrial.","And, I think if you recall, in the beginning of the year, we were a little concerned not only about the macroeconomic trends, but also in 2015, our industrial grew mid single-digit, so we suspected we were going to have a difficult comp. And so I think we modeled in something with sort of mid single-digit declines, and as I mentioned previously, we're actually seeing something that's more like high single-digit\/low double-digit declines. And our indications, and the information we're looking at, would not suggest that's going to change for the foreseeable future. So one of the things we're assuming in the back half of the year is that, in fact, industrial headwinds continue as they have in the first half of the year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.","William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hey, guys. This is actually Bill on for Paul. How you doing?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good.","William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","I wonder if you could just talk a bit about the food safety business. What are you seeing in that end market? And have you seen any pickup in demand or conversation since the last FSMA law went online in May?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I think as we mentioned previously, food was very strong for us in Q2, it grew double-digit, sort of in mid-teen area. I would say that's a combination of probably three factors. One is, I think the overall market is strong and growing, and I think a lot of that is just continued awareness and media recognition of some of the issues around food. So clearly, the food companies are investing in that area.","I would say the second area is, we continue to see significant investments coming out of China. So if you look at the food in China specifically, that was very strong. And the third area I think is unique to PerkinElmer, and I think the combination of the offerings we had historically in Environmental, combined with Perten and combined with Delta, and I gave an example specifically with a dairy company we're working with in China, is allowing us to better penetrate and provide some novel solutions to the customers. And so I think it's a combination of all three of those that's driving this very strong growth we're experiencing.","William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Great. And then, maybe just one on the industrial side. With oil prices kind of stabilizing, what are you seeing in terms of that end market? Is that part of the headwind you're facing, or is it maybe other sub-segments of the industrial market?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say, as I mentioned previously, oil and gas is relatively small for us. It's a small subset of our industrial, so it doesn't really drive a lot. I think what you're \u2013 the impact on the oil price, and in fact we've seen a little bit of a decline here, I would say more recently, it's probably more just in general confidence and the impact it has on sort of the macro effect. I think there's a general view as oil comes down, it does have a dampening effect on the overall economy, at least from a business perspective. But as far as direct exposure for us, the oil and gas, it's small.","William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Rob, if I go back to the beginning of the year, you were one of the two companies talking about a potential recovery in Europe in the back half of the year. Can you maybe just share your latest thoughts on that? I mean, I know some of it's dependent on new products, but are you still expecting a pickup in the back half of the year?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say, when we look at the geographic split of our revenue growth, actually Europe was pretty good in the second quarter. I think Andy talked about sort of mid single-digit, and if you look at where the research was strong, diagnostics were strong, and the thing that sort of depressed that to a large extent was medical imaging. So we're seeing some pretty good growth already in Europe, and our expectation is we'll continue to see some good growth in the back half of the year. So I would say from our perspective, Europe has stabilized and actually picked up a little bit relative to what we saw in the latter part of the 2015 and in the first quarter.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then now that you've had Vanadis for a few months, any updated thoughts on how that's going, and are there milestones we can track ahead of maybe 2017 or 2018 launch?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I would say we continue to be enthusiastic about the progress we're seeing there. I think as I mentioned in the past, we think we've got a terrific team. They continue to make progress on the development of the offering there.","I would say the one sort of significant milestone is, what we wanted to do with the Vanadis technology was not only continue to develop that to a commercial product, but also to integrate it with some of the PerkinElmer offerings. So it uses imaging capability, and we've been able to integrate the Operetta; it obviously uses some sample preparation for the NGS side of things, and we're using chemagen. And so that's been a sort of a great win to sort of move a lot of their capabilities onto the PerkinElmer products. But we still feel on track, and probably late 2017 is when you'll start to see the product come out, with sort of KOLs and a beta, and probably be revenue in early 2018.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good afternoon.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A couple of housekeeping questions. Hello?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. So, a couple of housekeeping questions. So, first of all, what's your sort of expectations for FX, the remainder of the year? And sort of full-year impacts, top and bottom line?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","For next quarter it's probably $3 million or $4 million on the top line and de minimums on the bottom, and I think that's probably got to be \u2013 maybe \u2013 it's maybe going to be neutral on the top and the bottom in the fourth quarter. So I would say, right now, based on the rates today, it's not much of a change from what we've seen. Obviously there's volatility, what we would update that if that changed, but as of right now, I don't see a big swing.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And what was the $5.5 million gain on the \u2013 the gain you had on investments?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That was related to the sale of the NTD business earlier in the quarter.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay. Got it. Okay. And I guess, just sort of going on with Tycho's question. LS, you're looking for low LS, negative low single-digit growth in U.S. this year. I guess, sort of what \u2013 in this quarter. Can you talk about sort of like the pacing for the remainder of the year for the U.S., and sort of how you're looking at that market?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I mean, if you look at the declines in the U.S., it was largely the industrial side that we talked about, a little bit in the sort of research area. Now as we look at the first couple of weeks of July, or at least a month of July, we are starting to see a little improvement of bookings in those areas, so we're cautiously optimistic. But I would say as we think about the U.S. for the latter part of the year, we think it probably maybe stabilizes at flat, but we are not forecasting significant growth.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I want to start and ask just a little bit more color on OneSource, how the service revenue was in the quarter, and then are there any notable contracts are evaluating at this point just through the end of the year that we should be looking for?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, OneSource had another good quarter. I mean, even though it comped against a strong, sort of mid-teen growth last year, it continued to grow double digit, so we continue to see nice progress there as we've talked about in the past. We think to a large extent our differentiation revolves around not only our capabilities and proven track record, but also the analytical capabilities we have with our informatics offering.","With regard to contracts, I would say at any given time we have a number of contracts that are coming through, and the back half of the year is not any different. So rather than spike out any particular ones, I would say, it's a continual process. I think we've mentioned in the past that a number of these contracts, or I'd say the majority of the contracts are sort of three-year tenure. And so in any given quarter we probably have a couple that are coming to, and we continue to be optimistic about our ability to either maintain the ones we have or win the ones we don't.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then just a two-parter on margins. Nice growth in the Human Health business, I thought there might be a little bit more margin expansion. I know you talked about some of the business investment there. Could you maybe quantify the amount of the new R&D going through that business versus the Environmental Health? And was there any change to your guide on R&D for the full year? Thank you.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think that \u2013 this is Andy. The majority of our incremental R&D is going towards Human Health, and a big piece of that is with the Vanadis acquisition. That will continue. I think you're going to continue to see our R&D, year-over-year, certainly higher. This quarter we were up 2%. I think that type of level of 6% or just north of 6% will probably continue in the second half, at least that's what the current outlook is. And again, we're not focusing all of our R&D in Human Health, but a big portion of the incremental R&D spend is in Human Health.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And I think the way to think about for the full year, we're assuming that R&D as a percentage of sales goes up about 50 basis points.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI, and your line is open.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Hi, good afternoon, guys. I guess in the context of something we've talked about before, you have a few parts of the business that had fantastic results, you have a few parts of the business that are struggling; some have struggled for some time, like panels. I mean, as you think about sort of portfolio reconstruction and how you're feeling about your general mix of assets, and I guess you have not done much recently on the M&A side \u2013 do you feel like you're making enough progress?","Obviously you're doing a lot of internal investment to get the growth rate higher, but to sort of get this mix to kind of an optimal level. I mean, is there stuff where you'll look and you say, well, I'd maybe contemplate that not being part of the Perkin portfolio, but I haven't been able to find the right asset yet? I'm just trying to figure out how you're thinking about the whole portfolio construction.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think that's a fair observation. And I would say not only we haven't found the right asset yet, but in a lot of instances, we're looking at what is the appropriate time to sell the asset. So I wouldn't be surprised if two years from now there's parts of PerkinElmer that probably aren't continue to be the part of the portfolio. And one of the things we're looking at is we continue to focus on the higher priority areas. We're sort of challenging ourselves on, let's say, some of the core product offerings. And particularly, to the extent that we think in order to be more competitive, it requires either greater scale or significant inorganic investment to, say, either accelerate market diversification or product diversification.","And so, obviously we evaluate the potential return of those investments versus possible commitments to overdrive other areas, right? And so ultimately if we determine those investments, they'll make sense relative to other alternatives, there probably should be another owner. And to your point, I think we focused a lot of time over the last maybe 24 months in making sure that we're optimizing the profitability and the growth prospects as we own it; at some point, to take it in the next level, it probably requires a different owner who will be willing to invest more inorganically in the business.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","That's fair. Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi, good evening guys. Two questions for you. First, I was wondering if you can just provide any color on some of the recent smaller mass spec acquisitions you've made, and how those fit in with the business? And then secondly, if you could remind us what drove the strong academic and government spending in the U.S. a year ago that you're comping against this quarter?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I'll take the first one. So I mentioned one in particular, we made a, call it a relatively small acquisition here recently, a company called BioScientific. Revenue for this year will probably be, I don't know, $11 million, $12 million, something like that. But we are excited about it because it brings two capabilities, it has a portfolio of NGS Library Prep kits, they go on both Illumina and Ion Torrent, they're particularly good at nucleic acid isolation, and their expertise particularly in increasing enzymatic efficiency. So we like that capability.","They also bring some strong capabilities around the food area, and in a particularly in the area of detection of microbial and industrial contaminants. And we like that portfolio of assets as well. So small deal from a revenue perspective, but we're excited about the capabilities that they bring, and again, complementary with two of the higher growth areas that we've identified in the past.","And we'll continue to look for those types of things. As I've said in the past, my preference would be something a little bigger, but clearly those capabilities are things that fit nicely into the PerkinElmer portfolio, and we'll continue to look for those and hopefully we'll be able to accelerate their growth and drive higher profitability.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And you know, the answer to your second question, last year we saw a significant growth in our in vivo imaging business. There was quite a bit of funding that came out during the quarter a year ago, and that really was the key driver to what was essentially double-digit growth in the prior year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. First one was on the Medical Imaging business. You guys commented on some of the pressure you're seeing there, and I was hoping you could maybe dissect a little bit what end-markets might have driven those, to the extent that might have been narrow or broad-based? And then, second to that, what's baked into your guidance for the balance of this year in that business?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, the headwinds are really in two areas, it's in radiology and it's in oncology. And on the flip side of that, we continue to see strong growth in the, I'll call it the non-medical applications, as well as our CMOS business continued to do quite well. And that's largely in sort of surgery, and increasingly going in the dental. So, those markets continue to grow nicely. Unfortunately they're not large enough to more than offset the challenges we see in the oncology and radiology area.","And so to mention, I would say through the first half, we've seen sort of mid-to-high single-digit declines, and to a large extent that's what we're expecting in the back. And that is a change, because I think previously, clearly in the first quarter, we thought there it would be some moderation of the pressure, and that our expectation was that in the back half of the year that we'd get medical imaging flat, maybe growing low single digits.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you. And then, just to follow up on the services side of your portfolio, you called out some of the strength in OneSource and Informatics. And I'm curious if you could maybe update us on your go-to-market strategy for those two businesses? I'm wondering if you're in a position where you're cross-selling those to the same accounts, or perhaps selling them in a bundle. Just thinking about how you are monetizing those growth opportunities? And as part of that, the margin contribution as Informatics in particular grows, I imagine the gross margin's quite attractive. So I'm wondering if it's starting to move the needle on operating margins as well.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, last year, we announced the creation of LSS, which was really taking the product business on research, our Informatics business, and our OneSource business, and combining them under one front-end structure. As a part of that, we also established a global account team, and we've been building and investing in that team for the last, now it's probably been 18 months.","And if you look \u2013 I think we commented in 2015, we saw nice growth in the global accounts. If you look at the second quarter, the global accounts were up about 10%. And so it's a combination of going through our Informatics customers and introducing in the OneSource, and then vice-versa on the OneSource side, and then also to the extent possible trying to drive some product revenue as well. I would say at this point we're seeing much better cross-selling between Informatics and OneSource than we are in the product side, but we'll continue to drive that. And I think it's an opportunity down the road.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, good afternoon. Rob, more of a bigger picture question. Do you guys track, or do you have a statistic around sort of what you view as your current vitality index, and where is that today relative to maybe where it was three years ago or so? Because you're increasing the spend, but it seems like the core growth is still in the 4% range. How do you think about the returns that you're getting on that incremental investment?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so we do track it, so our vitality index is in sort of the low 20s. It's been relatively flat over the last couple years. And so what's happening is, while we are adding some new products clearly into the marketplace, some of the ones from the sort of 2010, 2011, 2012 vintage, in some cases we're \u2013 very strong growers for us are coming off. So it's actually requiring us to get a fair amount of incremental growth. I think we talked about in 2015, sort of $40 million of incremental. Now our expectation is as we get sort of into the 2017-2018 timeframe, we'd like to see that into mid and high 20s. But I would say it's taken a fair amount of work just to sort of offset what was a pretty strong class of new products in the sort of 2010, 2011, 2012 timeframe.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Then one for Andy, the Environmental Health margins in the period improved pretty nicely despite the modest organic decline. Were there any one-time benefits to that improvement? And then secondarily, any update you can share as far as the net interest expense expectation for the year?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","There really were no one-times. If anything, they had stronger operating margin expansion, but they had some higher comp expense. Their results were a bit better, so the compensation related to that was higher. So I don't think there were any unusual items. And I think we're going to continue to see good solid margin expansion in the second half, in EH.","As far as incremental interest expense, we said it's going to be the impact of, it's about a penny, and we said we were going to essentially cover that with our operating results. That would be just related to the incremental interest.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Brokmeier with Cantor Fritzgerald. Your line is open.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. India is probably the largest newborn screening market that you still have left relatively untapped. Would you provide us with an update on the status of your pilots and programs that you have established there, and the percentage of the market that you've now penetrated, and any competition that you've encountered?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, as you pointed out, India is a significant, probably 27 million births. So we talked about three pilots that we started about a year ago; two of those have moved into what I'll call active use. In addition, we have several local states that have started a newborn screen test, really looking at six disorders. We placed systems with two other states, but they haven't started their pilots yet.","If you look at our diagnostic revenue in India, it was up 51%, but having said that, it was off a very small base. So we're starting to see some good traction there, but I think, as I think mentioned in the past, it's going to take some time to get that to a sort of a sizeable number, but at least the trends and the indications continue to be very positive.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","And how much of the regions \u2013 of the other regions within India looking at those pilots and considering starting their own, or to go all out into routine use?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, our approach has been to sort of both talk at the federal level, because ultimately for this to be broadly adopted, it's got to be sort of approved and suggested by the Indian sort of Federal Health Ministry, as well as working selective states. So it's really working both of those, and we've got a fairly significant effort in driving that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & and Company. Your line is open.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys. So, I guess just a quick one to start. China and India both were strong in the quarter. Could you just give us what your expectations are for growth in the second half in terms of what you embedded into guidance?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I think in China, we went into the year saying that we thought it was going to be sort of low double, and given the strong growth we saw in the second quarter, we've taken that up a little bit. But we haven't sort of assumed that the 20% continues. So I would say maybe we've taken it from sort of low teens to sort of mid teens. India, again because it's such a low base, I would say India we're probably in the sort of 15% to 20% range.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And I guess sort of related, in the past, sometimes when we flip the calendar and get into the early days of the new \u2013 of a new China five-year plan, there is a pause in demand. Ultimately this has, at least historically, been followed by a pretty big ramp-up in demand in areas that are prioritized within the plan. You looked really well-positioned, given the focus on a number of things, including but not limited to, food and water testing, as well as increased funding for things or increased focus on things like neonatal testing.","I'm just wondering, in the early days are you hearing or seeing anything that suggests we should be contemplating this dynamic? And is that something you factored into guidance? Or at this point, are you thinking that things may actually get going in the new five-year plan a little more smoothly than maybe we've seen the last couple of times?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Our assumption is the latter. I mean, our assumption is that it's going to be more sort of advertised or smoothly built-in. And again, because we've seen nice growth here more recently, our expectation is that we're not going to see any kind of incremental benefit from the rollout of the new five-year plan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Emily Stent with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions. I just have one. So now that we're seeing local Zika cases in Florida, are you seeing any impact on birth trends in the U.S. or any other main geographies?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I mentioned earlier that clearly Brazil, we've seen our business there be reduced significantly, but we have not seen any indications at this point that it's impacting U.S. birthrates. Our data would suggest that births in the U.S. are still growing in the sort of 1%, 1.5% range. But in the case of Brazil, we're seeing a significant decline.","Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And there are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rob Friel, for any closing remarks.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. So, first of all, thanks for the questions, and I'd just like to conclude by reiterating that we feel great about our progress during the first half, as well as the long-term opportunity to accelerate growth over the next five years.","At the same time, we continue to be inspired by the terrific impact that we continue to make for our customers to improve lives and the world around us. So, thanks again for your interest in PerkinElmer, and have a great evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Tommy Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Tommy Thomas - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon and welcome to the PerkinElmer second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me in the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jamey Mock, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","If you have not received a copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com. Please note that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website until August 15, 2018.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future even if our estimates change, so you should not rely on any of today's forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date after today.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Rob?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report that PerkinElmer had an excellent second quarter, delivering revenue and adjusted earnings per share significantly above our forecast and making important progress against our key strategic growth priorities.","Turning to the specific financial results, second quarter total revenue was $704 million, representing growth of 29% on a reported basis and organic growth to 10% with each of our businesses growing organically by 10%. EUROIMMUN grew as expected, increasing double digits in the second quarter. However, due to the strong growth of the core businesses, EUROIMMUN had an immaterial impact on our overall organic growth rate in this quarter.","Adjusted EPS was $0.91, an increase of 36% over Q2 last year, with operating margins expanding 180 basis points versus the second quarter last year to 19.7%. While Jamey will discuss our financial results in more detail, we are obviously very pleased with both the breadth and level of organic growth, as well as with the significant operating margin expansion.","A very strong top line organic growth this quarter is attributable both to the fact that end markets continued to experience robust demand, as well as our successful execution of previously communicated strategic initiatives. Specifically, our focus on tailoring the portfolio to more attractive end markets where our capabilities are well differentiated and investing in innovative new products and services that are helping solve customers' most challenging problems are leading to accelerating growth in each of our key end markets.","Turning first to our Discovery & Analytical Solutions business, or DAS, we are experiencing strong customer uptake of both our new imaging and analytical instrumentation, as well as solutions spanning informatics and service in both the pharma and applied markets.","Scientists and researchers are involving PerkinElmer in critical projects to discover disease insights sooner, detect contaminants more effectively, and accelerate therapies into the clinic and drugs to market. In particular, customers are using our new preclinical in vivo imaging solutions to better understand disease progression and to help develop treatments for a wide range of cancers, infectious diseases, and other disorders.","On the analytical side, our growth was broad-based as every one of our analytical offering segments experienced high-single-digit growth or better. This has been driven by customers around the world increasingly leveraging the versatility of our instruments to test for contaminants in food and the environment as well as across industrial applications.","In our Informatics and OneSource service offerings, we continue to experience very strong growth as our expanded professional and technology services improve how our pharma and biotech customers collaborate, share, harness, and interpret data. In the Life Sciences space, the trend toward digitization of the lab is helping fuel the race from molecule to medicine.","For example, we recently introduced a new screening solution built on application programming interfaces and customizable workflows that gives R&D organizations the ability to conduct data analysis, review, and report, plus compare data from different assay types across multiple platforms, ultimately helping researchers better discover and develop new therapies.","On the Diagnostics side, researchers and clinicians around the globe are rapidly adopting new technologies to accelerate disease understanding, diagnosis, and treatment, as well as enable earlier detection of diseases to improve patient outcomes.","In this regard, our two major focus areas this year have been to identify key technology synergies with EUROIMMUN, while maintaining its historical growth rate. And in our core Diagnostic businesses, we are strengthening our respective franchises in reproductive health and genomics by expanding our detection capabilities, product and service offerings, and continuing to build out our presence in emerging markets.","With regard to EUROIMMUN, the business has grown mid-teens through the first half of the year, and we are ahead of our plans relative to driving product synergies as we continue to find exciting areas of collaboration between EUROIMMUN and our existing technologies.","We recently announced that we received FDA clearance for several new assays to use with the EUROPattern microscope. These tests using EUROIMMUN's proprietary BIOCHIP technology have the ability to provide multiple mosaics improving lab workflow. In addition, with the EUROPattern automated microscopes, which have the leading throughput in the market, clinicians will improve efficiencies and labs will be able to better standardize patient care. EUROIMMUN has also been working on advancing technical synergies in the fields of antibody and antigen development, while expanding its testing menu on to PerkinElmer instrumentation. During the quarter, we also progressed in closing the gaps in liquid handling in nucleic acid extraction for EUROIMMUN's molecular diagnostic solutions using PerkinElmer technologies.","In addition, Tulip and EUROIMMUN have been working together in the field of infectious diseases on developments to expand our menu of arboviruses solutions in emerging markets. We look forward to the continued development of these technical synergies and bring these solutions to market in the coming quarters.","In our core Diagnostic franchises of reproductive health and genomics, we experienced high-single-digit growth or better. We continue to build out our capabilities in our next-generation sequencing workflow solutions to aid processes from extraction to analysis, as well as ramp up our genetic testing services.","In addition, we benefited from the rising demand for diagnostic solutions in rapidly emerging, expanding markets. This was evidenced by growth from Haoyuan blood bank screening business in China along with strong infectious disease testing wins from Tulip products in India, as well as Tulip's expansion through additional geographic markets outside of India such as in Africa.","In our newborn screening area, we're also delighted to announce that we have recently received FDA approval of our mass spec based test for lysosomal storage disorders, or LSD. Our NeoLSD kit is unique to the market and is the only FDA and CE-IVD kit approved for testing of six LSDs.","In June, PerkinElmer closed the acquisition of RHS Limited. Based in Australia, the company provides innovative solutions in single-cell genomics. The acquisition strengthens PerkinElmer's position in molecular cytogenetics and next-generation sequencing, allowing us to offer complete sequencing-based workflow solutions for pre-implementation genetic testing of aneuploidies.","The acquisition is a good fit to both our reproductive health and applied genomics businesses, where tools in single cell and genetic testing are going to play an important role in Diagnostics. Also during June, we filed for CE-IVD Marking for our Vanadis non-invasive prenatal screening solution.","We pre-launched the Vanadis system at the recent International Society of Prenatal Diagnostics meeting in Belgium, where we presented clinical data which showed sensitivity at least as good as both the RACE and sequencing and with a lower no-call rate than existing NIP technologies on the market.","Furthermore, this system is totally integrated workflow that lab technicians will be able to operate after one week of training. The reaction from prospective customers who were briefed on the system was very positive, and we expect to receive CE-IVD approval very soon.","As we've talked about in the past, our goal is to ultimately enable all women globally to have access to an accurate, low-cost method of screening of trisomies. Regarding pricing, we believe the majority of customers adopting Vanadis will prefer the reagent rental model consistent with how most of our reproductive health customers operate today.","Consequently, pricing will be largely dependent on the number of tests the lab runs. However, we anticipate pricing to be very attractive relative to current alternatives on the market irrespective of value. As we ramp up our operations and service, the plan is to install the solution in 10 labs this year. We will then work with our current biochemical customers in Europe to seamlessly convert them to Vanadis as we begin to make the system available to other regions of the world.","So to summarize the first half of 2018, we are making excellent progress on accelerating the growth profile of the company and converting incremental revenue to increase profits while fueling meaningful investments back into the company.","As a result of the progress we are making, we are confident and once again increasing our guidance for the year, raising our full-year organic revenue growth rate to 6% for the core business, excluding EUROIMMUN, which if included would add another 100 basis points to our organic growth rate. We are also increasing our adjusted EPS to $3.65, which is $0.15 higher than our original guidance of $3.50 in January this year and now represents an increase of 26% over last year.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Jamey, who will cover our financial performance in more detail.","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm excited to be part of PerkinElmer and optimistic about the outlook for our company. I've had the pleasure of meeting some of you since joining May 1 and I look forward to meeting more of you in the coming weeks.","I want to start with the financial highlights for the second quarter of 2018. Next, I'll provide some additional color on our served end markets and detail and other financial metrics. I'll finish with a financial summary of our second half 2018 guidance.","Turning to the second quarter results. We were very pleased with the continuing strength in our business as organic revenue in the second quarter of 2018 grew approximately 10%.","Adjusted revenue in the second quarter grew 29% to $704 million with acquisitions adding approximately 16% and foreign exchange representing a tailwind of approximately 3%. By business segment, Diagnostics, representing approximately 40% of total sales, grew 10% organically in the second quarter, driven by solid fundamentals in our served end markets.","Discovery & Analytical Solutions, representing approximately 60% of total sales, also grew approximately 10% organically in the second quarter, highlighted by broad-based strength in both the Life Sciences and applied end markets. I will provide some additional color on both businesses in a moment.","We were very encouraged by healthy growth across all major geographies with double-digit organic revenue growth in Asia and in Europe and high-single-digit organic revenue growth in the Americas. This represents four consecutive quarters of organic revenue growth in all major geographies. In the emerging market regions, we continue to see double-digit organic revenue growth driven by China and India.","Moving to the details of our operational performance, second quarter adjusted operating income increased 41%, and adjusted operating margins were 19.7%, up 180 basis points over the comparable prior period including a 30-basis-point benefit from EUROIMMUN.","Foreign exchange was a headwind of 50 basis points during the quarter. To net of acquisitions and foreign exchange, our underlying operational performance was strong in the quarter at 200 basis points of expansion driven by strong volume leverage and productivity. We are encouraged by the efforts of our product line and sourcing teams, driving savings in each of our commodity categories. We continue to expect strong adjusted operating margin improvements over the second half of 2018 to meet our guided range of 70 basis points to 90 basis points of expansion.","As a reminder, effective January 1, 2018, we adopted a new pension accounting standards and have restated 2017 effectively lowering adjusted operating income. The impact versus our prior guidance is an increase in operating costs of approximately 2 million per quarter with an offsetting increase in other income. As a result, there is no net impact to adjusted EPS.","Finally, adjusted earnings per share of $0.91 exceeded our guidance by $0.05, driven by a $0.06 beat from stronger organic growth, partially offset by $0.01 from unfavorable foreign exchange.","Looking further into the key drivers within our segments for the second quarter, let's start with our Discovery & Analytical Solutions business. Our second quarter results were driven by strong double-digit organic revenue growth in Life Sciences coupled with high-single-digit organic revenue growth in the applied market verticals.","As a reminder, our Life Sciences business serves the pharma biotech and academic government end markets, and our applied markets business sells into food, environmental, and industrial verticals.","Life Sciences' strength was driven by a very strong performance in the pharma biotech end market driven by strength in the Drug Discovery segment. Drug Discovery product sales in high content screening and new imaging products were key contributors as was continued strength in our OneSource and informatics businesses. Applied market growth was solid led by the industrial, environmental, and Asian food end markets driven by strong instrument sales.","Switching to Diagnostics, revenue grew 10% organically driven by high-single-digit organic revenue growth in reproductive health and strong double-digit organic revenue growth in both genomics and immunodiagnostics. Geographically, Asian organic revenue growth was up low teens; Europe increased double digits; and America saw a high-single-digit organic increase.","Looking at key new additions in our Diagnostics business. Tulip reported high teens organic growth driven by rapid testing, and the team continues to make great strides in penetrating the Indian diagnostics market. We continue to build on our momentum in our PerkinElmer genomics testing business and feel good about achieving approximately $15 million in revenues by 2020.","Broad-based growth across all disease states helped EUROIMMUN grow mid-teens organically through the first half of 2018, and they remain on target to achieve the organic revenue growth planned for the full year. Geographically, China and Germany were once again strong with momentum building in the U.S. We remain on track to double EUROIMMUN U.S. sales this year.","As Rob mentioned, we are pleased to report that we have submitted Vanadis for CE Mark approval, and we look forward to working with our European customers to bring this new technology to the market.","We believe that our strong global customer relationships and significant cost position provides a unique opportunity to help penetrate the NIPT market and deliver increased product offerings to a larger patient population.","Looking at below the line items, adjusted net interest and other expense for the second quarter was approximately $16 million, and our adjusted tax rate was approximately 17%. Looking ahead, we now see the full year adjusted tax rate at 16% driven by increased foreign profits in lower rate jurisdictions.","Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with approximately $2 billion of debt and $163 million of cash. We exited the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 3.2 times, and we remain on track to finish the year below 3 times.","Turning to our cash flow performance, our second quarter operating cash flow from continuing operations saw a sequential improvement. Higher inventory levels supporting production moves in Singapore and China to further increase our manufacturing localization, coupled with production builds supporting stronger demand, impacted the first half of 2018.","In addition, we have taken on a new distribution center strategy to better fulfill customer orders while also reducing logistics costs. We have plans in place to deliver on our full year free cash flow commitment. I would also note that our board recently approved a new two-year $250 million share repurchase authorization, replacing the recently expired authorization.","To wrap up the second quarter, we are very pleased with our performance, which has resulted in double-digit organic revenue growth and strong adjusted operating margin expansion.","Looking ahead to the second half of 2018, we continued to believe that we are well-positioned to drive solid organic revenue growth and provide strong financial results for our key stakeholders.","Driven by the strong first half performance, we are once again raising our full year 2018 core organic revenue growth guidance to 6%. This increase excludes EUROIMMUN, which will add another 100 basis points. Our organic revenue growth guidance now assumes 7% organic revenue growth in core Diagnostics with EUROIMMUN increasing the growth rate to 9% and 6% organic growth in debt. We now expect reported revenue for the year to be approximately $2.78 billion, which incorporates EUROIMMUN sales of approximately $370 million and foreign exchange tailwinds of approximately $30 million.","We are flowing through the net second quarter adjusted EPS fee and taking up our full year adjusted earnings per share to $3.65 despite an incremental $0.04 foreign exchange headwind. This represents approximately 26% adjusted EPS growth versus 2017. For the third quarter of 2018, we are forecasting reported revenues of $675 million, representing 22% reported revenue growth versus the comparable prior period.","Our guidance assumes 5% core organic growth, mid-teens growth from EUROIMMUN, and negligible impact from foreign currency on a year-over-year basis. In terms of adjusted earnings per share guidance, we are forecasting $0.92 for the third quarter, which represents 26% growth versus the comparable prior period.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time we would like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, and thanks for the time here this afternoon. Welcome, Jamey. Good to have you here on the call. And I'd put up a high-five for Corbett, really big quarter for DAS. And that's the first thing I'd like to talk about. I wonder if you could layer on any more perspective on the surge in the DAS franchise, good growth, big step-up, best quarter in, I think, three years.","Rob, you gave us a lot of detail on the product drivers, but I wonder if you could maybe rank order and again unpack it a little bit more between how much did end market help step up? How much of this is about commercial execution really hitting its stride more than a year after the sales force restructuring? How much of this is new products? Any more depth you could give us there would really help.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. Well, first of all, I think it's all of the above, as you pointed out. I would say, first of all, if we think about the beat in the quarter, it largely came on the instrument side. We clearly saw good strength in service and informatics and consumables, but I would say the delta really came on the instruments side, and it's a combination of things you talked about.","So, first of all, I think clearly we're seeing better execution. If you go back, we combined the businesses back in 2016. We, as you recall, experienced a little bit of disruption there. But I think we've now got the global account sort of customer initiative, coupled with the sales force, really focused on selling complete solutions, which is aided by the OneSource and the Informatics. So, I think that's going well.","I think on the innovation side, we continue to see strong uptake not only on the new products in 2018 but continued strong growth from the products that we introduced in 2017. Things like the Avio, the NexION, the QSight are all adding strong growth.","On the Life Science side, clearly in the imaging area, both our high content and in vivo imaging did quite well. And so what I sort of alluded to in the comments, it's fairly broad based. And then, even if you look across the geography, it was quite strong as well. So, I think it's clearly better execution. I think it's innovation. And I think, as we've heard in the last couple of weeks, I think the markets continue to be fairly robust.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Really appreciate that. The second thing that I wanted to touch on is Vanadis. It sounds like you have a series of target accounts. These are existing PerkinElmer customers. I wonder if you can give us a sense for where you think the common threads are. Are the regions that you think you have real success with here in the early days, the types of labs that you'd characterize as appropriate. And how should we think about the transition from CE Mark timing, hopefully, here in the near term to 2019, and Vanadis as a revenue driver? Thank again.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So I'd say, first of all, obviously, with the CE-IVD marking, our focus will largely be in Europe initially. And I think we've talked about this in the past, but we have probably 3.5 million pregnancies that we do today with biochemical screening. So, obviously, the focus will be in those areas that are doing the biochemical screening today and looking to convert, if not all, those tests on to Vanadis.","I would say that \u2013 with regard to targeted accounts as I sort of mentioned in my remarks, we've effectively already identified 10 labs that will be getting the systems throughout the remaining part of 2018. And then, as we sort of ramp up production, we'll look to expand that across Europe, initially, and then ultimately, probably not until 2020, we'll look to expand into other geographic regions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Rob, on EUROIMMUN, can you just comment on the U.S. market and if you could talk a little bit more about the puts and takes there? What's your view on the investment needs you expect you have in order to maximize that opportunity? I think, initially, you were thinking it was more requirements on the infrastructure side than the channel side. So, I guess, is that still the case? And then just, yeah, overall, how are you feeling about that portion of the market and then what you can do there in the next 12 months?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So, as I think, Jamey mentioned, EUROIMMUN did very well in the U.S. again. I think through the first half of the year, they've now exceeded what they did in 2017. But if you just step back from EUROIMMUN, it had another strong quarter across all the key geographic areas. Europe, China, U.S. were all up at least double digits. I think in U.S., specifically, I think we continue to add tests as we receive FDA approval. I think in the second quarter, we added about seven additional assays to the menu, and we're continuing to see expansion of our business, particularly with the larger reference labs.","So, I think it's partly adding some to the channel, but it's probably what's going to drive the more significant growth is getting the new products out there, getting the approval received from the FDA. I think right now, when you look at autoimmunity, we have, at least globally, the largest menu of tests and probably the best specificity, which is being driven by both our BIOCHIP technology and the capabilities of EUROIMMUN to produce excellent recombinant antibodies and antigens.","So therefore, they not only can produce very sensitive or very specific assays, but they also attract the KOLs to work with them. So I think that'll continue to be the approach to continue to build out the menu. And we continue to train the PerkinElmer sales force on the EUROIMMUN products and vice versa. So, I don't know that there's a huge investment required other than you just get to do products approved and out on the market.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Jamey, maybe on the margin outlook for the back half of the year, obviously some good improvements sequential here from 1Q. It does still require some acceleration in the back half to get to your 70 bps to 90 bps expansion targets. So can you just sort of comment on how you're thinking about the mix and the elements that give you the confidence in order to do that in the back half?","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, I think it's mostly around some extra volume in the fourth quarter, Dan. So in the third quarter it will be primarily mixing in EUROIMMUN for the margin expansion. And then in the fourth quarter it's both EUROIMMUN, as well as a solid amount of volume leverage as we expect some revenue uptick there.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Hey. Congrats, guys, on a great quarter.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Thank you.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","So maybe just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about China. You have a pretty varied business there now given obviously some of the recent moves that are in a number of different markets. Given all of the tariff noise, how are you thinking about sort of your manufacturing base, as well as sort of any potential maybe on the capital equipment side in the third quarter for any uncertainty? And just in general, kind of your view on that market as a whole?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So, first of all, China continues to perform well for us. It was up again double digits in the second quarter. And I think we feel we're continuing the track to a strong growth opportunity. But as you point out, there are some potential headwinds out there, so let me sort of take it one at a time.","So I'd say, first of all, on the tariff side, I mean, we think right now based on state of play, it's not a huge headwind for us. It's probably $1 million or less, and I think that's something we can either absorb in productivity or to the extent it requires a little bit of pricing. I think we can get that.","So we don't see tariffs today as a significant issue, I would say, and that's mostly coming from products produced in China and used in our supply chain. When you look at the other way, right now there's virtually no diagnostic product that come from the U.S. into China. Our Diagnostics products come from three sources: they're either made locally; they come from Finland; or they come from Germany. So we don't see much of a risk there.","On the DAS side, we think there is probably $75 million to $80 million of product that goes from U.S. into China. And we've looked at our ability to move that production. Some of it we can move relatively quickly, other probably would take us six to nine months, and we're starting to put some contingency plans in place that would allow us to do that.","We haven't sort of pulled any triggers right now, but we think we could do that in a relatively short period of time. Like I said in some cases relatively quickly, in some cases probably six to nine months.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","That's helpful. And maybe it sounded like, yeah, food and applied had a really good quarter. Perten, I think you've had some pretty great performance since you bought that asset. Maybe just give us a little color on sort of the dynamics there and maybe regionally what the bias is on applied and food?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So you said applied was a good quarter for us. It was up single digits. I would say if you look at food in Asia, that was strong. That was up high-single digits as well. I would say in North America and Europe it was more in the sort of low- to mid-single digits. I think that's somewhat timing. I think food for us, if you looked through the first half of the year is tracking sort of mid-single digits, but we think probably by the end it will get to the high single digits.","And industrial was also good for us. I think if you recall last quarter there was a little concern relative to I think we were down sort of 1% on the industrial side and sort of indicated it was timing. And I think when you look at some of these end markets that are sort of sub-10% for us as sort of a percentage of our revenue, we can have things move in and out of the quarter, couple of million bucks that can drive a couple of hundred basis points.","Industrial for us in the second quarter was up high-single digits. It was pretty broad-based from a geographic perspective. And so if you look at industrial now year-to-date, we're sort of tracking the mid-single.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Actually want to follow up on the China comment. There was no pull-forward dynamic this quarter. We've heard about that from a few peers. And I asked because the 3Q revenue guide also looks a little bit light relative to, I think, what we've been expecting at least.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","No, I don't think so, Tycho. I mean, I think when we look at the revenue in China. I mean, I don't see anything pull through. And I think relative to the back half, I just think it's prudent to maybe a little in the conservative side given some of the issues that are swirling out there. And I think particularly in the China side, I think we're looking to be somewhat prudent in our expectations around revenue.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then on the investment side, I want to go back to EUROIMMUN for a minute. You had talked previously, I think, in the conference about hiring 175 to 200 engineers. Can you comment on that, where you are in that process? And I guess if 90% of that business is reagents, what's really driving the need there?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. So I would say that the engineer hiring the 175 to 200 is probably on an annual basis. I mean, if you look at the growth that the company has experienced historically, that's generally what they're hiring in any given 12-month period. And I think the conversation was in the context of the Siemens discussions.","So I think, like I said, and if you look at the historical track record of the company and it's been growing sort of mid to high teens, that workforce is R&D based. It can be some salespeople, but I would say most of the engineers are going into the R&D area to sort of work with increased investment in R&D.","I mean, the model there has been, as they've grown the revenue, they've tried to keep their investment in R&D at least constant as a percentage of revenue. And so if you're growing at 15%, you're taking your R&D up 15%. And so that's what's really driving the hiring of the engineers.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Can you offer an update on how you're doing with the PerkinElmer genomics business? Is it just genetic testing portion specifically that you launched a year ago?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. So I would say we continue to see very good uptake on the genomics testing business. It grows or grew well in excess of 100%, but, of course, it's off of a low base. And so I would say consistent with the strategy we discussed previously, it's focused on, one, continuing to work with the states here in the U.S. to provide confirmatory testing, but also has been expanding our partnerships with pharma and biotech companies as we sort of help them in their quest to treat rare diseases. And we're also seeing nice opportunities to partner with other organizations to fundamentally to, I would say, faster turnarounds in our interpretive capabilities. So we're seeing a lot of opportunity. And in fact, we'll probably put in another five NovaSeqs in September to handle what we expect to be the significant volume uptake here.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then a follow up, another product question. Can you elaborate further on progress with the QSights? I know that that had some strategic implications for you as well beyond just being a new product launch.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So I would say I mentioned a little bit in the discussion around new products. I think on the DAS side, we're seeing good traction there largely in the food applications. And we hope to maybe over time just sort of expand that out into other areas.","I would say on the Diagnostics side we're in the process of getting that FDA approved with our set of reagents. And so while we've seen some increase there, it's going to really \u2013 until we get FDA approval on our reagents is when you'll see the more significant ramp-up on the Diagnostics side. But I would say overall we're very pleased with the performance and think it could be a nice platform to expand into other areas.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Your line is now open.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","Hey. Good afternoon. This is actually Chris on for Doug today. Thanks for taking my question. I just have a quick clarification question to start. What was Diagnostics organic revenue growth in Q2 excluding EUROIMMUN? I have a follow-up.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","10%.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","Okay. And then I believe you noted revenue synergies were ahead of expectations for EUROIMMUN. Can you just provide a bit more to detail on this commentary? Specifically what testing categories or geographies are generating upside? And lastly, just a longer-term question, given your early success with EUROIMMUN, should we think that mid-teens growth rate is now sustainable in 2019 and beyond?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So I would say relative to the revenue synergies and I would say the comment was not necessarily related to revenue dollars but really the projects that we're running that we think will have future revenue synergies. And the way I would sort of describe those is I'd probably put those into three categories.","The first one I would say around sort of new market or really probably new product opportunities. And so an example there would be we're in the process of putting some of their assays on our instrument. So an example would be we're combining a chemiluminescent bench-top instrument that PerkinElmer makes with some neurological assays from EUROIMMUN, and of course, that opens up a new market for us, so we're excited about that. And we've got a number of those instances where we're sort of combining the capabilities of both to open up new market opportunities.","The second area, I would say, where it's more sort of cost and capability. So EUROIMMUN, I think as we've talked about, is going to start producing antibodies across both DAS and DX, which in addition to expanding our product development opportunities and reducing our costs, we think, will improve quality. And so that's a sort of a second category.","And then the third area, I would say in the emerging market areas, and I sort of alluded to this in my prepared comments. We're developing a lateral flow infectious disease menu for emerging markets, and if you think about that Tulip has a lateral flow technology in the distribution channel and EUROIMMUN has the antigens.","So anyway my comment was really we're seeing those projects advance quicker than we thought. And I would also say we're seeing more opportunities to drive the synergies across the two capabilities of their respective companies.","Your second comment with regard to our confidence around continuing to expand EUROIMMUN into 2019 and 2020. I would say at this point I'm going to hold off on giving any discussion or guidance around 2019 or 2020 until we probably get through with 2018.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik. Thanks for taking the question. Real quick, just a follow-up on the EUROIMMUN question. In 1Q, you called out that there was an $82 million amount. Coming out at somewhere around $88 million to $90 million in 2Q, is that about right?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","That's about right, yeah.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And then just broader on the DAS segment, I mean given the 10% print, on the one hand, you have a little bit of an easier comp in the first half of 2017, in particular in 2Q, and then also on your comment that much of the strength, or at least the surprise for the upside came from instruments, which can be a little bit more bulky. Is there anything that's changed in your outlook for the second half of the year, both for either pharma or the life sciences, or the applied end markets in terms of demand? Just looking at where the numbers come out now and how it carries forward.","Are you feeling any more bullish? I know that you raised your DAS outlook 5% to 6%, but a lot of that's already carried in the beat. So how is your \u2013 or how has your outlook changed for the second half?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","No, I would say, if you think about the first half, as I mentioned, it's been a fairly robust macroeconomic environment, and our assumption right now is it sort of continues into the back. So, I wouldn't say we're anticipating any acceleration, at the same time, I don't know that we're anticipating a deceleration. So, we're assuming market conditions continuing to back half similar to what we saw in the first.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Good afternoon.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Rob, I was impressed with the commentary around the Discovery segment within biopharma, that seemed to accelerate the last couple of quarters. Could you elaborate just what you think is driving some of the improvement there? Whether it's on the funding environment or some of the new products you talked about?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Well, as \u2013 and I've sort of mentioned a little bit before, but I would say it really goes across a number of things. First of all, I think we're executing better. We're getting the sort of global account structure. I think the sales force is getting better at selling the complete solutions. I think the combination of OneSource and Informatics is sort of working well relative to our customers, so I think there's a category around sort of better execution.","I think there's a category around new products and innovations. So, clearly, in the imaging area, both high content and in vivo, we saw a nice step-up there. And then in more of the applied markets, virtually across all of our technologies, we saw strong growth. And again, I think a lot of that can be attributed to fairly significant refresh of a number of the platforms we did in 2017.","And as you probably appreciate, a lot of these instruments sales do have sort of a time lag associated until you start to see the ramp-up. So, I think a lot of the benefits we saw initially in 2017 are starting to carry through into 2018, and that's combined with, I think, better execution of the sales force, and I think robust end markets are what's leading to a very strong growth, particularly on the product side and DAS.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And just as a follow-up, so it looked like the primary driver to beat was on revenue, margins were modestly better than what we were looking for. I guess I was just a little surprised given the magnitude of the top line beat more than drop down to EBIT. So just wondering if either you or Jamey could just maybe just walk through some of the factors, FX, and maybe mix that might have been a headwind in the quarter there?","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, yeah. So, Jack, we grew 180 basis points on the OM line and there was 50 basis points of foreign exchange in there, so just to go back to the walk. The core grew 200 basis points. There was 50 basis points of foreign exchange headwind and then 30 basis points from EUROIMMUN, so we think that's actually pretty strong. We also saw it on the gross margin line as well being pretty strong. And there EUROIMMUN grew about 160 basis points, the core grew about 140 basis points, and we had another 50 basis points of FX headwind, so we felt pretty positive.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah. So I appreciate the optimism with our ability to perform and convert, but we saw gross margins up like 250 basis points. So we felt pretty good about that on the flow-through. And we lost a little bit through the operating line fundamentally because operating expenses, particularly on the R&D side, were a little higher.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi. Good evening. I just have a couple of questions for you. First, Rob, I guess just thinking about the back half organic growth versus what you've done here in the first half again, you talked about we've experienced a pretty robust macro environment in the first half of the year and you're assuming that to continue. So, I guess if you could maybe explain it to me one more time on, going from 10% organic growth this quarter down to 5% guidance here for the third quarter and probably around similar for that in the fourth quarter is what I think is implied. Just wondering why such the large deceleration there. And then I have a follow-up as well.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, I would say it's fundamentally two. One is, we've got a little bit more difficult comp in the back. And then the other one is, I think it's just \u2013 given what \u2013 our swirling around with some potential headwinds, we think it's prudent that 5% \u2013 and by the way, even with those numbers, we'll do 6% on the core. So as we sort of think about the last three years, our organic growth will go from 2% to 4% to 6%. And then, of course, if you add EUROIMMUN on top of that, it gets us to 7%. So, I think we're pretty pleased with that. And what I will say is, we won't let that be a constraint on our possibility of beating that number.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. And then just confirming something you said in the past, with the timing on Vanadis, are you still expecting $10 million in revenue from that this year? And then one more question for Jamey on guidance. Thanks so much.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","No, I think probably $10 million is a little heavy. I think what we had said in the past is sort of $5 million to $10 million, but I think it's probably more closer to $5 million than it is to $10 million again because I think it's the fact of the timing of the tenders. But we'll see. And again our anticipation is it's going to take it a while to get these sort of calibrated and validated within the labs. And so you're not really going to see a lot of the reagent flow until the latter part of the year or early 2019.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Perfect. And then, Jamey, just one for you on guidance, just as I'm thinking about kind of an earnings bridge between the previous guidance and the new guidance, the incremental FX headwind, is that basically being offset by a lower tax rate and then you flow through the 2Q beat here, is that the right way to think about things?","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","That's exactly right, Steve. Yes, it was a $0.05 beat and then $0.04 from tax and $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange. You got it.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Perfect. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Great. Thanks. Rob, maybe just one of the genetic testing services clearly trending well in the early innings year, first, what's the right number for this year on revenue there? And then I know you reaffirmed $50 million number for 2020. When you look at the levers to drive upside to there, what are the key factors you're seeing?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So I would say I think the number for this year is probably 10-ish is what we said. We sort of said 8 to 10 and we're probably maybe tracking to the higher end of that hopefully. I think the levers are probably more on we're sort of putting in interpretive software so that we can process the samples a little bit faster from an interpretive standpoint. And I think our throughput on the sort of sequencing side is a very good. But I think that's probably right now the sort of probably biggest barrier to be enabled to get more sort of volume out there.","I also mentioned the fact that we're planning on putting in five more NovaSeqs in September. Obviously they take a little bit of the time to get them sort of up and running. But as I mentioned, we continue to see very good opportunities across all the areas, I mean, particularly even in the pharma area as I mentioned, I mean, I think what's differentiating us is probably two things, and again we've talked about this in the past. First of all, our ability to both provide analysis of genes and proteins is really sort of differentiating us for a lot of the pharma companies that want to say, okay, first of all sequence and indentified (47:30) genetic mutation, but at the same time also desire to quantifying the level of specific enzymes. So that's interesting.","And the other one is because we can collect the samples and drive blood spot cards, which again is differentiated. We're basically the only company that can run NGS from that. So that's driving a lot of demand in the pharma companies.","And I think the other thing we're seeing is clearly the trend is toward more whole genome sequencing as compared to panels and exomes. And this also plays into our strength as we're one of the few labs that can do clinical whole genome test. So I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity to continue to sort of invest and build this business.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. Thanks. And then just a quick one on Europe, double-digit growth there, very strong. Can you just talk through anything jump out in terms of markets doing better than others? It kind of jumps off the page with double-digit growth there.","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, a few of them, Patrick. So I think what jumps out to me at least is reproductive health was quite strong for us and the whole Diagnostics segment was I think up mid-teens here. So, reproductive health in particular was one of the big, stronger players.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","But I would say when you look across DAS, it was again, sort of, fairly broad-based. So whether it was life sciences, whether it was applied markets, they were both up double digits in Europe for us.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Good afternoon.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","A couple questions, Rob. So, first off, on China, any update to some of the newborn screening programs over there? It was suggested on an earnings call earlier this afternoon that there's some renewed interest in expanding screening in China, so just curious what the latest and greatest is?","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","So newborn did well for us well in China again, but it's in the face of declining birth rates. I would say depending on whether it's the eastern part or the western part of China we're seeing birth rate declines anywhere from sort of mid- to actually high-single digits. Now some of that as we've talked about in the past is sort of the zodiac sign but also clearly there's some economic sort of impacts that are sort of putting the decline in birthrate.","That's being offset, as you can imagine, by expanding menu, so we see good opportunity to do that and then increase penetration in various areas. So I think you'll see, as far as increased screening, our data right now would suggest that a large portion of the Chinese newborn gets screened.","So, again, so I don't know that there's a huge opportunity to sort of screen more babies. I think the opportunity is really on the menu side. And we're seeing that across a number of regions, not only in China. I mean, even if you look at the U.S. right now, it's interesting. You continue to see fairly significant expansion of the RUSP panel, which you know is the sort of recommended uniform screening panel that the HHS sort of continues to put out. Even within the U.S., that continues to expand and provide nice opportunity for us to expand the menu there.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, got it. Thanks for the color. And then secondly, on Vanadis, in terms of the limiting that to 10 systems or 10 labs, excuse me, here in 2018, the reason behind the limitation there, Rob, is that because of timing of tenders? Does that have anything to do with you wanting to continue to evaluate the system and make some adjustments before you open this up broader in Europe in 2019? Just trying to get some additional color behind that. Thanks.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Yeah, I think it's actually a sort of a little bit of both. But the other thing to keep in mind is these systems, again because we're just sort of starting with it, will take some time to get sort of installed and probably more importantly validated. And so we want to sort of get them into some key customers and make sure that they're running well. And at the same time, we're sort of ramping up the production of these systems. And I think the combination of those factors led us to believe to be somewhat conservative relative to the volume in the back half.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies Financial. Your line is now open.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a quick one for Jamey, it looks like in terms of working capital, AR and inventories came down pretty substantially quarter-over-quarter. Was there any onetime sort of benefit there maybe EUROIMMUN-related? And then despite the EPS bump to the year, you didn't change free cash flow expectations for you. If you could just speak to that.","James M. Mock - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Sure. Yeah, with regard to cash, I mean, if you look at the first half of this year, Brandon, versus the last couple of years we are always later in the first half. And this quarter and this half is no different in particular. I'd say the only changes that affected the second quarter, as well as the first quarter and therefore the half is what I mentioned in my prepared remarks around what we're doing around the supply chain. So two production moves, a new distribution center strategy, and we anticipate that somewhat normalizing in the second half and being able to get to our kind of original target.","So to answer your second question we didn't increase our free cash flow target, our guidance for the end of the year because of these moves and we need to see. Some of this might settle out this year, some of them might settle out in the beginning of next year, but we still feel very good that we'll generate a lot of cash both in the second half and going into 2019.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Got you. It's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Rob Friel for closing remarks.","Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)","Great. So, first of all, thanks for your questions and your continued interest in PerkinElmer. So we look forward to continuing to drive our mission of innovating for a healthier world while creating even greater value for our customers, shareholders, and employees. So thanks again, and I hope everyone has a great evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Prahlad?","Prahlad Singh","Thank you, Bryan, and good evening, everyone.","I'm pleased to report that PerkinElmer had a strong finish to 2019 with reported revenue in the fourth quarter increasing 6% year-over-year and adjusted earnings per share growing 14%, beating both the top and bottom line of our previous guidance. Our revenue in the fourth quarter was $806 million representing organic growth of 5%, and our adjusted earnings per share was $1.35.","As I reflect on 2019, the rapid transformation we made as an organization has put us in an excellent position to accelerate profitable growth and advance outcomes around the world in 2020 and beyond. I have no doubt that these positive changes will become increasingly apparent to external stakeholders over the coming quarters and years.","From a financial perspective, we delivered strong performance in 2019 across our businesses, despite evolving macro headwinds. We delivered organic growth of 5%, a 170 basis points of margin expansion, and 14% adjusted earnings per share growth. Jamey will discuss our financial results in greater detail.","As you are familiar, last summer, we aligned our go-to-market approach and combined our R&D teams, empowering our regional commercial leaders to make decisions closer to customers and encouraging our R&D team to think differently and leverage the breadth of our capabilities across the end markets we serve to develop full workflow solutions that address evolving customer needs.","We enter 2020 as a new, highly collaborative organization that has significant opportunity to leverage our differentiated capabilities to accelerate positive outcomes for the betterment of people and their environment. All-in-all, I'm extremely proud of all of our 13,000 employees who come to work every day with enthusiasm around our mission of innovating for a healthier world, our relentless focus on transformative innovation and operational excellence and a strong commitment to meeting the ever changing needs of our customers.","I'll just share a few examples from the fourth quarter where we\u2019ve seen our transformation efforts pay off.","Our targeted focus on solving critical issues impacting the future of science and healthcare enabled us to achieve new milestones by working with our customers and partners. Within the diagnostics business, the FDA approval of our GSP Neonatal Creatine Kinase-MM kit has resulted in first commercially available assay for screening newborns affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy. PerkinElmer\u2019s kit is specifically designed for screening newborns and is a cost effective way to screen for DMD with a two-tier testing approach, using the CK-MM assay and then DMD gene analysis.","Screening newborns not only prevents DMD patients and their families from an unnecessary diagnostic odyssey, but it also ensures timely treatment for a disease that could otherwise go undetected for years.","Via our proprietary DMD kit, PerkinElmer is participating in Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy\u2019s consented pilot program to screen newborns in New York state for Duchenne. The program aims to screen 100,000 babies, about half of all those born each year in New York over a two-year period.","Taking a step back for a moment, when we think about positive and accelerated outcomes, we're looking at the whole human care cycle, not just siloed points along the diagnostics and therapeutic spectrum. Our advancements in newborn screening, such as the DMD kit, for example, play into a larger strategy focused on the full continuum from family planning to maternal fetal to newborn health, childhood and family health. To this end, we are excited about some of the truly novel solutions that we have in our pipeline today, and hopefully, we'll be discussing more in the months and years ahead.","Turning to DAS, our new go-to-market strategy is fundamentally shifting how we are approaching new analytical market opportunities. As I mentioned at a recent conference, cannabis is an early win example of this new go-to-market approach that we hope to replicate going forward.","We have progressed from a relatively nascent business in early 2018 to $26 million in revenue from cannabis testing in 2019. Thanks to our efforts to really understand the voice of the customer and provide an end-to-end workflow solution, including sample prep, quality and safety testing, and analytics capabilities.","To continue to show our strong commitment to this rapidly expanding market and to broaden our distribution reach, this past December at MJBizCon, we announced that Emerald Scientific a leading cannabis and hemp lab technology player and testing standard leader will now offer a cannabis and hemp testing portfolio to their North American customers.","Our success in developing complete workflow solutions is also serving as a key differentiator across our life sciences portfolio. With the acquisition of Cisbio, for example, which is tracking ahead of our deal model, we now can provide end-to-end solutions in the discovery stage on target identification, lead generation and optimization in preclinical for both pharma and biotech research.","During the fourth quarter alone, we introduced several new Cisbio kits for phosphorylate and total protein and biomarker detection. And with our reagent R&D for all PerkinElmer technologies, now consolidated at our site in Codolet, France, we expect an uptick in drug discovery screening reagent innovation in the future.","A final example of our new strategy coming to life is within the fast-growing food market. There, we are already reverse integrating some PerkinElmer food assets into the Meizheng sales channel to take advantage of its commercial breadth, customer intimacy and local domain expertise. One example of this in action is with our recently introduced PaddyCheck PC 6800 technology from Perten, which automates analysis and increasing testing accuracy of paddy rice for key quality markers. The new solution also eliminates the need for traditional labor-intensive steps and delivers accurate results with 5 to 10 minutes. With rice serving as a key staple in people's diet, helping to ensure the quality of this mega grain is important for the increasing research and planting demands of the ever-growing global food chain. While Meizheng maintained was only consolidated for part of the fourth quarter, we were pleased with its double-digit growth and early synergies.","As we look ahead, critical to our success will be our ability to execute across the Company on three key priorities we have laid out for our organization this year: Ensuring a customer first mindset; innovating to address critical health and scientific challenges; and evolving our employee experience.","From the customer standpoint, providing exceptional experiences with PerkinElmer means that we are improving our tools, processes, and responsiveness to deliver solutions, when, where and how our customer's need them.","On the innovation front, this year, you will see us further our partnerships with customers and industry organizations to accelerate the visibility and development of new offerings across our end markets. And internally, we will continue to work on creating a culture that drives greater cross-company culture than ever before.","Before I hand it over to Jamey, I want to briefly provide an update on Vanadis. Earlier this month, our team hosted people from the investment community at a lab in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where we discussed Vanadis and the broader PerkinElmer genomics strategy. Specific to Vanadis, the key messages that we tried to drive home were Vanadis NIPT is a test for every woman due to its high precision and low no-call rate, the system has clear workflow advantages over NGS, customer feedback continues to remain positive, and the NIPT market is sizable and growing rapidly. We truly believe that Vanadis NIPT will play a pivotal role in helping to democratize non- invasive prenatal testing across the globe over the next few decades.","In terms of placements in 2019, we achieved 28 systems, and we continue to have a healthy funnel. For 2020, our plan is to end the year between 50 to 55 installations in total, which would imply another 22 to 27 systems this year, up from 10 placements in 2018 and 18 placements in 2019. All told, I'm confident that we are on the right path as an organization.","While there were a lot of internal changes in 2019, we are now well-positioned as we turn the page to the next chapter of the PerkinElmer story. I look forward to sharing our continued progress throughout the year.","I'll now hand it over to Jamey to discuss our Q4 and 2019 financial results in more detail, as well as our 2020 guidance.","Jamey Mock","Thanks a lot and good evening, everyone.","Before I start, I want to point everyone's attention to our fourth quarter earnings call presentation, which has been posted on the Investor section of our website under Financial Information. The goal of this document is to drive additional transparency and simplicity around the Company and our quarterly performance.","Today, I plan to begin by highlighting the fourth quarter. Then, I'll provide some additional color on our served end markets and financial metrics. Lastly, I'll finish by providing a look back on our 2019 performance and our financial outlook for 2020.","Jumping in, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results and full-year 2019 performance. Market conditions were in line with our expectations entering the fourth quarter. As they have all year, our growth accelerators continued to perform well, led by EUROIMMUN, which grew at a double-digit clip on broad-based global demand, and cannabis, which more than doubled year-over-year. Our genomics testing business remains on track to complete the Branford to Pittsburgh consolidation by the end of the first quarter and Vanadis momentum continues to build. As Prahlad mentioned, the recent granting of the Vanadis NIPT PLA code by the American Medical Association was an important development in December that favorably positions Vanadis Diagnostics for 2020.","Our 2019 acquisitions of Cisbio, Meizheng, and Solus all performed well during the quarter and concluded the year well-positioned to be strong incremental contributors in the years ahead. From an operational standpoint, prior actions to reduce organizational complexity have been undoubtedly made us a nimbler organization. Our 50% organic incremental margin in 2019 is a direct product of the increased transparency and accountability across the organization.","Turning to the fourth quarter results. We achieved 5% organic revenue growth with broad-based momentum across our portfolio. Adjusted reported revenue grew 6% to $806 million and included a 1% foreign exchange headwind and a 2% net acquisition tailwind. By business, diagnostics representing 38% of total sales grew 5% organically, driven by our immunodiagnostics and reproductive health business lines. Discovering analytical solutions, representing 62% of total sales, also grew 5% organically due to continued strength in life sciences and a rebound in our core food business. I will provide some additional color on both businesses in a moment.","On a geographic basis, organic growth trends largely parallel what we experienced during the third quarter. Asia Pacific and Europe both grew mid single digits while the Americas grew low single digits.","Operationally, we are extremely pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter, and we continue to see significant potential to improve our profitability moving forward. Adjusted operating margins expanded 210 basis points in the fourth quarter to 23.9%, driven by productivity, mix, cost-out actions and some timing.","As Prahlad mentioned, adjusted earnings per share of $1.35 was an increase of 14% versus the fourth quarter of 2018 and $0.03 ahead of our guidance.","Looking further into the key drivers within our segments, let's start with our diagnostics business. As mentioned in my earlier remarks, organic revenue grew 5%, which was off a strong 14% organic growth comparison in 4Q \u201818. Immunodiagnostics grew low double digits. EUROIMMUN led the way with a mid-teens growth rate, which was broad-based from both a geographic and product basis.","Geographically, the U.S. and Western Europe both grew over 20% and China grew at a healthy mid-teens clip. Reproductive health grew low single digits organically, driven by expanded coverage in Asia Pacific. We highlighted expanded newborn screening in the Philippines on our last earnings call. Additionally, we also benefited from expanded screening programs in Japan and Vietnam in 2019.","Paralleling the third quarter, our applied genomics business remained soft, declining high single digits in the fourth quarter. Momentum in our NGS and nucleic acid extraction reagents was more than offset by softness in automated workstation and robotics product segments.","Turning to discovery and analytical solutions. Organic growth of 5% in the fourth quarter was driven by our life sciences and food franchises. By end market, we experienced high single digit organic revenue growth in pharma biotech, propelled by our discovery and informatics product lines.","Our informatics business continues to perform well, growing double digits in the fourth quarter. PerkinElmer\u2019s Signals solutions are increasingly gaining traction amongst the top pharma, biotech and contract research organizations, as Signals helps drive increased collaboration, improved efficiencies and accelerate time to discovery for R&D scientists.","The applied markets were up mid single digits in the quarter, driven by an improvement in our core food business, continued strength in cannabis solutions and a modest sequential improvement in Asia Pacific industrial and environmental safety demand. Overall, industrial and environmental grew approximately 1%. Food was up mid-teens with core food up mid single digits and cannabis up over 150% year-over-year.","Shifting to below-the-line items. Adjusted net interest and other expense for the fourth quarter was approximately $13 million and our adjusted tax rate was approximately 16%.","Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the year with approximately $2.1 billion of debt and $192 million of cash. Free cash flow in the quarter was $192 million and adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $193 million. As a reminder, the difference between the reported and the adjusted number is due to cash payments associated with prior acquisitions.","For the year, we achieved an adjusted free cash flow conversion of 70%, which was an improvement versus 2018. While this was short of our 80% estimate, we understand the fundamental levers of the shortfall, and we feel confident that we have the right action plans in place to improve the conversion rate over the coming years.","Finally, we exited the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.8 times.","Turning to the full-year results. We are very pleased by our performance, the progress we made aligning our organization, and the relentless focus of our entire organization displayed during times of internal change and external macro uncertainty.","For 2019, we posted 5% organic revenue growth and 14% adjusted earnings per share growth. Except for core food, end market\u2019s performance played out as we expected entering the year, and conditions were consistent throughout the year.","From an adjusted EPS standpoint, we beat the midpoint of our initial guide by $0.07 due to our strong margin performance and improved tax benefits, which more than offset a slight organic shortfall. As we transition to 2020, we remain excited by the prospects for growth, given the portfolio transformation over the past few years, including our recent acquisitions, the momentum of our growth accelerators, and our new organizational structure. Consequently, for 2020, we expect 5% to 6% organic growth, and reported revenue to be between $3.05 billion and $3.09 billion, including $12 million from foreign exchange headwinds and approximately $35 millions of contributions from acquisitions.","We're forecasting full-year adjusted EPS guidance for $4.50 to $4.60, up10% to 12% and including a $0.02 headwind from foreign exchange. We expect to expand our adjusted operating margin by 80 basis points.","Finally, we anticipate $54 million in adjusted interest and other expenses, a 16% tax rate and our share count to average 112 million for the year. Embedded in this full-year guidance is the impact from a 53rd fiscal week in 2020. As most of you know, PerkinElmer operates on a 364-day fiscal calendar. Therefore, similar to the year 2016, every fifth year includes a 53rd week. For 2020, we anticipate the impact of the 53rd week will be approximately $10 million to $15 million of revenue. However, given the extra week of expenses, the extra week will dilute our adjusted operating margin by 25 to 30 basis points and adjusted EPS by negative $0.03 to $0.05. For modeling purposes, the extra week falls into the first quarter.","We anticipate adjusted free cash flow conversion of 75% to 80% during the 2020 fiscal year, which would represent a 5% to 10% improvement year-over-year. We are acutely focused on improving our free cash flow conversion in a prudent way, while balancing growth and profitability. It's going to be a two to three-year process to get back to the 85% to 90% range.","Turning to the first quarter of 2020. We are forecasting reported revenue of $700 million, representing 6% organic revenue growth, including a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $8 million versus the comparable prior period.","In terms of adjusted earnings per share guidance for the first quarter, we are forecasting $0.70. We expect the impact from the extra week to dilute our first quarter operating margin rate by 90 to 110 basis points. Excluding the extra week, foreign exchange headwind and higher tax rate, earnings in the first quarter would be up 9% to 12%. Again, all of this is noted in the last page of our fourth quarter earnings presentation, which I mentioned earlier.","Before I hand it back to the operator, the growing coronavirus outbreak is a concern on multiple fronts. First, our thoughts and prayers go out to those impacted. Teams across PerkinElmer are actively working to develop solutions to control and hopefully help stop the spread of this infection. That said, we have not embedded any financial impact in our first quarter or full-year guidance. If the epidemic continues to grow, it could negatively impact our EUROIMMUN and SymBio franchises, given patients in China may avoid going to the hospital for immunology and infectious disease testing. There are currently a lot of unknowns. Therefore, we think it is prudent to highlight this risk going into the year.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time, we would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird. ","Catherine Schulte","Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. I just wanted to go back to that first quarter guide. If we back out the extra week, I think the first quarter comes in closer to 3.5% to 4%, despite having a fairly easy comp with the government shutdown we saw last year. So, could you just walk us through the pluses and minuses off of what you think a normalized growth rate should look like in that first quarter?","Jamey Mock","Yes. Thanks, Catherine. I'll take this one. So, I think, if you back out the extra week, it's more like 4% to 4.5% in the first quarter, which is down versus everything -- every quarter in the year 2019 we reported 5% organic growth. So, it's a similar comp throughout the year. I think, there's two things largely that are affecting us in the first quarter. First is genomic testing. If you remember 2019, we started off very high, particularly in the sequencing part of that business. And so that had a great first half and a little bit softer second half due to the consolidation. We expect that to continue into the first quarter, so that probably half a point of organic growth by itself, what we're planning on in the first quarter here.","And the second area is applied genomics. Similarly, when I mentioned on robotics and automated workstations that had a stronger first half, weaker second half, we're expecting that to continue into the first half here. And so, those two things really are the only difference between our 5% organic run rate that we saw throughout the year, including the fourth quarter and walking into the first quarter here.","Catherine Schulte","Okay. And on that applied genomics business, we've seen a number of data points suggesting that DTC microarray industry will continue to have some meaningful headwinds this year. I know you have some exposure there. So, how do you think about that business returning to better growth?","Prahlad Singh","Yes. Catherine, this is Prahlad. So, I think our exposure to the DTC market is not much. Most of our relationships there are pharma and on the newborn screening side. The thing that we're just going through is the consolidation piece that we -- as we pointed out earlier, by the end of Q1 that should be resolved. So, we don't -- we, at this point, don't see that as our exposure to DTC is not too much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Arias with Stifel. Your line is open. ","Dan Arias","Maybe just on Vanadis since Prahlad touched on it and we were just out there. What kind of revenues are you thinking that the placements and utilization will yield for 2020? And then along those lines, can you just sort of talk to the visibility that you have when you think about the labs that will get you there? Is there a volume trajectory that you feel confident about at this point, or is it still kind of fluid in terms of what the ramp will look like?","Prahlad Singh","Yes. Dan, in fact, as a matter of fact, we have a very heavy funnel and we are actually in the -- currently in the process of shipping and installing several systems. As we said earlier and I have is, our focus right now continues to be that the earlier adopters have a flawless experience. If you just look at what I pointed out earlier, 50 to 55 installations, Dan. We placed 10 systems in 2018, 18 systems in 2019 and the implied range between 22 to 27 in 2020. So, from our perspective, we think installations are an important metric to track early on in the product\u2019s lifecycle. But, in the end, eventually as I've said, our goal is to democratize Vanadis NIPT. So, that's where we are focusing. And also with the NIPT PLA code, that gives us several advantages in the U.S., once that is issued.","So, from a priority perspective, we are looking at the number of installations, getting the clinical data out and working on the PLA code.","Dan Arias","Okay. So, it sounds like that's a TBD on the forecast for Vanadis?","Prahlad Singh","Yes. I think from a revenue perspective, our guidance will be to continue to monitor the number of installations.","Dan Arias","Okay. And then, just secondly, Jamey, if I just think about the top-line guide, and I take out the half point or so that you're getting from the extra week, that's 5% organic at the midpoint, which is in line with 2019, which is a year where you had some organizational issues, and then either one-off or maybe somewhat unlikely to repeat elements. And then, I think at the end of this year, you should also be getting a little bit of juice from Meizheng. So, I guess, how much of the outlook for 2020 on the organic side is conservatism to start the year versus maybe something that's underappreciated about either the DX ramp or the factors that are at play in DAS?","Jamey Mock","Yes, good question. So, I mean, maybe we just kind of talked through the end markets here, Dan. So, I would say where we have a little bit of incremental caution is around life sciences and immunodiagnostics. So, it\u2019s immunodiagnostics. Obviously, EUROIMMUN leads the way there. They have been mid-teens for quite some time. But, I think we're pretty consistent in saying that we're going to model them at 12% organic growth. So, I think we expect a little bit of downtick there.","Life sciences, I don't think we've seen anything, but funding levels have remained very strong. And so, we're hopeful that it continues, but I'd say there's probably more downside than there is the upside. So, I\u2019d say, that's where we're cautionary. Conversely, if you look at food and applied genomics, food is what we talked about in terms of some kind of rebound in the core and we had at least one data point here in the fourth quarter, should provide some upside. Offsetting that, I don't anticipate cannabis being as large and incremental contributor this year. So, those kind of offset a little bit there. And then applied genomics, once we get through the first half, we'll see how it's going, but hopefully that has a little bit of easier competition this year -- comp as well in the second half here. So, overall, to answer your question, probably a little bit cautious in life sciences, immunodiagnostics, maybe a little bit upside in food and applied genomics, the others pretty steady.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derik DeBruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Derik DeBruin","So, a couple of questions. I think, the first one, did -- I think some companies, but maybe you don't have as much exposure here, but I think some companies were flagging that they didn't expect a significant budget flush during the fourth quarter from some of the customers as in prior years. So, I'm just wondering what you saw in terms of incremental spending and just sort of what was sort of like the year-end budget activity.","Jamey Mock","Yes. It's always difficult to tell, Derik, but I don't think we saw much. In terms of life sciences, actually it was a little soft in the Americas in the fourth quarter. Applied markets hung in there in the fourth quarter. So, maybe there's a little bit off there. But I\u2019d say, it's difficult to tell and overall nothing out of the ordinary here.","Derik DeBruin","Okay. And just on the China, I appreciate the comments on the coronavirus. We've been getting some questions today, just given that you do have an infectious disease testing business that you've got. I think, people are [ph] wondering, would you -- are you testing for it, are you going to see potentially any incremental headway to sales into your diagnostics products to potentially offset some of the headwinds you were referring to?","Prahlad Singh","Yes. And maybe I'll take that. So, Derik, we are in the process of developing a PCR and an antibody assay. PCR is generally a frontline assay during an outbreak, and we are making strides. But, we do have to take it through the CFDA, which is now the NMPA approval process. And they are working with us and with the several other entities to get a frontline testing assay out. Again, most of the focus right now is doing it more from a CSR perspective, just to make sure that we have an assay that we can use for testing. What's the commercial impact of that, I would say at this point is unknown.","Derik DeBruin","And Jamey, if I can squeeze one more in. So, if you adjust the extra week, about 105, 110 basis points of implied op margin expansion in 2020. I guess, is that a -- I mean, how sustainable is that sort of like 100 basis points number on a go-forward basis? I mean, is there incremental -- I mean, you're sort of at your 22ish percent operating margin targets you put out there a few years ago. Is there upside to that number?","Jamey Mock","Yes. I mean, like we've been saying, we see a lot of room for continued expansion and profitability here. And I don't think 22% was ever a stopping point. We see that ultimately over time getting up into the mid-20s. How much can be done in the year 2020? We think, 100 basis points ex the extra week is pretty healthy clip coming off 170 in 2019. To your point, I mean, we guided in 2019 120 to 150 and ended up beating that at 170. So, could there be upside to the 80 basis points that we're guiding? Sure. But, I think we're more focused on long term and putting programs in place to get this to the mid-20s.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Vijay Kumar","Jamey, if I could just touch on the margin question. Extra week incremental revenues, can you walk us, like what why margins would be down? I would have thought the extra revenues benefited margins?","Jamey Mock","Yes. You\u2019re talking for the quarter, Vijay, or for the year?","Vijay Kumar","Quarter and for the year; I\u2019m just curious why incremental revenues have lower margins? ","Jamey Mock","Yes. So, if you look at Vijay, the -- and we tried to lay this out in our earnings presentation, the exact numbers. So, we feel like the extra week will provide 10 to $15 million of additional revenue, which is not what we experienced, if you just take our total year and divide it by 52 weeks. But, we think that that's the right amount of extra revenue coming into the year. However, if you look at the expenses for an next week, that more than offset that amount of gross margin. So, if you take 10 to $15 million, you get 50% roughly thereabout gross margin, then you add an extra week of operating expenses and an extra week of interest expense, it's actually dilutive to the year. Like I said, we tried to lay that out, both for the quarter and for the year on that last page in the earnings presentation.","Vijay Kumar","Got you. And then, maybe just a follow-up on that theme, the extra math. One on Vanadis, is there -- are you guys in a position to compete for tenders in Europe? And related to that extra week, the $10 million to $15 million is sub 50 basis points on the topline. Shouldn't it be just -- if you did week or 53, something higher than what they implied on the extra week as?","Jamey Mock","Let me start with the extra week and then Prahlad is going to jump in on Vanadis here. So, we think most of our customers, and we actually saw this back in 2015, operate on a calendar year, so, January 1st to December 31st. And if you look at where the extra days in this year fall, they fall in the fringes. So, take this quarter, for example. December 31st and 31st for 2019 actually fall in this fiscal year 2020, but we think that the revenue from that is mostly going to be spent in the 2019 and therefore was recorded in our 2019 revenue. So, once you back out a couple of those days, you get down to, let's say 3 more days. And a lot of that is CapEx, some of that is scheduled professional services. So, not just a daily run rate. And so, therefore, you get down to some recurring revenues that are we believe in the 10% to 15% range, which ends up being 1.5% to 2%, which was very -- for the third quarter of 2015, we actually said that it was 2% impact to our organic growth. So, it\u2019s kind of a similar operating assumption here.","Prahlad Singh","Vijay, for the first part of your question, yes, we can and are starting to participate in tenders in Europe.","Vijay Kumar","That's helpful, Prahlad. And just to be clear, the guidance has no assumptions around any potential wins in Europe on Vanadis?","Prahlad Singh","Well, I think, what we are assuming basically is 22 to 27 installations. So, some of it is in Europe, some is in Asia and some is in the U.S. We are not sort of focusing on which particular tender, Vijay, we could win or which we wouldn't win.","Jamey Mock","But, there will be some CapEx revenue in our year guidance as well as some sample ramp as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for the time here. I was hoping first, you could unpack your thought process around reproductive in the 2020 guidance. Birthrates particularly in China were a headwind there in 2019. So, what do you expect for broader growth in that category? And are you thinking about the birthrate dynamic prospectively?","Jamey Mock","Yes. I think, overall, we think reproductive health ticks up a little bit. So, we've got Vanadis that should kick in some, genomics testing that gets reported in there that should kick in some. I don't -- we are not anticipating any good news on birthrates. We think we've continued to see significant issues, particularly in China. We expect that to continue. We have a lot of good APAC expansion that I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks around the Philippines and Japan and Vietnam. So, that has a little pressure. So, net-net, there is probably a little bit of upside to reproductive health year-over-year. But, we're definitely planning on birthrates impacting us, and we'll see where geographic expansion gets us.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay. And then, not just for 2020, but maybe even with a medium term bend. I wonder if you could speak for a minute about cannabis. You mentioned that the growth impact for cannabis in 2020 you expect to be somewhat smaller than it was in 2019. Can you put any numbers around that? And is that, market is just somewhat matured, or is there a competitive dynamic? Why would that be slower growth after a big 2019? Thanks.","Jamey Mock","Yes. I mean, cannabis this year performed extremely well. We're thrilled with the team, the solution that we bring. Pralhad mentioned that it was $26 million in revenue, which was off a $10 million base. That kind of incremental contributor is difficult to predict. And we are not banking on that in this guidance. We expect it to go up still at a double-digit rate, but to go up another $16 million just feels like a significant planning assumption that we're not. It could happen, but that's not what we're banking on right now. So, the market still seems great. We'll see how it states for a while. I think there's couple more that'll come on line in 2020. But, I don't think we're going to bank on that kind of incremental contributor this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. Sorry to go back to the 1Q guide. But, you mentioned backing out the extra week you guess would have grown 9% to 12%, $0.75 to $0.77. That's still below consensus. I would have thought with the recent reorganization efforts, you would have at least been able to guide to consensus. So, can you talk about if there are other offsets other than the extra week that are kind of weighing on EPS in the first quarter?","Jamey Mock","Yes. I mean, -- hey, Tycho. So, in general, there is probably a little bit of mix difference in the gross margin line versus what we kind of exited the last end of the year on as well as on the operating margin line. There's a little bit of comp timing year-over-year, as well as some investments we're making in our growth accelerators in terms of Vanadis and cannabis, et cetera to kind of set up the year. So, overall, we think we'd be up about 40 basis points in the quarter, excluding the extra week. And that continues the uptick throughout the year here.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then, a couple of quick clean-ups. It sounds like the Vanadis installed base went down, it was 19 last quarter and now you're saying 18. Was there something, did the customer return or why did it go down?","Prahlad Singh","Tycho, it's 28. So, till the end of the third quarter, we were 19, and that went to 28.","Jamey Mock","Maybe, Tycho, what we were saying was in 2018, we delivered 10 systems. In 2019, we added 18 systems to get to 28. Next year, we're guiding somewhere in the 22 to 27. So, we\u2019re taking a methodical approach to increase our placements every year and be prudent on how we roll out these systems.","Tycho Peterson","All right. And then, on EUROIMMUN, mid-teens in the fourth quarter, you made a comment that that's maybe not sustainable and we should be back to thinking 12% maybe 13%. What -- was there something in the fourth quarter that allowed us to overshoot to the upside?","Jamey Mock","No, no. I mean, look, we hope that it's mid-teens. I think, we've been consistent in saying that we're going to budget a year at 12% going forward. That's what we planned in initial deal model. Throughout the first two years of having EUROIMMUN in the PerkinElmer family, it's grown mid-teens both years, maybe it does again. So, we've always been consistent in saying, we'd like to plan this at about 12%, based upon terrific product introductions, geographic expansion, including the U.S. And we just think 12% is a good operating assumption.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then, just one last quick one on the genomics, the automation. It sounds like you're going to recapture half of it in the first quarter. Was that in line with your original expectation or were you expecting to recapture most of that in the fourth quarter?","Jamey Mock","No, not as much. Actually, Tycho, we're expecting that to persist into the first quarter. So, some of the pressure we saw in the second half of 2019, we're expecting to persist. We keep seeing things push to the right here from a demand perspective, and we're not banking on that that will change in the first half year. Naturally, when you get to the second half, you get a different comp. If it's better than that, we're happy. But right now, our operating assumption is that we're going to continue on with the growth rates we saw in the second half of 2019 into the first half of 2020.","Operator","And our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open.","Patrick Donnelly","Maybe just building on Tycho's question on EUROIMMUN. Can you just talk through how sensitive that business is to the China hospital volume? And then, maybe just give us some color on what kind of the volume per day looks like on the growth there?","Prahlad Singh","Yes. Patrick, I think it'll be difficult to give a volume per day. I think, as Jamey pointed out in his remarks, given the evolving situation right now, all we're doing is highlighting the coronavirus thing. You don't know what the impact of that will be. It all depends on how it plays out over the next few days or weeks. I think, the point that Jamey made to Tycho's earlier question is that EUROIMMUN has done better than what we have forecasted in the deal model, which has been 12% over the past couple of years. And we hope that it continues to do that way. From our forecasting perspective, we have modeled it at 12%.","Patrick Donnelly","Okay. And then, maybe Jamey, just on the cash flow, I appreciate the 75% to 80% conversion guidance. Can you just talk about some internal initiatives you guys are focused on there? I know you had some headwinds around receivables and inventory, kind of extended out some agreement terms. Can you talk about the trends you're expecting in 2020 there, the focus points?","Jamey Mock","Yes, sure. Thanks, Patrick. So, I mean, we've learned a lot about cash flow over the last year here. And we've made some progress, not where we wanted it to go to, but definitely some uptick. The 2020 operating assumption is that working capital turns are basically static, unlike the last couple of years, where we've actually been reducing our working capital turns, and it's been a headwind. So, there's internal processes around things like billing and invoice accuracy and timeliness and collection efforts, et cetera. But really, when you look at receivables, it's in three or four different business models. And we expect some of that to somewhat plateau in 2020. We've seen terms changing, particularly in China and some of the emerging markets that are much more developed now. Informatics, we've started to sell subscriptions on a three-year basis, a couple years ago. So, we should expect some more cash from that. Cannabis, we've been leaning into a little bit here. So, the fundamental -- embedded in this 75% to 80% is basically static from an efficiency standpoint, which will be great. Hopefully, there's upside. And certainly over the next couple years, we'll drive that.","The second thing I'd say is around capital expenditures. So, capital expenditures downtick I think about 20% this year. We didn't repeat some of the investments in genomics, and we've been kind of monitoring EUROIMMUN. I would say over the next couple of years, there are two remaining areas that require capital expansion. That's EUROIMMUN in China; we're building out a facility there. And then, our Tulip business in India is growing extremely well. And we\u2019ve got to increase some of the facilities space there. But after that, I don't think we see a lot of capital expansion. So, we've kind of reduced it a little bit here. It'll be static for a little while. And then, hopefully, that downticks over time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open.","Doug Schenkel","I'm just going to ask three quick ones, and then get back into the queue because [ph] just I\u2019m on the train. And I don't want to have too much background noise. So first, following up on Patrick\u2019s question, has there been or is there any formal change to plan for incentive comp as it relates to free cash flow conversion? Second, what assumptions for growth by geography are embedded into revenue growth guidance for the year? And three, what are your capital deployment priorities for the year? Do you have a target in terms of capital you intend to deploy? And what\u2019s the mix you expect between share repurchases and M&A? Thank you.","Jamey Mock","Yes, sure. So, I didn't catch the second one, but I'll answer the other two and then ask you to repeat that one, Doug. So, incentive comp is now in all of our financial plans. Free cash -- or sorry, free cash flow is now in our incentive comp plans. So, that answers that question.","From a capital deployment perspective, we continue to remain acquisition first from a priority standpoint. And so, I think, if you look at the last couple of years, we did four acquisitions in \u201818, four acquisitions in \u201819. We always look at a healthy pipeline. I think, you can expect us to be active there. The dollar amount might fluctuate, but I think that's still our priority here from a capital deployment. We ended leverage a little bit down versus the end of last year and our liquidity is much stronger after refinancing. And then, in terms where, it's always been pretty consistent. I think, we're primarily focused on diagnostics and life sciences. And I think that's it.","And you cut out on the second question there, Doug. What was the second question?","Doug Schenkel","Yes. Sorry about that, Jamey. What are your assumptions for growth by geography, in terms of what you embedded into revenue growth guidance for the year?","Jamey Mock","Yes. Good question. So, basically, we're pretty much mid-single-digit across the board. If you look at Americas and APAC, that's been mid-single-digits all 2019. Europe was low-single-digits. We expect the Vanadis kind of revenue to clip that over into maybe the mid-single-digits reign, I call it a weaker mid-single-digits. So, pretty consistent across the board and pretty consistent with what we saw in 2019.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan","I wanted to start, maybe move back to DAS. I was curious what you're seeing from your industrial customers, what that grew in the fourth quarter. And just given the current state of the macro, what the 2020 guidance assumes there in terms of progression?","Prahlad Singh","So, I think, talk about 4Q to start with, Jamey.","Jamey Mock","Yes. 4Q was flat, consistent with where it's been most of the year, Jack.","Jack Meehan ","And then, for 2020?","Jamey Mock","We expect no change. Industrial environmental has been remarkably consistent for us, pretty flat throughout the entire year. And I think that's our operating assumption going into 2020.","Jack Meehan","And then, back on the diagnostics business, I wanted to follow up on the genetic testing lab, just marking the market. What was the final contribution for 2019? What does the guidance assume for 2020 contribution? And given the pace of the transition, is there any additional timing dynamic there, assuming for the first quarter as well?","Jamey Mock","Yes. So, 2019 genomics testing did extremely well. Obviously, it was much stronger in the first half than the second half; it was probably a little under $20 million in total. In terms of 2020, I think we'd rather not give the specific guidance here, but you can expect that it's going to grow substantially. And, in terms of the cadence through the year, I mentioned in my earlier remarks that the first quarter will continue to be challenged, because the consolidation is not supposed to happen till the -- well, it\u2019s happening right now, and the real road block there is hiring. We feel good about it, but sometimes it can take two or three months to onboard people in that space. And so, we feel like the second quarter is when we'll start to ramp back up again. And so overall, we expect another healthy incremental growth driver from genomics testing in 2020.","Jack Meehan","Great. If I could squeeze in one more, what were the individual contributions from Meizheng and Cisbio? The acquired growth in DAS was a little bit higher than what we looking for. Was there anything outsized that contributed in the quarter?","Jamey Mock","No, not really, no. Cisbio and Meizheng both continued to do well. I think, we said Meizheng has been growing into the 20% plus range and it continues to perform well. We got I think 11 out of 13 weeks or something in the quarter from them. And Cisbio has been double digit all year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brandon Couillard","Hey, Prahlad. I was curious if you could just touch on the services business for a minute. I know you did some restructuring there in the third quarter. Just curious what your outlook is for the OneSource business, specifically enterprise services as look into 20?","Prahlad Singh","Yes, Brendan. I think, in terms of the services business, we did some restructuring, as you\u2019ve seen. This was again with the implementation of ServiceMax. We continued to sort of see productivity coming out of there. I think, as we look forward, we are in a good position for 2020, and we expect to win some tenders. And I think, as you said, it will continue to be a high single digit growth business for us.","Brandon Couillard","I see. And one just for Jamey on the tax rate ticking up a little bit this year. Is there anything specific behind that or just added level of conservatism sort of embedded for the tax rate?","Jamey Mock","No. Yes. It\u2019s good question, Brandon. It had gotten down to about 14% in 2018. We guided 16% for the year, and came in at 15%. So, there is a little natural uptick in tax. I think, if you look at where we are growing, you look at EUROIMMUN, you at Informatics, Enterprise, a lot of those areas are higher tax jurisdictions. So, therefore, we do anticipate that to go up a little. And then, the offset to that which is difficult to forecast are some of the discrete items. We always have tax planning items, we had a lot in 2019, which basically brought us from the 16% down to 15%. But there is a little natural upward pressure there that makes us think that 16% is the right number. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. A couple of things. One, Prahlad, you teased us with some potential proof points coming in 2020 as a result of the combined efforts of the organization? Are these - whether they be new product introductions or service efforts or what have, are these things that would have an impact in 2020 or are these things that would build and have a further impact in 2021 and beyond?","Prahlad Singh","I think, we started seeing some of the benefits already, as I pointed out the whole cannabis workflow solutions that we have seen. There have been other examples of where we\u2019ve combined our sample prep business from the applied genomics sides with reagents from our life sciences business. So, we've started to seeing proof points of this. And I don't think it's going to be a discreet 2020 item. It will continue to be ongoing. And we expect to see more synergistic opportunities coming out of this.","Dan Leonard","Okay. And then, secondly, can you walk me through your strategies to go from -- you mentioned the PLA code. Can you walk through your strategy to go from that PLA code to getting that code included in medical coverage policies for NIPT?","Prahlad Singh","I think, just getting the code offers us the advantage that as a manufacturer we can negotiate reimbursement rates directly with peers and direct billing on a methodology that would be specific to Vanadis NIPT. And that hopefully offers better reimbursement rate for the laboratories. And also additionally, we can bill insurance without any risk of incorrect coding.","So, I think, that's the level I want to share just given the competitive situations and for commercial reasons. But at this point really what I would say is that we're really excited about EMA's acceptance of our PLA code that came in at the end of December. And right now, we are all hands on to ensure that the submissions get in time and we get the code in hand.","Dan Leonard","Okay. Thank you. And then just final clean-up for Jamey. Jamey, what was the China growth rate in Q4? Was it consistent with the mid-single-digits of APAC or was it higher or lower than that?","Jamey Mock","Consistent with APAC, Dan.","Dan Leonard","Thank you.","Jamey Mock","No problem.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a question from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.","Paul Knight","Thanks for the time. I know the product portfolio has clearly benefited from cannabis and food safety testing. Is there any goal you would have or point on the R&D that you want to spend this year? Is it increasing faster than revenue, and what are the some of the areas you would like to develop further?","Jamey Mock ","Yes, Paul. Overall, R&D if you look at it in 2019, we actually saw a little bit of efficiency, and that was related to some of the organizational restructuring. We want that to be ticking up a little bit over time. And so, what's embedded in this guidance is kind of a constant R&D as a percent of sales, if anything, maybe a little bit of uptick. You mentioned cannabis and food, that's one of the areas that we're increasing some of our budgets. And I think in general, we're putting a little bit more resources between, behind life sciences, diagnostics and food. And I think you can expect that R&D as a percent of revenue will be at least flat, if not up a little bit this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Brennan with UBS. Your line is open.","Dan Brennan","Great. Thanks for the questions. So, Jamey or Prahlad, just wondering for DAS, I don't know if you guys broke out exactly what's baked in for 2020 guidance overall. And then, maybe within that I know you touched on client environment. But can you break down a little bit food and biopharma, both were solid in this quarter. Kind of what\u2019s baked in going forward and what's -- kind of where is the outlook?","Jamey Mock","Yes. I think we're optimistic that that upticks here. And maybe it's a point or point a half. If you look at food, I mentioned it earlier. I mean, we expect some kind of rebound in core food. Fourth quarter was a good data point. If nothing else, there's some good comp here. Obviously, it's difficult to predict weather and climate change. And if that impacts us, then that'll be different than what we're planning on. But core food should rebound. I mentioned that cannabis will have a slight offset to that though that we're not expecting as much incremental contributors. But net-net, I think food ticks up a little bit.","Life sciences, I think ticked up a little bit. We talked about, Prahlad talked about some of our enterprise business going well and some extra tenders and an extra week here. I think, Cisbio and Informatics continues to be extremely strong, both were double digits this year. We're planning them more in the high single digit range. So, haven't seen anything. But that\u2019s just something we're going to plan them at double digit. So, net-net, that probably upticks a little bit. And then, industrial and environmental, we are planning flat. So, no change from 2019. So, if we make a little bit of improvement in life sciences and food, we probably uptick a little bit in DAS year-over-year.","Dan Brennan","Great. Thank you. And then, if you kind of pull the scope back a little bit. I know like a year or so ago, the conversation was maybe kind of high single digit growth type of portfolio, which obviously you guys still sound very constructive on the momentum that you have with all the business changes. But, when you think about the 2020 guide, you\u2019ve given a lot of color on the different businesses. But, how would you characterize the 5% balance, or is there a conservatism in? And you had a call out of swing factor on the upside or downside, what would that be? Thank you.","Prahlad Singh","Yes. Dan, I think, look, again, we continue to be very excited about the portfolio and the prospects that we have for accelerating profitable growth. We've got a lot of fans in the fire. I think, entering the year, we are trying to be balanced, given there are some uncertainties that we see. And again, example that Jamey talked about just coming in as with the coronavirus. You don't know how that plays out. But, essentially, the growth accelerators that we have are inherently the swing factors that will play a very important role as we look forward.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from Bill Quirk with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.","Bill Quirk","Great, thanks. Good evening, everybody. So a couple of questions for me. First off, Pralhad, really do appreciate all the Vanadis commentary. Is there any -- just I guess last question maybe on that, any particular geography or customer type, where you're seeing outsized interest and success in terms of placements? And then, secondly, just staying at diagnostics for a moment. With respect to the coronavirus assay development, the CDC has some emergency procedures in place to be able to rapidly disseminate test from a regulatory standpoint. Are you familiar or are you aware of a similar type of program in any of the other affected countries? Thanks.","Prahlad Singh","Yes. Just starting with your first question around Vanadis. I think, from an interest perspective, we are seeing interest in all the three regions. In APAC, ex-China, given that we don't have approval in China yet, we are going through the clinical in Europe, and, of course, with the recent launch that we did in the U.S., we continue to see a broad spread interest on it.","In regards to your second question, yes, similar to the CDC, the NMPA and CFDA in China also has accelerated emergency processes that they have in place and we're working with them to get a test out, hopefully in a few weeks.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a question from Derik DeBruin with Bank of America.","Derik DeBruin","Hey. Great. Thanks for taking a follow-up. Just one question. I just wanted to clarify, since I got a bunch of questions from investors. So, typically, the rule of thumb, when you look at extra days, is about a 0.5% organic revenue growth is a contribution for consumable revenue companies. So, the $10 million to $15 million seems a little bit white in terms of revenue contribution on the extra week. Did I hear you correctly in saying you thought some of that was pulled forward into the fourth quarter? I'm just trying to say to make sure that is, because it just seems like it's a lower number than I would have thought in your business mix?","Jamey Mock","Yes. Overall, it's 1.5% to 2%. So, the rule of thumb of 0.5% times 5, we\u2019re only really, I guess a half 0.5% to a 1% off here. So, I don't think it's too different than what we saw in 3Q '15 nor the rule of thumb overall. I did say that -- yes, I mean, if you look at December 30th and 31st, I think most customers operate on a calendar budget and that our sales force probably much like every other year, looks at the CapEx spending and says let's execute those before December 29th. And I don't think that's any different than what we've done in most years. So, I think it's pretty much noise around the fringes here.","Operator","Thank you. There are no other questions at the queue. I'd like to turn the call back to Prahlad Singh for any closing remarks.","Prahlad Singh","Thank you all for your questions. As we\u2019ve shared today, we have a number of exciting opportunities on the horizon, as we continue to drive towards our mission and accelerate outcomes for the betterment of people and the environment. I look forward to updating you on our continued progress in 2020. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."],"16859":["PerkinElmer (NYSE:PKI) Q4 2014 Earnings Call January 29, 2015  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Tommy Thomas - ","Robert F.

My name is Joyce, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Tommy Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Tommy Thomas","Thank you, Joyce. Good afternoon, and welcome to the PerkinElmer Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","If you have not received a copy of the earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com. Please note that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website until February 12, 2015.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon, and also those in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future, even if our estimates change. So you should not rely on any of today's forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any other date after today.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that we plan to use during this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available as an attachment to our earnings press release. To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during the call that are not reconciled to GAAP in that attachment, we will provide reconciliations promptly.","I am now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel. Rob?","Robert F. Friel","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we delivered very good performance in the fourth quarter, capping off a successful year in which we've made significant progress against our strategic priorities and delivered strong financial results.","Over the past year, we've expanded our organizational capabilities, introduced new innovative solutions for our customers, focused our investments in the most attractive end markets and exceeded our financial forecast despite challenging macroeconomic conditions.","Turning to our financial performance in the fourth quarter. We experienced a general strengthening of the business, as we saw good growth throughout all products and geographies, with organic revenue growing 5%. We expanded adjusted operating margins by 200 basis points to 21.5%, delivered strong operating cash flow of $97 million and increased adjusted earnings per share by 15% to $0.85, coming in at $0.06 above the high end of our guidance.","To mention a few commercial highlights from the fourth quarter, in the diagnostics markets, we were proud to receive market authorization from both the FDA and Health Canada to offer the first commercially available newborn screening test for SCID in the U.S. and Canada. Testing for SCID, which is an inherited metabolic disease that impacts an estimated 1 in 58,000 newborns each year, represents yet another important milestone as we expand our newborn screening menu.","Moreover, as we aggressively spur our footprint to meet demand for prenatal, neonatal and infectious disease screening, we announced the opening of PerkinElmer's state-of-the-art clinical testing lab in Suzhou, China. This new facility will offer a complete solution for hospitals and patients and supports the country's investments toward detection and prevention of birth defects and infectious disease.","Also during the fourth quarter, we made significant traction against our strategy to further penetrate the multibillion-dollar global food testing market through our acquisition of Perten Instruments Group, a leading supplier of analytical instruments for quality control of food, grain, flour and feed. We're excited about the opportunity to combine Perten's product portfolio, customer relations and technology with ours and make greater impact on the world's supply of safe food.","In the life sciences market, our new innovations are creating incremental market demand, including our Opera Phenix High Content Screening System, which has experienced an outstanding order rate since launching in the third quarter. Contributing to the Opera Phenix's success is its ability to work seamlessly with our High Content Profiler, a powerful new scientific analysis and visualization application powered by Spotfire. The High Content Profiler helps customers better interpret their high-dimensional big data and draw critical insights more quickly. Customers are finding that by pairing these 2 capabilities, they have a line of sight towards moving into the next phase of gene targeting for personalized medicine drug discovery.","Finally, in our efforts to adopt a more market- and customer-focused organizational approach, earlier this month, we announced the move of our OneSource service group from the Environmental Health business into our Human Health business. With the predominant OneSource customer base being in the pharma and biotech markets, this realignment will better equip us internally to serve our life science customers with complete solutions targeted toward their needs.","Reflecting on the full year, I'm very pleased with our financial performance, especially in light of the current macro environment. In 2014, we grew organic growth -- we grew organic revenue by 4%, expanded adjusted operating margins over 160 basis points, increased adjusted EPS by 18% to $2.47 and generated strong operating cash flow of $282 million.","With that said, 2014 marked the final year of the plan we set 5 years ago to generate significant adjusted operating margin improvement through both productivity and growth investments. Adjusting for the recent stronger dollar, we would have exceeded our goal of the 18% operating margins. More importantly, since establishing this goal in 2009, we have increased revenue at an 8% CAGR and EPS at an 18% CAGR.","Furthermore, throughout the last 5 years, we have elevated our leadership positions within the markets we serve. Today, 75% of our total revenue derives from products that hold 1 of the top 3 positions in their markets. All in all, our portfolio today is better focused on those areas where we can deliver exciting capabilities targeted towards meeting demand in the fast-growing markets and geographies.","In that regard, we are pleased to be recently named by Instrument Business Outlook as the Company of the Year for 2014, in which they highlighted our ability to commercialize innovation as a key strength. Building on our track record, I'm confident that we have the right roadmap, as we head into the next 5 years, to continue to expand operating margins and grow our top line.","Before I turn the call over to Andy to cover our fourth quarter financial results in more detail, I would like to briefly share some perspectives around the current growth environment.","From a geographic standpoint, the outlook in APAC remains stable, with China experiencing continued growth in diagnostics and some recovery in the research, environmental and industrial markets.","Europe continues to face a weakened economy and should pose similar challenges in 2015 as it did during the majority of last year. The U.S. economy, on the other hand, is improving, although the stronger dollar is creating new challenges, especially in emerging markets. We do anticipate a material headwind to growth in 2015 as a result of the unfavorable FX impact.","Looking at our end markets, pharma is stabilizing as customers move back into development mode and away from restructuring. We also expect to see strong biotech growth for Europe and the U.S. in 2015. In particular, we are poised to benefit from investments in the area of cancer immunotherapy as well as the rising trend of outsourcing instrument maintenance and scientific services. The academic and government sectors most likely will stay flat over prior year, driven by soft funding in the U.S. and austerity in Europe.","In the environmental and industrial markets, growth is expected to remain at similar levels as in the second half of 2014, dependent on impending global environmental regulations and macro GDP growth rates.","We are optimistic about the rapidly expanding food market, which has become one of the fastest-growing segments of the analytical instruments sector.","Finally, the global diagnostics markets that we participate in continue to be very good, driven by higher U.S. birth rates, prenatal and neonatal screening menu expansion and the long-term emerging market demand, especially in China.","From an innovation standpoint, we exceeded our goal of achieving $15 million to $17 million in new product revenues during the second half of 2014. Market response to our new offerings has been quite positive, and we anticipate that new innovations will help contribute to continued growth this year.","Notably, in the Environmental Health business, a robust pipeline of novel products will start to launch in the first half and gain scale in the back half of 2015. As we drive innovation forward, our focus will increasingly center on developing solutions that leverage capabilities from the full breadth of our portfolio, with the goal to enable critical insights and discoveries in Human and Environmental Health.","As we enter 2015, we are optimistic about our opportunities to accelerate growth and further drive competitive differentiation. We remain cautious, however, given the recent PMI data indicating a decelerating global economic growth, which is somewhat tied to China's lower near-term outlook, drop in oil prices and foreign currency headwinds.","While Andy will get into more detail, I want to give a high-level overview of our 2015 guidance.","Due to the significant impact of foreign exchange changes relative to the average rates last year, I will discuss our forecast on a constant currency basis, assuming exchange rates remain where they are currently.","On a constant currency basis, we are forecasting top line growth of 6% to 8%, with organic revenue growth of 3% to 5% and about 3% of revenue coming from acquisitions completed last year. Based on the top line performance -- based on this top line performance, we believe we can grow adjusted EPS 11% to 13% on a constant currency basis. We expect the impact of the stronger dollar will reduce revenue by about $100 million and reduce the bottom line by about $0.15 relative to our forecast based on the current currency outlook.","Consequently, our reported revenue guidance is $2.28 billion to $2.32 billion, which would represent 2% to 4% growth over 2014, and our adjusted EPS guidance is $2.58 to $2.64, which represents growth of roughly 5% to 7% off the $2.47 we delivered in 2014.","I would now like to turn the call over to Andy to walk through our financial results in greater detail.","Frank A. Wilson","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. As I've done in previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, financial summary of our fourth quarter results, and I'll provide some details around our first quarter and full year 2015 guidance. And then we'll, as usual, open up the call for questions.","I'd like to start by saying we had a very strong finish to the year. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was 5%, with recent acquisitions adding approximately 1%. This was offset by unfavorable foreign exchange, which represented a headwind of approximately 3%.","Reported and adjusted revenues each increased 3% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted revenues were $609 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $593 million in the same period a year ago. Since we last provided adjusted revenue guidance back in October, foreign currency has negatively impacted our results by an additional $7 million.","Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share grew 15% to $0.85, with full year adjusted earnings per share growing 18% to $2.47. Our quarterly results were $0.06 above the high end of our guidance range, the result of both volume leverage and strong incremental margins driven by favorable geographic and product mix, as well as a modest impact from Perten.","I'd like to note that approximately $5 million of revenues recognized in the fourth quarter related to sales that had originally been forecasted for the first quarter of 2015, but were shipped prior to year end at the request of our customers.","Looking at our geographic results. We experienced broad-based growth across all major geographies and end markets, with improved results in academic markets and stronger analytical instrument demand in China.","Our fourth quarter organic revenue increased high-single digits in the Americas, mid-single digits in Europe and Asia, with China also growing at a mid-single digit rate.","As to our operating results, fourth quarter adjusted gross margins were 49.5%, up 30 basis points from the prior period. Volume leverage, along with geographic and product mix, including new products, were the key drivers offsetting the negative impact to foreign exchange.","Fourth quarter adjusted SG&A was 23%, down 110 basis points from Q4 of 2013, benefiting from the impact of successful productivity initiatives and foreign exchange.","Fourth quarter research and development spending was down approximately 50 basis points from the same period a year ago, due primarily to efficiencies resulting from the consolidation of our R&D activities and to our research Center for Innovation in Hopkinton. We expect modest increases in R&D spending throughout 2015 as we continue to invest in innovative new product development.","Our operational performance in the fourth quarter was very strong as we expanded adjusted operating margins by 200 basis points to 21.5%, this in spite of the negative impact of foreign currency. Net interest expense in the fourth quarter was approximately $9 million, in line with guidance and lower than the prior period by approximately $5 million, due primarily to costs associated with the retirement of our private placement notes a year ago and the resulting lower interest costs resulting from refinancing at a lower interest rate.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 600,000 of the company's outstanding shares for a consideration of $26.5 million. For the full year 2014, we repurchased 1.3 million -- 1,350,000 shares for a total consideration of $61.3 million.","Our adjusted tax rate for Q4 was approximately 20% and 20.5% for the full year, essentially in line with our guidance.","Switching gears, I'd like to walk through the performance of our business segments for the fourth quarter.","By segment, Q4 organic revenues in our Human Health business grew 3%, and the Environmental Health business grew 7%. From an end-market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 55% of reported revenue in the quarter, with diagnostics representing 26% and research representing 29% of reported revenue.","Organic revenue growth from our diagnostics business increased mid-single-digits during the fourth quarter. Our results were driven primarily by strength in our newborn and prenatal screening and infectious disease testing solutions, which continue to garner strong demand throughout emerging markets.","In addition, birthrates in the U.S. grew at a 2% rate, showing a modest improvement from a year ago. This performance was partially offset by the expected decline in our medical imaging business due to customer ordering patterns.","Organic revenue in our research business grew low-single digits in the fourth quarter. Our Q4 results were driven by a number of new product introductions, including the Opera Phenix, EnSight and Touch, as well as improved demand for our innovative automation, quantitative technology and informatics platforms.","Moving to our Environmental Health business, representing approximately 45% of reported revenue in the quarter. Analytical instruments sales represented approximately 25% and service represented approximately 20% of reported revenue.","As Rob mentioned earlier, effective in 2015, we will be moving our OneSource Multi-Vendor Service offering into the research segment within Human Health to better serve our customers in the pharma, biotech end markets. As a result of this change, we'll be restating our historical financial results ahead of our first quarter 2015 earnings call. A non-GAAP reconciliation will also be posted on our website in the next few weeks to help you with your models.","Environmental Health organic revenue increased high-single digits in the fourth quarter and mid-single digits for the full year 2014. Our fourth quarter results were driven by strong demand in both food and safety end markets, with particular strength from our ICP-MS product portfolio and continued strength at our service offerings.","Turning to balance sheet. We finished the fourth quarter with approximately $1 billion of debt and approximately $175 million of cash. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.4x and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.0x. This compares to a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio in the fourth quarter of 2013 of 2x, as we essentially utilize our operating cash flows to fund acquisitions and share buybacks during the year.","Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $282 million versus $157 million in 2013. Improved working capital efficiency and completed operational investments were key drivers to this significant level of improvement. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was a record $90 million.","Looking back at 2014 results, we feel very good about our performance. Our mid-single digit organic revenue growth was encouraging, particularly in light of economic headwinds in Europe and China, aided in part by successful new product launches. As I mentioned, we are very pleased with our operating margin expansion, as we exited the year at 17.6% despite facing almost 50 basis points of currency headwinds during the year. This represents almost 500 basis points of margin improvement since we first communicated our longer-term operating margin expansion goals in early 2010.","In summary, we have delivered strong results over the last 5 years, culminating in a very successful 2014.","Turning to 2015. We entered the year with significant operational momentum. We anticipate market and geographic growth rates in 2015 to be somewhat similar to what was experienced in 2014. As in 2014, our strong incumbent positions, coupled with the benefit of a full year of new product revenue coming from launches in the second half of 2014 and additional launches in 2015, give us confidence in our ability to deliver organic revenue growth.","As Rob mentioned, the stronger dollar is expected to negatively impact revenues by approximately $100 million and impact earnings per share by approximately $0.15. As a result, we expect reported revenues to be in the range of $2.20 -- I'm sorry, reported revenues to be in the range of $2.28 billion to $2.32 billion, which represents organic revenue growth of 3% to 5%.","Adjusted earnings per share for 2015 is expected to be in the range of $2.58 to $2.64, which represents earnings per share growth of 6% at the midpoint. Included in this guidance is adjusted gross margin expansion of approximately 20 to 30 basis points and adjusted operating margin expansion of 30 to 50 basis points.","Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $42 million to $44 million and adjusted tax rate is expected to be 21%. We also expect a flat weighted average share count of approximately 113.5 million shares.","Given the significant strengthening of the dollar in the latter part of 2014, we also believe year-over-year comparisons will be more difficult in the first half of the year. Consequently, for the first quarter of 2015, we are forecasting reported revenues to be in the range of $530 million to $540 million or essentially flat, but represent organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%.","As a result of the flat revenue, combined with the impact of the timing of sales recognized in the fourth quarter, which I mentioned earlier, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.46 for the quarter.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So my first question is, yes, this is clearly a nice end to a year marked by some quarter-to-quarter volatility. One way you've managed operational spend in the context of this volatility was cutting R&D expense. And to be fair, a lot of this was expected given the Hopkinton consolidation. But you did come in, I think, a little bit lower than many of us expected. So with this in mind, can you talk about what's baked into 2015 guidance specifically for new product contributions to revenue growth? And will you likely increase R&D spend a little bit looking ahead, given you are seemingly expecting a little bit of a pick-up in sales growth over the next few quarters?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, so first of all, our plan is to ramp up R&D. And I would say when you look at 2014, as you pointed out, part of that was a purposeful slowdown in spending. But probably the bigger impact was our ability to hire the engineers or find the engineers that we were looking for. And so as we talked about, I think, in the beginning of '14, we had a significant ramp-up of employment planned in Hopkinton and, quite frankly, it's taken us longer to find the qualified people to sort of fill those slots. So hopefully, we'll continue to succeed in that area. See the other area that we've been focused on ramping up is informatics software engineers, and again they are -- have been somewhat troublesome to find. And we've seen some good progress here probably in the last 30 to 60 days. So I think it's fair to expect an increase in R&D spending in 2015, and we'll continue to layer that in. Your other question was with regard to new product revenue. Clearly, we would expect an annualization of the revenue we saw in the second half. So I would say we're probably looking for something in the $30 million to $35 million of benefit from new products for the entire 2015.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess a question on M&A. I mean, even subsequent to the completion of Perten, you guys have a pretty clean balance sheet. The rating on the company is higher now. So I was wondering if you wouldn't mind refreshing your financial criteria including ROIC hurdles, accretion requirements, maybe areas of prioritization and size limitations. And building off of this, would you describe the competitive environment in M&A? It does seem like leverage ratio limits have come down a bit for PE, which would seemingly be good for you. But beyond that, how would you describe the competitive environment for adding assets?","Robert F. Friel","So first of all, from our perspective, I think we feel pretty good about the capability we have to continue to do acquisitions and potentially buy back shares as well. So I think our slight preference is to do bolt-on acquisitions that add big capability both from a technology and an organizational capability. To the extent we can't find appropriate assets or the valuations are challenging, we would buy back stock. When we think about, over the next couple of years, we feel like we've probably got $1 billion of capability between the cash flow we -- the free cash flow we generate and the capacity we have on the balance sheet. We would be comfortable probably at 2.5x EBITDA, maybe stretching a little bit above that. But I think when you look at the combination, that's probably $1 billion of capability. With regard to the competitive environment, as I sort of alluded to before, I would say valuations are -- continue to be high. Makes sense relative to the cost of capital. So my sense is, increasingly, to make good assets work, you've got to have good synergies, and it's got to make sense relative -- either from a technology or from a market -- accessing customers. So we still see pretty good assets out there and we've got a pretty full pipeline. One of the things we did do in 2014 is we significantly ramped up our internal capabilities around business development. And so consequently, I think we've seen -- we've built a nice pipeline and we continue to feel optimistic about our ability to continue to bring in some great assets over the next couple of quarters.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And if I could sneak one more in for Andy and I'll get back in the queue. Andy, you've mentioned about $5 million in revenue that was pulled forward into the quarter. Would you be willing to just provide a little more color on how broad this was? Things like was it one customer? Was it a bunch of customers? And was it in 1 specific end market versus another?","Frank A. Wilson","Sure. It was really within 2 businesses. It was with our diagnostics business and with our informatics business. Both of those being high-margin businesses. But it was less than 10 customers, but it was split probably pretty evenly among the 2 businesses.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore Partners.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI, Research Division","So maybe I've missed it. I think on environmental, I was trying to get some of the extra color on how growth looked between environmental and industrial. Can you give us a flavor for how those 2 pieces trended sort of on a core basis? And then was there any notable change geographically? And it seemed like your commentary as a whole, as you look forward, was more conservative because of PMI, but it looked like the business actually had some pretty good results in maybe some of the cyclically oriented areas. So I'm just trying to figure out...","Robert F. Friel","Yes so first of all, on a geographic basis in the environmental, we saw pretty good growth across all the geographies. So whether it was Europe, Asia or Americas, it was all around mid-single digits. Actually maybe Europe was a little bit higher. But within those 3 geographies, the growth of environmental was between 5% and 7%, so it was pretty broad-based. However, when you look at the segments, industrial was lower than the sort of core environmental and food. So if you look at industrial was sort of low-single digits, whereas sort of environmental food and water was sort of again closer to the mid to high. So there was bifurcation from an end-market perspective. But geographically, it was fairly broad-based. And again, just even within China, we saw some nice recovery and within environmental. Greater China grew high-single digits.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI, Research Division","And maybe just on the margin cadence, obviously, the currency environment has been tricky this year and obviously had a bit of weight in your earnings. So as you think about various levers, I mean, obviously Doug touched upon the balance sheet. You've got plenty of capacity there. But as we think about -- you obviously just are coming off a year where you had pretty spectacular expansion, that would seem like some of the heavy lifting is already sort of underway. How much wiggle room do you have if we see either FX or something macro-oriented happen to kind of flex that line to make sure you can kind of manage within the earnings range?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I still think we see a number of opportunities to improve the efficiency of the operations. And we've talked in the past about the fact that we've done a lot around our factory consolidation. But purposely, while we were doing that, we were not as focused on switching our supply base out, for example, because we didn't want to be both moving the factory and moving the supply base. We think there's opportunity to continue to get better leverage there. We've talked about -- I know Andy's been talking about the big initiative around indirect spend. We continue to get good traction there. And doing some things on how we go to market, whether it's more effectively utilizing the web or some of our back-office capabilities. So we continue to see a number of opportunities to drive efficiencies and improve margins outright. But quite frankly, I think now that we're at the level, call it 18%, we do want to shift our focus a little bit more to growth. And so going back to sort of Doug's original question, I'm hopeful that we will be able to take up our spend around innovation. And we talked about opening up the China lab. There's another -- a number of great opportunities we see to take advantage of what we think are some terrific market positions that we have.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just want to actually follow-up on the M&A discussion. Can you give us a sense of how you're prioritizing different areas? Obviously, the 2 recent acquisitions, Perten Instruments and Ceiba, speak to some of the industrial or applied markets. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about software versus other areas that you might prioritize from an M&A perspective?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I'd start off by saying, I mean, I think the great thing about PerkinElmer right now is if you look at research, if you look at diagnostics, if you look at environmental, all those I think are attractive end markets. So we've got potential targets in all of those. From a prioritization standpoint though, we would probably put diagnostics probably a little bit higher. We just -- and I think we like the macro trends there, particularly in the areas we operate in. When you think about what's potentially -- the rising middle class, particularly in the emerging markets, and the continued pressure that's going to put on access to health care and aspects of newborn and infectious disease. So I would say that has a little bit of a maybe higher priority for us. We like the environmental area especially -- particularly food. And even within the research area, there's some areas that -- from a technology perspective. The great thing about informatics and why we also have been focused on informatics is we believe they leverage across all 3 markets. So again, we're looking for targets in all of those areas. But like I said, probably diagnostics in certain aspects within environmental probably have a little higher priority for us.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And you talked in our conference about trying to kind of monetize synergies between Environmental and Human Health. Can you just talk to what specifically that entails? Is that investments around software or -- just talk to what that means from your perspective.","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I think some of it is in software. But it's broader areas. There's areas like certain technologies. I think I mentioned the -- specifically, optics. So if you look at whether it's diagnostics, research or environmental, we do a number of things that require -- obviously when you're into detection and imaging, optics is a big component of that. If you look at algorithms, right, again because it's -- when you're taking readings off of instruments and converting that into data and information, there's algorithms. There's service benefits across the portfolio. So I think there's a number of technologies that leverage across. Obviously, there's software that leverages across and then things like brand and financial capability and sort of organizations. So we like being about Human and Environmental Health. It gives us access to customers and information that we can leverage across the businesses.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just lastly on China, you talked about things getting better on the analytical instruments side. Can you just quantify what your expectations are in '15, and your confidence in kind of the stabilization and recovery there?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, so if you look at China for us in 2014, it was in the high-single digits, because I think I talked about before, there was fairly big disparity between Human Health and Environmental Health. I would say for 2015, we would say similar top line growth for the company. So again, sort of high-single digit growth. Our expectation though is it would be sort of closer linkage between Environmental and Human Health. So similar growth to what we saw in 2014 but hopefully a little closer linkage between Human and Environmental Health.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Capital Markets.","Bryan Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","This is actually Bryan Kipp on behalf of Paul. I just want to dig in a little bit more on the environmental and industrial side. Did you see any budget flush in that in context to the strength you saw there? I know with the FX volatility and just year-end strength there, it just seems a little surprising. I know you also said there were strong bookings at the end of 3Q. So did most of those convert? And did account for, I guess...","Robert F. Friel","We don't believe that a significant contributor was budget flush, quite frankly. I mean if you look at within the specific growth of 7%, again, we saw higher growth on the service side. So service was stronger than the product. The product was still growing nicely, but we saw it higher on the service part. But we don't believe so [ph]. And again, as I sort of alluded to before, it was pretty broad-based across the geographies. I mean, I think some of that is attributable to better execution, quite frankly, within the businesses and maybe some improved market conditions, particularly in China.","Bryan Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And is there any color on how it's paced so far this quarter? I guess, bookings I mean, for -- end of 4Q, early 1Q?","Robert F. Friel","Our view right now is market conditions for the early part of '15 has been very similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter.","Bryan Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","All right. Last one quick for me. Last quarter, last call, you said $400 million in indirect spend that you've kind of highlighted and potentially pull out a little bit of leverage here and there. I think you said you'd like to pull out $10 million there. Are you seeing additional opportunities that you could pull from on that indirect spend that could support '15 and above and beyond where you were prior?","Frank A. Wilson","We absolutely do. It's about $420 million in total. And we've put a lot of effort around the tools and the education across the organization. In fact, we hired a dedicated procurement person dealing strictly with indirect spend. So our hope internally is to derive an even higher savings off of that total. And I think we may decide to spin some of that back or flow it through but I think that gives us a little bit of hedge on further currency deterioration. So I -- we feel very good about that particular initiative at this point.","Bryan Kipp - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Will you give harder numbers down the road?","Frank A. Wilson","I think as we progress through the year, we'll provide some additional color on how we're doing.","Operator","Question comes from the line of Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray.","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","This is actually Alex Nowak filling in for Bill. Can you describe the progress you're making in China with the increasing the newborn screening menu? I know you previously mentioned moving from 2 to 4 tests. I guess based on my question is how far along are you in this adoption going to 4 tests? And should we expect this to go to 5 or 6 tests in the future?","Robert F. Friel","First of all, we saw a very nice growth in China in newborn in the fourth quarter and, in fact, for the entire year. But I would describe the growth in China as more testing more children than expanding the menu. And I think right now, at least with our discussions with the government officials there, I think there's a higher priority around getting all the children screened at least the 2 to 4 before you'll see a big push on expanding. Some of that may happen in parallel. But if you look at our growth in 2014, it was probably more screening more children than it is absolute menu expansion. As we get into '15 and '16, I think then you'll hopefully see some more menu expansion where, as we mentioned, we go to 4 or 5, getting maybe even some mass spec screening. But clearly, what we saw in '14 was less menu expansion and more -- screening more children.","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, excellent. And then staying on China real quick. How is the NAQ [ph] conversion going for blood screening? Is it basically a national rollout at this point? Or is it still province-by-province?","Robert F. Friel","It's still province-by-province and it's starting to roll out but as, I think, we suggested earlier, it's sort of slower ramp than anticipated. So I think we talked a lot about probably seeing the uptick more in the back half of '15 as compared to early '15.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Actually, I have one on 4Q and then one on 2015. First on 4Q, the $5 million of additional revenue, is there any way to quantify what that translated into earnings for the quarter? Then I'm also curious just with the margins here in the fourth quarter, both gross and operating margins were better than I was looking for. So I was wondering what drove the -- I mean, when I look at it, 12% quarter-over-quarter increase in revenue, but only a 3% quarter-over-quarter increase in SG&A. So maybe I don't know if they're related at all or not. And then I'll follow up with my question 2015.","Frank A. Wilson","Well, as far as the overall EPS impact of the $5 million, it's probably a couple pennies.","Robert F. Friel","And I mean, it speaks a little bit to the leverage we get on volume growth. I mean, one of the things that you look at -- as PerkinElmer starts to do $600 million of revenue or north of that, we can produce a lot of incremental profitability. So in the quarter, we're 21.5% operating margin. Then it speaks to the leverage we get, particularly off of SG&A, but also some of the other fixed costs. So I mean, obviously that's going back to my prior comments around trying to get the growth cranked up. I mean, if we could get to the point where we're generating revenue significantly above the breakeven, we start to see very high flow-through of the profitability because clearly the SG&A and a lot of our costs do not scale with the revenue.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then just on 2015. I may be off on this but I believe in 2015, you're going to have 53 selling weeks versus 52 in past years. And so I'm just wondering, I guess, a couple of things. One, if that's correct. Two, if you could quantify the impact from that. And then three, what quarter those extra days will hit in 2015?","Robert F. Friel","So first of all, that is correct, every 6 or 7 years, we have an extra week. That's to some extent why you saw, in 2014, we closed on the 28th and not the 31st. So this year, we'll have an extra week. I believe, Andy, it's in the third quarter?","Frank A. Wilson","Yes.","Robert F. Friel","And I think we factored that into our guidance. We don't think it's going to be a significant impact on the top line because, fundamentally, what you're doing is you're picking up a couple of days at the end of '14 and a couple of days at the early part of '16. So that the week we get is really the 29th, 30th and 31st of December in '14, and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th of January. Our sense is maybe that's $15 million to $20 million of revenue. And some associated profit flows through from that. So -- and again, we sort of factored that in the 3% to 5% growth guidance.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","You talked a couple of times about achieving, for all intents and purposes, your 18% operating margin target in 2014. Previously, you had offered another target of greater than 20% in 2017. Is that still the plan or are you stepping back from that plan?","Robert F. Friel","I would say it's our goal. I think what makes that more challenging is where the dollar is right now. So -- and particularly if it's going to continue to strengthen. So while we still have the goal out there internally and we're trying to get to 20% by 2017, I think of the euro at $1.12, and like I said, and if it continues to sort of march towards parity, I think 20% operating margins, I don't think they become impossible but it gets a lot more challenging.","Frank A. Wilson","But Dan, I think the activities that we had laid out and have in place through '17 will continue, and I think we'll continue to make good progress on that. We can't control FX, but I think you'll continue to see us expand margins. And if FX does head the other way, it does make it a little bit easier.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up question on Human Health. I'm trying to reconcile some of the positive new product commentary in that category with a result that was a little bit lower than we were looking for, it had a low single-digit number. So what were the offsets and what assumptions do we need to make to assume that, that segment accelerates to a mid-single digit growth range after a couple of years of low-single digit?","Robert F. Friel","So if we're talking specifically about Human Health, the offset was medical imaging, as we mentioned, was sort of down mid-single digits. So that's why you're seeing Human Health pulled down a little bit from sort of the 5 to 6 it's been historically down to 3. If you're talking more specifically around research and what needs to happen there, I think a couple of things is as we continue to get new products out in those areas that we're focused like microfluidics and imaging, and -- what will move is radiochemicals becomes a smaller percentage of the whole. So obviously, we've -- that's a drag. But I think the other thing is we've talked about informatics, which is in the research area, had a very strong 2013. In the back half of 2014, it wasn't as strong because of difficult comps but also because we're investing a lot in a new offering around the cloud. And so we're optimistic that for '15, you'll see informatics return to sort of a high-single, low-digit -- double-digit growth. So it's a combination of getting new products out. Second thing is getting informatics growing again at sort of a double-digit rate and sort of averaging radiochemicals down to a smaller percentage of the business.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to start off with the margins. I think in the beginning, you or Andy talked about the long-term goals that you set, you hit 18%. And obviously, it's been a pretty successful run here. And as we look to the long term from here forward, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you think margins can go and realize you probably wouldn't want to give specific guidance, but just trying to get a sense of what you think the opportunities are and how much you have to work with?","Robert F. Friel","Well, going back to the comment earlier, we had set a goal of 20% by the end of '17, and we felt fairly confident we could get there based on both the success that we've had previously and the opportunities we see going forward. But as I mentioned before, that's still a goal of ours. It's just a little bit more difficult given the headwinds associated with foreign exchange. So we haven't come out with a new goal relative to 20% because we're waiting to see whether the strength of the dollar is a short term, long term and where it goes. But I would say for now, the 20% is the goal that we've got out there.","Frank A. Wilson","And I think as I said before, I think our plans have not changed. The only thing that's really changed is FX. And if you look at reinvestment, we're actually covering probably 8% to 10% increases in R&D for this year, for 2015. So I think all the dynamics and the framework will continue to be executed against. And again, it's really going to depend on where the FX rate's at over the next 3 or 4 years.","Robert F. Friel","But as a general rule, the idea of 75 basis points a year, plus maybe some benefit from acquisitions or capital deployment, et cetera, I think still holds.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. It all makes sense. Second one was on newborn screening. I was curious just the underlying growth trend that you saw domestically versus a broad, how did that do? I'm assuming that U.S. improved a little bit sequentially but wondering if that in fact was the case. And then as you look at 2015, are you assuming that continues to trend better?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. So your assumption is correct. U.S. improved incrementally, as did the outside the U.S. So we saw growth across both. As you could imagine, in the U.S., it was sort of more menu expansion, whereas outside, it was more -- we continue to get good penetration. I think the other opportunity as we look out, as you probably saw, we just got FDA approval for our SCID assay. And we're very excited about that, and we've actually started some pilot programs actually outside the U.S. So for example, France is doing a pilot program. So we think there is continued opportunity, even within the developed world, to expand the menu. So we continue to be quite bullish on the newborn screening growth prospects.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If I could just sneak one in real quickly. Do you think the U.S. volume environment for newborn could tick up this year as well, just putting aside the nice menu additions as well?","Robert F. Friel","Our statistics, as I think Andy mentioned, would indicate the birthrates are up about 2% on a trailing 12 months. So obviously, that helps from a volume perspective.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Miroslava Minkova of Stifel.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Let me just start with a question on the revenue and earnings cadence in '15. Just looking at your first quarter outlook here, and it seems to suggest a somewhat slower start. I know there was the $5 million that got pushed forward into fourth quarter. But there have been some comments from your competitors as well that budgets stand to be spent a little bit later in the year, perhaps more recently. How do you think about sort of the revenue and the earnings build as you go through the year?","Frank A. Wilson","Yes, we talked earlier. We do feel like there's going to be a bit more of a shift to the latter half for both the top and bottom line from a cadence perspective. I think in the first quarter, in particular, we do have what I described as the $5 million in the fourth quarter. But in addition, we have some investments that we're making, which is also impacting our earnings per share around the China lab and around some investments in informatics. So I think we're going to see some essentially flat margins in the first quarter. But I think that's because of investments and the impact of FX. I think for the full year, I think we still see revenue improving more in the second than the first half. And we think operating margins are going to be, after FX, in kind of that 30 to 50 basis point range.","Robert F. Friel","I would say the other thing -- and I mentioned in fact that we are expecting to introduce some new products at PITTCON, which is the analytical instruments show in early March. And so we're looking to get some nice tailwinds from that, particularly in the back half of the year. And so that's also skewing some of the growth and profitability in the back half.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And perhaps if I could go back to the Human Health business, and the medical imaging in particular. Do you expect this to rebound in 2015? And why was the margin so strong on the Human Health side?","Robert F. Friel","So first of all, the answer is yes. We do expect medical imaging to be sort of mid-single digits in 2015. I think, Andy, in his prepared remarks, mentioned a little bit of some customer ordering patterns that created some difficulty, particularly in Q4. I think the answer to your question about why the margins were sort of high is, first of all, we had some favorable mix during the fourth quarter, as I sort of alluded to. Newborn screening was very strong, and that's probably one of our highest profitable business. I think the other thing, going to the overall point that I made before, is when volume increases, we create a lot of profitability on an incremental basis. And so that's particularly true in Human Health, where you've got high reagent flow, which, of course, has very high gross margins associated with it.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rafael Tejada - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's Rafael in for Derik. I just wanted to go back to the margins for 2015. Can you just actually provide what the margins would look like on a constant currency basis? What the margin expansion would be at the gross and operating margin level?","Frank A. Wilson","Probably closer to around 30 basis points at the gross margin level and probably 50 to 70 at the operating line.","Rafael Tejada - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, helpful. And just wanted to go back on the -- to the research markets. Can you remind us again what the -- where we are now in terms of what radiochemicals represents as a percentage of total sales? And how in vivo imaging, how that business is trending?","Robert F. Friel","So the radio chemical business for us, it's -- I call it $90 million of revenue, just to give you a sense of the size of that business. The in vivo imaging business, I would say for the fourth quarter was slow relative -- and I think, to a large extent, that was associated by -- as I mentioned before some of the austerity we're seeing around academic spending. We do believe or we expect in 2015, we'll see that business be up again in the sort of mid- to high-single digits.","Rafael Tejada - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just one last one on OneSource.","Can you just speak to the competitive landscape here in terms of lead generation and also just the pricing dynamics that you're seeing in the space?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I mean, I think the multi-vendor service area has been one that's been fairly competitive for a period of time, right? There's a number of strong competitors out there. I think we've got a little bit of a first-mover advantage. And the other thing I think that helps us is that our informatics capabilities, which we've been leveraging, the Ceiba acquisition was -- helped bolster that as well. So I think the combination of being incumbents in a lot of areas, having the strong software capability and being quite successful at it continues to us take our fair share, but it is a very competitive environment.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier, Maxim Group.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","First question on M&A. You said that you like M&A opportunities in diagnostics. Obviously, you're strong in newborn and prenatal screening and strong growing in infectious disease. Would you step outside of those core competencies or are those the areas where we should expect you to be the most focused on in potential M&A opportunities?","Robert F. Friel","My sense is that you expect us to be most focused on, I mean, maybe potential adjacencies for those areas, but unlikely that you're going to see us make a significant move outside. Clearly, an area of molecular diagnostics might be one, where you think about the opportunity to take that into the -- our current markets that we serve. But a few things that we're going to look for are stuff that are adjacent to what we do, that we can -- are consistent with the channels that we have or the technologies we can deploy into our existing customer base.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","And then do you know what the screening rate in China is up to today? And I've seen an estimate for Chinese births to decline as much as 30% in 2015. Even with further expansion of screening, can that business still grow in 2015 with such a severe birthrate headwind?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, so the current screening in China is in the 65% to 70% range. I think what you're referring to is 2015 is the Year of the Goat. And so apparently, Chinese do not want to have children in the Year of the Goat because there's negative implications to that. And we've actually seen some of that impact in our prenatal business because that's a very good precursor to newborn rates. 30% sounds like a pretty high number to me. And of course, what's offsetting that to some extent is the release -- or the loosening of the one-child policy. And so the answer to your question is we do believe we can continue to grow the newborn business in 2015 despite it being the Year of the Goat.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott with Robert W. Baird.","Elena Popova - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Ellie Popova filling in for Jeff. Can you walk us through some of the main components of your revenue growth assumptions? I know you already mentioned new product, but are you able to share your expectations around volume and pricing? And particularly pricing in light of some of the large FX moves we've seen.","Robert F. Friel","I would say generally speaking, pricing for us has not had a material impact one way or another if you look historically, and consequently we haven't factored into it having a large impact in 2015. I think if you look at all of last year, pricing was in sort of 50-basis-point help. So I would say for 2015, our assumptions are that similar level, maybe 50 basis points of increase in price. So that the majority of the volume is going to -- majority of the growth is going to come from volume. To give you a sense by business, I think it's fairly well distributed. I think as we think about '15 right now, it's probably Environmental and Human Health, similar growth trajectories, I would say, in the 3% to 5% range. When you look within Human Health, diagnostics will probably be a little at the higher end. So maybe that's in the sort of 7% range. And clearly, research will be sort of at the lower end of that, maybe in the 3% range.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Andy, just on -- in terms of the outlook for next year, could you give us some metrics around what you're looking for in terms of operating cash flow and CapEx? And how you're thinking about the free cash flow conversion that's likely for the year?","Frank A. Wilson","Yes. Sure. I think we'll be in the mid- to high-90s on free cash flow conversion. I think our operating cash flow should be around $315 million to $325 million, so we'll have a 3 handle for the first time on our operating cash flows. I think free cash flow, yes, it will probably be high 200s to $285 million to close to $300 million, in that range. I think we're going to see some continued improvement on the working capital side. We've made some investments, utilizing our SAP system on the collection side. We think we can get some working capital taken out with that. And we also have some efforts around inventory. So we feel pretty good about the working capital piece, and I think with the additional income we'll see our way to getting to those numbers.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And just on the research business in the fourth quarter, could you give us a feel for the geographic performance? Or if there was any -- I suppose it's mostly pharma, but any customer-based color to share on the fourth quarter?","Robert F. Friel","I would say if you look at the pharma sort of academics split, pharma was sort of mid-single digits, academic was sort of low single. I alluded to the fact that the imaging business, the in vivo imaging was impacted by the funding environment. And of course, when I talk about research here, I'm not including the OneSource, which was -- had a very strong fourth quarter. I think what drove pharma to some extent was the new products, particularly around the Opera Phenix and the MOD [ph]. We came out with a new product called the EnSight, which combines both detection capability and imaging. Geographically, I'd say the strongest region was Europe. Europe was up mid-single digits. It was nice recovery there so we were pleased with the performance there. Americas was up low-single digits and APAC was actually down a little bit, even though China grew. China grew mid- to high-single digits. It was really some difficult comps we had outside of China that put pressure on that region. But again, it was low single in the Americas, mid-single-digit growth in Europe and APAC was down just slightly.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Reggie Miller with CitiBank.","Reginald Miller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Most have been answered so far but I guess kind of thinking big picture, Rob. You mentioned that you're playing a leadership position in more or less 75% of the businesses that you operate in today. How often, I guess, do you look at the other 25% and say, hey, maybe kind of evaluate those and potentially, I guess, see if they are subscale or maybe look into divesting them?","Robert F. Friel","I mean, we're looking at our businesses all the time. And at least on an annual basis, we're sitting down with the Board of Directors and going through a fairly thorough strategic review of the portfolio and the businesses. And so one of the questions we continue to ask ourselves are, are we the most appropriate owner of the franchise of the business? So it's something we go through, like I said, a fair amount of detail on at least an annual basis, but it's something we're always challenging ourselves and questioning the businesses and making sure that we can continue to create value owning those businesses.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Eric Criscuolo with Mizuho.","Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Just filling in for Peter tonight. I guess if you could maybe talk about -- or talk a little more about the Perten acquisition and the kind of growth rates it had when you acquired it and where you think it could go under your leadership and maybe the margin profile as well?","Robert F. Friel","So as I sort of mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're very excited about the Perten Instruments acquisition. We think it brings us some terrific capabilities in and around, broadly defined, food but more specifically, in grain and feed. And we think the combination of their technical capabilities, their product portfolio and maybe, most importantly, their access and customer reputation, combined with some of the things that we have the capability to do, will allow us to accelerate the growth in and around that business. So -- and early indications are -- continue to be reinforce what we saw when we did the diligence. With regard to specific numbers, they are growing around 7%, 8%, which we would expect to continue and maybe even improve a little bit. And it was a business that had 20% operating margin. So profitable business, good growth, great reputation in the marketplace, and we look to leverage that and continue to expand in, obviously, the important area of food safety.","Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","I guess Andy on the FX issue, is there anything that you can do, I guess, to maybe be a little more proactive in taking that hit a little or making the hit a little less as far as shipping costs or anything like that? Or is it something that you basically just have to kind of weather through for a little while?","Frank A. Wilson","I think for the majority of the FX impact, we have to weather through it. I think what we're trying to do is accelerate some of the actions around -- some of the cost initiatives around direct spend and so forth to try to pull as much of that in as we can to try to somewhat offset it. But it's a fairly significant number, as we've communicated. And we're not going to hedge the P&L. It's a lot of risk and you're wrong more than half the time. So I think we'll just try to power through it. It's -- unfortunately, there's not any magic dust to help us here.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions in queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rob Friel.","Robert F. Friel","Great. Well, first of all, thank you for your questions.

I'm pleased to report PerkinElmer had a very good start 2019 delivering a strong performance in the first quarter. Revenue for the first quarter was $649 million, representing organic growth of 5%. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.69, representing growth of 10% over Q1 last year and $0.03 better than our guidance.","EPS feat was attributable to slightly higher organic revenue growth in the quarter and better operating margin expansion, as adjusted operating margins increased 130 basis points in the quarter. In addition, we continue to execute on plans to invest in high-growth areas, shift the organization to a more unified structure and further improve operating margins. From an end-market perspective, the first quarter played out similar to our expectations, except that we were able to ship about half of the revenue we thought we would miss as a result of the U.S. government shutdown.","Looking at our growth by market. Americas was strong up high single-digits, led by Diagnostics pharma and food. Asia was solid up mid-single digits with strength in Diagnostics and pharma. Europe was down modestly due to softness in industrial environmental and food end markets.","Looking ahead, we continue to expect improved growth momentum in APAC, solid growth trends in the Americas and modest growth in the low single-digits in Europe. While Jamey will discuss our end markets in more detail the macro drivers to our growth remains largely unchanged. In Diagnostics, the prevalence of infectious and autoimmune diseases continue to grow, particularly in emerging markets. Increasing demand for earlier diagnosis and the rising adoption of new technologies also is fueling growth across all three of our segments of reproductive health, immunodiagnostics and genomics.","In life sciences, we continue to see robust demand in both product sales and services within the pharma and biotech markets as our customers continue to increase investments in tools and technologies to improve their research lab productivity. Within food analysis, market growth continues to be driven by the rising outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, advances in technology for food safety testing and globalization of the food supply. ","Lastly, our environmental and applied markets generally track macroeconomic conditions and as such are experiencing stronger growth in the Americas with softness in Europe and Asia. Influenced by these market trends, we continue to shape our portfolio actions and investment priorities to expand in the key growth areas, I outlined in January.","During the first quarter, these areas experienced strong growth as we continue to execute on our plans to invest and build-out these differentiated capabilities. I've asked Prahlad to briefly update you on our activities regarding these key growth initiatives as well as how we are better aligning our organization to optimize these opportunities and better serve our customers. In addition to these organically funded initiatives, we continue to deploy capital to complement these growth areas with companies that add technology and leadership positions in synergistic market applications.","A good example of this is our announcement today of our purchase of Cisbio Bioassays. Cisbio is based in France and produces kits and reagents for life science and diagnostic markets. Last year, we generated just over $50 million in revenue with margins north of 25%. We're excited - we're very excited to welcome Cisbio team to PerkinElmer and believe it provides us a number of strategic opportunity. In the area of drug discovery, we will now have the broadest capabilities with regard to homogeneous detection technologies, helping scientists accelerate workflows and more efficiently stream potential drug candidates.","Cisbio also enables our expansion into cellular imaging reagents to complement our strong positions in high content and in vivo imaging markets. In addition, approximately 25% of the revenue is focused on in-vitro diagnostics which is very complementary with EUROIMMUN. And finally, they bring strong technical capabilities and intellectual property in molecular and cellular biology and assay development.","Once integrated, our combined resources should result in accelerated growth and innovation in our reagent portfolio for the life sciences and drug discovery markets. Jamey, will discuss the financial aspects of the deal later in the call. As I mentioned earlier, another key focus area for us this year is expanding our operating margins, and I was particularly pleased with our performance in the first quarter. The majority of this progress was attributable to three areas that we have targeted this year.","The first is EUROIMMUN, where a more favorable product mix and improved cost management added roughly 60 basis points to margin. The second is improved factory productivity, which drove about 50 basis points of margin expansion with the remaining factor was continued success in leveraging operating expenses by maintaining our SG&A expenses flat, while revenue grew 5% organically. The progress, we made this quarter reinforces our confidence in the full year plan to increase operating margins 120 to 150 basis points.","So to summarize the start of the year, we delivered strong financial performance continued to make good progress on those areas that accelerate our growth, completed the Cisbio acquisition which adds terrific capabilities and is attractive financially, and we experienced good traction on our initiatives to significantly expand our operating margins.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Prahlad to give you some more color on our growth initiatives.","Prahlad Singh","Thanks, Rob. As I mentioned during last year's - our last quarter's earnings call we are rallying around an end-market approach to create the most advanced solutions for our customers in the key markets we serve. This approach will enable us to drive leadership across our priority end markets whether through the differentiated solutions, we are creating to meet customer needs or strategic partnerships and acquisitions that will deliver incremental value to our customers, while focused on solving the next big thing in science and health care.","In that regard, I've had the opportunity of spending a great amount of time, this past quarter meeting with customers, employees and shareholders across all of PerkinElmer and it has further reinforced the need and opportunity for us to move forward on this strategy.","Rob mentioned our key growth accelerators and I would like to give you a sense of the progress we are making in a few of these areas, which we believe will fuel long-term top line growth by expanding profitability. We continue to execute against our previously stated key priorities of providing an exceptional customer experience being recognized as an innovation leader and making people and culture a competitive advantage.","To accelerate our efforts, we are focused internally on reshaping the organization to leverage our capabilities across PerkinElmer. We recently announced a combined R&D organization that brings together our technical capabilities across businesses and geographies, and aligns our two R&D groups from Diagnostics and Discovery & Analytical Solutions under one team.","Further, as we continue to see capabilities and applications that our customers demand converge across our end markets. We are revamping our go-to-market approach to maximize the benefit from the intersections of our technologies and expertise across end markets. This will be a seamless transition that positions us to immediately create even more relevancy and opportunities with customers around the globe.","From an operations standpoint, we have launched several initiatives that will improve the customer experience from quickening, auto fulfillment to optimizing the supply chain. Importantly, we are fully capitalizing on the trend towards digitalization and will be implementing our company-wide digital transformation strategy aimed at re-crafting our digital architecture, assets and capabilities to better benefit our customers and organization.","Similarly, in immunodiagnostics, we continue to leverage the capabilities of EUROIMMUN and PerkinElmer to launch innovative products and penetrate new markets for allergy, autoimmune and infectious disease testing. We received FDA clearance for two celiac markers to complete EUROIMMUN's offerings in the U.S. and help expand our test menu within existing lab accounts.","We continue to expand our autoimmune screening footprint with some key wins and expect that by early Q3 we will boost EUROIMMUN's market share in the U.S. market to 50%. The market for autoimmunity screen testing is anticipated to increase as more patients gain access to testing.","Building upon our leadership in the burgeoning area of genomics. In collaboration with Helix and Genome Medical we launched GenePrism: Actionable Insights. This is a genetic test that will return results for 59 genes, which the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics have associated with potentially life-threatening, but actionable health conditions. PerkinElmer is the only truly global genomics lab covering all aspects of genomics biochemical, cytogenetics and molecular testing with options from prenatal with -- or Vanadis NIPT test to postnatal with whole-genome sequencing. We are also uniquely able to conduct testing for both sick and healthy populations.","For healthy individuals, GenePrism offers elective genomic sequencing of actionable genes. This test is not a direct-to-consumer test, but rather physician-driven, which includes pre- and post-test genetic counseling. PerkinElmer genomics will provide data analysis, interpretation clinical reports to individuals who purchased the product.","Within reproductive health, our Vanadis NIPT System continues on track and we are ramping up our global service and support teams. The funnel is strong and is improving with each quarter. We also continue to expand our newborn screening business around the world, the latest milestone being in Singapore. By the end of this year, all newborn babies in Singapore will be screened for treatable generic disorders with PerkinElmer solutions.","Lastly, I would like to provide some updates on our focus on the food and cannabis end markets. We were recently awarded Emerald Test badges for our proficiency in cannabis testing. As state and federal regulations in this space evolve, Emerald Test results provide a benchmark for laboratories in the cannabis industry to ensure safe, high-quality products. Our analytical instruments such as the QSight series and testing methods were proven to meet the highest standards in accurately detecting pesticides, heavy metals, residues solvents and terpenes in cannabis, as well as determining product potency.","By qualifying as a vendor and not just a testing lab, PerkinElmer is even better positioned above the competition to demonstrate that our technology, application knowledge, and SOPs are the best choice for customers. I look forward to sharing ongoing progress with you during the year. And will now hand the call over to Jamey.","Jamey Mock","Thanks Prahlad, and good evening everyone. I want to start with the financial highlights for the first quarter of 2019. Next, I'll provide some additional color on our served end markets and detail on other financial metrics. I'll finish by providing a brief update on how we are thinking about the rest of 2019.","Turning to the first quarter results. We continue to be pleased with the strength in our business as organic revenue grew approximately 5%. Reported revenue in the first quarter of $649 million, included a 4% foreign exchange headwind and net acquisition had a negligible impact.","As discussed in our previous guidance for the quarter, the temporary U.S. government shutdown created a delay in the approval process for an export-controlled product, which led to a 1% headwind in the quarter. Both segments and geographies grew in line with our initial assumptions heading into the year. Diagnostics representing 40% of total sales grew 9% organically, driven by broad based growth across our reproductive health, applied genomics and immunodiagnostics business lines.","Discovery & Analytical Solutions representing 60% of total sales grew 2% organically highlighted by strength in pharma biotech end market. I will provide some additional color on both businesses in a moment.","As expected, organic revenue growth was mixed on a geographic basis. High single-digit organic revenue growth in the Americas and mid single-digit organic revenue growth in APAC was modestly offset by a low single-digit organic revenue decline in Europe. Excluding the impact from the lost revenue due to the U.S. government shutdown both APAC and China were up high single-digits. We are encouraged by our operational performance in the first quarter.","Adjusted gross margins were up 120 basis points to 49.8%. Adjusted operating margins expanded 130 basis points in the first quarter to 16.2%, driven by strong productivity in our Diagnostics business and good operating expense leverage.","As Rob mentioned, adjusted earnings per share of $0.69 was an increase of 10% versus the first quarter of 2018 and was $0.03 better than our guidance in January. The beat was comprised of $0.01 from greater organic revenue growth and $0.02 from more favorable incremental margins.","Looking further into the key drivers within our segments for the first quarter of 2019, let's start with our Diagnostics business. As mentioned in my earlier remarks, organic revenue grew 9%, driven by broad based momentum across our portfolio. Reproductive health grew high single-digits organically, driven by our genomics testing business. We remain on track to double revenue in our genomics testing business year-over-year in 2019.","Immunodiagnostics grew low double-digits organically led by double-digit organic growth in EUROIMMUN and Tulip. As Prahlad mentioned, we're encouraged by our progress in the U.S. and excited about our future MPIs over the next couple of years.","Applied genomics products grew high single-digit, as customers increasingly rely on our automated sample to answer portfolio. Finally, we are encouraged by the initial feedback from our Vanadis early adopters and remain on track to have 30 total installations by the end of the year.","Turning to Discovery & Analytical Solutions. The first quarter was impacted by several unique timing items. However, we feel confident the business will grow mid-single digits in 2019. We experienced high single-digit organic revenue growth in pharma biotech.","Demand for our leading Discovery product portfolio remained robust, led by our high-content screening and in vivo imaging solutions. This marks our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth in our imaging and detection product lines.","We are optimistic that Cisbio, which I will talk about in a few minutes, will help further our leading Discovery portfolio -- further improve our leading Discovery portfolio. Additionally, we experienced high single-digit organic revenue growth in our OneSource business and flat organic revenue growth in our informatics business off a difficult first quarter 2018 comparison.","The two end markets impacted most by timing were applied, and academic and government. Applied markets, which grew low single-digits, would have been mid-single digits excluding the impact from the U.S. government shutdown. Academic and government, which had a double-digit decline off a small revenue base, would have been flat excluding the U.S. government shutdown and service timing delays.","Looking at below-the-line items, adjusted net interest and other expense for the first quarter was approximately $14 million and our adjusted tax rate was approximately 16%, driven by discrete items.","Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion of debt and $134 million of cash. We exited the quarter with a net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.8 times.","Free cash flow in the quarter was negative $25 million and adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was negative $7 million. The difference between the reported and adjusted number is due to cash payments associated with the Tulip and Vanadis acquisitions.","Working capital uses increased mostly due to seasonal inventory builds. We have ongoing actions to execute our full year cash flow plan and we continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow conversion of 95% in 2019.","As Rob mentioned, we are excited about our acquisition of Cisbio, at net purchase price of approximately $215 million. We expect a double-digit return on invested capital by year four. Cisbio had about $51 million of revenue in 2018. For the remainder of 2019, we expect Cisbio to contribute $35 million in revenue and approximately $0.02 of adjusted earnings per share to PerkinElmer.","Given our strong first quarter results and the addition of Cisbio, we are raising our revenue and adjusted earnings outlook for 2019. We expect revenue for the year to be approximately $2.93 billion, including $42 million from foreign exchange headwinds, $35 million of contributions from Cisbio and 6% organic revenue growth.","For the full year, we expect EPS -- adjusted EPS of $4.02 to $4.07, driven primarily by the addition of Cisbio. Implicit in this guidance is, adjusted operating margin expansion of 120 to 150 basis points, $50 million of interest and other expense and a tax rate of 16%. We expect our share count to be slightly under 112 million shares.","For the second quarter of 2019, we are forecasting reported revenue of $730 million, representing 5% to 6% organic revenue growth, including a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $18 million versus the comparable prior period and $8 million from Cisbio. In terms of adjusted earnings per share guidance, we are forecasting $1.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time, we would like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Willoughby","Hi. Good evening. A question for you, just on guidance first, Jamey. You beat here by $0.03 in the first quarter. This acquisition you're saying is $0.02 accretive. It looks like your interest expense for the year might be coming down a few million as well. What is the offset then that you're only raising your full year guidance by $0.02? And then I have one follow-up.","Jamey Mock","Sure. Thanks for the question Steve. So, yes, the $0.03 beat in the first quarter, we think a couple of pennies will come back in the second quarter, that's due to the extra organic revenue growth for the export-controlled products as well as a little bit of margin expansion with a little bit of timing.","The offset to the extra penny is a little bit -- actually a little bit extra interest expense in the year, because our pre-cash flow performance in the first quarter was a little less than expected. So I think you might be referring to total -- that the number that I quoted was total interest expense and other and that was $60 million as our guidance for the year.","Steve Willoughby","Okay, great. And then, I was just wondering if someone could comment and provide a little bit more color, just on how the Vanadis rollout is going? How discussions as it relates to reimbursement is going? How people are seeing throughput, et cetera? And maybe an update on when we will see some clinical publications on that.","Prahlad Singh","Yes. Steve, this is Prahlad. So the Vanadis installations are going per plan that we have shared earlier. We've had 13 installations by the end of Q1. I personally have visited the first seven customers over the last month and the feedback has been very positive. And generally customers continue to remain excited.","We have a pretty strong pipeline. So that's from an installation and a current status perspective. We have submitted publication. So hopefully it's going through the peer review process and that provides data around all the CE-IVD, the clinical arm the CE Mark that was submitted.","In the U.S. we've -- as you know we've got the women and infants -- the value study that's ongoing. We've just very initially begun discussions and started exploring as to what our strategies should be around payers. So it's still in its early stages in regards to reimbursement.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Patrick Donnelly","Great, thanks guys. Rob, maybe one for you, just on China, we've seen some mixed data points there. You had one peer who saw a decline called out a few specific areas of weakness, another peer put up a really strong quarter sounded bullish across the board.","And then on the more macro side, we saw some core industrial companies report even today kind of blaming the macro in China and saw a big slowdown there. I know you guys had high single kind of removing onetime stuff. So, can you just provide your perspective on that market help us think about the state of the market there during the quarter and then also just to go forward?","Rob Friel","Yeah. So, for us, it was a good quarter in China. I would say the majority of our end markets continue to see good growth. So, if you look particularly in the diagnostic side, EUROIMMUN did well.","Our immunodiagnostic business continues to do pretty well. And so I would say, on the diagnostic side we saw a good strength. On the Pharma aside we continue to see good strength. But I would say to the extent, that was somewhat offset by weakness more on the applied markets.","And we think some of them are maybe timing related. But as you said, when you exclude the sort of onetime impact of the export-controlled product, we were sort of high-single digits. So we feel pretty good about the China momentum going into the second quarter.","Patrick Donnelly","Okay. And then maybe just on DAS, calling for pretty healthy uptick to mid-single digits in 2Q, facing a significantly more difficult comp. I know you touched on a bit. But can you just talk through the moving pieces there how much visibility you have? And what drives that business really higher on kind of a two-year stack number?","Rob Friel","So, first of all, we did see strong growth or continued strong growth in the Pharma biotech which is sort of high-single digits for us in the first quarter. We think that continues. Some of that was offset from some academic markets that were quite frankly timing related.","There were a number of items there, that sort of caused that to be actually negative in the quarter, we don't think that's a market phenomenon. We think that's unique to a couple of things we had. So, if academic goes back to sort of positive, we think that will drive life sciences to sort of mid- to high-single digits.","And then as I mentioned before, there was some things in the implied markets outside the U.S. that I think -- when we look at the bookings we're fairly confident that we'll return that business to sort of mid-single digits despite the difficult comp with last year.","Patrick Donnelly","Yeah. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Chris McCabe","Hey. Good afternoon. This is Chris on for Doug today. Thanks for taking my question. So, just based on your Q2 core revenue guidance, it looks like, the core revenue growth for the year is back-end loaded.","By our math you're essentially guiding to 6.5% to 7% core growth in the second half relative to a 5% growth in the first half. So with that in mind, can you just walk us through the key drivers behind the 150 basis points to 200 basis points of revenue growth deceleration in the second half?","Rob Friel","So why don't I take the revenue and then maybe Jamey can talk a little bit about the margin. But, I think actually going into the year we talked about the fact that the back end will be a little better from both a revenue perspective as well as a margin perspective.","And a lot of that is because a lot of the growth accelerators that Prahlad mentioned, so whether it's our genetic testing business, whether it's Vanadis, whether it's some of the MPIs that are coming out later in the year will ramp up the revenue growth. And that also impacts our margins to some extent. But I'll let Jamey speak to the margins then.","Jamey Mock","Yeah. That's what I was going to say. So, 130 basis points of margin expansion in the first quarter, the first half of the year Chris is probably 46% to 47% of our revenue. And so we get a lot more volume leverage in the second half of the year. So if we're in the 120 range already in the first half, we feel very confident in the 120 to 150 for the total year. Thank you.","Chris McCabe","Okay. And then for my follow-up question, could you just provide a bit more on Europe performance, specifically why end markets were soft there. And do you expect that to remain here for the balance of the year? And maybe just more broadly, are there any major changes to your end market or geographic growth assumptions for the year?","Rob Friel","Yeah. I would say the pressure we saw in Europe was largely in the applied markets and also academic. And that really put some pressure on our DAS growth rates. The majority of our Diagnostics business continued to do well in Europe. And so for Europe overall we were just slightly negative.","And then your question whether we do think that's going to come back somewhat in the remainder of the year, I think we talked in the beginning of the year of targeting Europe at sort of low single-digits. And we still think that's the appropriate number for Europe.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks and good afternoon.","Rob Friel","Good afternoon, Brandon.","Brandon Couillard","On the Cisbio deal, could you help us kind of understand what the growth profile of that asset is? And any opportunities you might see to accelerate growth or profitability under the Perkin umbrella?","Rob Friel","Yeah. So I would say we're quite excited about this acquisition because we think it's extremely complementary to what we do on drug Discovery. And so I mentioned a little bit in my prepared remarks, but we think with Cisbio combined with our strength in some of the areas particularly around luminescence. And so we do a lot of work around luminescence. They have a very strong fluorescent portfolio of assays. Of course then when you combine that with our automation and detection, we can now go with a fully automated workflow whether it's reagents plates, automation detection information.","So all the drug discoveries and I had alluded to before, we're the only company now that can provide all three assay tests for on a homogeneous. So, whether you want to look at luminescence, whether you want to look at fluorescence, or whether you want to look at radiometric. So we think by combining our efforts with Cisbio's capabilities, we can accelerate the growth. And historically they've grown fairly well. So we think this business with PerkinElmer definitely gets into the high-single digits maybe even a little bit better than that.","The other aspect I alluded to is I think you know well, we have a very strong imaging portfolio whether it's high content or whether it's in vivo. But generally up to this point we've been principally around in instruments and software and no other firms so sell the cellular imaging reagents that go with our imaging instruments. While with Cisbio's technology and capabilities, we'll be able to expand in the cellular imaging reagents and consumables. And so, therefore, we'll be able to go to our customers with a package with the instruments software and the assays. And I think that further drives incremental growth between the two companies.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. And just a quick follow-up for Jamey. Could you help us with the impact of currency on the gross and operating margin lines? And any impact on EPS in the quarter?","Jamey Mock","Yeah. Gross operating margin, foreign exchange was probably about 20 basis points. And on an operating margin it was about 30 basis points with regards to foreign exchange.","Brandon Couillard","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Knight with Janney. Your line is now open.","Rob Friel","Paul, we can't hear you.","Paul Knight","Hey, can you hear me now, Rob?","Rob Friel","Yes, Paul. How are you?","Paul Knight","Congratulations on your new IR person.","Rob Friel","I understand, he was trying to rob.","Paul Knight","Anyway. Hey, Rob can you talk about China. I mean you were one of the early innovators there with SYM-BIO. Is that -- can you also talk about your M&A pipelines specifically in that market? And my next question would be your U.S. penetration now in Diagnostics with your broader product line? Thanks.","Rob Friel","Yes. So why don't I take the China discussion I'll pass it over to Prahlad on the U.S. and I assume you're talking mostly with EUROIMMUN on the U.S. penetration? But as you pointed out, we were fairly early in the China market. SYM-BIO brought us some terrific distribution capabilities and then we've added with high wound blood screening in a number of other areas. So -- and of course EUROIMMUN brings a very strong capability in China.","So I think first of all looking at the diagnostic side, we feel very good about our capabilities. We continue to look for opportunities from an inorganic perspective to add to that and we invest a lot of time and effort in that regard. And I guess I would say stay tuned on that one.","Where we've been a little bit more active recently is on the DAS side. And as you saw over the last sort of year or two, we've been adding some assets on the analytical instruments side. We're looking very active in the applied markets like for areas like food and other areas that are higher growth areas and I'd say very active there and hopefully we'll have something to talk about maybe later this year.","Let me turn it over to Prahlad maybe he can talk a little bit about the EUROIMMUN penetration in the U.S.","Prahlad Singh","Yeah. Thanks, Rob. And Paul I think EUROIMMUN continues to do well in the U.S. As I mentioned they got two approvals on celiac markers this quarter. They continued to grow well, they had a major lab victory, which will not only give them instrument penetration but also continued asset penetration over the years. They grew low double digits in the first quarter and we see very good traction for the rest of the year.","Paul Knight","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thanks. This is Dan [ph] on for Bill. First on Tulip, it sounds like growth was strong in the quarter. I think you said double digits. Could you just provide an update there? And then any insight on new offerings as well? Thanks.","Prahlad Singh","Yeah. Tulip, again as you said it continues to do well, they had double-digit growth and their pipeline is growing both not just in India, but we are also looking at how do we take the product portfolio out into some of the other emerging markets. So great traction there they had a very good 2018 and a very good start to the year.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks. And then I'm a millennial. So stereotypically, I'd ask about cannabis. Do you guys have any update on what kind of market opportunity you're seeing there?","Rob Friel","Yes. So you know we talked in the beginning of the year of the opportunity to probably double that business in 2019. And just a reminder, we did about $10 million last year. So we're -- got to go about $20 million and I would say we saw strong growth in the first quarter and we think we're on -- well on track to at least do $20 million in 2019.","Unidentified Analyst","Awesome. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Mitch Petersen","Hey. Thank you. This is actually Mitch Petersen on for Jack this afternoon. So pretty good growth out of OneSource in the quarter I was just hoping you could unpack that for us a little bit. I know you're expecting to lap some enterprise wins there. And then, as we think about the balance of the year, do you think the high single-digit growth rate from 1Q 2019 is sustainable for the remainder of 2019? Thanks.","Jamey Mock","Hey, Mitch it's Jamey. Thanks for the question. So yes. I mean, OneSource is going as planned. So we still feel confident in the high single-digits for the year. As we mentioned before, we're looking at some tenders that we think could land in the second half maybe late maybe have an impact to that, but still feel good about it and I think no change in the overall guidance.","Mitch Petersen","Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just to confirm, it sounds like you pulled in half of what you expected from the U.S. government shutdown. Do you expect to recoup the other half of that in the second quarter?","Jamey Mock","Yes. That's right. It's a -- we got about half in the first quarter. So going back to Steve's point and some of the questions around DAS mid single-digits in the second quarter we get -- that we expect some of that -- the second portion of that to come in the second quarter, which also helps give confidence to mid single-digits for DAS in the second quarter.","Mitch Petersen","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Luke Sergott","Hey, guys. This is Luke on for Ross today. Just real quick a couple of housekeeping ones. Did you break out the -- by your expectations for guidance by segment? I think I missed that one.","Rob Friel","Expectations for Q2? Or for the year?","Luke Sergott","Yes. For 2Q.","Jamey Mock","No. No. We didn't give the expectations for 2Q. But I think generally speaking probably high single-digits for Diagnostics mid single-digits for DAS is the way to think about 2Q.","Luke Sergott","Okay. That's great. And I guess on the just sticking with the Diagnostics growth and how strong it's been over the last couple of quarters, how much of that is due to strong market conditions and just high-growth markets speaking of immunodiagnostics et cetera? And how much of that is really your expanding portfolio and kind of everything starting to come together for you guys?","Prahlad Singh","I think it's a combination of both. If you look at it from the reproductive health perspective, I think despite strained growth rates we have expanded the business and that's happening because we are adding new test menus with lysosomal disorders and NeoBase two approvals that have come through. And similarly, on the applied genomics side and EUROIMMUN, we see good traction for those product portfolio in emerging markets. So I think it's a combination of both.","Luke Sergott","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Savi [ph] on for Derik today. Thank you for the questions. So first question is for the applied market. So I know -- I appreciate the color provided so far, but then some of your competitors caught out some choppiness in the food market, particularly in China. Just wondering if you've seen any of that? If so, when can we expect that to go away? Thanks.","Rob Friel","Yes. I would say we probably saw some of that in China. But quite frankly, one of dynamics that are going on in the China market right now as you probably heard from our competitors as well is there is some shifting in testing going from government labs to more private-based labs. And a lot of these private-based labs do more than food. So they will test for environmental and they'll test for food and they may do other types of things. So quite frankly for our first quarter in particular, there may be noise in sort of was it environmental lab or was it a food lab. And so we're still trying to get better color behind that. But clearly, we've seen a little bit of a reduction in food testing as the shift has occurred from public labs to private labs. But we do think it's somewhat temporary and as we think about food for 2019, we expect it will continue to do strong growth in China.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, that's very helpful. Just a follow-up. I apologize if I missed it earlier. Just wanted to get more color on the pacing for the rest of the year. So, anything that we should think about for the rest of the quarters regarding organic growth and margin trends throughout the year just given the more difficult comps? Thank you.","Rob Friel","No, I mean as we think about the first quarter, it came in pretty much as we expected. And so we'd say that we think the year is going to play out pretty much as we expected which will be a little stronger growth in the back half. We talked a little bit about that earlier. So, we think our back half organic growth is probably in the 6.5%, 7% range.","And then as we think about operating margin expansion, we also think that's a little heavier in the back half. So, if you think about maybe 100 basis points or so in the first half and then stronger growth in the back half so that we average that 120 to 150 for the year. Again that's very consistent with what we talked about in January.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Brennan with UBS. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. This is Tim on for Dan. Would you be able to get a little more granular about your applied growth? I know it's low single-digits in the quarter but could you maybe give us a breakout of the industrial versus environmental versus food?","Rob Friel","So, industrial and environmental, we really don't sort of breakdown. And again part of that is it's becoming increasingly more difficult with our customer base is it really definitively defined what's being done on from an environmental testing perspective on what's been testing for other things. So, we've sort of put those together.","But if you look at industrial and food we think that was sort of low to mid-single-digits. And as I mentioned before food was down largely outside the U.S. U.S. is very strong sort of mid-teens.","And if you look at it from a geographic perspective applied was sort of mid-singles in Americas up sort of low to mid-single depending on how you consider the government control the product and Europe was down a little bit. So, low single-digits.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And could you talk a little bit about Cisbio just in terms of your overall M&A strategy going forward? Do you see other deals of this size kind of in the pipeline? Was this a particularly competitive deal? Is this an area where you think you might continue to focus? Just give us a little bit more color there.","Rob Friel","So, I would say generally our M&A strategy is sort of consistent with the overall company strategy which is we're trying to drive from an end market perspective into the more attractive end market for us which we think are life sciences food and diagnostics. So, those are areas that we think are very attractive because of the growth profile and also because we think we have some differentiated capabilities in those markets. We're also looking to continue to expand our capabilities globally. So, we've over the last couple of years been focused largely on emerging market growth.","And then I would say the third aspect of it is we want to continue to drive our growth into areas that facilitate a workflow. So, obviously, we sell instruments we want to continue to build out our reagent assay and consumable as well as our informatics. So, that's the fundamental larger strategy that we're focusing on.","Cisbio hit most, if not all those, obviously, provide a very strong capability in assays increased our exposure to the pharma and biotech market. And while they weren't significant in emerging markets, we think their capability combined with our distribution capability will be able to expand emerging market presence in the drug discovery space.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tycho Peterson","Hey thanks. Rob I guess on EUROIMMUN. I know you said double-digit growth. Can you just talk to how that compares to the full year guidance of 13% to 15%? And can you just maybe unpack China, Germany with the moderation versus U.S. and other emerging markets?","Rob Friel","Yes. So, EUROIMMUN pretty much came on track is what we expected. So, I would say EUROIMMUN when I think about the first quarter revenue was pretty much on. And we sort of mention this a little bit in the prepared remarks. We were pleasantly surprise on the operating margin side. They had a nice pickup in operating margin.","Some of that is probably timing, because they sold a little less instruments in the quarter - no, sold a little bit more. But we think a lot of it is just better cost focus and cost management. And so we're excited about that, because we think that is one of the big levers to margin expansion as we started thinking about 2019, 2020 and 2021. So I think that's good.","With regard to China and Germany, you're talking specifically for EUROIMMUN or for PerkinElmer?","Tycho Peterson","EUROIMMUN.","Rob Friel","Okay. So EUROIMMUN had another strong quarter in China, and it was up sort of mid-teens something like that. Maybe even a little bit better than that. I don't know Germany offhand. I can tell you sort of Europe was sort of mid-single.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then, on Vanadis, just curious about utilization at some of your early customers? And as we think about how many biochemicals within the labs have enough volume to achieve the \u20ac100 cost per test? Can you maybe just talk to how you plan to penetrate some of the lower volume labs?","Prahlad Singh","Yeah. Tycho, this is Prahlad. So the labs that we are focusing on right now, and obviously labs that have larger than, let's say, on average 5,000 tests, and that's where we are seeing a lot of interest coming in from. I think in some of the places or some of the countries where you would have lower volumes. We would probably look at either centralizing it to one lab there that could attract. And there are also facilities where we have our own labs. So that's in Kuala Lumpur or India or in the U.S. where we would look at putting Vanadis.","Tycho Peterson","Okay.","Jamey Mock","Tycho, just to clarify quickly it was high-single-digit EUROIMMUN in Europe.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then, just last one. It came out in the K. I think you guys had about a point benefit 1.3% organic growth from the ASC 606 switch last year. So as we think about that and the context of the underlying organic growth. Are you still comfortable with kind of the high-single-digit targets, that you put out there and the path to get there?","Jamey Mock","Yeah. We are, Tycho. And just to maybe explain that change last year. I mean the new revenue guidance enabled us to do some things operationally and commercially that we chose to do that was -- we are able to recognize revenue under 606 and we wouldn't have been able to under 605. But had 606 not coming around we still would have -- we just wouldn't have made those changes, and still had relatively the same amount of revenue growth year-over-year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Mike Sarcone","Hey, guys. This is Mike Sarcone on for Dan Leonard. Just a few questions on EUROIMMUN. You had mentioned you're targeting 50% market share in the U.S. by the end of the year. Can you just tell us where you're starting from in terms of market share heading into 2019, and then maybe your confidence level around getting to 50%?","Prahlad Singh","I think just to give you a sense, I think on -- and this is again just to be specific around the autoimmune screening business. We would say that we are somewhere around 30%. And with some of the new forays that we have made in the lab, we think that by the end of the year we'll get to about 50% autoimmune screening.","Mike Sarcone","Got it. And one more on EUROIMMUN. I think on the last conference call you said, you had in the U.S. about 50 tests approved. Where do you stand today?","Prahlad Singh","Yeah. I think we are slightly over 60 now.","Mike Sarcone","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Robert Friel for any closing remarks.","Rob Friel","Well, great. Well, first of all thank you for your questions and your interest in PerkinElmer. So we think we're off to a great start this year to continue to drive our mission and continue to create value for our customers, shareholders, and employees. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. Thanks again for joining the call, and I hope everyone has a great evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]","I would now turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Tommy Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Tommy Thomas","Thank you, Valerie. Good afternoon and welcome to the PerkinElmer fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings conference call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Prahlad Singh, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jamey Mock, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","If you have not received a copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com. Please note that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website until February 14, 2019.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon and also those in the SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future even if our estimates change, so you should not rely on any of today's forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date after today.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures.

To the extent, we use non-GAAP financial measures during this call that are not reconciled to GAAP in that attachment, we will provide reconciliations promptly.","I'm now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel. Rob?","Robert Friel","Thanks, Tommy, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to report that PerkinElmer had a strong finish to 2018 with reported revenue in the fourth quarter increasing 18% over Q4 of 2017 and adjusted earnings per share growing 22%, leading both the top and bottom line of our previous guidance.","Our revenue in the fourth quarter was $757 million, representing core organic growth of 7% excluding the impact from EUROIMMUN and our adjusted earnings per share was $1.18. These excellent fourth quarter results concluded the year in which we grew revenue and earnings over 20% relative to 2017, with reported revenue up 23% to $2.78 billion and adjusted earnings per share increasing 24% to $3.61.","In addition, core organic growth for the full year was 7% and 8% when considering the impact of EUROIMMUN, resulting in significantly better 2018 financial results than our original guidance in January of last year. We're obviously very pleased with this performance and believe 2018 will mark an inflection point in our revenue growth, profitability, and just as importantly, our ability to make an increasingly positive impact on the quality of life across the globe.","Reflecting on last year, we increased our operational execution across the Company, as the Discovery & Analytical Solutions organization has now matured its processes, leadership, and organizational structure and Diagnostics is becoming better integrated across the multiple acquisitions completed over the last few years.","In addition, both businesses are experiencing excellent traction on their respective initiatives to accelerate growth beyond current levels. Clearly the portfolio and organizational changes we have made over the last few years have dramatically changed the revenue distribution of our end markets we serve, as well as our capabilities, geographic reach, and product mix.","We entered 2019 with a much improved portfolio of businesses and a stronger organization that can better serve our customers, innovate breakthrough solutions, and infuse more simplicity into how we operate. Within Diagnostics, we've evolved from a business centered around the mother and child to a broader specialty Diagnostics provider due to our acquisitions of Tulip, Bioo Scientific, RHS, and EUROIMMUN, as well as breakthrough innovations now driving organic growth.","As a result, we now have leading positions in reproductive health, emerging infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and applied genomics, and have gained new technological skill sets across immuno and clinical chemistry, detection and automation, PCR, mass spec, NGS workflow and single cell genomics.","Last year, we received CE-IVD marking for our Vanadis product, which we believe will dramatically increase the accessibility to noninvasive prenatal screening for many more women. The performance of EUROIMMUN continues to be strong as the business achieved mid-teens organic growth in 2018 and exceeded our plan for operating income. Also, we continue to recognize greater opportunities that benefit from end leverage, the capabilities of EUROIMMUN and PerkinElmer, as well as identifying additional synergistic opportunities in reagents, instruments and new markets.","Finally, our product and services business targeted on genomics continues to expand capabilities and is experiencing strong market traction. With regards to innovation in new products, last year we generated over $67 million of incremental revenue from new product introductions, exceeding our target of $50 million and driving our vitality index from 28% to 32%.","During last year, we increased our R&D spending by $47 million to 9.4% as a percentage of product revenue, up 20 basis points versus 2017. This increased spending not only resulted in incremental revenue but also enabled us to strengthen our scientific and technical capabilities in the key areas of genomics, infectious disease and digital, with most of our new R&D hires in these disciplines.","Also during 2018, we continue to access disruptive technologies, executing seven key collaborations in equity investments, further accelerating innovation and access in some of our key growth areas, including reproductive health, and applied genomics, digital and pharmaceutical.","In life sciences, we focused our new product introductions in the areas of imaging, reagents and software, and entered 2019 with a much more contemporary lineup of products to serve our pharmaceutical, biotech and academic customers. In addition, we continue to expand our value-added services and IT offerings across one source, bringing new tools, solutions and capabilities to our growing customers - growing base of customers.","And within food analysis, we have extended our capabilities within food safety, research and quality, to address the rapidly growing demand for safe, healthy food, and credible science-backed cannabis-based products. Our broad portfolio allows us to serve as a complete food, cannabis and hemp science partner, with full lab solutions including our QSight technology.","We now have over $200 million in revenue in the food segment, with cross-PKI offerings, dedicated R&D resources, and focused market specialists. Through the acquisitions of Dani Analitica and China-based Spectrum Instruments, we rapidly expanded our footprint and technical capabilities in the core market of gas chromatography. Dani has critical software and essential technology to revitalize our GC portfolio gain share across several key market segments, including ag-bio, environmental and pharma quality.","The Spectrum acquisition provides a highly complementary atomic absorption product portfolio that fill the gap in the inorganic business for the high-growth China region, while also providing products directly into the local environmental, food, and industrial markets in China. Finally, we completed the divestiture of a quantitative pathology solutions business line to further streamline and focus our portfolio.","Over the last three years, we executed against the well-defined strategy to shift our portfolio across markets, customers and products. As a result of these changes, we enter 2019 with over 80% of our revenue in the diagnostics, food and life science end markets, up from 50% four years ago. With the environmental and industrial end markets now representing less than 20% of our revenue versus 45% in 2014.","From a geographic reach perspective, emerging markets now account for 40% of our revenue, up from 28% four years ago. Our product mix also has shifted significantly. In 2014 consumers - consumables, services and software accounted for 55% of our revenue. Today those products account for nearly 70%.","For 2019, we will continue this overarching strategy to leverage our global capabilities in detection, imaging, assays and software to deliver differentiated solutions in priority end markets. As we are already driving several opportunities to deal this in specific end markets that we believe will deliver above-market growth rates.","However, based on both our internal work, as well as work with external resources, we believe one of our greatest opportunities lies within the value that can be derived directly from intersections of our technologies and talent across end markets. We are clearly seeing the capabilities in applications that our customers are demanding by increasingly converging.","For example, advanced pathogen-detection capabilities, usually in Diagnostics, are readily applicable to the food safety market. The same is true in other areas such as genomics, informatics and mass spec, whether based on shared technology platforms, the use of analytics, and the need for service, digital solutions or the call for integrated seamless customer experiences.","Adding to this dynamic is the emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning for multiple uses in the life sciences, pharma, food and environmental testing, from detecting ingredient levels in crops to perfecting high-content screening. In recognition of these opportunities, we announced last month the appointment of Prahlad as President and Chief Operating Officer, to help accelerate and advance our capabilities from Diagnostics and DAS to better design, sell and service solutions in the context of our end markets. The new structure we begun to put in place will result in a more nimble focus and effective organization and we believe it poses a significant and unique advantage for PerkinElmer.","With that perspective, I've asked Prahlad to discuss how he's approaching the opportunities made possible by the convergence occurring across our end markets. We see this as a powerful growth accelerator and differentiator for the Company and I'm pleased to have him lead that charge in his new expanded role. Prahlad?","Prahlad Singh","Thanks, Rob. PerkinElmer has made tremendous progress over the past several years by expanding in key markets and geographies, driving innovation and improving how we serve our customers. As Rob mentioned, we announced a unique opportunity to increase our impact and the rate of our growth by more seamlessly pulling from the full suite of capabilities available across our organization to serve each customer we have regardless of their end market.","Over the next few minutes, I would like to describe how we think about this opportunity and how we will implement it, while continuing to drive our other key strategic priorities this year. Increasingly, solutions to critical problems within science and healthcare are converging. Our goal is to take full advantage of all of PerkingElmer's capabilities, insurance, consumables, software and services to create the most advanced solutions for our customers in the end markets we serve.","Despite just a handful of instances of these market synergies, within food, quality and safety, the shift among scientists and researchers to focus on molecular and genomics calls for capability that PerkinElmer has developed within both Diagnostics and DAS businesses. We are therefore no longer viewing food as an analytical business but rather as a broader market with multiple opportunities for our technological capabilities.","Or, if we look at our rare disease focused organizations, they are turning to genomic sequencing analysis to accelerate research and to guide drug development. In addition, precision medicine initiatives are employing informatics capabilities to harness big data and gain new insights on the development of lifesaving treatments. We are currently focused on reshaping our organization internally to leverage our capabilities across PerkinElmer so that we are better equipped to serve our customers and support our objectives to grow, innovate and simplify how we do business. This will require us to align our R&D and product management teams in a way that fully utilizes and integrates our capabilities, across businesses and geographies, driving collaboration and accelerating our pace of innovation. We will also ensure that our go-to-market strategy continues to provide a seamless value-add customer experience.","Critical to our success will be our ability to affect these changes, while ensuring we continue to focus on three key priorities: number one, providing an exceptional customer experience; number two, being recognized as a leader in innovation; and number three, making people and culture a competitive advantage.","Digitalization is a rapid in emerging macro trend that is a critical piece of our strategic priority around providing an exceptional customer experience. It will force us to evolve how we serve and can interact with our customers. In 2019, we will continue to improve our digital capabilities across the Company, while also reducing complexities so that we make it easier to do business with PerkinElmer. This simplify how we rally together to serve our customers. We will naturally be better able to meet their needs and adapt to their changing demands and new technologies.","Now, talking about innovation, let me think about the increasingly complex and critical challenges that our customers are facing, it calls for thinking and innovating differently. The first step is to increase our agility and speed to market for introducing new products. This requires both cross-company innovation and generating novel ideas that integrate our core capabilities.","With Vanadis and more recently with cannabis testing, our efforts to fully integrate total customer solutions in-house are paying dividends. We will drive more of these kind of breakthrough innovations by leveraging multiple internal capabilities from new markets. This will ensure that customers are turning to PerkinElmer first as a trusted and innovative partner.","Our third strategic priority is around our people and culture. Building upon our progress from last year, we continue to create an environment that enables our employees to work at their best. First, adopting more entrepreneur behavior and challenging the status quo; second, sharing knowledge and insights through collaboration and teamwork; and third, seeking opportunities to develop skills and capabilities, as well as cross-business and cross-functional career moments.","As more parts of the Company work closer together, identifying and making these opportunities possible should become easier. I'm excited about the opportunities in front of us and look forward to sharing the progress we make with you during the year.","Thank you. And I'll now hand it over to Jamey to discuss our Q4 and 2018 financial results in more detail, as well as our 2019 guidance. Jamey?","Jamey Mock","Thanks, Prahlad, and good evening everyone. I want to start with the financial highlights for the fourth quarter of 2018. Next I'll provide some additional color on our served end markets and detail on other financial metrics. I'll finish with a financial summary of our full year results and provide assumptions for our 2019 guidance.","Turning to the fourth quarter results. We continue to be pleased with the strength in our business as core organic revenue, excluding EUROIMMUN, grew approximately 7% of our toughest comparison in 2017. Adjusted revenue in the fourth quarter grew 18% to $757 million, beating our revenue guidance of $745 million, driven by 2% higher organic growth. Net acquisitions grew approximately 13% and foreign exchange negatively impacted revenues by 2%.","By business segment, Diagnostics representing approximately 40% of total core sales grew 13% organically, driven by our reproductive health and immunodiagnostics business lines. Incorporating EUROIMMUN, Diagnostics would have grown 14% organically.","Discovery & Analytical Solutions representing approximately 60% of total sales grew 5% organically in the fourth quarter. It's most difficult comparison in 2017, highlighted by well-balanced strength in both life sciences and applied end markets. I will provide some additional color on both businesses in a moment.","Core revenues saw growth in all major geographies with double-digit organic revenue growth in the Americas, high single-digit organic revenue growth in Asia, and low single-digit organic revenue growth in Europe. This represents six consecutive quarters of organic revenue growth in all major geographies. The emerging market regions now represent approximately 40% of total sales and we continue to see double-digit organic revenue growth there, driven by broad-based strength.","Moving to the details of our operational performance in the fourth quarter. Adjusted gross margins were up 190 basis points to 51.4%. Operating margins expanded 60 basis points in the fourth quarter to 21.7%, driven by improved adjusted gross margins which helped offset increased investments in research and development.","Additionally foreign exchange had a 20 basis point negative impact. Excluding the impact of these additional investments and foreign exchange, our operating margins would have expanded 120 basis points. As Rob mentioned, adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 was an increase of 22% versus the fourth quarter of 2017 and was $0.02 better than our guidance in October. The beat was comprised of $0.03 from favorable incremental margins on higher organic revenue growth and $0.02 from a lower tax rate partially offset by $0.03 from extra growth in investments in R&D.","Looking further into the key drivers within our segments for the fourth quarter of 2018, let's starts with our Discovery & Analytical Solutions business. Our results were driven by balanced mid-single digit organic revenue growth in both life sciences and applied market verticals. Life sciences was driven by continued strength in our imaging detection product lines and informatics. We also saw high single-digit growth in the academic end market benefiting from a favorable prior period comparison. We experienced solid growth in the quarter from applied markets, driven by high single-digit growth in environmental mid-single-digit growth in food and low single-digit growth in industrial.","Switching to Diagnostics. As mentioned in my earlier remarks, core organic revenue grew 13% driven by our reproductive health business and immunodiagnostics. Within reproductive health the core business grew high single digits and our genomics testing business grew by 50%. The portion of genomics testing related to our sequencing business finished its first-year with revenues approximately $10 million and we continue to see solid pipeline of opportunities heading into 2019.","We are pleased to have received CE Mark for Vanadis and placed nine systems at key customer sites in 2018. Core immunodiagnostics was led by strong performance at Tulip and in our China business. EUROIMMUN had a strong close to the year with 16% organic revenue growth. Geographically, high incidence rates had helped China and Germany experience mid-teens-plus organic revenue growth. Looking at below-the-line items, adjusted net interest and other expense for the fourth quarter was approximately $14 million and our adjusted tax rate was approximately 12% driven by discrete items.","Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion of debt and $163 million of cash. We exited the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.9 times and we feel like we have the capacity to look at sizable deals again in 2019. From a capital allocation standpoint, we completed the acquisition of Dani Analitica in Italy for $52 million, and we repurchased approximately 650,000 shares of stock in the fourth quarter at an average per share purchase price of $80. Adjusted free cash flow of $132 million in the quarter saw strong sequential and year-over-year improvement, representing a 100% of cash net income.","Turning to the full year results. We are very enthused by our performance. The shape of the portfolio transformation and our organic growth potential which resulted in 7% organic revenue growth and 24% adjusted earnings-per-share growth. As we reflect on our initial 2018 guidance of 4% to 5% organic growth and $3.50 of adjusted earnings per share, we're extremely pleased by the execution of our teams throughout the year. Greater organic growth of 2% to 3% and an improved tax rate of an additional $0.35 which was partially offset by $0.24 from foreign exchange headwinds, extra interest expense, mild share dilution and increased strategic investments.","Looking ahead to 2019. We continue to believe that we are well positioned to drive solid organic revenue growth and provide strong financial results for our stakeholders. For the full year 2019, we forecast organic revenue to grow 6%. We expect reported revenue for the year to be approximately $2.89 billion, including $52 million from foreign exchange headwinds and no impact from mergers and acquisitions. We are forecasting $4 to $4.05 in adjusted earnings per share for 2019, up 11% to 12% versus 2018 with foreign exchange impacting the year by negative $0.04, predominantly in the first half.","Implicit in this guidance is adjusted operating margin expansion of 120 basis points to 150 basis points, $53 million in interest and other expenses and a tax rate of 16%. We expect our share count to be approximately 112 million. We forecast adjusted free cash flow conversion to be greater than 95%. For the first quarter of 2019 we are forecasting reported revenues of $643 million representing 4% organic revenue growth, including a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $27 million versus the comparable prior period.","In terms of adjusted earnings per share guidance we are forecasting $0.66. Due to the impact of the US government shutdown on the approval processes for an export-controlled products. We are forecasting a transient headwind of 2% organic revenue growth and $0.03 of adjusted earnings per share in this guidance. Excluding this impact and a $0.02 foreign exchange headwind, adjusted earnings per share would be up approximately 13% and our organic growth rate would have been up 6%.","Before I open the call to questions, I want to introduce Bryan Kipp as our next Vice President of Investor Relations effective tomorrow. Bryan has spent a lot of time in the life sciences space and we're excited to have him on the team. His background on equity research and as an investor brings a unique perspective which will serve all of our stakeholders well.","Thanks again to Tommy for his great six years and pulling double dutied for the last three months. This concludes my prepared remarks.","Operator, at this time, we would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Arias of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Daniel Arias","Afternoon guys, thanks. Congrats. Thanks. Congratulations on the strategic IR hire that you made there. Rob, on Vanadis, can you just talk a little bit about the early days of the commercial launch and then what your revenue assumption is for the outlook? And then, maybe just with respect to additional data in publications, are those something that we should look for this year? I think, the Rhode Island study finishes somewhere around mid-year. So do you think you'd see something like that coming out in 2019?","Robert Friel","Let me start and maybe Prahlad can jump in as well. So I would say, early start to Vanadis continues to go very well. I would say for 2019, our outlook is really to get 30 installations in with the customers. We'll be in a little bit less specific on the revenue and Dan I think we've talked about this in the past. We're going to see how the ramp occurs. There's a couple of variables we're still trying to figure out. How many of the customers are going to do reagent rental versus capital purchases, what the ramp will be. And so I would say, we're focused right now on getting installations. I'd say right now I think there is 10, we're in the process I think of putting 11 million and 12 million, so we feel pretty good about that.","The publications we expect probably midyear, but I would say that it continues to be very high interest level in it? So I don't know if anything you want to add to that, Prahlad?","Prahlad Singh","Yeah, the only thing I would add Rob is that, Dan, the publication from the CE Mark data that should be out by the middle of the year in the process of submitting it. The Rhode Island study that you referred to, you'd probably see abstracts and presentations of that in the second half of the year rather than actual peer-reviewed publication.","Daniel Arias","Okay. And then maybe on the DAS side, it looks like you're pushing higher there than you have been in the past as well. Can you just kind of talk about maybe the confidence that you have for some of the new products and the things that are helping you there being the ones that make a 5-plus percent organic growth level, something that has a multiyear runway if that is in fact the way that you're looking at it.","Robert Friel","Yeah, sorry, we thought this as - I think a lot of that is just the business is executing much better. We've got a fair amount of training with the sales force and I think it's just the maturing of the processes. The other benefit we see is, we have come up with a fair amount of new products more recently. So if you remember Dan back in '17, we came out really more on the analytical side with inorganic portfolio. In '18, we out with a number of products in the life sciences particularly in the imaging area.","One maybe I'll highlight in particular is our Lumina, both X5 and S5 is enabling high throughput in vivo imaging. Its high throughput, its multi-modality, it's a complete solution. And so in the imaging area, in particular, we're seeing very good traction there and we feel good about that. I would say that the last thing I'd maybe mention is, we've also over the last probably 12 to 18 months introduced a lot of reagents and I'll say non-rad agents and that's also driving a fair amount of growth. So I think we feel good about the long-term prospects for DAS, and like you said, I think, 5% seems like a sustainable level for us.","Daniel Arias","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. I want to start with maybe EUROIMMUN in the quarter. I think you guys have guided to $102 million which would imply about 53% contribution to the DAS, but it looks like it came in a bit lower around $85 million. Can you just kind of confirm that? And then any update there on driving synergies with DAS, I think, in terms of cross-selling and automation and some of these things you've talked about.","Robert Friel","Yes, I think, first of all, EUROIMMUN, we think had a very good quarter. I think Jamey mentioned it's like 16% or something like that. We're looking for a little higher revenue and that was something I think we mentioned back before, there's been one order that really is a minister of health at a country. And I think as we talked about before, one that over time, then there were some discussions about bundling that in a particular quarter. We thought that was going to be in the fourth quarter. It looks like that order now is going back to sort of over a period of time.","And so, we haven't lost that order. It's just a question of, sort of, as you can imagine there's been a fair amount of volatility in that situation there. And so it looks like now it's going to be spread out over a number of quarters rather than sort of a lump-sum. And that's really what would happen in the quarter and why rather than $102 million it came in I think closer to $97 million or something like that, but continues to do well. We're seeing good traction across all their end markets.","On the synergy side, Tycho, I think we continue to see increasing opportunities whether it's on the detection and imaging side, whether it's on the assay side. I would just give you one maybe data point. For Vanadis, we use I think it's 10 enzymes. And we asked the EUROIMMUN people to take a look at it. It looks like they can produce 9 out of 10 internal to EUROIMMUN. And obviously, in addition to being supplier within PerkinElmer, it looks like it can dramatically reduce our cost and improve the performance. So it's just another instance of where the more we learn and work with EUROIMMUN, we see greater opportunity across PerkinElmer to benefit both our existing products, as well as potentially new products and new market applications.","Tycho Peterson","Right. And then a follow-up on Vanadis, two quick parts. First, what is it taken your view to kind of penetrate non-Perkin customers in Europe? I mean, obviously there's an upsell to your existing customer base which kind of move beyond that. Can you talk about what you need to do? And then, in the US, if we do get kind of the expansion, the guidelines, for NGS and the average risk, do you think that represents a potential headwind, I guess.","Robert Friel","Yes, I think the thing we've got to do right now Tycho is really get the publications out. I think it's really getting people sort of to understand the sensitivity of it and the performance of the products. I think if we can get that, I think, given the ease-of-use, given the cost, I think we'll be able to penetrate non-PerkinElmer biochemical customers.","Prahlad Singh","And just add to that Rob, especially in the US Tycho, the question that you asked, I think if it does if and when it does go leverage, this we actually see Vanadis as a potential advantage because the focus there is going to continue to be on 13, 18, 21 and cost and I think those are specific advantages that the Vanadis technology brings to the plate.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Luke Sergott","Hey, guys. This is Luke on for Ross today. I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on some of these new product opportunities in the '19 and what you guys are baking in the guidance. Particularly like the QSight for cannabis, you gave a little bit of color on the Vanadis, but as you continue to roll out those products, how do you expect those to contribute to growth next year or this year and then kind of what's your expectations on the margin as it rolls out?","Robert Friel","So I will say on QSight in cannabis specifically, we think food for us is probably high single digits in 2019 as we sort of built into the forecast. And yeah, I would say the QSight as well as other product opportunities within whether it's Perkin or Delta et cetera sort of contribute to that high single digits. So but I think carve out individual products, I would say, the cannabis opportunity as well as some other opportunities we see globally gives us the confidence to say food probably grows high single digits for us.","On the margin side, you wanted just specifically about that product or just generally margins?","Luke Sergott","No just generally on the margins as the new products kind of roll through and then you kind of get the uplift if you - as you were talking about the consumables being a large launch last year.","Robert Friel","Yeah, so - clearly the new products in '18 are built into the 120 basis points, 150 basis points of 2019 growth. I would say, the probably next big margin opportunity for us from a new product perspective is probably doesn't kick in until late '19 or early '20 and I would say that from Vanadis as Vanadis scales, that goes from a product that was negative in '18 probably will continue to be a drag in '19 but becomes a positive contributor in '20 and similar on the genetic testing business. As that ramps up and that volume is up, it probably gets positive in '19 but probably becomes an accretive margin contributor in '20. So I'd probably spike up those two is the biggest contributors.","I don't know, Jamey anything you'd add there?","Jamey Mock","No.","Luke Sergott","Okay, great. Thanks. And then, I guess, you're talking about your [indiscernible] you guys are able to do something larger strategically on the M&A front. Kind of how you bake in the opportunities out there given all of the volatility in the public markets and kind of what you guys are seeing?","Robert Friel","So first of all, with regard to the M&A activity, two things. I think Jamey mentioned the fact that because of our capability we'll probably be doing a little bit more. Obviously, 2018, I think we did deploy maybe $100 million or so as we wanted to pay down the debt from EUROIMMUN. So I think hopefully we'll be a little bit more aggressive from a size perspective.","I would say the other thing is, we'd like to do more in DAS. If you look at the number of transactions that we did over the last two or maybe even three years was mostly on the Diagnostics side. Some of that was because we were putting DAS together. And as I mentioned, trying to get the maturity of the process into the leadership and the organization. So hopefully as we move into '19, we'll see a little bit more from an M&A perspective and it'll be more balanced between both DAS and Diagnostics.","Luke Sergott","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Steve Willoughby","Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Actually I have two. First, I was wondering if you can provide a little bit more color on the transient impact comment you made regarding the government shutdown. And then secondly, you guys did about 7% organic growth here in 2018 and you're guiding to 6% I believe you said.","I'm just trying to figure out what slows given whatever revenue Vanadis does generate, it's going to be all incremental and EUROIMMUN will be in the comp now which should add about 100 basis points genomic services business should continue to grow and add to organic growth. So what gets you to go from 7% this year down to 6% in 2019? Thank you.","Robert Friel","So let me start on the transient. So we actually have a product that I would say because of its sensitivity and versatility and I would say unique product features has so many - it requires a license because what I'll define as national security consideration. And I prefer not to go into a lot more than that other than again just sort of talk about the fact that this is a product that has the ability to look at atomic mass units, individual atomic mass units. And so consequently, it requires a US government export license and because of the shutdown for whatever 35 days things are - were concerned that things will be a little backed up there.","And so we think some of that revenue for that product pushes out from Q1 to Q2. We'll see obviously we've been open for all about a week. We'll see how quickly we get those applications through the government, but we just thought it was prudent to call that out and sort of adjust our Q1 guidance accordingly. But let me be clear though. This is not revenue that will be lost. This is revenue that will just move potentially from Q1 to Q2. So if in fact we do not get the 2% revenue boost because of this product, it will just move into Q2.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. Thank you.","Robert Friel","Okay. The second question you asked is sort of guide for 6%, and I would say you could probably put it into three categories and I would put it in a classification as we're trying to be prudent here relative to what we see as we think about 2019. First of all, we had very good growth in the pharma life sciences area in 2018 and we think that moderates particularly as you get into the back half of '19. And one of the reasons for that is we've seen - in 2018, we had a very nice ramp up in OneSource. There are some opportunities in OneSource for '19, but they have a tendency to be in the latter part of this year. And so we don't know that they'll have a material impact on 2019. So I'd say that's one area.","We have sort of dialed back a little bit on the industrial side. The industrial and environmental side that grew sort of mid-single digits for us last year and we're assuming that's probably a little lighter in 2019.","And the third area is China for us, again grew double digits. If you recall in 2018, in the beginning of 2018, we were concerned that that would moderate the high single digits. It actually did not and so that was one of the upsides we saw in 2018. As we say in 2019, we think it's prudent to plan China at high single digits and again we'll see what happens. But that's fundamentally what's driving 6% versus the 7% in 2018.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Steve Beuchaw","Thanks for the time. First, I'd love to get your recap if you will of what you're hearing from your customers who have adopted the Vanadis system. I guess, number one is, what do you think is a reasonable expectation fully deployed for the number of samples that can go through one of these samples or one of these installs? And the second part of the Vanadis question is, how do you imagine that the labs which are presumably broader reproductive health labs take on the system, integrate it into the workflow and then deploy it into the catchment of people whom they serve?","Robert Friel","So, Steve, I'm going to ask Prahlad to speak about the Vanadis.","Prahlad Singh","Yeah, Steve, so the initial feedback from our customers has been very positive. In fact, the first two units which we had put in as RU units or research use units have now - those customers have taken on and converted into CE-IVD units and have transitioned it on to routine clinical use.","And part of feedback that we are getting from our customers is the ease - not just to ease of use but also the way that they are used to sharing the data and the results with their constituents are easy because it's the same life cycle software that we were using for our biochemical screens on maternal and fetal health. So the end result is that the customers are seeing the same report out as they would for the biochemical. So overall the feedback has been very good. The clinical data and the response that we are seeing is equal to if not in some cases better than what they see for the NGS customers.","Steve Beuchaw","So I want to press on that a little bit. I'm sure that these customers are in areas where they're probably using more expensive technologies to try to get the similar results. Do you get the sense that they want to convert or is this all incremental?","Prahlad Singh","In fact, these customers they are using biochemical screening. And these are the - well, two customers who have switched from biochemical to Vanadis technologies. As you know, in Europe, each country has its own reimbursement policies. And in these two countries, one is on the public side and one is on the private side. They have switched from biochemical to Vanadis.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay. And to tie up your - sticking with the theme of new products and new initiatives, I wonder, if you could give us a view on what your assumption is for EUROIMMUN growth for 2019. And any color on what the backlog looks like for the sequencing in the genetics lab would be great? Thank you so much.","Robert Friel","So I would say for 2019, we're assuming Vanadis - I mean EUROIMMUN is very similar to what we assume going into 2018, which again is consistent with what we did in the acquisition model. And again, if you recall Steve, this was a business that sort of grew in the high teens. We said for purposes of the modeling, for assumptions, we were assuming something in the sort of 13% to 14% range and so that will be consistent. The backlog for the testing lab, I don't know, Prahlad...","Prahlad Singh","Yeah, actually the backlog for the testing lab is very healthy. Earlier we've shared that - the lab - the information systems, the internal software that we are using for LIMS. We have completed the beta testing and that will be fully operational into the lab at the end of the first quarter, early second quarter, and that has sort of allowed us to scale it at a much higher level than it is, but the backlog is very healthy.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay. Thanks you very much. Have a great night, guys.","Prahlad Singh","Thanks Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Brennan of UBS. Your line is open.","Daniel Brennan","Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first question is just - I was hoping you can just kind of break down what's implied for growth kind of in 2019 as we think about DAS and Diagnostics. And within DAS, can you give us a little color. I know you've already talked about maybe pharma and industrial moderating a bit, but can you give us some color on the different customer groups and how you expect them to fair?","Robert Friel","So I would say for 2019, we're assuming DAS does sort of mid-single, so called 5-ish, and we're thinking Diagnostics does high single and call that sort of 8-ish. Those are the numbers out, we're sort of assuming in the 6%. With regard to the various groups, as I mentioned before, we think pharma moderates a little bit. If you look at 2018, we did 8% in pharma and we think that comes down a little bit, maybe 100 basis points or something like that. As I mentioned, food, we think continues to high single digit, driven to some extent by cannabis.","So as I mentioned before, I think, our assumption is that industrial and to some extent environmental sort of moderates a little bit, where that goes from sort of mid-single digits to low single digits. That's sort of the composition of DAS.","Diagnostics, I already mentioned what EUROIMMUN does. I think we're saying reproductive health in sort of high-single digits, mid-single digits, probably in the 7% range, something like that, and applied genomics, probably mid-single digits. And then the immunodiagnostics for PerkinElmer as compared EUROIMMUN is probably high-single digits.","Daniel Brennan","Great. And then maybe can you just on your EUROIMMUN, Rob, so you're guiding for the same growth, I guess, that you started that kind of in the M&A model. But can you just give us an update on the US and kind of where you are with menu and I know at the time of the deal it sounds like over a period of time that can become a very large market. I'm just wondering how is that coming so far and kind of what are you incorporating for 2019 for US in the various regions within your EUROIMMUN growth? Thanks.","Robert Friel","Yeah, first of all, I'd say, the US is performing well. It had very strong growth in 2018 for relatively low base. I would say that our marketing efforts and the FDA approval process continues to go well. I think, at last check, we have about 50 assays that are now approved in the US. And I don't know there's another 12 or 13 in the pipeline or something like that. So we continue to be very bullish on the US side. And like I said, I think the integration is going well. We've trained the respective sales forces. We've moved over the service engineers, so now we're providing our service on EUROIMMUN products. So I would say, yeah, we feel very good about the opportunities in the US.","Daniel Brennan","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Your line is open.","Doug Schenkel","Hey, good afternoon. I wanted to dig it on margins a little bit more. So first, starting on the performance in the quarter. DAS operating margin went from 20.8% to 20.2% year-over-year. Diagnostics went from 30.4% to 28.9% year-over-year. So segment margins moved down in a period of robust revenue growth, yet overall margin increased year-over-year albeit not to guidance levels. So I was just hoping you could unpack that a little bit. Talk about what happened with segment margins? What were the not segment adjustments and did you pull some investment forward into the quarter? So that's the first thing, just recapping the quarter.","Then second, as we turn to next year, 120 basis points to 150 basis points of margin improvements, a pretty big tick-up relative to what we've seen from you recently. Can you just walk us through the components of how you get there?","And then longer term, and this is the third part, earlier this month, you reiterated guidance for 22% operating margin in 2020. Again we're building off of 19% in 2018. What type of growth do you need to generate this year and next to get to that level of margin improvement? Thank you.","Robert Friel","So let me start and then I'll turn it over to Jamey to get - maybe a little bit more into the specifics. But let me address and I would say, this would apply to sort of Q4 as well as 2018. And so when I think about margins and let me do it relative to our plan and our guidance for 2018. So if you recall back in - beginning of 2018, we've said 4% to 5% organic growth, 70%, 90% of operating margin and $3.50 of EPS.","And as we go into the year, we - three things I would say we saw. One is, revenue was coming in better. Our tax rate, we realized was going to come down a couple of hundred basis points. And I would say, we continue to see fairly significant opportunities to invest for growth. So we made a fairly conscious decision to take that upside, both on the revenue and the tax and invest some of that in growth and we'll say higher R&D, R&D was up, in particular, in the latter half of the year and in selling and marketing and returned some of that in the form of higher EPS.","And to just give you a rough estimate, our investments in selling and marketing and R&D relative to the beginning of the year is up about $15 million and we beat EPS by $0.11, which is about $15 million. So if you look at the tax savings and if you look at the revenue, now there is some foreign exchange noise in there as well. But basically we took half of it and put it in growth and put half of it and put it in higher EPS growth. And so we ended the year beating EPS by $0.11 and accelerating our top line growth by 250 basis point and we feel very good about that.","The issue is that the geography on the P&L doesn't match up, because the investments that go into operating expenses offset the incremental revenue and impact the operating margin, but the flow-through on the tax obviously is below the operating margin line. So the way we thought about 2018 was to take the growth and the tax, invest it back, accelerate the organic growth rate. And like I said, the net result of that was a very strong EPS growth, beating by $0.11 and we believe accelerating the opportunities on the organic growth. You've seen that in '19 and you will continue to see that in '20.","So again to answer your question, how do we get to 120 basis to 150 basis points, Jamey can sort of take you through the specifics of that, but we do not anticipate doing that again in 2019 unless possibly we see another opportunity because our revenue is cranking up and we're going to be significant below the tax rate.","Jamey Mock","Yeah, maybe Doug, just to talk to the segments. If you look at DAS in the fourth quarter, as you mentioned down 50 basis points on out margin line, 40 basis points on the gross margin line. As we outlined at the end of the third quarter with the sale of Multispectral Imaging that had a 25 basis point drag to gross margins in the fourth quarter for us. And then we started to really ramp some of our production in China and so that had a little bit of margin pressure as we ramp up there, which is what we experienced on a gross margin like. Rob spoke to some of the investments we made, so if you look at OpEx as we invest, we invested in sales force in food, cannabis and informatics and I think we're starting to night growth in those areas, so that are going to speeds the DAS.","If you look at DX in the way they drive, that's really a function of the EUROIMMUN mix year-over-year. So as you mix in EUROIMMUN at a lower margin rate, that's why we see a drop year-over-year, but EUROIMMUN did grow in the year nicely actually and beat the deal model by $0.06 to $0.07 actually on a year. If you look at the investment we are making in DX, we're investing in largely in APAC. So APAC sales, Tulip sales force and I think we've seen very nice growth in both of those area as well.","And I just kind of reiterate a little bit of what Rob said in terms of 2018 versus 2019. You know 2018, the way I think about is 40 basis points. If we look at what we know, what we normally say is we'd like to invest in sales and marketing kind of half of way to revenue, we want R&D to keep up with revenue. We need a lot of sales investing - sales and marketing investments in particular and even uptake the R&D a little bit as Rob mentioned at the beginning of the call here.","So that looks about 50 basis points of a drag and then foreign exchange with a 50 basis point drag this year. And I know that markets were kind of volatile. So if we exclude the investment in sales and marketing and R&D and foreign exchange, we think operating margins would have been up 140 basis points this year. Take 2018 and put that in the context for 2019, Rob already mentioned whether the gross margin lines hold up or anything is upside will continue to invest more than we normally do number one.","And then number two is, foreign exchange is kind of flip for us. So what is a 50 basis point drag this year is more like at least year-end planning rates at 20 basis points tailwind heading into 2019, so we feel pretty confident in being able to do 120 to 150 and will kind of mirror these investments as they come up and the opportunity as they're arrive and we see other areas that were excelling in like revenue or tax as Rob mentioned then we'll continue to invest otherwise we feel pretty confident in the current market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin","Hi, thanks. And Doug just took my margin question, so now I got to get creative. So can you talk a little bit more about the 13% core growth guide in the Diagnostics business this quarter and just sort of what was driving that a little bit more detail because it's just - was a much bigger step up than I would have thought, is it pull forward, but it will flus onetime risk, can you just give a little bit more on depth on that?","Jamey Mock","Yeah, it's a little bit higher than we anticipated in the quarter. We only talk about EUROIMMUN coming at in $97 million versus $102 million, let me talk about that. But in the quarter, it was a little higher and as they came in two areas, one is reproductive health, we mentioned low double-digit growth but breaking that down further reproductive health is made up of genomic testing business which we continue to grow and expect to go at very high rates that grew 30%. But even the core business so kind of neonatal, prenatal et cetera grew high single-digits and we were - we throughout the year we've seen mid-single-digits and that we were kind of planning. So we don't know of any flush or pull in or what not, but it's a relatively small business, so you know or it's about $100 million business, so 2% to 3% is $2 million to $3 million, could that happen maybe but not sure.","The other area the kind of was strong for us was Tulip. As I have mention we've been investing in additional feed on ground there and marketing efforts and Tulip grew I think over 20% in the fourth quarter. So those two areas grew the core for us. And then the last thing is the genomics testing business that's doing extremely well. So I mentioned I think in my prepared remarks that we were almost $10 million and we were $5 million through the first three quarters. So that obviously had a nice uptick for us here in the quarter.","Derik de Bruin","So can I unpack that one a little bit and just can you talk about a little bit demand that you're seeing sort of like what the project backlog is? And just - I'm sort of curious about the sort of projects you're doing. And also since, I don't know if you're bidding on or you're winning contracts for whole human genome, but I'm just sort of curious about how you're competing in that market given there are a lot of larger players out there. So just a little bit more color on that I think would be useful.","Prahlad Singh","Yeah, so - this is Prahlad. I think the two aspects to the growth in the genomics testing business we are seeing, one is around our partnership with the pharma businesses that are focused on rare diseases and that's where primarily we have a large - a couple of large contracts that we are actualizing and moving forward. And the second piece is more around the two aspects to it. One is around the confirmatory testing around newborn screening. More and more of these states as we gain traction with them that helps and on the neuromuscular disorder relationships that we have. So those are the three aspects that have added to it.","Robert Friel","I'll say one other thing and I get constantly corrected by the person who runs this business. So we have a tendency to describe this business as DNA testing. And in fact, we do some DNA testing, but what we also do is we do protein, we do biochemical, we do a lot of other things. And when you ask how do we compete with the larger labs? My understanding is, we are unique in the ability to offer that complete solution. And so a lot of instances, the reason why we win is because we're not just looking at DNA, we can look at enzymes, we can look at a lot of other areas, and that's differentiated in the marketplace.","Derik de Bruin","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Leonard of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Daniel Leonard","Thank you. A bit of a follow-up to Doug's question. Fourth quarter gross margins came in a little lighter than we were expecting despite the higher volume growth. Jamey, I think you touched on maybe a couple of the drivers. But could you maybe bridge for me what the gross margin plan was in Q4? What the variance was and maybe offer color on gross margins expectations for 2019? Thanks.","James Mock","Sure, yes. Hi Dan. I would say there were probably two key things, one we knew about and one that changed. So I mentioned the multispectral imaging sale and how that impacted gross margins in the quarter by 25 basis points and that's basically we have now - we're producing that product for the buyer, but we had a very thin margin on that. So our revenue has stepped down quite a bit and that's about 25 basis point headwind.","The other thing I would say changed in the quarter on us is, we sold a little less reagents in EUROIMMUN and have a little bit more instruments. So we guided $102 million for EUROIMMUN, it came in at $97 million. So $5 million and a 30% to 40% margin delta on that had an impact on our gross margin line. Otherwise we think it was pretty much in line with what we were anticipating.","And then for 2019, we continue to see - we believe that those should be a good - a large portion of this 120 basis points to 150 basis points OM expansion should come through the gross margin line, probably north of 100 basis points. And part of that is what Rob has continued to outline, wherein we've all continued to outline little bit of product mix incremental look better. I think we - as we said at JP Morgan, our incremental this year were at 26% and if we go up to 28% that should help us. And then a little bit of operating - well if operating leverage on the OEM line should get us the whole way there for the 120 basis points to 150 points.","Daniel Leonard","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Patrick Donnelly","Great, thanks. I appreciate the color on the EUROIMMUN growth side. Can you also just talk through the cost of margin side? I know that margins were significantly below Diagnostic's average, I think around 20%. So what are your expectations for 2019 and what are the biggest levers there? Is there anything outside of just pure volume leverage to do?","Robert Friel","Yeah, so - in terms of 2018 EUROIMMUN outperformed what we were thinking from a merchandise standpoint. So we went into new year thinking something like 19% to 20% and it's north of that at this point, let's call it, 21%. So it's done nice. It's definitely a lot driven by volume. But if we look at kind of the future here and what we can do, I think, we've been still pretty light touch from an integration and synergy perspective, so there should be a long way to go here in terms of margin expansion. As we compare that to the core business being more like a 30% OM or high 20s OM. There's obviously a lot of room here.","Baked into the guidance next year is something a little bit north of the 120 basis points to 150 basis points that'll - we will continue to get some additional leverage from your EUROIMMUN, but it looks good and it outperformed in this year.","James Mock","Yeah, I would say right now in our model, I think I talked about this in the past. For the first couple of years, we just assumed their margin expansion would be volume driven, so obviously they get leveraged on for their fixed cost. But I think now, owning it now, let's call it, 15 months or something like that, I think we continue to see significant opportunity to go in and maybe some - drive some synergies on the cost side and not disrupt the revenue growth. So I think as we get into 2019, we'll see opportunities, to sort of leverage, what they're doing on the R&D side. I mentioned the fact that the enzymes for Vanadis, there's a number of antigens, they could make for PerkinElmer and I think just on the material productivity and even on the commercial side. I think as we get into '19, we'll be able to do - we'll be able to drive some margin expansion beyond just leverage.","Patrick Donnelly","That's helpful. And then Jamey, just a quick one on capital deployment. I know you mentioned you're kind of thinking you can do big M&A this year, just below 3 times on leverage. Where should we think that you guys kind of max out on the leverage ratio there?","James Mock","I think we appreciate our investment-grade rating. So - but we've been willing to take up to a little over 3.5 times. So absent acquisition, we think we can get down to a net debt-to-EBITDA a little over 2 times and EBITDA should be north closer to $700 million here. So we'd probably have $700 million to $1 billion of firepower for next year.","Patrick Donnelly","Okay. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan","Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about geographically the Americas putting up double-digit growth, screening is pretty strong. Is that just a factor of where some of the new products and services are rolling out or can you talk about what you were seeing here in the US?","James Mock","Yeah, I mean, I think the US has been driven largely by - DAS has been strong, DX is also strong. But I'd say pharma biotech in the US, detection and imaging and enterprise was very strong across this year. I think Rob mentioned that. Some of our enterprise wins have been more in the US and have had a nice revenue growth for us in 2018. So that probably drove a little bit more of the uptick versus the rest of the regions.","Robert Friel","As Jamey alluded to, it's pretty broad-based. I think some of that is the new products. But I would say if you look across a number of end markets, we're seeing good growth. The other one, not a big driver though, obviously cannabis is fundamentally all North American. So that's a driver as well.","Jack Meehan","Great. And one just clean up on the capital deployment. I'm assuming your guidance doesn't build in any share repurchase with the $112 million share count. So you're just assuming that cash generation generates interest. How does that build into the guide?","James Mock","Yeah, exactly. Good question. So we right now do not assume share repurchase. We've assumed pay down of our debt and guided to this kind of EPS range. And any acquisition or share repurchase would have to be accretive. This is our kind of thinking here. So we've kind of modeled, like I said, nearly $112 million. We ended this year at $111.3 million. So obviously it will dilute up a little bit next year in our guidance but obviously that will change throughout the year as we see acquisition targets and look at potentially buying back shares.","Jack Meehan","Sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","William Quirk","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon everybody. A couple of quick ones here. Jamey, just a quick clean up. In terms of your comments, there is no M&A contribution in '19 in terms of - meaning that the overall guidance should be - revenue should be consistent organic versus FX neutral and such. So should we assume then that the impact of the Spectrum deal essentially offsets the quant pathology divestiture?","James Mock","Yeah, including the Dani deal. So we did a handful of small acquisitions this past year and the multispectral imaging taken out that revenue, and offsetting it with some of the other acquisitions, it's neutral to the year. That's the way to think about it.","William Quirk","Okay. Okay, got it. Perfect. And then, Jamey or Rob, just thinking about the first quarter '19 guidance, a little lower than the Street was expecting. Certainly I appreciate that there's a number of moving parts in terms of FX as well as the government's shutdown. Any other quarters or movements that we should be thinking about here throughout the year in '19?","James Mock","That maybe I'll start, Rob. So in terms of earnings, besides from this first government shutdown issue, our profile of earnings is not a lot different than what you'll see on a percentage basis that we did in 2018. So I'll start there.","And then in terms of the organic growth rate 4%, like I said, it would be 6% which is right in line with our guidance for the year. So we feel pretty good about that.","William Quirk","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brandon Couillard","Two housekeeping items for Jamey. First, can you speak to the spike in account receivables in the fourth quarter? Is that just seasonality? And then, can you help us with a CapEx number for '19?","James Mock","Sure. Hey Brandon. Yeah, I think cash was a little light here at the end of the year, all attributed to working capital. Inventory was kind of where we're starting to plan it to; had a little bit of uptick throughout the year, but that should normalize next year. Receivables, it just was a function of most of our sales in terms in shipments happened in the month of December. So an $80 million uptick was solely attributed to the fact that we shipped a lot in December and it should be collected mostly in the first quarter of next year. So we do anticipate that coming back next year. So that's first.","And then CapEx, I think - so CapEx, we're still planning on something like $80 million for next year. This year, we were up to something like $90 million, but next year I think we're starting - we believe we can start taking down EUROIMMUN. We've also invested in a lot of the planned transitions already. So some of those should come down, so I'd pencil that in, Brandon.","Brandon Couillard","Very good. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Catherine Schulte of Baird. Your line is open.","Catherine Schulte","Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Just first, you've talked about going to 7% to 9% top line growth in 2020. You've guided 2019 at 6%. So are you still confident in that high single-digit outlook and what gives you those extra two points or so of growth in 2020?","Robert Friel","Yes. I would say we continue to be confident in the high single-digit growth by 2020. And I think what gets us there is the number of, well, I guess what we're referring to as growth accelerators. So as we get into 2020, we expect Vanadis to start to step up nicely. The genetic testing business I think will continue to do well. I think in the food area broadly, and then maybe specific on the cannabis side, I think that provides a fair nice upside for us.","And I would say, the last thing maybe I'll mention is, we've got a number of new products particularly on the DAS side that probably comes out in the latter part of this year and early into 2020 and we think that can generate some additional demands as well.","Catherine Schulte","Okay. And then going back to new products, I recognized you don't want to give specific numbers for Vanadis or individual products. But what's your target for total new product contribution in 2019 versus the $50 million goal you...","Robert Friel","Yeah, I would say we're maintaining that number for 2019 as well. Like I said, we've got a number of new products that are sort of coming out later in the half of the - second half of 2019 and so we're maintaining the $50 million. And - but I would say, as we get into 2020, I think that number will sort of step up pretty nicely.","Catherine Schulte","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I will just turn the conference back over to Rob Friel for any closing remarks.","Robert Friel","All right. Well, thank you Valerie, and thank you all for your questions and interest in PerkinElmer. I look forward to updating you on the progress we're making as we take advantage of the numerous opportunities we see this year to both drive long-term growth and improve our profitability and increase the impact we're having on global health. Thanks everyone and have a great evening.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

My name is Whitney, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to host for today, Mr. Tommy Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Tommy Thomas","Thank you, Whitney. Good afternoon, and welcome to the PerkinElmer fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. With me in the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","If you have not received the copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com. Please note, this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website until February 13, 2014.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings.","Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future, even if our estimates change. So you should not rely on any of today's forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any day after today.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures.

To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during this call that are not reconciled to GAAP statement in that attachment, we will provide reconciliations promptly.","I am now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel. Rob?","Robert F. Friel","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report PerkinElmer achieved a very good performance in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, organic revenue grew 3% and expanded adjusted operating margins by 90 basis points, resulting in adjusted EPS of $0.73, a 12% increase relative to Q4 in 2012. Operating cash flow is also strong, increasing significantly over Q4 last year to $71 million. All of these financial metrics exceeded our expectations. And while it is rewarding to close the year with strong financial results, more importantly, we ended 2013 a stronger company.","During 2013, we made excellent progress on our productivity programs to rationalize our production footprint, shift production to lower-cost regions, better leverage our G&A expenses, and both simplify and strengthen our organization. In addition, we continue to make strides in expanding our capabilities into targeted, high-growth markets with a number of innovative new products launching in the first half of this year. We enter 2014 much better positioned to accelerate profitable growth and deliver innovative solutions to meaningfully improve human environmental health.","As Andy will describe our Q4 results in detail, I will focus my comments on our end markets and discuss our guidance for 2014.","Starting first with Diagnostics. Our specific end markets continue to be positively influenced by 2 major factors. The first is a desire by health care professionals to identify potential health problems as early as possible, because of both the clinical and economic benefits of early diagnosis. Second, the introduction of new technologies, products and analysis tools, particularly in emerging markets, is providing opportunities for us to leverage our knowledge and infrastructure. More specifically, we expect newborn screening to continue to expand into new markets globally, additional expansion of the newborn testing menus in certain geographies and noninvasive prenatal testing to grow sequentially as reimbursement trends improve.","In China, we continue to introduce new products, expand our product and service capabilities, and gain market share in the areas of infectious disease testing. For example, we won nearly half of the Chinese tender for nucleic acid blood screening last year, solidifying our position as one of the top 2 providers in China.","Due to our unique value proposition in emerging markets, our strong positions in newborn and prenatal screening, and the overall market expansion of these segments, we are forecasting our Diagnostic business to grow mid- to high single-digits in 2014.","In Life Science Research, market conditions are clearly better than a year ago. The certainty concerning the NIH budget should avoid the funding delays we experienced last year and its 3.5% budget increase will improve public spending on research. In addition, biotech companies are increasing R&D spending and we are seeing modest improvements in selected foreign accounts.","In addition to the improved market conditions, we introduced several new products this month and expect to launch several more midyear, which should provide incremental revenue growth. Two of the new products I'd like to highlight are the Opera Phenix launched at SLAS last week, which is a high content screening system using a proprietary technology, called Synchrony Optics, employing dual view confocal optics for significantly better speed and sensitivity by eliminating crosstalk between channels for 4 different markers simultaneously. In addition, we're introducing a multi-label slide scanner for research pathology, called the Lamina, that leverages our proprietary technology to reduce auto-fluorescence and improves the visualization of disease marker expression.","Based on the forecasted impact of our new products and the improved end-market conditions, we are forecasting mid-single digit growth for the non-rad portion of our life science portfolio, with continued headwinds from Radiochemicals, resulting in overall growth in our Research business of low to mid-single-digits.","In our Environmental end markets, overall conditions also seem to be improving, as capital expenditures in the developed world are recovering with PMI data in most of Europe at levels above the average for 2013, and continuing to indicate expansion. CapEx spending also appears to be improving in the U.S., but we are cautious given the likelihood of continued tapering by the Fed. We are also watching the implications of Fed tapering on certain emerging markets. However, we saw no impact in Q4, as growth continue to be double-digit. And to date, we have seen no signs of a decrease in order demand.","Looking at specific application areas. Food analysis continue to be an attractive market, as increasing regulation on food control and production and brand protection from adulteration is increasing demand for food testing mid- to high-single digits. The environmental monitoring labs continue to consolidate and restructure, but regional areas of growth exist through the new water regulations in Europe and increased air monitoring in China.","Demand from our industrial customers is largely tied to macro GDP growth. However, we do see opportunities for strong growth in materials research and testing applications, particularly in alternative energy.","Finally, we continue to see our pharma customers outsourcing non-core activities, providing significant opportunities for our OneSource business. Based on this outlook for end markets, combined with the introduction of the iQT mass spec and several other new products, we believe our environmental business should grow mid-single-digits this year.","A further contributor to our growth this year will be expanding the adoption of Spotfire visualization software. Recently, we introduced SciStream, which is a new configuration of Spotfire that allows direct collection of data from instruments, bypassing the need for additional programming. Initially, we are focusing this product on our line of plate readers, but eventually we will deploy the growth of the majority of instrument platforms, providing a significant competitive advantage to our detection and imaging products, and improving our customer's ability to visualize and analyze samples.","Turning to full year 2014 guidance for the company, we are forecasting organic growth of mid-single-digits for the full year, with slightly higher growth in the second half, due to the timing of new product introductions. As a result of the productivity projects completed last year, and the higher volume, we should experience a significant adjusted operating margin expansion and our forecasted adjusted EPS in the range of $2.40 to $2.45 which represents adjusted EPS growth of 15% to 18%. EPS growth should be evenly distributed throughout the year, as the slightly higher revenue growth in the back half is compensated by the easier comps in the first half. Also, I should mention that our financial guidance does not assume any impact from the deployment of capital.","Before I turn the call over to Andy to share more details on our 2013 results and 2014 guidance, I wanted to briefly mention our 3 key leadership objectives for the year.","The first is accelerating profitable revenue growth by executing on our strategic plans. This incorporates increasing our leadership position in key end markets by leveraging our capabilities in detection, imaging, informatics and service. Second is achieving sustainable, best-in-class quality by producing superior products and driving efficiencies in all our processes. And third is building employee engagement and organizational strength through collaboration and investing in our people.","We believe that engaging our employees in achieving these priorities will lead, not only to a very successful 2014, but will also be fundamental in fortifying the company for sustainable, long-term growth and shareholder value creation.","I would now like to turn the call over to Andy.","Frank A. Wilson","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our fourth quarter results and details around our Q1 and full year 2014 guidance, and then we'll open up the call for questions.","As Rob mentioned earlier, we were pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter. Reported revenue increased by 4%, while adjusted and organic revenue both increased by 3%. Adjusted revenue for the quarter was $594 million, as compared to $577 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. By segment, our organic revenue in Human Health business grew 4%, while organic revenue in our Environmental Health business grew 1%.","Looking at our geographical results. Organic revenue increased high single-digits in Europe and Asia, but declined low single-digits in the Americas, primarily the result of a difficult high single-digit year-over-year comparison.","We were pleased with our performance in China, as organic revenue once again increased double digits, despite a difficult year-over-year comparison of more than 20%. We continue to be encouraged by the demand trends for our key environmental and diagnostic offerings in China, which help address critical needs in that part of the world.","Looking at organic revenue growth by product category. Recurring revenue, which includes reagents, consumables and service, grew low single-digits in the quarter on a high single-digit organic growth comparison. Organic revenue for our instrument component offerings was at mid-single-digits in the quarter.","From an end market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 57% of reported revenue in the quarter. We serve two end markets in Human Health: Diagnostics, which represented 27% of reported revenue; and Research, which represented 30% of reported revenue.","Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business increased high single-digits during the fourth quarter, primarily driven by strength in our newborn screening and infectious disease solutions and our Medical Imaging offerings. As we guided on our third quarter earnings call, the Medical Imaging business returned to a mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in the quarter, and we saw strong demand from key customers in the oncology, diagnostics and industrial verticals.","Our Research business delivered low single-digit organic revenue growth from the fourth quarter versus the comparable period in 2012. We experienced solid demand in our In Vivo Imaging, Microfluidics and Radiometric Detection businesses, which were notable standouts in the quarter, with double-digit revenue growth.","Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represented 43% of reported revenues in the fourth quarter, we serve three end markets: laboratory services, which represent 19% of reported revenue; environmental and safety, which represented 17% of reported revenue; and industrial, which represented 7% of reported revenue.","As I mentioned earlier, organic revenue in our environmental health business grew low single-digit in the quarter, grew 1%, driven by continued strength in our lab services business. Organic revenue from industrial end markets grew mid-single digit, while environmental and safety revenue declined low single-digits.","Turning to our margin performance in the period. Adjusted gross margins were 49% as compared to 48.8% in the fourth quarter of 2012. We're beginning to realize savings related to the completion of our manufacturing consolidation and productivity initiatives, driving improved gross margins in the quarter despite foreign currency headwinds and our continued investments, primarily in software.","As a reminder, investments in Spotfire's software are charged to gross margin as opposed R&D and SG&A, and therefore negatively impacted adjusted gross margins throughout the year.","Adjusted operating margins in the fourth quarter were 19.2%, as compared to 18.3% for the same period a year ago. Restructuring efforts and recently completed productivity initiatives helped to drive profitability in the quarter.","By segment, adjusted operating margins in our Human Health business increased approximately 100 basis points to 24.9%, as compared to 23.9% in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase was primarily a result of positive product mix and the completion of a number of productivity initiatives.","In our Environmental Health business, adjusted operating margins increased approximately 60 basis points to 15.9%, as compared to 15.3% in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase was primarily the result of savings from our restructuring actions and operating expense controls.","GAAP operating income from continuing operations was $84.7 million in the fourth quarter of '13, versus an operating loss of $30.8 million in the same period a year ago. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of '13 were $0.58, compared to a loss of $0.14 in the fourth quarter of last year.","Recall that the fourth quarter of 2012 was negatively impacted by noncash charges related to pension mark-to-market and our trademark name rationalizations. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.73 in the fourth quarter of 2013, about $0.03 above the mid-point of our guidance range, on higher sales volumes and a lower tax rate. On a non-GAAP basis, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was approximately 18% versus our forecast of 21%, a result of the shift in jurisdictional profits.","Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the fourth quarter with approximately $930 million of debt and approximately $170 million of cash. We exit the quarter with a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.4x and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 2x.","Looking at our cash flow performance. Full year GAAP operating cash flow from continuing operations was $158 million, as compared to $154 million in 2012. Note that our 2013 full year cash flow results were negatively impacted by approximately $87 million of pension and royalty payments in addition to higher working capital related to productivity initiatives. These payments are not expected to recur in 2014. And given the completion of our productivity initiatives in 2013, we expect significantly higher operating cash flows for 2014.","As to 2014 guidance. Going back to Rob's earlier remarks on our served markets, and given the new products we expect to launch throughout the year, we anticipate adjusted revenue for the full year to grow organically mid-single-digits, or 4% to 6%, with the full-year impact from foreign currency being minimal. Given the timing of new product introductions, we expect growth to be slightly higher the second half of 2014, but both halves should grow mid-single-digits organically.","Regarding adjusted operating margins, the combination of the carryover productivity initiatives completed in 2013, of approximately 100 basis points, and incremental margins on 2014 revenue growth, will contribute approximately 160 to 180 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. Partially mitigating this expansion are higher variable compensation and benefit cost due in part to a higher stock price and lower prior year payouts, as well as higher growth investments in the back half of the year.","These costs in total are expected to negatively impact adjusting operating margins by approximately 30 to 40 basis points for the year. And as a result, we now expect operating margin expansion of at least 130 basis points for the full year 2014.","Interest and other expenses are expected to be approximately $43 million. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 21%. And our weighted average diluted share count is expected to be flat or approximately 113.3 million shares. As a result, we now expect full year earnings per share to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.45, representing mid- to high-teens earnings growth for the year.","Looking to the first quarter. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $525 million to $535 million. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of this year are expected to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.44, which represents growth of 17% to 22% for the quarter. The significant growth in EPS is a result of the impact of our prior year productivity initiatives, but will be impacted by the aforementioned compensation headwinds, currencies, specifically the Japanese yen, as well as the negative mix impact from lower informatics and medical imaging revenues.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe to start off, Andy and Rob, as we think about 2014 and the margin expansion is significant, that you're guiding to. However, just wondering, is 18% now kind of off the table, given some of the investments that you're looking to make in the back half of the year, plus in the variable comp?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I wouldn't say it's off the table. I think what we're trying to do is we guide where we think is sort of realistic and achievable. And I would think about it that if we see a little bit improvement on the top line and we get a little bit better mix, I think there's a possibility we can get there. But we don't think it's prudent to sort of guide to 18%. And as Andy said, we think we can get at least 130 basis points of margin expansion this year.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe on the environmental side. It was a bit weaker than we expected, human was stronger. Maybe can you just talk to, versus your own expectations, maybe how did environmental come in and maybe anything on pacing in the quarter that might give us some visibility on how it's shaping up as you look in to kind of '14?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. So I would say, when we reflect back in 2013, and particularly in environmental, as you know we had a lot of focus around improving our cost structure, particularly on the manufacturing side and the back office. And while I feel great about how we did relative to making all those moves from the standpoint of very minimal customer disruption, I think in hindsight, one of the areas we're probably impacted on was our ability to get innovation in the new products. And we've talked a little bit about the delay that we've seen in new product introductions, particularly in the back half of the year, and I think it impacted our environmental business. I mean, clearly, we spiked out the mass spec, slipping a little bit. And a couple of other products that we would have liked have seen get out in the latter part of the year, and we didn't. And I think that clearly impacted the growth rates. I would say the good news is, obviously, all those activities are behind us. And I think, from a management disruption perspective, we can now be singularly focused on driving growth and innovation in the marketplace. So, again, looking back, we're a little bit disappointed on the growth, particularly on the instrument side. I think service continue to do well. But on the instrument side, a little disappointing. But as I mentioned in the remarks, we're quite excited about both the market trends, as well as some of the new products and capabilities we've got coming out in '14. And that's why we're fairly confident forecasting a mid-single-digit growth for that business this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So my first question is last quarter you mentioned some challenges in Southeast Asia and also some inspection-related delays that prompted you to take, I believe, about $10 million out of Q4 guidance. I may be off a little bit with that number, so please correct me if I'm wrong. But I'm just curious, how did that play out in Q4 and is there any related backlog to those dynamics that you would expect to be part of Q1?","Robert F. Friel","Right. So, I would say, I think we sort of indicated something in the $5 million to $10 million range. So I think $10 million was probably the upper range that we talked about. I would say, when we look back on '14, we clearly did not see the headwinds that we had expected. So, as Andy talked a little bit in his comments, emerging markets continue to do well. We grew double digits in emerging markets again. So maybe a little bit of an impact, but not significant. And with regard to the government shutdown, while we didn't get everything out that we expected, it wasn't a material impact to us. I would say, relative to the $5 million to $10 million impact that we were concerned about, we think it's probably in the $2 million to $3 million range to sort of what we didn't get out in Q4, and that sort of spills over Q1.","Frank A. Wilson","Okay. And specific to Asia Pacific, Southeast Asia, we did actually see that return to modest growth in the quarter, primarily from SEA [ph].","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then two of the more challenging areas for the company -- and I would say especially in the early part of 2013, were In Vivo and Medical Imaging. The silver lining there, as we look ahead to 2014, is that you have some favorable comps, especially early in the year. Could you just talk about how those businesses have been trending the past couple of quarters, maybe from a sequential standpoint, and how would you describe visibility on those businesses heading into the new year?","Robert F. Friel","So, first of all, let me take In Vivo and Imaging. And as Andy mentioned, that was solid double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. So, ever since Q1, we've seen a nice recovery in that business. And in fact, it's been accelerating on a sequential basis. So, actually, if you look at that business for the whole year, despite, as you know, a very significant decline in the first quarter, we still grew mid-single-digits. And looking forward, we think the pipeline looks strong. And clearly, with the NIH budget going up a little bit and the certainty around funding being available, we think that business should have a strong 2014. Medical Imaging was a little different situation, where, obviously we knew going into '13, it was going to have some difficult comps. And what we saw in the fourth quarter is Medical Imaging return to mid-single-digit growth. So that was great to see. As we go into '14, we've got a little bit of an issue in Q1 because of some ordering patterns. So we expect Medical Imaging to actually be down a little bit in Q1. But for the full year, it'll probably be growing in the mid- to high-single digits.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group.","Elizabeth Anderson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","This is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross Muken. I just had a question, in terms of you can give us an update. I know you've done a lot in terms of productivity enhancements in the past year, and restructuring and sort out what your -- a little bit more color on what your plans are for those areas in 2014.","Frank A. Wilson","Well, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're entering 2014 with about 100 basis points of margin expansion. It's a bit north of $20 million of cost. Some of this is the annualization of some of the restructuring activities with the second quarter. And we had completed the 3 major projects in '13, that we've been talking about over the last couple of years. I think as we look into '14, we obviously have leverage off the incremental volume. We also have a couple of the areas that we've talked about, that we're just beginning work on, which is really around our go-to-market strategy. And I think there are some real opportunities there, as well as our investment in indirect spend. We have consolidated all of our purchasing onto one ERP system. That affords us the ability to look across the corporation at our spend. And our indirect spend is actually almost the equivalent of our direct spend. So it's a fairly significant number, north of $400 million. And we believe that there's a lot of opportunity to consolidate vendors, really drive pricing, savings, as well as better terms. So not only should it help us on the bottom line, but it should also help us in working capital. So I think the combination of those with the volume leverage, we feel like we have, potentially, some additional upside. Those are the key areas we'll be focused on in '14.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So, Rob, I guess just starting off, what's your expectation, if you had to kind of lay it, what's your expectation for just kind of your underlying market growth? And what are kind of the key things that you'll be watching? It sounded like you mentioned blood screening, which I thought maybe would be more of a '15 event. You think you'll see some of that in 2014 in China or maybe just highlight some of the things that you think can get you growing a little bit faster than the market.","Robert F. Friel","Yes, first of all, I think you're right on the blood screening. And I mentioned from the standpoint is we continue to see the traction in the market. But I think you're going to see a significant ramp-up in '15. And I think that's largely probably being driven by funding than it is market dynamics. So I would say, when I think about the overall markets on a weighted basis, it's probably in the 3% to 3.5%. And I think we should be able to drive 150 basis points to 200 basis points additional growth this year, largely through our new product introductions. And as we've talked about, probably now for 4 or 5 quarters, we have been making a number of investments in the businesses. And we think '14 will be the year where you'll start to see some of that throughout the year. I mentioned a couple that have come out now; you'll see a couple more in the second quarter and then 1 or 2 in the second half of the year. But I think that's really going to be a significant contributor to our growth. As markets sort of recover here and probably don't get back to a full mid-single-digit growth from an end market perspective until probably the latter or middle part of this year.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's helpful. And, Rob, as you and Andy sat down and thought about this year, obviously, if I just go back and look, in 2012 you had a lot of margin expansion. You made some investments in '13, and then the market didn't grow as expected and so it didn't work out. I'm just curious how you thought about maybe the next 3 years and kind of what your targets will be in terms of margin expansion and EPS growth. If that's kind of -- is it at all involved in your thinking about how much you want to spend this year, how much you want margins to expand this year?","Robert F. Friel","I mean, I think what we talk about, on a multiyear basis, of revenue growth starting off sort of mid-single-digits and obviously trying to drive that up further. Operating margin expansion in the sort of 75 basis points, plus or minus, range. And I think if we can get 5% top line growth, we should be able to grow the bottom line greater than 2x that. So think about a 12% to 15% EPS growth off of a mid-single digit organic growth. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, none of that employ, considers any deployment of capital. And clearly, what we'd like to do is supplement that with anywhere in the sort of 2% to 4% of additional growth through business development or acquisition activity. So, again, when we think about 2017, I'd like to be able to look back and say, 8% compounded growth, sort of call it mid-teens EPS growth. And that would be comprised of 75 or so basis points of operating margin expansion.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. So, just to be clear, that would kind of be on average over the year.","Robert F. Friel","Right.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So I was just curious, if like this year let's say you do 150 basis points because you had a tough year last year, right, and then do you still see a path for expanding margins in 2015 or do you get kind of this lumpiness or choppiness to the...","Robert F. Friel","No, no. I think we see a path every year. Again, with the revenue growth in mid-single-digits of getting a 75 basis point margin expansion. I think if you go back prior to '13, what you saw was something more, on average, north of 100. And I think that's because we were being a little bit more aggressive on the production side. And while Andy talked about some of the other activities we're focusing on this year, I think as we look forward, we think 75 basis points per year is probably a better average. But clearly, we'll continue to get operating margins expansion going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Capital Markets.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Did we see the full effect of the facility consolidation in the fourth quarter, Rob?","Frank A. Wilson","This is Andy. But, no, we did not. We'll see a full impact to that in the first quarter of this year. There were still some carryover. And really there's no carryover expense. There is some remaining restructuring carryover that'll hit our cash flow, that'll go through '14. But from a profitability perspective and a return, that'll hit in the first quarter of this year.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","What are the major things you want to get done on the environmental side to get that margin a little higher?","Robert F. Friel","I think it's a couple of things. First of all, obviously getting these new products out into the marketplace because they'll bring higher margins with it. I think when you look at our margin profile in Environmental, we've talked about it in the past, we've got to get more consumables or make consumables a higher percentage of our business. So, obviously changing the mix out a little bit. And then, as I also mentioned, driving sort of the informatics and software capabilities that we have into that business as well. And I think if we can do those things, and obviously get the top line growth, you'll see improved operating margin in that business.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And then last, Rob, I think all of us see a stacked up pipeline of diagnostic startups out there. Are you getting approached more and more for companies trying to leverage your distribution channel? What are the dynamics happening there?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I think it's fair. As I mentioned, clearly there is an emphasis on earlier detection, right? And so, clearly our capabilities and our share in prenatal and newborn are very attractive. And so we do get good looks, particularly at some of the exciting new technologies. Because in many instances, and you're clearly see this on the NGS side, that some of the early adopters will be in that portion of diagnostics.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amit Bhalla with Citigroup.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to just dig into two things on the guidance. I guess, first on the instruments side. Can you help us with what's the embedded instrument growth rates in guidance? And then just second, on mass spec, can you just help us with the supplier issues you've been having on the mass spec side? Just get us comfortable on the timing of the launch of new products there?","Frank A. Wilson","Sure. Within the guidance is an assumption of mid-single-digit growth. It's also mid-single-digit growth on the services side as well. And again, a lot of that's driven by the new products we've talked about, as well as just general market conditions.","Robert F. Friel","Yes. With regard to the mass spec, I think we feel better about the supplier issues, and so we continue to feel like it's a late Q1, early Q2 launch.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just a quick follow-up on the first quarter guidance. Andy, can you just go through, again, the hit to EPS in the first quarter? Obviously, the EPS was a little bit lower than we were expecting. And I was hoping you can just break apart the -- quantify the hits.","Frank A. Wilson","Sure. Well, I talked about some items at the beginning -- or at the end of my prepared remarks, rather -- and we had some compensation headwinds and some benefit funding that's really more first quarter specific. Some of the competition headwinds will continue through the year. That's a piece of it. As you realize, our comps in some cases is tied to the share price, and the share price has gone up. So that has created a headwind. And in addition we had a lower payout in '13 than we are currently assuming in '14. Currency for the year is minimal, top and bottom, but in the first quarter it's about $0.01 on the bottom line, and it's specifically the Japanese yen. We had very little expense in Japan to offset the revenue FX change. And then, really, the third thing is the mix of income. Because of customer ordering patterns, med imaging, as Rob mentioned, will be softer in the first quarter, as will informatics. And that's the third piece I think. All in, those 3 pieces are about $0.04 to $0.05 of headwind on the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So, on the bio pharma spending comments you had early. Can you just tell a little bit of color where you are part of portfolio you see the most benefit? And I'm just trying to get a better sense of how broad-based that is. We've obviously seen some of that elsewhere in the sector. And at the same time, you're seeing drug companies with some renewed pipeline productivity. So, trying to figure out how much of this is really secular versus maybe one-time in nature?","Robert F. Friel","So if you look at Q4 specifically -- let me start there. We saw it in Asia, we saw it in Europe, less so in the U.S. We believe, in Europe there was clearly a -- we got a benefit from some of the budget flush, I think. When we talked to customers there were some money available and I think they were spending that before the end of the year. However when we look forward and talk to our customers, I think the benefit we'll get going into '14 is clearly in the academic area. And that will benefit, obviously, the imaging area and some of the more capital-intensive products that we sell. And then I would say the other area, clearly, is in the informatics area. We continue to see nice order growth there, particularly in the fourth quarter we're strong. And as Andy said, while the first quarter will be a little slow, we do expect strong growth coming out of informatics. And a lot of that is going into the pharma markets.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then just while you're talking to informatics, maybe to expand on that a little bit. We did see an acquisition of the one sort of independent publicly-traded company. And at the same time you've seen some active M&A with the other players in the NGS space. So maybe if you could just walk us through at a very big picture. You mentioned Spotfire, but across the entire portfolio of assets put together here, how do you guys look at your competitive advantage in informatics relative to some of these other companies who are now getting in?","Robert F. Friel","So I would say a couple of things. First of all, our approach in informatics is not to be necessarily focused on one type of technology or application and to be more sort of a platform. And so if you think about Spotfire, Spotfire is a visualization and analysis capability that ultimately we think will go into research, it'll go into environmental, it'll go into diagnostics. So I think that's, we believe, advantageous for us. And then, obviously, the other thing is because we have the underlying source of the data, so whether it's detection, whether it's informatics or whether it's some of our diagnostics screening tests, I think that provide us a significant advantage to better understand what the customer is trying to do. And again, it's the interaction or the inter-connectivity of having the detection and imaging, providing the informatics. And also through some of our service capabilities, understanding what our customers -- or the information and answers that our customers are trying to drive. So, again, you're already seeing a lot more activity in this, but I like our competitive advantages relative to the assets we have in informatics and also, again, the breadth of our capabilities.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. It's very helpful. And then lastly, if I could sneak one in with Andy on the deployment of capital. You mentioned your guidance doesn't factor that in and you guys have obviously been pretty opportunistic on tuck-in M&A over the last couple of years. But can you maybe, today, refresh us on your rank order priority, uses of cash between M&A and maybe a small buyback? Just wondering why something like that wouldn't be on the table as well.","Frank A. Wilson","Yes. I think right now, we have said we're going to hold our share count flat. I think, obviously, we have the opportunity to do something different. We're still working with Moody's on our credit rating. So we've been on the negative watch. So hopefully that will get behind us at some point. But I think M&A is really our primary focus, it will continue to be. There's a number of, what I would consider, attractive bolt-on and tuck-in transaction, really, across the portfolio. Maybe a few more in human health. But I think that's really probably where you're going to see most of our capital deployment in '14, and actually in '15 as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Dan Arias with UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Rob, any way you can help us with the contribution you expect from the Verinata collaboration for the year?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I would say, we -- as I said in the comments, we're -- I would say long-term we feel good about NIPT, right? And you can see the ramp-up in the coverage has been very good. The real question is how quickly the payers and the payment occurs. And one of the things that -- we look back even at our NTD business and the biochemical screening, and it does take a couple of years for that test to ramp up and to beget a sustainable reimbursement rate. So I think that's the question for us. It's being adopted. Its being sort of picked up by contract. But I still think it's going to take a little while before you'll see consistent, repeatable reimbursement.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe on the newborn side. What is the outlook for getting things going on the increases in the number of screening tests offered internationally? Do you think you can have some meaningful discussions there this year? And I guess, when do you think you could start seeing those menus begin to expand?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I mean, I think -- we're in those discussions now. And I think I mentioned a couple of weeks ago that we've seen an increase in China now. It's, on average, going from 2 to 4. There's actually some provinces that are doing 6. And we're actually in some discussions that are actually doing some things around mass spec. So we're clearly seen in China. I think in Europe we're quite excited. We just got the skits test that we deployed in the U.S., now CE marked. So we're in discussions with a number of countries there. So as we said in the past, these things never go as fast as we would like. But we are in a number of dialogues where we think we'll continue to see good movement on the menu expansion. And hopefully we'll see some, maybe, step moves here in 2014.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then if I can sneak one more in, just on the informatics effort. To what extent do you think you can leverage OneSource as sort of a vehicle there, to make an impact with the accounts that, that business touches?","Robert F. Friel","I think OneSource is having and will continue to have an impact on that. And one of the clear synergies that we saw with, for example, CambridgeSoft is they had relationships with some companies where we weren't as significant on the OneSource side and vice versa. So I would say, over the last year, we've been averaging those. I think we've got good synergies on that. And now, with the Asset Genius and a couple of other products that we've evolved from the informatics side, I think we are seeing good traction. And we have a number of customers now where we're in beta test with some interesting informatics capabilities that sort of supplement what we do or complement what we do on the OneSource side.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So, actually kicking off the last one on OneSource. I mean, we saw the Merck news. Maybe just talk about visibility with that business and growth assumptions for this coming year in light of, obviously, some pipelines being rebuilt but obviously restructuring as well.","Robert F. Friel","So first of all, I would say OneSource continued to do well in the back half of '13 and had a good sort of mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. And so while clearly you see some of the large pharmas, like Merck, restructuring. At the same time you're continuing to see other pharmaceutical companies recognize the benefits of outsourcing some of their noncore activities. In addition, even with our existing customers, as we mentioned, whether it's informatics or some of the other capabilities that we've developed, we continue to win new business with existing customers. So I think the combination of new customers starting to outsource more of their non-core work, as well as getting more business with existing customers, we still think OneSource can grow sort of mid- to maybe high single-digits in '14.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, obviously, there's been a lot of focus on margins. But on the flip side, can you talk about where you're making incremental investments in '14 either channel-wise, in terms of -- you mentioned a pathology system. Do you need to do more there? And then, conversely, if you could talk on R&D, other priorities? At one point, I think it was mentioned, you can add an LC maybe to the ITT and how do you think about opportunities like that?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, so I would say, first of all, from an R&D perspective, we want to continue to keep our R&D at least at the same level as revenue, as a percentage of revenue, and maybe increase that a little bit. There are some technologies that we're focusing on to sort of expand our capabilities, particularly in the imaging area. You mentioned pathology. I think the exciting thing about the new product, the scanner, is it's being added to a growing range of what we would refer to as quantitative pathology solutions. So we now have a reagent of protocols for staining. We've got imaging instrumentation. We've got analysis software. So that's an area that we think will provide a nice growth. As you point out, we are investing in the channel there, bringing in some additional capabilities there. And I would say, incrementally, in some of the emerging markets, we're looking to add sales and distribution capabilities. So sort of at the next level now beyond the BRIC. So, South Africa, Turkey, some of the Middle East, some of the areas of Eastern Europe. So that's the area of where we're investing, where we see nice opportunities to grow.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, along those lines, you mentioned the China net opportunity, obviously, that's kind of 2015. But can you maybe help us think about whether you need to make investments there, what the size of that opportunity could be in the next couple of years. And then are there similar nat-based [ph] testing opportunities beyond China that you're going after?","Robert F. Friel","So first of all, in the China diagnostic area, that's an area where we have been investing fairly significantly, probably since the 2012 timeframe. I think we now have over 100 engineers in our Diagnostic business based in China. And so we'll continue to invest there. I think the opportunity for blood screening, longer-term, could be quite significant, probably in the $30 million to $40 million per year. That may take a couple of years to ramp up. But I think that's -- when you look at the amount of screening that's done in the U.S., the potential for China is could be quite significant. And then, of course, India, I think is another area where we think we want to leverage what we're doing in China and move that into some of the other emerging markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So, we haven't really talked about sort of what the Caliper business has done. And I'm curious in terms of how the sample prep portion of it is done, the automation portion of it. And I guess, have you thought about what sort of the role is for the Caliper and some of the next generation seamless workflows over the next couple of years as a number of other players are sort of entering the market or people that actually sell equipment are starting to launch their own prep systems.","Robert F. Friel","So let me start off with the first question. So if you look at Q4 specifically, the Caliper businesses all did very well. I mentioned In Vivo, Microfluidics had a good quarter and the liquid handling portion associated with NGS. I think they all were probably high single, low double. If you look at the year, probably a little disappointing relative to the original model. But I think a large reason for that is just because, obviously, when we bought Caliper, we did not assume we were going to see the academic funding issues that we saw, particularly in the first part or the first half of 2013. But overall, if you look at a couple of years, I think we feel good about the returns and we feel good about the traction we're getting in the marketplace. And probably most importantly, the synergies that we've been able to drive by taking some of the Caliper products and combining it to what we've done historically at PerkinElmer. So I think we feel good. Going forward, again, the Microfluidics work, we continue to move that into other applications. So we've got an interesting product coming out probably a month that'll be more focused in the diagnostic area and to leverage what we do, obviously, in that area. I mentioned the fact that In Vivo was strong, and I think you're going to see a good pipeline in that in 2014. And we continue to believe there's an opportunity in Next Gen sequencing sample prep at the sort of higher volume end. And I think that's clearly where we see the opportunity continue to play and continue to work the synergies with that in our informatics back end.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. It sounds like you're going to do -- whatever your M&A strategy is, a lot of is going to be focused on the Human Health side of the business. And obviously the Human Health side of the business is where a lot more of a more robust growth opportunities are. I guess, does it make sense to sort of contemplate maybe divesting some of the Environmental Health businesses and maybe making it as a pure-play on Human Health? I guess, I'm thinking about -- how do you think about strategy of the company going forward?","Robert F. Friel","So, first of all, I just want to say, while I think Andy mentioned that there's sort of a bias in Human Health, there are a number of opportunities we're looking in the Environmental Health area. Because we think, particularly in the area of, let's say, air monitoring and food, there are some nice growth areas there. And we think we've got some good capabilities to pursue those. That's one. The second thing is, increasingly, when we look at the core capabilities of PerkinElmer, like informatics, like imaging and some of the other things we do, we see applicability, both -- across both areas, Environmental and Human Health. So I would say unlikely that you would see a situation where we would split. If anything, we'd like to great greater synergies across the businesses. So when you think about the new mass spec coming out, that's going to have applicability in the environmental end markets, but we ultimately would like to see that also going to the Human Health. So the core capabilities around detection, imaging and informatics has applicability across -- whether its research, diagnostics and environmental. And I think, over time, you're going to see us continue to leverage that and gets benefits from the broader market opportunities.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And just one housekeeping question. Andy, the $12.6 million other expense net item, is that just debt extinguishment cost?","Frank A. Wilson","It is. It's a make-whole.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","It's actually Dave Clair in for Bill. Sorry, I missed the first part of the call. I'm not sure if you addressed this already. But I was just curious, if you could give us an update on Japan. Are you seeing any impact from the stimulus over there?","Robert F. Friel","So Japan has continued to improve sequentially since the first quarter. And I would say, slight benefit. We do you think in 2014, we'll see a more of an impact from that. But Japan, I think for the year, is in the low to mid-single-digit growth. And again, given the difficult first quarter, that was pretty good improvement.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And Andy, thanks for the color on operating margin. I was curious if you could talk about how you're looking at gross margin in 2014.","Frank A. Wilson","Well, I think we've said all along that we feel like we can get almost an equivalent amount on the gross margin, on the operating margin. If you look at the initiatives that we had last year, the move to Asia, primarily Singapore and China, was really to drive supply chain savings. There are some labor arbitrage. That we will see, I think, ramp over time, as we build out the supply chain there. So it's still early days. So I think that the mix going into the year will be probably a little more skewed towards the SG&A side than on the gross margin side, but we should see improvement in both. And I think that gross margin will start to ramp up as we start to really make progress on the product side.","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I mean, the one thing we mentioned in gross margin, and we spec this out in the prepared remarks, is the investment in informatics goes into gross margin. So while Andy talked about the productivity savings we're seeing, and we do expect to see gross margin improvement in 2014. That has a little bit of an offset as we continue to build-out, and that will be an area of investment in informatics. That does cause a little bit of an offset to what otherwise would be, I think, fairly significant gross margin expansion in '14.","Frank A. Wilson","That's right. The accounting treatment does put it into cost of goods versus -- traditionally it would be put in R&D or SG&A.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Criscuolo with Mizuho.","Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Just filling in for Peter. Did you see, I guess, toward the end of the quarter and maybe even the first couple of weeks of 2014, did you see any increase in U.S. health care utilization rates?","Robert F. Friel","No. I mean, that'll be probably be difficult for us to see it based on the newborn or prenatal area. But I would say no, nothing that I would say would be significant.","Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, given the term -- while it's kind of happening right now in various emerging markets, whether it be maybe in Europe or Southeast Asia. Has that kind of changed your outlook in any ways or are you baking in any more risk in those markets in 2014?","Robert F. Friel","I think we're monitoring it. But if we look at Q4, as I mentioned, it continued to do well, and the ordering pattern, at least in the sort of pipeline and discussions with customers. At least in the areas where we're focused, which is fundamentally Environmental Health Care we're not seeing that. But it is something we're keeping a watchful eye. I think we mentioned in the prior call that, obviously, when you see the currency devaluations that you've seen in a number of these countries, that the initial impact of that is products that are based fundamentally in dollars become significantly more expensive. And we have seen a couple of countries, obviously, Turkey and, et cetera, that have taken fairly aggressive actions from interest rate to try and offset that. But that is something we're keeping a careful eye on. But I would say that up to this point, we haven't seen anything that it indicates that its impacting our business directly.","Frank A. Wilson","Yes, I think part of that is due to the product set, the offering that we bring over there. And if you think about diagnostics and environmental tools, I mean, those are kind of critical needs right now within emerging markets. So as far as prioritization, we feel a little better about their ability to prioritize that spend maybe versus others. But we'll continue to monitor it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott with William (sic) [Robert] W Baird.","Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just looking at the free cash flow commentary. Can you be more specific on what you're looking for in terms of free cash flow or cash flow from operations in 2014. And then can you give us some color on the metric business? Could you update us on the size of that business and what you're seeing for growth there?","Frank A. Wilson","Sure. Why don't I take the first question, and Rob will take the second question. On free cash flow, we always try to shoot for 100% of net income. We've obviously made some investments as a part of our productivity initiatives and working capital, as well as with some of our informatics. And I think that has impacted our cash flow. But I think those are behind us. I think I said in my prepared remark, we have about $87 million of cost in the year that we won't see next year. So I think we're going to be in that solid 90% free cash flow to net income range. In 2014, I think the difference will be our ability to generate more working capital improvement to get to 100%. But we still have some restructuring that is a carryover from some of the productivity initiatives we had in '13 that will dampen that a bit. But I think, if you look at operating cash flow, we talked about close to $160 million. We're looking at closer to $300 million going into 2014, it's operating, not for EBIT. A fairly significant improvement year-over-year.","Robert F. Friel","Let me just talk little bit about the Radiometric Detection business and the Radio Chemical business. So the Radiometric Detection business actually had a good fourth quarter. It's been fairly lumpy, obviously we had some issues in the first quarter. I think that's a business that can probably be flat to down slightly. We continue to come out with -- in 2014, potentially a refresh of that product line, and so we'll have some expectations. The Radiochemical business continues to be down in the sort of mid-to high-single digits. Again, we've seen that slow down a little bit. But our expectations for '14 that, that will continue to be a headwind relative to the growth of the Research business.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Two quick questions for you. First, just a housekeeping. Andy, the Service business, did you mention how much that grew in the quarter itself?","Frank A. Wilson","Mid-single-digits. I don't think I did mention it, but it grew mid-single-digit.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then secondly, I was just wondering if you can provide a bit more color within the diagnostic business, both in the quarter and kind of looking to 2014, as it relates to growth in the newborn business versus growth in the Infectious Diseases.","Robert F. Friel","Yes. So both of them, I think, should have strong growth in 2014. So if you look at the newborn business we're anticipating. That's probably going to be in the high single-digit growth. And it's fundamentally -- the couple of drivers that I mentioned about before, we're going to -- we expect to see continued adoption in some of the countries, and we expect to see menu expansion. The other thing is, if you look in China in 2013, births were down about 15%. And what caused that phenomena is, in 2012, you had the Year of the Dragon. And in 2013, you had the year of the Snake. And so what we expected is, in China, you'll see a rebound of births to a positive number. And again, that should be a contributor. And then of course, of the last aspect of it -- although we don't think it's going to be huge driver is, obviously, the relaxing of the one child policy in China will also be a contributor. In the case of infectious disease, that's a business that's consistently grown in the sort of high-teens to over 20% for us. And we would say, we think that's going to continue to be a strong grower. It may moderate a little bit. But I think it's still going to be something in the sort of mid- to high-teens growth for us.","Operator","That concludes our Q&A. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Rob Friel. Please proceed, sir.","Robert F. Friel","Okay, great. Well, first of all, thank you for your questions. So let me, in closing, just say we entered 2014 optimistic about our end markets and enthusiastic about our capabilities. We look forward to leveraging opportunities this year to deliver differentiated value to both our customers and our shareholders. Thank you for your continued interest in PerkinElmer and have a great evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Keith, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. And with that, I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Tommy Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Tommy J. Thomas","Thank you, Keith. Good afternoon, and welcome to PerkinElmer's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","If you have not received your copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com or from our toll-free investor hotline in 1 (877) PKI-NYSE. Please note, this call is being webcast live and will be archived in our website until August 16, 2012.","Before we start, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor Statement that we have outlined in our earnings press release, issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future, even if our estimates change. So you should not rely on any of today's forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date after today.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures we plan to use during this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available as an attachment to our earnings press release. To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during this call, but are not reconciled to GAAP in the attachment, we will provide reconciliations promptly.","I'm now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel. Rob?","Robert F. Friel","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Once again, we are reporting another excellent quarter, in which we delivered solid financial results while making excellent progress against our strategic priorities.","During the second quarter, our adjusted revenue grew 10% year-over-year, adjusted operating margins expanded 240 basis points. We generated excellent cash flow and adjusted earnings per share increased 23%, which exceeded both our guidance and consensus.","We continue to be extremely pleased with how we are improving both operating efficiencies and profitability of the company, while also delivering very strong top line growth. Our ability to deliver this impressive financial performance, particularly in light of the current difficult macroeconomic conditions, is due to several factors.","First of all, we serve many end markets that are less economically sensitive. In addition, within these markets, we provide products that are critical to our customers. Whether it is assisting in the screening of newborns, helping improve the productivity of labs or keeping drinking water safe, our products continue to be sought after even in an unstable, global financial situation, as global interest in both human and environmental health continues to grow.","And with our recent acquisitions, we have further bolstered this advantage by expanding our capabilities in the areas of informatics, molecular analysis, imaging and sample prep, positioning us well to address both current and future needs of the global human and environmental communities.","The second factor is our significant global reach and capabilities, particularly in emerging markets. As many of our products are instrumental to expanding health care services and improving environmental conditions, we continue to experience strong demand for many of our products in these areas of the world where there is a focus on developing fundamental, environmental and health care needs. I'm especially pleased that our sales into the emerging markets now represents approximately 28% of our total sales, and were responsible for over half of the company's total organic growth during the second quarter.","For example, our China business, once again, showed strong growth with organic revenues increasing more than 20%, and with adjusted operating margins greater than the corporate average. China continues to be an important contributor to both our revenue and earnings growth.","In particular, our Chinese diagnostic business continues to gain traction with both new and existing customers, adding approximately 40 new customers in the quarter as the country increases its efforts to help combat infectious diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV. What's important to note here is that we saw a double-digit sequential organic growth and feel that we're still only in the early stages of a very big opportunity. A major part of China's 12 5-year plan is focused on improving both human and environmental health, and we believe that we are well-prepared to capitalize on this trend.","A third contributing factor is our ability to provide innovations into the marketplace by leveraging our strong detection, imaging and software technologies with our extensive application knowledge. In the first half of the year, new products introduced in the last 3 years represented 22% of our total revenue and 32% of our product revenue, which excludes our revenue from service.","During the second quarter, we introduced a revolutionary technology that enables any sample form, whether it is gas, liquid or solid, to be introduced into a mass spectrometer with minimal sample prep.","Our spectrum CT, which combines optical imaging and 3D x-ray, is enabling researchers to pursue unique strategies in oncology research. In the informatics area, we introduced the Ensemble platform, which enables real-time control and automation of laboratory processes, helping laboratories to decrease errors and speed the delivery of results, as well as the Asset Genius, which provides customers with the critical information they need to make informed decisions on lab asset deployment.","Also, during the quarter, we launched our new OneSource Scientific IT service, which leverages the strength of our service expertise and informatics capabilities. Customers, such as Merck Resource Laboratories, are now turning to Perkinelmer for this new and unique service to substantially improve the efficiencies and supportability of their lab technology and overall lab environment.","The fourth, and most important, factor is our people. We would not be as well-positioned as we are today without the hard work, passion and outstanding contributions of our 7,200 employees who, everyday, are committed to driving our growth, innovation and mission to improve the health and safety of people in the environment. It is truly an exciting time to be part of PerkinElmer.","Through the first half of this year, our organic growth as of the high-end of our original guidance, while our adjusted operating margins have increased by 200 basis points, significantly greater than expected. Some of the higher margin expansion was due to a more favorable mix of revenue and better profitability of the former Caliper products. However, a portion of the higher-adjusted margin expansion was a result of the retiming of some growth and productivity investments due to both uncertainties surrounding Europe and a significant amount of integration activity underway.","Due to the strong first half and the rapid integration of Caliper and our other acquisitions from last year, we are planning to accelerate our spend against these initiatives in the third and fourth quarters, as we continue to see great opportunity to improve the operating margin and growth profile of the company. Even with this increased investment in the back half and the significant headwind from the stronger dollar, we feel comfortable maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance of $2 to $2.05.","I would now like to turn the call over to Andy, who will provide more details on the quarter and our Q3 guidance.","Frank A. Wilson","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon. Consistent with prior quarters, I'll provide some additional color with our end markets and our second quarter results, and then I'll it open up for questions.","As Rob mentioned earlier, we were pleased with our performance in the second quarter delivering another solid quarter of growth in both revenue and adjusted earnings per share. Reported revenue for the second quarter increased 9%, while adjusted revenue for the second quarter increased by 10% to $532.3 million as compared to the second quarter of 2011.","Organic revenue increased 5% as compared to the same period in 2011. This performance was at the high-end of our guidance range of $530 million to $540 million, after adjusting for the negative impacts of approximately $7 million of FX headwinds, arriving subsequent to the guidance we've provided following our first quarter earnings call.","For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share increased 23% to $0.53, $0.05 better than the midpoint of our guidance.","By segment, organic revenue increased by 4% and 5% in our Human Health and Environmental Health segments, respectively. By geography, organic revenue in the Americas and Asia both grew at a high-single-digit rate while Europe declined low-single digits, but within our expectations.","We experienced continued strong demand from emerging territories with organic revenue growth in the BRIC countries up high teens, despite an even higher comparison in the prior year. As Rob noted, we remain pleased with our performance in China, with revenues up more than 20% on a year-over-year basis, despite similar growth in the prior year.","Looking at organic revenue, by product category, recurring revenue, which includes reagents, consumables and service, grew high-single digits in the quarter, while instruments and components grew at a low-single-digit rate when compared to the second quarter of 2011. From an end market perspective, PerkinElmer's Human Health segment represented approximately 49% of total revenue in the quarter. We served 2 end markets in Human Health: diagnostics, which represented 27% of total revenue; and research, which represented 22% of total revenue.","Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business increased mid-teens during the quarter, with notable contributions from both our Screening and Medical Imaging businesses. In our Screening business, we continue to experience solid demand across all major segments of the portfolio. This business is benefiting from the stabilization of U.S. birthrates and the expansion of our prenatal, newborn and infectious disease screening solutions in key regions outside of the U.S.","We continue to see strong uptake of our portfolio in China and feel that we are well-positioned to benefit from China's 12th 5-year plan.","Our Medical Imaging business continued see broad-based growth across all key technologies and applications in the period, with particular strength in traditional medical diagnostic imaging offerings. We also saw a healthy contribution from our CMOS imaging technology, primarily focused on surgical applications.","Organic revenue in our Research business declined high-single digits in the quarter, the result of a difficult year-over-year comparison, ongoing declines in our radio isotope offerings and softer pharma demand.","Caliper organic revenue grew mid-single digits on a difficult prior-year comparison of more than 20% and finished the first half with low-teens organic growth and operating profit ahead of our acquisition model expectations.","Our Research business continues to gain traction in new areas, such as biotherapeutics, NextGen sequencing and epigenetics, and customer acceptance remains high, as evidenced by the strong increase in our backlog as we exited the second quarter.","Moving to Environmental Health, which represents 51% of total revenue in the second quarter, we served 3 end markets: Industrial, which represented 8% of total revenue; Environmental and Safety, which  represented 18% of total revenue; and Laboratory Services, which represented 25% of total revenue.","During the quarter, we experienced low-single-digit organic growth in the Environmental Safety segment, a low-single digit decline in the Industrial segment and high single-digit growth in the Laboratory Services business. We were particularly pleased with our performance in China, which continues to benefit from environmental applications, specifically focused on inorganic analysis solutions for the analysis of metal content and contaminants in water and soil.","In addition, we continue to see good acceptance in our Laboratory Service and Informatics platforms, as we help our lab customers manage their critical laboratory assets and the related data output.","As Rob mentioned earlier, our new OneSource Scientific IT services help customers improve the efficiency of their lab computing environment and the safety of the scientific data.","Now looking at the margin performance in the period, adjusted gross margins expanded approximately 200 basis points. This was driven by volume leverage, favorable mix, robust productivity gains and a favorable impact from our businesses acquired in 2011.","Adjusted operating margins expanded approximately 240 basis points in the second quarter to approximately 17%. As Rob mentioned earlier, given the significant amount of integration activity underway at the end of the first quarter and the uncertainty surrounding Europe at that time, we elected to defer some of our growth and productivity investments originally slated for the second quarter. Delayed timing of this spend contributed about 80 basis points to our strong margin expansion performance in the quarter, and is expected to negatively impact second half margins as we reaccelerate our spend against these initiatives in the third and fourth quarters.","By segment, adjusted operating margins at our Human Health business for the quarter were 22%, representing an increase of approximately 130 basis points as compared to the second quarter of 2011.","Our Environmental Health segment delivered adjusted operating margins of 16%, representing an increase of approximately 210 basis points. The combination of volume leverage, favorable mix and productivity gains across the company contributed to the strong performance delivered by both segments.","GAAP operating income from continuing operations was $49.8 million in the second quarter of 2012 versus $39.4 million for the same period a year ago. Our GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 13%. And on a non-GAAP basis, our adjusted tax rate was approximately 23%, which is slightly lower than our previous guidance communicated in April. We now expect our tax rate for the second half to be approximately 23%.","GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations in the second quarter of 2012 was $0.29 compared to GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.26 in the second quarter of 2011.","Adjusted EPS was $0.53 in the second quarter of 2012, up 23% from the prior period, and exceeding our guidance range for the quarter of $0.47 to $0.49, despite an FX headwind of approximately $0.02 per share, which was partially offset by approximately $0.01 per share from the lower tax rate.","Our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter of 2012 was approximately 114.6 million shares, and our ending share count was approximately 113.6 million shares.","Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the second quarter with approximately $911 million of debt and approximately $171 million of cash. We continue to make progress on our delevering efforts as we exit the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5x and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 2x.","Looking at our cash flow performance, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $77.4 million as compared to $54.9 million in the second quarter of 2011. We made good progress managing our working capital and cash collections in the quarter, delivering greater than 118% of free cash to net income. We believe that our second half 2012 cash conversion will be slightly below our stated goal due to increased cash taxes as a result of the settlement of certain foreign tax audits, as well as higher inventory levels, resulting from the move of manufacturing operations to lower cost regions.","In summary, as Rob indicated, we feel good about our performance in the quarter as we delivered 5% organic revenue growth, approximately 200 basis -- 240 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 23% growth in adjusted earnings per share.","Now I'd like to discuss our third quarter and full year 2012 guidance in a bit more detail.","Consistent with our view from earlier in the year, we remain cautious regarding macro economic conditions, specifically with regard of Europe and the strength of the U.S. dollar. As a result of current FX rates, we now expect full year 2012 reported revenue growth to grow high-single digits and organic revenue growth, to be in the mid single-digit range, which is consistent with our original guidance provided at the beginning of the year.","Regarding adjusted operating margins, we expect to expand margins above our stated range of 75 to 100 basis points for the full year.","For the third quarter, we expect adjusted revenue growth of $495 million to $505 million, with organic growth -- revenue growth being in the range of 3% to 5%, with foreign currency headwinds of approximately 4% based on current exchange rates.","As we mentioned, we are planning additional productivity and growth investments for the balance of 2012, which we believe will further solidify our ability to achieve our longer-term growth and margin expansion objectives. These investments will have a dilutive impact on our adjusted operating margin expansion in the second half of this year, and as a result, we expect adjusted operating margins for the second half to expand more modestly.","Based on these assumptions, we are maintaining our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2012 of $2.00 to $2.05 despite FX headwinds of approximately $0.06 per share.","Additionally, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.44, which assumes the negative impact of approximately $0.02 from FX headwinds.","That concludes my prepared remarks. Keith, at this time, we can open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Your first question is from the line of Jon Groberg from Macquarie Capital.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So can you -- just a couple of this clarification, I'm trying to understand. So on Caliper, that is about $38 million last year. Looks like, you're saying about 8% acquisition, that's what it did this quarter. So it was up 5% organic and that's kind of offset with currency. I'm just trying to understand what they did in the quarter.","Frank A. Wilson","Caliper was a little less -- Caliper grew mid-single digits organically. It's a little hard to kind of break out Caliper now that it's being integrated with the larger business. But its impact to overall PerkinElmer organic was fairly minimal this quarter. But the rationale, or the reason behind that, Caliper had a very strong 20-plus percent organic growth quarter last year, so it was a little bit lower. But first half, we're seeing Caliper generating about 13% organic revenue.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just one other quick clarification and then -- I'm sorry, one question. I think in the past, you guys have said you're basically have -- you're pretty neutral from a currency standpoint. I remember a lot of calls. So is that kind of changed as you've gone through this? Or is this a mix of currency? So maybe just talk about, I think you said that makes impact.","Robert F. Friel","I think what we talked about is that we're fairly neutral from the standpoint of revenue and expense across the various regions. But, of course, what you have is the profitability. When we talk about the currency impact, think about it as just at a high-level earning. Europe is close to 30% of our revenue and call that our profitability, right? So 30% of our profitability is going through sort of 15% decline. So as you convert that profit in Europe to dollars, that's where your impact is, you're converting that in a much lower rate.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. That's helpful. I was just trying to triangulate with what could -- we had a lot of those questions in the past. And then, Rob, for you that last question, Europe is kind of down, China seems really strong. Can you maybe give a little bit more detail? You mentioned some diagnostic business. Is that primarily the kind of postnatal screening or the neonatal screening, I mean, or what else is going on there? And can you maybe -- others are seeing a slowdown there, sounds like you haven't. Can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing and what you're outlook for those businesses?","Robert F. Friel","Well, try not to -- we fundamentally have 2 businesses. One, we have, as you said, the newborn screening, and that continues to grow. But more importantly, when we bought SYM-BIO in 2009, we also got a business that's involved in infectious disease, so hepatitis and HIV. And that continues to see very strong growth and continued to come out with new products there. You may recall, we talked about building out a big production capacity there, so we've continued to invest there and that's contributing a big portion of the growth in China. I would also say, on the environmental side, we see strong growth there as well. So I would say, mostly on the environmental side and on the diagnostic side is what's driving the over 20% growth in China.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So even in some of the more instrument-related markets like thermal analysis, maybe, and some of the monitoring -- environmental monitoring, that for you is still very strong in China? You don't see that slowing?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I would say it's still strong. I would say it's slowed a little bit in the second quarter. And, of course, we also have some new products coming out, particularly in the ICP-MS area and those sides. So that's -- we're seeing, I would say, good growth in China. It's probably slowed a little bit relative to what we saw in -- I'm talking specifically on the environmental side relative to Q4 and Q1.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Daniel Leonard from Leerink Swann.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I was just hoping you could give us some flavor on the types of growth investments you're planning for the back half of the year.","Robert F. Friel","Well, I would put it in some category, some buckets. So I would say, first of all, we continue to invest in some interesting areas around detection capabilities. So we talked about -- I talked a little bit about this sample introduction technology from Aspect[ph], so I would say that's one area. Clearly, continuing to expand out our menu in the screening area, is an area that's going to get some investment here in the back half. I think in the research area, biotherapeutics and epigenetics are 2 areas that we feel very good about. And of course, we announced recently our expansion of a personal health innovation center in Hopkinton, so the focus in those areas and a couple other ones. So -- and of course, informatics, I would say is another that, I think, you'll continue to see us investing here in the back half.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up question. In terms of what you seeing from the pharmaceutical market, is the weakness you're seeing there in the research product business, is that -- is it worsening? And is your strength in the services more than enough to offset that going forward?","Robert F. Friel","I would say, from a market perspective, it's maybe worsening a little bit on the pharma side, particularly in the small molecule area. And our focus is to continue to migrate into some of these higher-growth areas like biotherapeutics, epigenetics, next-gen sequencing. Obviously, that was one of the big incentives or benefits of buying Caliper. So I would say that's slowing a little bit. I would say to be fair also in Q2, we made some switches with the Caliper integration. We went on to SAP and a number of other things, and probably that maybe cost us a little bit of growth. And I think, as Andy mentioned, we've built some nice backlog. So our expectation is that the Research business probably returns to positive growth in the back half.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ross Muken of ISI.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Particularly on some of your shorter cycle businesses, maybe in the industrial side, can you talk a bit about sort of the pacing through the quarter, and what you sort of saw in the latter half? And how you think about that in sort of the context of your 3Q assumptions and sort of the full year kind of organic growth guidance?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. I would say that where we saw the biggest change through Q2 was in Europe. So as you recall, Europe in Q1 for us was sort of mid-single growth. And in Q2, it was actually a decline of low-single digits. And so we saw that occur from sort of the April to the May timeframe and into June. I would say, since sort of mid-June to July here, that's been fairly similar. And so other than Europe, I would say the trends in most of our end markets has been fairly consistent over the last couple of months.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, Andy, on the SG&A line, it just seems like a heroic sort of performance there, in terms of what that line is doing, given all of the moving parts from the deal and the organic. I guess, I know you're putting in some investments back half of the year. But if you sort of had to tease out the components of how you manage that Q-to-Q, for the last few quarters it's been relatively flattish to modestly up. What would sort of be the key deltas of why we're not seeing that line inflate more?","Frank A. Wilson","Well, I think we -- we've been talking about sort of productivity initiatives that we've been putting in place. And if you really look at a lot of our ability to expand margins, it's really been levering that G&A base. So as we grow, we're able to basically keep our headcount fairly flat. And obviously, that translates into good margin expansion. We did get a little bit of help from FX in the quarter. So if you're just looking  specifically at the second quarter. I think overall, though, it's really been a corporate focus on trying to make sure we're efficient with spend. And I think that it's taking hold. And over the last several quarters, we've continued to see that gain traction. And I think we've got some spending that we're going to be doing, some heavier lifting over the next 2 to 3 quarters that we think will further enhance that as we look on the gross margin lines to move things, move some of the manufacturing from developed -- developing economies, as well as really leveraging more at the back office and in certain parts of the world. So I think we feel good about the progress, some heavy lifting left to do, but a lot more opportunities as well. And I think we still feel pretty good about our ability to get to the high-teens operating margin by '14.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Daniel Brennan from Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was wondering first, just on your kind of instrument business, I'm particularly hearing from some other peers about signature levels rising up. I know you've already commented on some of the pacing in the quarter, but maybe in the -- your call specifically in the instrument side, there maybe -- see any change there in the dynamic about CFO-type levels being more inclined to kind of wait on spending the money?","Robert F. Friel","I would say that's a trend that has been around for at least a couple quarters. I would say the one area where we are seeing some changes on the instrument side is some more aggressive pricing by some of the competition. So I would say that's for us, that seems to be more of a recent change. But as far as higher-level approvals within our customer base, I think that's been around for a couple of quarters.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then maybe just on the big user group meeting that you had up, up in your headquarters in England, attended by over 500 customers. Is there anything kind of notable feedback you can share in terms of whether it be products or applications that seem to be in the highest demand? Anything kind of surprise you from detraction maybe coming out of the meeting, just some of the highlights from that were.","Robert F. Friel","Sure. Why, Kevin's here, that was sort of Kevin's meeting to some extent, so maybe I ask him to comment on some of the takeaways from that.","Kevin Hrusovsky","Yes, Den, it was actually well-attended and we had a meeting in U.K. the following week as, which was well-attended. And we had over 800 customers and I would say the next-gen sequencing, biotherapeutics, as well as epigenetics, which PerkinElmer is uniquely qualified to address, because it's really how the environment is affecting health. Those topics seem to really resonate. We actually had to track as well on informatics, and that was -- the rooms were completely full on informatics. And I think, the combination of those 4 topics was about, let's say, 65 presentations from customers, really created -- we think good demand for the second half as well as next year and with us opening up the new Personalized Help Innovation Center, we think that there's great momentum for a lot of these newer hotter markets in the positioning that we have inside of them.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. Maybe, can I just sneak one more in. Just in terms of the gross margin in the quarter. I know you mentioned you had some mixed benefit but seems they're up really significantly year-over-year, maybe. Can you just flesh out specifically, again, like what the key driver was at that expansion?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. Of the 200 raised points, about 80 of that was just the higher gross margins of the acquisitions we acquired in 2011. So they contributed 80 basis points. And then the rest of it was strictly around productivity with some of the initiatives I talked about earlier within the factory. And I think that's -- we did also see, in the quarter, a bit of an increase from a mix perspective and some licensing revenues, as well as some informatics revenues, which are higher gross margin than in the average.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Daniel Arias with UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a question on Environmental Health. I guess, Rob, can you talk broadly about your applied market customer base and the overall tone that you have there right now? We sort of kind of think of those markets as pretty secular and pretty steady over time, but there has been some discussion about maybe some fluctuations in certain areas. So I guess, how are your food and beverage and environmental safety customers thinking about purchasing in this environment? I guess how much visibility do you have there?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, so I would say in this quarter, we saw a much more severe bifurcation between emerging markets and developed markets. I think if you look historically, as you mentioned, the difference might have been 200 basis points between the growth we saw in developed world versus emerging. This year, we saw a much greater differentiation. So clearly, in the emerging markets they're continuing to spend, particularly in the environmental area and I would say also in the food safety area. We saw a little bit of a pullback, or let's say less growth in the developed world. So that's how I would characterize some of the change you're seeing now. And, of course, Europe is a big part of that. So that's a large contributor to it. But we did see a much larger gap between the 2, the developed and the emerging markets.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, Andy, did I hear you say that U.S. was up in the teens in the quarter? And if so, can you comment just a bit broadly on that strength?","Frank A. Wilson","Well, it was -- the U.S. was actually up high-single digit in the quarter. And we had some strong informatics revenue in the quarter, which was a piece of that. But overall, it was a very solid quarter.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe one more for Kevin. You mentioned some momentum in next-gen sequencing. I guess, when you think of the Caliper business, do you think that the pieces are in place there for the move to clinical sequencing and taking medical genomics to the next level, as they say?","Kevin Hrusovsky","Yes, Dan. I think that we are still investing in this area. We were watching carefully the evolution of kind of the centralized next-gen sequencer to the benchtop, and looking at accuracy and precision rates, but most importantly, we're seeing that sample prep is playing an important role in that overall accuracy, so we are continually -- PerkinElmer's is continuing to make strong investments in sample preparation, not only to improve the precision, to help it get in to the clinic more productively, but also the sample sizes, in general, are getting smaller. We had many physicians at our user conference talking about circulating tumor cells, as well as fine-needle aspirate biopsies, as opposed to large biopsies. And as these sample sizes get smaller, I think our microfluidic estate is well-positioned to really help the sample preparation of these smaller samples and eliminate biosnisis[ph which has been a big issue, which is important for getting into the clinics. So I think we're -- we've got strategic relationships with all of the major NGSs, and we have -- now we have an informatics platform from Geospiza, that's really focused on trying to create medical reports, as opposed to research reports from the data. So I think both on informatics and sample prep, we're well-positioned but we'll continue to make investments as we want to improve accuracy rates.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering if you could first help me maybe touch on the pace of business during -- in Europe during the quarter. I think there's been some debate there across the industry regarding whether or not conditions there really deteriorated or sort of steadily kind of pressured environment. So any color you could put on the European-pacing across the various businesses would be great.","Robert F. Friel","Well, first of all, when I talk about our Europe business, we actually had -- our diagnostic business continued to grow. So what we saw -- we actually saw growth on the diagnostic side. Where we saw a decline was sort of, I would say more in the instrument-based businesses, so both environmental and the research side. And as I mentioned before, we did see -- now, of course, we grew in the first half as well, as I said mid-single digits. So we did see fairly, sort of steady, sort of consistent decline beginning sort of early Q2, sort of in the early June. And then like I said, it sort of stabilized a little bit, and our sense is, at least through the first couple of weeks here, in the third quarter, it's more stable. So that is how I would describe our experiences in Europe.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just secondly on informatics, Kevin, can you maybe comment on one more detail regarding how product integration there is progressing and sort of the overall trend that you're seeing in the OneSource business as well?","Kevin Hrusovsky","Yes. I think overall, we're very encouraged by the acquisitions that have been put together. First of all, that integration is ahead of schedule. And I think there's a strong focus now towards applications, using the systematic capabilities that are somewhat unique. And as I think Andy and Rob both mentioned, there's some really nice -- in OneSource, new technology, new informatics that really help customers with utilization rates of their assets and to better optimize those investments. And I think, both in OneSource as well as future application opportunities, and next-gen sequencing, and even biotherapeutics, we're seeing nice integration opportunities with some of the Caliper product lines with the informatics. And so overall, I would say that's going very well, and we see it as a major piece of the future growth profile for PerkinElmer.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. And then last one for me, just certainly for either Rob or Andy. Can you guys maybe update us on the latest thoughts from the board regarding future management incentives that might go in providing ROIC-based metrics? I think that's one area where a lot of investors would have a pretty positive response, if we got a path there.","Robert F. Friel","Well, I would just say, Isaac, generally we -- to the extent we're going to do anything on incentive comp, we would do that sort of on the latter part of the year. So I would say no current plans to change it. But again, those discussions usually occur at our December board meeting.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Fair to say it's a possibility? Or...","Kevin Hrusovsky","I know, I think it is a possibility. We've had some discussions about it, but I would say nothing definitive at this point.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jon Wood with Jefferies.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So you've got about a $4 million benefit from, I guess, deferring some of the investments in the second quarter. So my question is, are you actually incrementally stepping up in the second half? Or you're just basically adding back that benefit you got in the second quarter, if you will?","Robert F. Friel","I would think of it more as sort of adding back the benefit in the second quarter. And again, we'll sort of evaluate as we go along. I mean, that's the plan right now into Q3, and we'll sort of reassess that depending on how we go in Q3. But I would think of it as sort of taking it from the first half and moving into the second.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Andy, you commented that acquisitions were 80 bps in gross margins. Do you have that impact on OP margins?","Frank A. Wilson","It was negative 30 basis points on operating margins.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, so diluted operating margin?","Frank A. Wilson","Yes, it was accretive to gross and diluted to op.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Rob, how are you thinking about the imaging business in the second half of year? I mean, obviously, you had a pretty strong first half. How have you guys come model that in second half, given what we've seen from some of the bigger industry players?","Robert F. Friel","I mean, I assume that it will continue to grow in the back half, probably moderate a little relative to what we've seen here in the first half. But we feel like we'll continue to see pretty growth there. They do have a very strong growth in Q4 that will make it a little bit more difficult comparison. I think they were up sort of mid-teens, organically, in the fourth quarter of '11. But generally speaking, that business continues to do well and we see good demands there.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Last one for Andy. Delevered about $23 million, is there any reason why that wasn't higher? Is it just timing? I think you guys had talked about like $150 million for the year of deleveraging. So just looking for some color on pacing there.","Frank A. Wilson","It's in line with the timing we set in place at the beginning of the year. It maybe a little off, but not much. I think we're still on track. I think there's 2 components of it as well. There's EBIT -- there's EBITDA and the debt delevering, and we're doing a little better on the EBITDA as well so there's a bit of a mix there. But I think overall, we're on track.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Peter Lawson from Mizuho Securities.","Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","This is Eric Criscuolo filling in for Peter. The investments in the second half that are going to increase, is that going to be focused more on R&D or SG&A?","Robert F. Friel","No, I think it's going to be both. And I think there'll also be some on the cost of sales line as well which will be some of these productivities. But I would say R&D and selling, as Andy talked about before, we're trying to be fairly aggressive on trying to reduce our G&A. So I would say it's on those 2 areas, most, and then you see it in cost of sales.","Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And on the share count, it's been creeping up a little over these past 2 quarters. Is that going to continue to increase incrementally? Or is there a way to kind of slow that down?","Frank A. Wilson","I think for modeling purposes, I would keep it kind of fairly steady at that level. I don't think it's going to go -- we're not going to let it go any higher.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, great. And then any color on volumes or activity in your sequencing center that just got the CLIA certification?","Robert F. Friel","Yes,  I mean, as we said, it continues to grow nicely. It's off of a very low base, but as far as growth rates, it continues to do well. I think the CLIA certification opens up some additional business we can get. Again, this is largely focused on the research area and pharmaceutical companies. So we have had requests in the past where they wanted some of the samples to be done under CLIA because they're either going into preclinical or clinical tests. And so I think it's really -- it's, again, really focused on the research and, mostly, pharma side.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Bryan Brokmeier from Maxim Group.","Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","First, you commented earlier about the diagnostic -- you are actually seeing diagnostic growth in Europe. Is most of that in eastern Europe? Or is there a positive growth in -- sorry, was most of that in eastern Europe or you're also seeing positive growth in western Europe?","Robert F. Friel","We're actually seeing in both regions.","Unknown Analyst","And is that kind of across the infectious disease and prenatal?","Robert F. Friel","Well, in Europe, it's fundamentally newborn and prenatal.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And also the -- are you bringing your infectious disease products into new markets? Or is a lot of the strong that you're seeing in markets that you've traditionally had a presence in, including China?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I would say specifically, in infectious disease, it's mostly in China.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's most in China?","Robert F. Friel","Yes.","Unknown Analyst","And just real quickly, last the -- have you started to shift in any of your -- the sales of any of those Caliper products from distributors to your sales force in some international markets?","Robert F. Friel","We have. I would say it's still small. I mean I would say we've targeted that more sort of the latter part of this year. So we started to move some, but it's been very small, I don't know if you want to...","Kevin Hrusovsky","I think that while it has been small, we've had really strong relationships with the distributors and we have been able to rationalize multiple distributors into single distributors, and the growth that those accounts and those distributors are continuing to ramp nicely. So we do feel like while we're waiting to make the final conversions, we're making nice progress with a lower number of distributors.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America..","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You were fairly conservative on Europe, a little bit more so than a lot of your peers on this. I guess, Europe, generally in line with where you thought it would be, to be getting incrementally worse, are you expecting it to be incrementally worse from where you initially guided?","Robert F. Friel","No, I don't think so. I mean, I think, particularly when you look at the strength in the first quarter and sort of average that over the year, our assumption is that Europe will be sort of flat to down slightly.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So last quarter, some of the companies that supply stuff to the sample prep market for next-gen sequencing reported some pricing pressures and some competition there is. Caliper didn't see that kind of headwind. Has -- you're still seeing good demand there in that market -- has there been any change in the competitive dynamic in sample prep area?","Kevin Hrusovsky","I think the term sample prep does get used a lot because many of the large NGS providers are actually providing their own sample prep reagents for certain steps. We're upstream with that, and we haven't seen any slowdown at all. It's been strong double-digit growth occurring for next-gen sequencing sample preps for us. And we actually have pretty good visibility to the future here as well, and we're seeing really strong demand for this. So both -- I would say expansion into Asia, as well as just primarily in North American markets, we see really nice sample prep on demand.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And is there any demarcation between some of the big-box machines and the benchtop machines? Are you supplying both of those? Can you just talk about how the market is?","Kevin Hrusovsky","Well, interestingly, it's probably as expected. The larger machines initially were acquired by our customers, and then many of them started coming to our shows and realizing that the bottleneck became the sample preparation. And so, mostly they would buy those as secondary investments after they bought their first unit, but now that they've had experience, many of the same steps are needed for benchtop us well. And so, they've now gone into this investments a little bit more knowledgeable about the need for sample prep. And so, we do see, in many cases, we've got relationships with Life, with Alumina, with Packbio and others. But primarily, Life and Alumina, when that initial acquisition is made now on the benchtop version, you'll see sample prep being brought in right away.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Zarak Khurshid with Wedbush Securities.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","So it's the year of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. Clearly, it's a little bit early for the impact on your business. But can you just remind us how large, how important is your prenatal screening franchise today, and how are you thinking about that business given the rapid evolution of the field?","Robert F. Friel","So I think from a size -- I don't if we've got into the specifics of how big that business is, specifically, but I would say it's less clearly, less than 5% of our revenue. And I think, we've talked about this on our other calls, we're really pursuing 2 alternatives. We're pursuing some things internally and in this specific case, we're using some technology, actually, that Caliper had combined with some capabilities that we had to see if we can orchestrate around some of the difficult IP issues in this area. And then, of course, the other thing is we're watching that very closely because I think one of the challenges with some of the current providers is, there seems to be a sort of an IP minefield right now. So I would say we're sort of analyzing that, as well as sort of doing some things internally to potentially have our own offering.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Interesting. And then maybe a question for Kevin. Sounds like the Caliper microfluidics business was pretty robust in the quarter. Can you maybe just talk about the comparison versus the In Vivo Imaging side? And I guess, as we look further out, how are you thinking about the runway of growth in that In Vivo Imaging segment?","Kevin Hrusovsky","Yes, Zarak. You actually have hit upon [indiscernible] -- if you look at it from a product or technology standpoint, you've hit upon the 2 double-digit growth components of the old Caliper that have now been integrated with some product lines and technologies from PerkinElmer, which, I think, increases our menu. So when you look at microfluidics, we have had very strong ramp in next-gen sequencing and biotherapeutics. And when you look at the In Vivo Imaging, we've had very strong ramp in biotherapeutics, where there's a lot of distribution studies, as well as continued focus on oncology, and that expanding now into inflammation and metabolic. So we're seeing nice growth across all regions of the world, and we're seeing nice growth across those market segments, which were very concentrated. Now we're starting to pull along some of the traditional legacy PerkinElmer products into those newer markets, which was one of the strategies that Robin outlined for the acquisition. So I think that the areas where the growth has not been as strong, are probably in areas of small molecule, and there were still some assets in Caliper technology for small molecule, but the good news is that, that's now rapidly moving over to large molecule and even epigenetics. So I think across-the-board, and the 2 categories you mentioned, we still feel we've got strong growth and good visibility for the future. And these shows we've had with customers, most of the talks, if you looked at the 65 talks we had, I would say that 70% of them hit those 2 product lines, the In Vivo Imaging and microfluidics. And I should also mention that we're having 2 major shows in 2 weeks, in China. One in Shanghai, one in Beijing. And then we're going to having 2 more shows out on the West Coast that investors will be invited to those, as well as our customers, over the next 2 months.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jeff Elliott with Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Your OneSource offering continues to do well and you keep adding to that offering. With competitors increasing their focus here, how will you continue to win with new and existing customers?","Robert F. Friel","Well, I think it's just continuing to be able to differentiate what we're doing. I think that drove us to some extent into some of these informatics capabilities. I mentioned the current collaboration with our informatics business and OneSource that we've now come up with a very interesting product that, for example, Mark is using. So it's just continuing to build out our differentiated capabilities. I would say that's one. I think the other thing is just to continue to expand geographically. I mean, historically, OneSource was adopted in, sort of the developed world, and now it's -- almost all of our customers seem to move a lot of their lab activity into emerging markets. We continue to build our capability there. So I think that really is how we'll continue to grow.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Just wondering, looks like the past couple of quarters here, you guys have benefited in your diagnostic business from some larger equipment placements. I remember a couple of quarters ago, you mentioned Russia, sounds like this quarter maybe China. I'm just wondering, what's going on there and what's the future look like for those kind of larger orders?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. Let me just clarify. I would say that in the case of China, that wasn't a large equipment. That was just a continued growth. I talked about expansion of more customers there. So in Q2, we did not have a necessarily large interim placement. But what happens periodically is we'll build some large -- in most cases, newborn screening labs. I think Egypt was one, we mentioned last year. But I would say in Q2, that was not the case.","Operator","And we have no other questions at this time. So I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Rob Friel for closing remarks.","Robert F. Friel","Great. Thank you, Keith. And thank you, all, for your questions and continued interest in PerkinElmer. So in summary, let me just add, we were -- we're very well-positioned, but given the attractiveness in the end markets and the criticality of our offerings, our ability to continue to provide differentiated innovations to our customers and our focus on providing strong financial results while investing in the long-term growth aspects of the company. So again, I look forward to updating you on our continued progress at the end of next quarter. Thank you, and have great day. This call is now adjourned.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you very much for joining us. You may now disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Tommy Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Tommy Thomas - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Esther. Good afternoon and welcome to the PerkinElmer first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","If you have not received the copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com. Please note that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website until May 19, 2016.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future, even if our estimates change. So you should not rely in any of today's forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any other date after today.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures we plan to use during this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is also available as an attachment to our earnings press release. To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during this call that are not reconciled to GAAP in that attachment, we will provide reconciliations promptly.","I'm now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel. Rob?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on PerkinElmer's strong start to the year, in which we delivered solid financial performance and gained significant early momentum on our 2016 strategic priorities.","Turning first to our financial performance, we exceeded our revenue and profitability expectations for the quarter, despite a macroeconomic environment that remains mixed. We grew organic revenue by approximately 4%, which was fairly evenly split between Human and Environmental Health. We also experienced a good expansion of our gross and operating margins and increased adjusted earnings per share by 12% or $0.56. As a result, we have raised our topline and earnings per share expectations for the full year.","While Andy will discuss our first quarter financial results and end markets in more detail, overall, our markets are performing similarly to the latter part of last year, and are in line with our expectations. While the conditions of the few market segments are a bit mixed, these are areas that for the most part impact a relatively small portion of our overall business.","For example, during the first quarter, our revenue from industrial markets declined low single digits, due somewhat to tough prior year comparisons, but also to weaker customer demand. Fortunately, this was more than offset by better than expected performance in the food market, particularly in China and in a number of emerging markets.","We also continue to see persistent headwinds in certain geographies, such as Brazil, Japan and Russia. However, in the first quarter, revenue from these countries represented less than 5% of our aggregate revenue. As we look to the remainder of the year, we continue to believe it is prudent to expect a fairly moderate growth environment, with continued volatility in both industrial and emerging markets.","Before turning the call over to Andy, I'd like to highlight some of the progress we made towards our strategic priorities for this year as well as provide some examples of how our offerings continue to help make a profound impact on human and environmental health. As I reiterated during last quarter's earnings call, ParkinElmer's unique value stems from our ability to offer novel solutions that help customers unlock insights by leveraging the combined power of our scientific and technical capabilities with deep application knowledge.","In addition, by disproportionately directing more of our resources towards the high growth areas of pharma and biotech services and solutions, reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics and food quality and safety, we believe we can accelerate organic revenue growth beyond the mid-single digit rate, drive sustainable margin improvement and reduce the effects of near-term macroeconomic volatility.","This focus has enabled us to target solutions that are solving some of our customers' most significant real world challenges. For example, in the first quarter, we introduced our Operetta CLS cell imaging system. This system combines PerkinElmer's proprietary automated water immersion technology with direct LED illumination, enabling up to four times higher sensitivity and finer resolution for phenotypic cell assays. Recently, our cell imaging systems have been selected by the University College of London, Cambridge University and Oxford University, in connection with a collaborative study to better understand the molecular and genetic mechanics of dementia.","In addition, researchers in Brazil and the U.S. are utilizing our Operetta and JANUS liquid handling systems, to screen compounds and inhibit the infection and transmission of the dangerous Zika virus. Another important offering from a research imaging platform is our recently introduced Synoptic's quantitative pathology system which allows quantitative and spatial imaging analysis. Last month, an article in the New England Journal of Medicine showcased how scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center at John Hopkins leveraged our platform to understand immune response to an anti-PD-1 drug for Merkel cell carcinoma.","In addition, a second study published by Genoptix, a Novartis subsidiary, indicated that a Multiplex IHC test using our platform to measure not only PDL-1 expression, but also the interaction between cancer cells and PD-1 positive immune cells leads to a better prediction of immunotherapy response for melanoma and potentially other cancers versus current single flex IHC tests. Both of these studies reinforce our belief that our Phenoptics offering is substantially differentiated in its ability to identify and quantify cancer immune interactions, therefore better enabling our customers for precision medicine.","In the area of diagnostics, we continue to see significant opportunities in reproductive health, particularly in emerging markets. In the first quarter, we opened a new laboratory in Chennai, India, which broadened our diagnostics offerings to respond to India's growing demand for easier access to technologies that screen for and help diagnose prenatal and neonatal conditions. The lab will provide a comprehensive menu of diagnostic screening services for hospitals, maternity nursing facilities, diagnostic labs and clinicians.","In newborn screening, global adoption of our gold standard automated screening platform, the GSP, continues to grow. In particular, our GSP pilots are going well in China as the country ramps up its automated screening capabilities. In addition, as additional countries expand their testing menus, more of them are implementing our market-leading SCID [Severe Combined Immunodeficiency] test.","In China, our Haoyuan business won a number of government tenders in the first quarter, as customers work to meet the nucleic acid testing mandate coming into effect. We are proud that through the deployment of our industry leading Cheeta (08:10) molecular blood screening system, hospitals will help ensure the safety of China's blood supply.","Consistent with our strategy to focus our efforts on our very best opportunities, last week we announced the divestiture of our U.S. prenatal laboratory screening service business, NTD, to European Scientific. Through this divestiture, we can now better concentrate our diagnostic efforts on developing innovative maternal fetal health technologies and solutions for the U.S.","Outside the U.S., we are continuing to provide kits, technologies and services through a variety of channels focused on improving health outcomes for babies and expectant mothers. Within food testing, we grew our Perten franchise with the acquisition of Delta Instruments. Delta is a Netherlands-based manufacturer of infrared analyzers and flow cytometers for dairy products. This acquisition broadens our portfolio to now offer the most complete range of analyzers used for measuring nutritional components in somatic cells in milk. We are also expanding Perten's addressable market organically by leveraging our core PerkinElmer technical capabilities.","Most recently, Perten transformed a single-use analyzer into an in line solution to monitor product quality for a major consumer goods manufacturer. The consumers (sic) [customer's] (09:32) already purchased a large quantity of instruments, primarily to test moisture levels during process control.","While the Delta acquisition was small, we continue to look for more substantive bolt-on acquisitions in our higher priority markets. We have a solid pipeline and hope to close one of those transactions during the remainder of the year. However, as you saw in our press release, during the first quarter we bought back $150 million of stock, as we believe we have the cash flow generation and leverage capability to both bolt on strategic attractive assets and return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Another key strategic priority for us is driving productivity and operational effectiveness. We've been aggressively deploying Lean principles throughout the organization. Within manufacturing we are upgrading our procurement practices and improving cross-site collaboration. While early days, our Lean applications in operations are starting to free up manufacturing capacity, which will enable us to in-source key assemblies at very minor incremental variable cost. In addition, reusing an in-sourcing initiative to accelerate value engineering and further reduce product cost by driving commonality and component standardization across a number of important product lines.","Furthermore, we have consolidated the management of transportation activities, which is yielding impressive initial results. The early benefits from these actions have already started to positively impact our margins and are responsible for some of the better than expected financial performance in the first quarter.","So to summarize our first quarter, I would note the following: Solid financial performance, particularly in the areas of margin expansion; good progress on focusing our investments in the most attractive growth areas; the advancement of implementing a multifaceted approach to improve operational effectiveness; and lastly, the return of 50% of our forecasted free cash flow this year to our shareholders.","As we move ahead, our strong first quarter momentum reinforces our confidence in the growth investments we are making, our ability to meet our financial targets and our success in serving our customers around the globe.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Andy.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our first quarter results, as well as details around our second quarter and full-year outlook.","Starting with the first quarter, we were very pleased with our strong start to the year, as solid execution on a number of key initiatives afforded us the opportunity to make a meaningful investment across a number of new growth opportunities, and still deliver solid financial results. For the first quarter, adjusted revenues were $539 million, representing organic growth of approximately 4%, while FX negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 2% or $10 million.","Adjusted earnings per share was $0.56, up 12% from the comparable period a year ago, and $0.06 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. The strong operational performance contributed approximately $0.05 per share of the beat and was primarily the result of volume, favorable mix and price as well as the incremental impact from our Lean and productivity initiatives.","Non-operating items contributed approximately $0.01 per share versus our guidance and were comprised of a lower share count and favorable FX, each of which contributed approximately a penny, but were partially offset by approximately a penny resulting from a slightly higher tax rate in the quarter. I'll go into a bit more detail on several of these items later in my prepared remarks.","As Rob mentioned earlier, the trends we saw through the latter part of 2015 largely continued through the first quarter of 2016. Looking at our end markets, we continued to see healthy demand from pharma and biotech, stable academic and government spending, as well as strong demand for food and environmental applications. Our product mix was also balanced with consumables, reagents and instruments all growing mid-single digits organically.","Looking at our geographic results for the first quarter, our overall performance was balanced as we experienced high single digit organic revenue growth in Asia, mid-single digit growth in Europe and low single digit growth in the Americas. In the BRIC economies, first quarter organic revenues increased high single digits compared to the same period a year ago, driven by strong China results, more than offsetting continued weak demand in Brazil and Russia. Overall, our emerging market demand has remained resilient.","We are pleased with our solid results in China, as organic revenues grew double digits in the quarter with broad-based strength from both our Human and Environmental Health segments. Our Haoyuan blood screening business had another strong quarter of tender wins, while Haoyuan instrument placements completed in the second half of 2015 are now beginning to drive reagent demand. On the Environmental side, strength in food and environmental testing solutions were the key contributors of Environmental Health's solid performance in China.","As to our operating results for the quarter, adjusted gross margins were 48%, up 30 basis points, driven primarily by the success of higher margin new products, successful pricing and Lean initiatives and volume leverage. We continue to be encouraged by the traction we are seeing from our Lean activities.","Adjusted SG&A was 25.1%, down 80 basis points over the same period a year ago, driven by productivity actions and the ongoing success of our indirect spend initiatives. As we guided for the full year 2016, our first quarter reported research and development spending was higher by approximately $2 million as compared to 2015, driven by core investments in our four strategic initiatives, along with R&D funding supporting Vanadis, as we announced last quarter,","Overall, we were very pleased with our operational performance and execution in the first quarter of 2016, as we expanded adjusted operating margins by approximately 100 basis points on top of our incremental R&D investments.","Looking below the operating line, first quarter net interest and other expense was $11 million and our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 21.5%. The higher tax rate was a result of the geographic distribution of profits and had a negative impact on adjusted earnings per share of about $0.01 in the quarter. We still expect our full year tax rate to normalize over the balance of the year to approximately 19.5%.","Consistent with our comments in February, we completed the buyback of 3.2 million shares of the company's stock for a total consideration of $148 million during the quarter, leaving 2.7 million shares remaining for repurchase under our current board authorization. The timing of the acquisition of these shares was modestly accelerated and will have a positive impact of approximately $0.01 per share for the year.","Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of debt and nearly $210 million of cash, and we exited the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of two times. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $32 million as compared to $38 million in the same period last year, due primarily to the timing of payroll and benefit expenses, as well as higher working capital requirements supporting future new product introductions. For the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our adjusted free cash flow commitment of $300 million.","Turning to our segment results for the first quarter, Environmental Health organic revenue grew approximately 5%, with Human Health increasing 3% as compared to the same period a year ago. From an end market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the first quarter of 2016, with Diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue, and Life Sciences Solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue.","First quarter organic revenue growth from our Diagnostics business was driven by healthy mid-single digit growth from our core diagnostic franchises, partially offset by a mid-single digit decline in medical imaging. We continue, however, to see increasing demand for a number of new CMOS applications as the team continues to successfully diversify the medical imaging portfolio.","Organic revenue in our Life Sciences Solutions business grew low single digits in the quarter, while core research grew mid-single digits. Pharma and biotech continue to be the key contributors, both growing high single digits. Growth was broad-based globally with continued strengths from our OneSource service franchise. We continue to experience solid demand for core products with particular strength in reagents, which grew at a double digit rate in the quarter. We've also been very pleased with the demand for our new product introductions including our high content screening platform.","Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represents approximately 38% of adjusted revenue, we are pleased to report that revenues grew 5% organically for the first quarter of 2016. Our results benefited from the timing of strong demand in our Food and Environmental Testing Solutions; however, we expect this growth rate to moderate somewhat in the second quarter. We continue to be delighted with the performance of Perten and the positive customer feedback we've received on their new in-line testing solution for moisture measurement. As Rob mentioned, we expanded our food analysis franchise through the recent acquisition of Delta Instruments, a provider of analytical equipment and solutions for the dairy market.","Looking at segment margins, Environmental Health margins expanded 470 basis points, as strong mix, prior year restructuring actions and solid operational execution were key contributors to this performance in the quarter. Human Health margins were 21.2%, a decline of 80 basis points, largely due to planned growth investments and mix, partially offset by the positive impact of pricing initiatives impacted at the end of last year.","Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2016, we believe we are well positioned to deliver another solid financial performance with continued stability in a majority of our end markets. For the second quarter of 2016, we are forecasting reported revenues to be in the range of $570 million to $575 million, which represents organic revenue growth of roughly 4%. Second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $0.65 to $0.66.","For the full year, we now believe our organic revenue growth will be approximately 4% or $2.32 billion. Looking at margins for the year, we now expect gross margins to expand approximately 70 to 80 basis points and operating margins to expand 60 to 80 basis points, with R&D continuing to represent a year-over-year headwind of approximately 40 basis points.","Regarding our adjusted earnings per share outlook, we are increasing the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range by $0.10. The $0.10 increase is comprised of our first quarter outperformance of $0.06 per share coupled with an estimated $0.04 per share from a more favorable foreign exchange. As in prior quarters, the methodology for calculating the impact of foreign exchange movements on our operating results is based on an average of FX rates over the last month of the quarter, and we will continue to be transparent as to the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results as we move through the year.","And finally, the impact from the acceleration of our share repurchase in the first quarter is expected to essentially offset the dilution from the sale of the NTD lab services business, which was a little over a penny.","As a result of these factors, we are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from the range of $2.65 to $2.75 to a new range of $2.75 to $2.85 with the midpoint of $2.80. As always, when assessing our adjusted EPS guidance range, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view of how we see our results playing out.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time, we would like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is now open.","William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hey guys. This is actually Bill March on for Paul. How are you guys doing?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good. How are you?","William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","I'm doing well. Thank you. First question, maybe if you could in terms of capital deployment, with the acceleration of the share buybacks in the quarter, maybe a little bit insight or color around what you see for the rest of the year?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I would say, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our view is, we would hopefully be able to get something done from the standpoint of a bolt-on acquisition. I mentioned the fact we feel good about our pipeline of opportunities. And so, that's our first preference. But clearly, if we are unable to get that done let's say over the next nine to 12 months, then I think we'd probably look to continue to buy back shares.","William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Got it. And then maybe just in terms of China, I know heading into the year, you were seeing, say maybe as going from double digits to high single digits growth, maybe an update on that outlook and how both sides of the portfolio are tracking?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, I would say, we continued to see very strong growth in China. China for us, in the first quarter was up sort of mid-teens, and it was very broad based. So, both on the Environmental side as well as the Human Health side, we saw a double-digit growth in the quarter. And even within if you looked in Human Health, it was broad-based between sort of diagnostics and research. So, we continue, I think, to enjoy the advantage of being in some very attractive markets from the standpoint of the funding of the Chinese government, and again, I think this was reinforced with their recent five-year plan.","William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Got it. Thanks. Have a good night.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First, just on free cash flow, it was down a little bit year-over-year. Just was wondering, are you still expecting roughly $300 million of free cash flow for this year? And then, I have a follow up.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, sure. I \u2013 well, let me tell you a little bit about free cash flow. I mean, first off, the primary driver of the difference year-over-year was the timing of our payroll. That'll normalize in the second quarter. We did have some additional working capital; as you guys remember, we had a very strong fourth quarter. There was a little bit of build of working capital; some of that was in support of new products that are going to be coming out in the second half. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we are still committed to a free cash flow of $300 million, which is essentially one times our adjusted net income.","And one thing I'd like to add just as a clarification. When I was doing my prepared remarks, I was handed a note. I said our full year revenue \u2013 we were going to be $3.23 million \u2013 that should be $2.32 billion; just wanted to make that clear.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks so much. And then, just following up on a comment from Rob. Rob, you made a comment about the potential to expand revenue growth beyond mid-single digits. I was just wondering if you could provide a bit more color there because that would obviously imply a step-up from what the company has done historically.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And I think just goes back to conversation maybe we started a couple of quarters ago, where we said strategically what we want to do is disproportionally invest in those \u2013 and I think we've identified four key areas \u2013 where we see both more significant opportunities to grow the topline and the profitability of the company, and where we think we have a very strong shares and core capabilities.","Just to give you an example, if you look at about 75% of our revenue in the quarter, it would've grown high single digits; and largely in the areas that we've sort of identified as those higher growth areas. So, we've got a situation, where is, we're going to continue to invest in those and hope those \u2013 to make those a bigger portion of the company. And then obviously over time, we think the overall growth \u2013 organic growth \u2013 could hopefully average up to a higher number. Now, this won't happen in the next quarter or two, but we think, as you look at it in a couple years, our goal here is to get from mid-single digits to maybe high single digits.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. It's actually Joel in for Isaac. Could you guys provide any update on the timeline of the commercial rollout of your NIPT initiative? And then any comment on whether the divestiture to Eurofins played into the strategy in anyway?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I would say, in reference to the Vanadis, it's still very early days. We've owned the company now for probably four months. And what I would say is first of all, we're very pleased with the individuals and the team. We're on track relative to our milestones given that it's only been fairly early. And I would say, the one area where I think we continue to be very pleased with, we saw some good synergies both on the imaging side with our imaging people out of Hamburg as well as in the chemagen sample prep. So we think \u2013 we were pleased that over the last couple of months \u2013 we were able to confirm what we thought were significant opportunities to get some synergies from our capabilities as well as theirs. So, I would say, still early days and this is probably something that will not be a significant revenue until late 2017 or early 2018, but indications on track.","I would say, with regard to the NTD divestiture, that was really, I would say, somewhat different. And I think what to a large extent drove that was sort of a strategic decision that as we continue to look at services with, I'll call it regulated services within U.S. or U.S. testing labs, it just didn't seem like a strategic opportunity for us for a number of reasons.","One is, fairly significant regulatory and compliance infrastructure required. So, we had a lab that was sort of less than $20 million in revenue and was requiring a fair amount of infrastructure on a regulatory and compliance cost. By selling NTD, it effectively eliminates all our exposure to either federal or private payer reimbursement, and so that was a big consideration.","The other thing was, as we thought about our customers would be better served by a company with a broader capability and, quite frankly, a stronger commitment to the U.S. services market. And then finally, I think. And maybe this is somewhat related to the Vanadis development is, as we ultimately develop new products and new capabilities in that marketplace, we want to be able to offer that to more channel partners.","And so, I think it was a combination of all those that led us to conclude that it makes sense to sell the NTD lab services.","Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then, maybe turning to food safety, how are you guys thinking about the underlying market growth rate there? And then, just given your investments and the commentary on the tuck-in pipeline, what type of margin should we be expecting from these bolt-ons, and then maybe from this business longer-term?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I would say we feel very good about the opportunities in both the food safety and the food quality analysis area. And as we've sort of talked about in the past, Perten has been sort of growing sort of high single digits. And we actually saw a little stronger growth than that this quarter, so we continue to be very bullish on the food area. And we are excited about the Delta tuck-in. While it wasn't a large acquisition, it did bring us some good capability around flow cytometry, and it actually is used for looking for bacterial infection in milk. And when you think about the connection with Perten, they both have sort of common customers as well as a very common business model. So we think the margins in those businesses can be sort of high teens, low-20%s.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, I think, you called out two different growth rates in LSS \u2013 one for LSS as a whole and then, the other one for core research \u2013 and I just like \u2013 I was thinking, what's the difference?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Within LSS as a whole, we have core research and informatics and service. And so, the core research grew at a mid-single digit rate; when you combine the three pieces, it grew at a low single digit rate. Informatics had a very difficult comparison in the first quarter and that's really what drove the difference between mid and low single digit.","Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, great. That's helpful. And as you talk about potentially simplifying the business and focusing on four key areas, I know previously you've talked about radio chemicals being a flat to down business. What's the size of that now and has that continued to decline or has it stabilized?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, it continues to decline a little bit sort of low single digits. I would describe that as a business that declines from a volume perspective and we continually try and get price, so we offset some of the volume decline with price. But it's a business that probably declines low to mid-single digits on a sort of an annual basis. And right now, it's $80 million to $85 million in revenue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hi, Derik.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, good margin expansion, good progress there. I'm just curious, as you start thinking about \u2013 on the out years \u2013 and I'm making the assumption that the economic malaise and the slower growth environment won't last forever. So, you did 4% organic revenue growth, 12% EPS growth this quarter. What's the model to sort of think about going forward on this? So if we get back to 5% to 6% organic revenue growth, what does that sort of contribute to on the EPS growth and EBIT margin growth, when we look out?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think what we've said longer term is sort of mid-single on the topline and probably mid-teens on the bottom.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Is that \u2013 was that inclusive of the share buybacks?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, it probably is not inclusive of capital deployment, whether that's share buyback or acquisitions. I would say that's the fundamental sort of operating rhythm of the business. So, if we can grow the topline, call it 5%, we think we can probably get mid-teens on the bottom line. And then, capital deployment would be additional, whether that's bolt-on acquisitions or share buybacks.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And then just sort of one follow-up from a bigger picture's perspective, I know, obviously the new China five-year plan is focused on a number of areas, like environmental and food where you are. There's also clear evidence of the Chinese want to build out their Life Sciences businesses and they're trying to do some acquisitions in some certain areas and this is \u2013 I'm just wondering \u2013 are you seeing any sort of threat from internal development in China, technologies being acquired, things being copied. I mean, how do you sort of \u2013 what do you sort of think is the outlook for that considering that \u2013 I'm not going to say that some of the instruments in that market are not high-tech, but I don't know if you need the latest cutting edge instruments for some of those areas. Just your thoughts on the Chinese competition question?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, I would say, if it's specifically around the research market, I would say we don't see a lot of copied, because quite frankly \u2013 ours, I think, I would put in the high-tech category, right? I mean, when we think about our research products, it's cellular imaging, it's high content imaging, it's fairly sophisticated technology. So, we do not \u2013 or we haven't up to this point run up against local competition.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Rob, I just want to start and \u2013 you guys put up a nice first quarter \u2013 the tone at the beginning, a little bit more muted. At this point of year, is this just caution around everything we see in the press or is there anything else that you're keeping an eye on specifically?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would say, if you're talking about caution maybe from a topline perspective, I think a lot of it is, again, if you just look at some of the macro factors out there, there's a lot to be concerned about from the standpoint of PMI, whether you look at the global number or whether you look at the U.S. numbers, it's a little bit. But we've \u2013 I think global PMI was the second weakest reading during the last 40 months, down to like 50.1. Production growth slipped to a 16-month low in the European Union. So, I mean, there's a lot of economic numbers out there that gives you a little bit of concern. Contrast that with, I mean, we feel good about our business and we continue to like the areas we operate in. But I just think when you look at some of the economic indicators out there, there's \u2013 it's prudent to be a little bit cautious.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, that's fair. And then, just one more on what you're seeing in terms of the underlying birth rates maybe in different geographies. Have you seen China start to show some improvement? And then, everybody's favorite topic, Zika, whether you've seen that in any particular markets as well? Thanks.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say in the case of China, our people there are suggesting that probably something in high single, low double digit is what we would expect from a birth rate. In the U.S., we're seeing something in the sort of 1% to 2%. And I would say, clearly in Brazil, we've seen a dramatic drop in the birth rate there. Now, it's not a huge business for us, but we're seeing probably a 30%, 40% drop in birth rates in Brazil. And now offsetting that to some extent, I mentioned the fact that we are selling some of our research products into that analysis, but clearly that's impacting us in Brazil more specifically and a little bit in the South America area.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mira Minkova with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Let me go back for a moment to the very strong Environmental business performance in the quarter. It was pretty impressive, particularly that early in the year. Can you maybe give us a little bit of more context behind of \u2013 besides food testing. What did so well in the quarter, how sustainable is it and in the context of your cautions commentary in industrial markets last quarter, how did industrial do? And I do have a follow-up.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I would say, there was \u2013 I would say sort of three drivers to the Environmental strength. One was food; the other was sort of Environmental generally, so more in the sort of air and water area was also a good grower. And then I would sort of spike out China specifically; I talked about the fact that China was double digit growth for us. So, those are the sort of three big drivers.","If you look at industrial specifically, it was down low single digits, and I would say the driver to that was, one, very difficult comparison, so it was up high single digits in Q1 of 2015. And then the other area was we saw a little bit of weakness in what we would call sort of material characterization, which is largely in areas like polymers, maybe a little bit in sort of paints and chemicals. And I would spike that out from the sort of product perspective.","Whether it's sustainable or not, I would say we are not forecasting that type of growth to continue in the year. I mean, I would say that we think Environmental sort of moderates probably more to a lower single digit growth, as we look at in the sort of second, third and fourth quarters.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And on the gross margin, to what extent was the improvement driven by your Lean initiatives or the Lean program, and when might we see a bigger impact from Lean?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think you're going to see that impact from Lean grow as the year progresses. We've said most of our gross margin impact is really going to occur in the second half of the year as these initiatives are rolled out. I think the Lean initiatives probably were about a third of the improvement in the first quarter. I think we did have some pricing initiatives within our Human Health business that contributed another piece and then the incremental volume was probably the third piece.","I think you're going to start to see the Lean initiatives and the productivity initiatives being implemented, within operations, start to accelerate in the second, third and fourth quarters. And as we said, we think our gross margin expansion for the year will be somewhere in the 70 to 80 basis point range. So, being 30 in the first quarter, you can see, it's a fairly rapid acceleration through the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citibank. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, guys. This is actually Brian (40:05) on behalf of Dan. Just jumping a little bit further into EH, I thought it was interesting how strongly the op margin was in the quarter. Correct me if I'm wrong, I think it might be the strongest in at least over five years. So, I just kind of want to see how that run rate goes or should pace going forward, especially in light of the weak China renminbi, et cetera, and if you can give any color around, if that had a drag on EH performance?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, I would say, again, going back to some of the comments we've made previously, where we said we wanted to be very focused in investing in where we saw the greatest growth opportunities. At the same time, we wanted to make sure that we were getting our cost structure appropriate for what potentially could be a slower growth in some of the other areas.","So, you may recall that in the back half of 2015, we took some restructuring actions in the Environmental Health area. And so, I think they've got a cost structure now that hopefully will allow us that margin performance that you saw in the first quarter should be sustainable through 2016 and going forward.","Unknown Speaker","Was there any net dilution from the renminbi there that dragged down results given the highest revenue...?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, not material.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Not material.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And then lastly from me on the services side, is there any large contracts that are coming up this year and can you give us any color across the board on retention rate or at least how retention...?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say in any given year, there are some large contracts that come up \u2013 would rather not get into those specifics \u2013 but I would say these are generally three year contracts, so in any 12 months period, you're going to get some big ones. Our retention rate generally is very high. I would \u2013 so call it north of 85%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Good afternoon guys. So, I just wanted to clarify.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon, Ross.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","On the paddles business, can you just kind of provide us with sort of your thoughts on the pacing for the remainder of the year? And obviously, there's been some mix challenges in that business, how you're sort of thinking about the medium-term growth outlook for that sub-segment even though it's small?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think as \u2013 I think we alluded to it a little bit \u2013 it continues to have a little bit of a headwind. It was down low single digits in the quarter. I think that's probably going to be the case in Q2 again, maybe even a little bit more than that, maybe high single digits. I think as we get to the back half of the year maybe that improves a little bit. But I think our belief right now is for 2016 that's probably flat to down low single digits. And it's just facing some very challenging short-term market headwinds, but at the same time it's got a great team and they continue to execute well. So, the profitability, even given the headwinds from the topline, they continue to sort of operate it \u2013 operating margins above the corporate average. And the challenging thing, you know Ross, that this is the one business where we're component supplier, and obviously, selling into the large hospital CapEx market, it just \u2013 unfortunately a little more volatile than the overall portfolio \u2013 but bottom line, it's a good business.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Fair. And then Andy, I don't know if I missed it, what's your view on cash conversion for the year?","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We \u2013 we're still committed to our delivering one times adjusted net income, which is essentially $300 million. And I had talked earlier about that we had a very strong finish to the year, which did impact us a bit in the first quarter. Most of it is timing, and we've already seen some of that reverse. We had some higher inventory builds for supporting some new products; we think that'll flow through. So, at this point, there's no reason to think we shouldn't be able to hit that one times adjusted net income or $300 million.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Awesome. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Last quarter, you positioned 2016 as an investment year. You did that coming off a quarter where you came up a bit light of your expectations. You set revenue guidance at a pretty low level for the year. Three months later, there's a bit more operating leverage in the quarter than expected and you're bumping growth guidance. So, while R&D investment did grow, I think, it was about 5% in the quarter, I am wondering if you held back on investment in the quarter at least early on, given the uncertainty and concern that you acknowledged back in the Q4 call in February? And now as we look ahead, given that you grew better than expected in the quarter and you guided up expectations, should we expect investment to ramp from here and maybe even more so if you see more upside?","I guess I'm just trying to figure out if we're getting ahead of ourselves given that while you did beat Q1 expectations, organic growth was still only 3.5%, 4% against a favorable comp, which I know you want to do better. And while bumped-up guidance is definitely a step in the right direction, it's still only for 4% growth. So, I am just \u2013 I guess wondering \u2013 whether you feel comfortable at this point ramping up investment pursuant to objectives?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, there's a lot of questions wrapped into that comment. So, first of all, we didn't hold back any R&D. I mean, to some extent, we knew it was going to be ramp up in \u2013 during the year anyway because you're sort of hiring the people and sort of spending the money. But, what I would tell you is, while it looks like our R&D went up roughly $2 million in the quarter, actually it went up $4 million in Human Health and it was down a little bit in Environmental. So, we've been ramping up fairly significantly.","I would say the difference between three months ago and now is not necessarily the fact that we slowed down R&D \u2013 and I think Andy alluded to this to some extent \u2013 it's actually we're seeing the benefits of our productivity and Lean initiatives sooner than we thought. And I would say that's the fundamental reason why we beat in the first quarter. And that's why we felt comfortable taking the entire beat in the first quarter and flowing it through.","But to your point, with regard to will we continue to invest? That's the plan and we continue to expect that in 2016, R&D will be 40 basis points higher as a percentage of revenue than it was in 2015.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Rob, that's super helpful. And if you actually track ahead of plan again at the topline over the next couple of quarters, should we think that you're more likely to reinvest that, given some of the things you're excited about in terms of growth drivers for the out years? Or should we expect kind of a normal balance of reinvestment as well as letting it flow through?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think there'd be probably a normal balance. I mean, there are obviously \u2013 there are some things that we'd like to do \u2013 but one of the things I think I mentioned in the beginning of the year was, we purposely wanted to take our R&D up because we saw some terrific opportunities to invest it in. So, where we saw the opportunities, we're funding them.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with UBS. Your line is now open.","Harris Iqbal - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. This is actually Harris on behalf of Jon, appreciate the question. Kind of a follow-up to your comments earlier on NTD. As you continue to refocus the portfolio, can you walk us through maybe more broadly, everything in that, which product lines make sense for PerkinElmer versus divesting and how far along would you say you are in that process?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I don't know that I want to get into specific businesses, we're either going to keep or sell on the call, quite frankly. But I would say, we have discussions continually with the board regarding whether we're the right owner of the assets. And I would say, right now as we sort look across the portfolio, we think we're right owner. However, if a better owner is willing to pay us a strategic premium to be the better owner, we're willing to look at those types of things. But I think I sort of articulated why we thought NTD made sense to sell, but as of right now, all the businesses we have we think make sense in the portfolio.","Harris Iqbal - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. A couple on the international front, I want to start with Japan. Your commentary there seems a little more cautious and maybe some of the peers that are kind of guiding for status quo to maybe a slight improvement. So, wondering kind of what's behind that? And then in Europe, we had another negative data point from one of the smaller cap tools companies tonight on equipment in Europe. Just wondering what the risks are to that business? And then lastly in China, I didn't hear you quantify what you thought the government tenders on that could do this year, but if you can give any color around that, that would be helpful.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, let me go through. So in Japan, I mean, we were down sort of low-mid single digits in Japan; that's better than what we saw in 2015, but we're still concerned. I think what we've said in the past is, at least in the latter half of the year, we get easier comps. So, I think our view for Japan right now is sort of flat, maybe down a little bit. For us, we're seeing pretty good strength in Environmental, but continued headwinds in Human Health. And a lot it is because we think the academic funding is still not flowing. So, we will continue to be cautious on Japan. But like I said, I think it probably gets better in the second half of the year.","Your question on China with regard to the blood screening, I think as Andy talked about, we had a very strong quarter there. And I would say when we think about 2016 versus 2015, we think that business at least doubles. And I think we've said in the past, that we think over the next couple of years, it's a $50 million business; we think we're well on track to achieve that. So, again, we feel very good about that business. We feel very good about the traction that business is getting and we feel very good about the percentage of tenders we're winning.","Your other question I think was around Europe and was it specifically on product, tell me again, Tycho.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. It was just more on equipment in Europe, I mean, we have two negative data points from tools companies that have missed on system sales in Europe, so I'm just wondering what \u2013 if there's any risk to kind of your outlook there?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Europe for us was sort of mid-single digits and it was fairly even balanced between Human and Environmental Health. I think probably service grew a little faster than products, but I mean, nothing more than just sort of the overall macro concern that we I sort of highlighted before. If you look at some of the data coming out on the sort of production growth in the PMI, it makes you a little cautious. But I think we still feel like Europe's stabilized and should grow in the sort of low to mid-single digits.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess first question, you mentioned the birth rates are down historically in Brazil 30% to 40% as a result of Zika. Obviously, it's an unknown here in the U.S. in terms of how this could expand, but there is some data out to suggest that you could be looking at multiple mosquito species as vectors and so, how are you guys thinking about that as it relates to the potential impact on overall screening in the prenatal space? Thanks.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say we're not really factoring that in in any sort of forecast. I mentioned that I think in the U.S., it was up 1% to 2%, and I think that's what we've assumed in our forecast. We'll see. If that starts to have a more dramatic impact and we see birth rates decline a little bit, we'll sort of adjust accordingly. But I would say right now, that's not our assumption.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. Got it. And then, thanks for the color on the blood screening \u2013 Tycho's question. Do we have a target for when this should be fully penetrated within the China blood collection...?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know that it'll ever be fully penetrated because I think it will continue to grow. But I would say probably 2017 is the \u2013 is where \u2013 you'll probably see sort of a slowdown in instrument placements. But you'll still continue to see sort of reagent growth there, we believe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Thank you. Andy, just a question on the pricing environment. I think you said, strong pricing in Human Health, but I guess, could you give an update more color there and how about pricing in the Environmental side? Thanks.","Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I would say, we typically across PerkinElmer, get pricing specifically around reagents and consumables and some pricing around service. Instruments have been a little bit more of a struggle. On the Human Health side, we implemented some new pricing programs and some discounting programs within our sales organization late in the fourth quarter last year, and we've rolled those out across geographies and we're starting to see the traction, first in the U.S., and we think we'll start to see traction in Europe and Asia to follow. But that's really where it's been focused.","I think we'll probably take some of those learnings and port those over to Environmental Health as well. So hopefully, we can see some upside there. But I'd say, right now, in the consumables and reagents, we do get price typically, and then, of recent which I spiked out, we got some product price on the Human Health side.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say, I think we were a little bit pleasantly surprised by some of the price that was sticking. And we think to some extent, hopefully that speaks to the differentiation nature of some of the new products we are rolling out. So, I think a lot of times when you look at your ability get price, I think that hopefully reinforces the competitive nature of the product. And so, we saw it on a research side; later this year, we're looking to come out with some new products on the Environmental side and hopefully use that as a way to get some price. But I would say on the Environmental side, the price continues to be a little challenging until we get some more of the new products out into the marketplace.","Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then, can you break out how much you got from new products in the quarter, how much revenue?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It was about \u2013 what we would calculate is about $18 million.","Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Good afternoon. Could you provide some color on your microfluidics business, particularly around, if you're seeing a disproportionate penetration of bench-top sequencers versus some of the higher throughput NGS systems? And in what types of labs are you seeing the most interest?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So the microfluidics business did quite well in the quarter. I think it was up high single digits. I would say it was fairly broad-based. So I think we saw that growth across. I mean, I don't know that I can give you specifics into what types of labs that went into, but I would say we continue to see good growth in the microfluidics. And clearly, the NGS labs is a targeted area for us, but I couldn't give you the split.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. And you seem to have \u2013 I think a lot of your businesses had pretty solid growth. I don't know if you really talked a lot about where you're the most surprised, either positively or negatively? Could you get into that?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean on the topline side, we really didn't beat by that much, so I wouldn't say there was a lot of surprises. We spiked that a little bit on food, so food was probably a little bit better than we thought. And also I would say China probably came in a little stronger than we thought. But relative to the topline, we were maybe a little bit better, but not significantly.","I think the real surprise this quarter that we talked about was really on the margin side and I think that really relates to the fact that we're starting to see the flow-through of some of the actions that we put in place, latter part of 2015, a little sooner than we thought.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink. Your line is now open.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you. Rob or Andy, I was hoping you could give us an update on how to size your newborn screening exposure around the globe. So how much of your business is exposed to Brazil versus North America versus elsewhere in your newborn screening?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Brazil newborn for us is in the \u2013 it's less than $20 million.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And Rob, can you talk about where ViaCell fits into the business now? I believe part of the rationale back when you acquired that company, was that there were some synergies between ViaCell and in NTD in terms of call point?","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I would say, first of all, ViaCell in some instances, a stem cell transplant is a cure for some of the things that we uncover in our newborn screenings. So, I think there is a good tie there, and I think first of all, it ties well into our mission from the standpoint of Human and Environmental Health, so I would say that.","And I would say cord blood is an area that I think for 2016, we believe there may be some opportunities here that \u2013 to see some nice growth. We've been participating in some studies and we could see some positive movement here in cord blood, I think, in the foreseeable future.","Operator","At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Rob Friel, for closing remarks.","Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Tommy Thomas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Tommy Thomas","Thank you, Philip. Good afternoon, and welcome to the PerkinElmer's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call are Rob Friel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","If you have not received a copy of our earnings press release, you may get one from the Investors section of our website at www.perkinelmer.com. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website until November 13, 2013.","Before we begin, we need to remind everyone of the Safe Harbor statements that we have outlined in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon and also those in our SEC filings.","Any forward-looking statements made today represent our views only as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements in the future, even if our estimates change. So you should not rely on any of today's forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any day after today.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures we plan to use during this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available as an attachment to our earnings press release. To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during this call that are not reconciled to GAAP in that attachment, we will provide reconciliations promptly.","I'm now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel. Rob?","Robert F. Friel","Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that PerkinElmer achieved a very good performance in the third quarter. Despite a tough prior period comparison, we were able to deliver organic revenue growth of 2%, which was at the high end of our guidance.","Also during the quarter, we expanded adjusted operating margins by 30 basis points and grew adjusted earnings per share by 9% to $0.49, $0.01 better than the top end of our guidance.","With regard to our end-market conditions, we did not experience a significant change from trends we saw in Q2.","In the pharma biotech research market, we continued to experience high single-digit growth, aided by our informatics and service offerings.","In clinical screening and infectious disease, the markets grew mid-single digits, as birthrates in the U.S. continue to grow low single digits and demand remains strong in China.","Both the Environmental and Safety and Industrial markets grew low-single digits during the third quarter, while our academic market was down mid-single digits as budget pressures continued to dampen demand.","Geographically, we saw sequential improvement in the Americas, particularly in the Environmental and Research markets.","However, in Southeast Asia, growth is slowing as a result of delayed capital investments into mostly the industrial end markets, as many countries such as India, are facing currency devaluation.","Despite this uneven macroeconomic environment, we made good progress in areas we can control, including delivering margin expansion and productivity gains during the quarter.","We successfully completed several manufacturing moves into Singapore and China, consolidated some of the legacy Caliper sites into a newly-opened center for innovation and ramped up the functionality of our customer relationship center in Krak\u00f3w, Poland.","As you recall, we took these actions to further simplify and rationalize our global manufacturing footprint, improve our R&D efficiencies and reduce our back-office expenses.","In addition, we made good progress on our growth investments across our key end markets during the quarter. We significantly expanded our relationship with TIBCO for the Spotfire software product, a year after launching our successful collaboration, which brought the power of the Spotfire analytics platform to the global research community, our offering now positions PerkinElmer as the exclusive channel for Spotfire in clinical development and translational medicine.","PerkinElmer is now a single provider of informatics and data visualization tools to all functions of life science companies, from early-stage discovery through development, sales, marketing and manufacturing.","In Diagnostics, we made good headway in expanding our offerings into niche areas and new markets. For example, we saw tangible demand and a very strong tender win rate for nucleic acid test screens from our Haoyuan acquisition in China. As a reminder, the Chinese government has announced that it will mandate these screens for blood testing starting in 2015.","In the food market, later this week at the International Dairy Show in Chicago, we will launch the DairyGuard Milk Powder Analyzer, the first in our new food guard platform series that leverages our frontier FTIR and proprietary algorithms specifically developed for food suppliers and manufacturers. The DairyGuard will be the only system available that tests for unknown adulterants in milk powder to help customers avoid product safety issues and protect their brand image.","These investments in growth, combined with others we have discussed previously, plus the excellent momentum we are experiencing with many of our key customers, reinforces our confidence that we can return to mid-single digit organic growth in 2014.","Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are forecasting that Q4 organic revenue growth will be similar to what we experienced in the third quarter. While revenue growth comparisons to last year become easier this quarter, we believe it is prudent to guide conservatively, given the current conditions in several of our markets and the potential for some impact from the U.S. government shutdown that may result in revenue shifting out of the quarter.","Despite guiding to lower-single-digit organic growth, we believe we can still deliver significant adjusted operating margin improvement in the quarter of greater than 50 basis points, given the positive impact of the productivity actions I previously discussed.","With regard to adjusted EPS guidance for the year, we are increasing the bottom end of our previous range by $0.01 to reflect the third quarter b and reducing the top end of the range by $0.03 due to the revenue risks I've noted. This results in our full year adjusted EPS guidance changing to $2.04 to $2.07, from our previous guidance of $2.03 to $2.10.","I would now like to turn the call over to Andy to share more details on our results.","Frank A. Wilson","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone, and a special good afternoon to everyone in Red Sox nation. Consistent with prior quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our third quarter results and details around our fourth quarter guidance. Then we'll open up the call for questions.","As Rob mentioned earlier, we were very encouraged by our performance in the third quarter as both adjusted and organic revenue came in at the top end of our guidance range. Reported revenue increased by 3%, while adjusted revenue and organic revenue both increased by 2%.","Adjusted revenue for the quarter was $525.1 million as compared to $514.8 million in the third quarter of 2012.","We experienced 4% organic revenue growth in our Environmental Health business, while our Human Health business was flat, primarily due to a difficult comparison to the same period last year.","Looking at our geographical results. Organic revenue increased mid-single digits in the Americas, low-single digits in Asia and declined low-single digits in Europe. We are once again pleased with our performance in China as organic revenue increased low double digits despite our most difficult year-over-year comparison of more than 30%.","We remain encouraged by the strength and resiliency of the demand for our key Environmental and Diagnostics offerings in China, which help address critical needs in that part of the world.","Looking at organic revenue growth by product category. Recurring revenue, which includes reagents, consumables and service, grew high-single digits in the quarter, primarily as a result of continued strength in our OneSource Laboratory Service business and the success of our informatics offerings.","Organic revenue for our instrument and components offerings was down mid-single digit in the quarter, primarily a result of prior-year comparison headwinds at our Medical Imaging business.","From an end market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 56% of reported revenue in the quarter. We serve 2 end markets in Human Health: Diagnostics, which represented 27% of reported revenue; and Research, which represented 29% of reported revenue.","Organic revenue from our Diagnostics business declined low single digits during the third quarter, primarily impacted by the previously mentioned decline in our Medical Imaging business. Excluding Medical Imaging, our Diagnostics business grew mid single digits in the quarter.","We continue to benefit from positive U.S. birthrates and the expansion of our newborn screening solutions in key regions outside the U S. We are particularly pleased with our SYM-BIO infectious disease diagnostic offerings in China, once again delivering organic revenue growth in the mid-teens, as well as the ongoing newborn screening uptake in Asia, which saw organic revenue growth of more than 30%.","As we forecasted on our last earnings call, our Medical Imaging business faced significant headwinds in the quarter with organic revenues declining high-teens, a result of customer ordering patterns and high-teens comparisons versus the same period last year.","We did, however, continued to see good acceptance of our CMOS offering in the marketplace, as evidenced by 2 new industrial product design wins for nondestructive testing applications. For the quarter, CMOS organic revenue grew by more than 20%.","Our Research business delivered low single digit organic revenue growth in the third quarter versus the comparable period in 2012. Despite ongoing funding challenges, we experienced solid demand in our In Vivo business, as well as in our informatics offerings, which were notable standouts in the quarter, particularly in the U.S.","During the quarter, as Rob mentioned, we completed the construction of our new center for innovation located in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. The recent opening of this state-of-the-art facility represents the culmination of our manufacturing and R&D consolidation activities, which began in 2012. This initiative has resulted in the closure of 5 facilities and has afforded us the opportunity to better leverage our manufacturing operations, as well as more effectively focus our R&D efforts across the company.","Moving to Environmental Health, which represents -- the business represented 44% of reported revenue in the third quarter. We serve 3 end markets: Laboratory Services, which represented 19% of reported revenue; Environmental Safety, which represented 17% of reported revenue; and Industrial, which represented 8% of reported revenue.","During the quarter we experienced mid single digit organic revenue growth in our Laboratory Services business and low single digit organic revenue growth in both our Industrial and Environmental and Safety businesses.","We are pleased with the organic revenue growth in the third quarter. And while customers continue to be cautious with their capital spending, we continue to be encouraged by strong order demand in China.","We experienced another solid quarter of organic revenue growth in our Laboratory Services business, as we help our lab customers better manage their critical laboratory assets and related data needs. Our OneSource business saw a robust revenue growth, driven by an expansion of services within several major pharmaceutical companies during the quarter.","Turning to our margin performance in the period. Adjusted gross margins were 47.4% as compared to 48.3% in the third quarter of 2012. While currency was a headwind in the quarter, the decline in gross margin is primarily due to 3 factors: First, we incurred one-time costs related to the closure of 2 additional facilities we highlighted in Q2, in conjunction with the establishment of our center of innovation. As mentioned earlier, this effort is now largely complete and we expect gross margin savings in the fourth quarter as a result.","Second, within informatics, we deployed investments supporting our rollout of Spotfire into a number of new channels.","And third, we continue to face product mix headwinds and modest pricing pressures in our environmental business, primarily focused in emerging markets.","Adjusting operating margins in the third quarter were 15.5% as compared to 15.2% in the comparable period a year ago. Restructuring efforts and operating expense controls enabled us to offset the lower adjusted gross margins just mentioned.","By segment, adjusted operating margins in our Human Health business increased approximately 80 basis points to 22.4% as compared to 21.6% in the third quarter of 2012. The increase was primarily the result of positive product mix and operating expense controls.","In our Environmental Health business, adjusted operating margins declined approximately 60 basis points to 10.6% as compared to 11.2% in the third quarter of 2012. This decrease was the result of price and product mix headwinds just mentioned.","GAAP operating income from continuing operations was $57.2 million in the third quarter of 2013 versus $43.2 million in the same period a year ago. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2013 was $0.36 compared to $0.25 in the third quarter last year.","Adjusted earnings per share was $0.49 in the third quarter of 2013, $0.02 above the midpoint of our guidance range.","On a non-GAAP basis, our adjusted tax rate was approximately 19%.","Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the third quarter with approximately $900 million of debt and approximately $130 million of cash. We exited the quarter with a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.4x and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.1x.","Looking at our cash flow performance year-to-date, adjusted operating cash flow from continuing operations was $161.8 million, up 8% as compared to $150.3 million in 2012. Adjusted operating cash flows are expected to continue to improve in Q4, primarily the result of lower working capital needs.","Turning to our Q4 of 2013 guidance. As Rob mentioned, there continues to be headwinds across many of our end markets. And as a result of these headwinds, we believe it's prudent and appropriate to be conservative in our outlook.","There are 2 specific areas that I'd like to discuss further. First, we are forecasting a softer performance in certain emerging markets, where we experienced a modest slowing in the third quarter this year. We believe recent currency fluctuations in certain geographies, including India and Southeast Asia, have dampened capital spending in these regions and we believe these markets will continue to moderate.","Secondly, a large majority of our highly sensitive instruments are shipped overseas and require the issuance of government export licenses. As the recent government shutdown has directly impacted this area, we are currently waiting for the government to work through this backlog but expect the delay to have an impact on fourth quarter revenues.","We also expect the total revenue impact of these initiatives to be in the range of $10 million to $12 million in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we expect adjusted revenue for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $582 million to $592 million, which assumes low single-digit organic revenue growth.","Regarding adjusted operating margins, despite the impact from the revenue headwinds mentioned above, we estimate adjusted operating margins will improve in the range of 60 to 80 basis points for the fourth quarter.","Our Q4 and full year adjusted tax rate is expected to be 21% and our weighted average diluted share count for the year is assumed to be approximately 113 million shares.","We expect interest and other expense to be approximately $12.5 million in the fourth quarter.","So based on these assumptions, we now expect our Q4 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.71.","This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","It's actually Dave Clair in for Bill. I guess the first one for me, it sounds like the In Vivo business is going pretty well for you guys. What's behind the growth there and what's your outlook going forward?","Robert F. Friel","So yes, as you point out, In Vivo grew probably mid single digits in the quarter. And going back to the first quarter of this year, where we -- there were some delays in the ordering pattern there, we think we're catching up in Q2 and Q3. We saw a very strong growth in the U.S. and I think that was -- we're starting to see some of the funds that have been tied up in sequestration being released. So like I said, we saw very strong growth in the U.S. And I think that's what's driving some of the growth in this quarter. But fundamentally, I think this is a good product and I think it's an attractive market. And I think we continue to believe that this is a product that probably grows high single digits once we get through some of the issues with the sequestration.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, great. And then can you give us an update on the AxION iQT launch? How is that going and is that hitting internal expectations?","Robert F. Friel","So we continue to be very excited about the iQT offering as well as the longer-term opportunities, we see to leverage the platform. It continues to garner a lot of interest and we remain encouraged by the current interest levels from both customers and KOLs. We purposely have a little bit of a minor delay due to -- attributable to some supplier issues and have used that time to build out our application support for several key market segments that have been identified based on customer feedback. The delay will have a minimal impact on our Q4 revenue. But again, because of some supplier issues, it's been pushed back a short period of time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","On the panel business, I mean, the weakness was expected rather than you guys highlighted last call. I admit it, my memory serves me poorly but I thought we were supposed to get -- I thought that was more of a timing issue than something related to demand. And so as we look at the 4Q assumption, do we get some of that back? Is that a 2014 revenue line now? I'm just trying to get a sense for the sequential...","Robert F. Friel","So specifically in the Q3, it was really a year-over-year comp issue. I think we talked about this before based on some ordering patterns. Our customers ordered a lot of panels in 2012. As we think about Q4 now, we think this business returns to probably mid single digit growth. And as we go out into '14, we think that level may be even a little better than that. So it returns to a more normal growth rate, where we think it's sort of a mid to high single digit growth business. But again, Q3 was driven more by ordering patterns in 2012 that caused the decline, or drove a lot of the decline in Q3.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So I guess just mathematically, by that going from a high-teens decline or to a -- to growth, it's got a pretty upward impact on organic. I guess I'm just trying to see what the delta is. I mean, the comp sequentially is not tougher. So I'm just trying to get a sense for how much kind of conservatism you're putting into the revenue forecast, just based on all the uncertainty. I know you called out some of the delays. It's just the first time we've heard of that. So I'm just trying to figure out how much is you sort of assuming stuff doesn't get shipped because you don't have the export licenses plus some of the shutdown on the consumable side, plus anything else in the emerging markets versus sort of some of this we're getting back. I'm just trying to tease out...","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I would say, relative to our original forecast at Q4, about half of that is attributable to -- and again, this is -- we're trying to estimate this based on the backlog that's at the government export license right now. But we think that could be sort of half of the issue. And we think the other half is potentially just some slowing in the selective emerging markets, as Andy talked to. It's really just a couple of the areas in Southeast Asia, where we believe that we've seen a fairly dramatic devaluation of their currency and at least we're seeing some impact there in the industrial end markets. So again, probably $5 million there and probably $5 million potential risk associated with the government licenses. And again, you hadn't heard about it before because it's never been an issue. I mean, this is something that generally works well. But I think because of the shutdown of the government, we're stacking up against a relatively tight timeframe to get this stuff out.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","No, that's appreciated. And maybe for Andy, on the margins, you've done quite well relative to what's been a tough top line or tougher than an average year. How does -- sort of the progression we've had so far this year, how does it make you think about your multiyear targets? Do you still feel good about where that is? Is it more a top line dependent now? I'm just trying to get a sense for -- have you sort of back solved with costs for your multiyear plan or maybe the revenue outlook kind of puts a little bit of a question mark next to it?","Frank A. Wilson","Ross, I think we've always said that in order to achieve our 4-year goals, we really needed mid single-digit organic growth. So I think when we don't get that, it makes it much more difficult. But if I step back and look at what we've done to-date, I think we've made great progress on the initiatives we've talked about over the last several years, I think certainly the last several quarters. We may have been a little bit late with the center of innovation at Hopkinton, but it is now up and running. And I think we're going to start see good savings from that. I think Project Rabbit [ph] continues to ramp as we try to get supply chain savings. This is our name for the movement of the manufacturing over to Asia. And then on the operating expense side, we should be completely moved in to Krakow by the end of this year, so we will have all of our European back-office operations basically domiciled now in Krakow. So there's a number of savings opportunities that are now getting close to or are already completed. So I think, structurally, we're going to have a very good position. I think we still need that organic growth to drive significant leverage on that, but I feel very good about where we are today with those initiatives.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Capital Markets.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Hi, Rob. Could you point to -- what was it chromatography, spectroscopy, what end markets as well on the Environmental Health side? Does it continue to be what a shallow recovery and weak or -- what exactly was it?","Robert F. Friel","So Paul, actually, when you look at it from a technology perspective, the 4% growth in the third quarter, it was fairly broad-based. So whether it was chromatography, Metcar or inorganic, we saw similar levels of growth, call it sort of low to mid single digit growth across the entire product portfolio. So we were pleased to see that. Andy mentioned the fact that OneSource continued to do well. If you look at it geographically, what you see is good growth in the Americas, again sort of mid single digits, a slight decline in Europe, sort of low single digits, and continued strong penetration in China. So in the Environmental area, China again was sort of north of 20%.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And then on the facility consolidation, could you go over that again? I mean, you've said it's 5 facilities, I think it was less than that when you spoke to it a year ago or so. And did it start just recently or at the beginning of the quarter? When was the exact timing you expect to see benefit from that?","Robert F. Friel","Right. So our initial plan was to consolidate 3 facilities, one of them in Canada, 2 of those in the West Coast into Hopkinton. And then in Q2, particularly post Q1 when we saw a revenue growth lower than we anticipated, we made the decision to put 2 additional facilities in the Hopkinton. And again, Andy alluded to the little bit of pressure on the gross margin in this quarter, getting that completed. Those are now done. Last week, we actually kicked off the opening of the Hopkinton Center. And as Andy said, it's a workplace facility and we're quite excited about it. So our expectation is we'll start to see benefits in Q4. It is to some extent why you're seeing, or at least we're forecasting, greater than 50 basis points of operating margin expansion despite guiding to low single digit growth. So some of those productivity savings that we've been talking about over the last couple quarters, we expect to start seeing in Q4 and obviously as we get into 2014.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","My first question is -- and I apologize if I missed this in your prepared remarks. Did you talk about growth in Japan and specifically how stimulus is impacting your performance in that geography? And how should we think about the outlook from here related to stimulus?","Robert F. Friel","So we didn't talk about Japan specifically, but Japan in the quarter grew across the company low single digits. I think it was around 3%. And I think we're starting to see some benefit from the stimulus, but it's not a significant driver to the growth at this point. We hope, as we get -- sort of probably into '14 is where we'll hope to see more of an impact for that. And I would say, our expectation continues to be in sort of low to mid single digits, maybe increasing a little bit as we get into '14, as we get -- as I said, some of the benefits of participating in the additional funding being provided by the government. So I think since Q1, we've continued to see sequential improvement in Japan and I think that will continue for the next couple of quarters.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And during the quarter, Merck announced plans to rationalize some of their R&D efforts. I believe Merck's a customer of yours. I can see where this would be potentially a threat to revenues. I can also see where this would be really good opportunity for you to go in and work with them as they work through this process. Could you just help us understand how we should think about either this announcement specifically or more broadly, whether the things like this are really a threat or really an opportunity for you?","Robert F. Friel","So I would say, first of all, whenever one of our customers or sort of a group of companies announces a restructuring, it can be difficult for a number of constituents. However, as you sort of point out, if you think about the logic and the rationale for these types of announcements, it's all around becoming more efficient in how they run their R&D facilities. And that really sort of plays into the strategy of not only OneSource, but real -- our emphasis in informatics. And as you point out, while specific to certain customers, there may be some minor impacts. But quite frankly, that's offset by other outsourcing opportunities around relocation, scientific services and asset management, sort of more than offsets that. But when we think about the opportunity to penetrate more pharmaceutical companies with our OneSource and informatics offerings, we think this provides a tremendous opportunity. And we talked about the fact that OneSource had a nice growth in Q3. And so the dialogue now around driving productivity in the pharma and biotech markets, being somewhat necessitated by the restructuring actions, is really driving great demand, again, not only for OneSource but as our informatics capabilities are being deployed into OneSource to enable customers to better understand the capital purchases they need to make and the utilization of their assets within their labs, I think it's just going to create a great opportunity to further penetrate what we think is probably a $1.5 billion to $2 billion market opportunity, where we're just scratching the surface right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citigroup.","Nicholas Nohling","This is Nick Nohling in for Amit today. First off, could you talk a little bit just about trends in emerging markets. I mean, it seems coming into the quarter, you were a little bit more cautious on the emerging markets in the second half. And it seems like pretty much your market performance is pretty good in the quarter, but you did cite some moving parts there. So what's going to lead to the slowdown? Is China going to be as strong also to offset some of these other EM government regulation concerns?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. So first of all, to clarify, we continue to see good growth. And emerging markets, generally speaking, specifically and China did well and Brazil did well. I think our comments were really talking about a subset of those countries, particularly where there's been -- at least our belief, has been influenced by currency devaluations. So I think a good example is India, where the rupee is down double digits over the last couple quarters. And of course as a local company buying product that's dollar based, that's dramatically increasing the price of those products. And so we're seeing, in Southeast Asia and in India, specifically, slowing demand where historically that's been sort of a solid mid-teens grower, and that's moderating into sort of mid to high single digits. And so that's where we're just sort of teeing up as a little concerning. It's -- 1 point doesn't make a trend. But as we go into Q4, we're concerned that we're not going to see a moderation of the currency pressure and therefore, that's going to continue to put pressure on capital purchases, and like I said, particularly in the industrial markets where there's maybe some more flexibility in deferring them, those purchases for maybe 1 or 2 quarters. We don't think this is necessarily a longer-term trend, but it's just something that we have identified. But again, to reinforce, in places like China and Brazil, we continue to see very good strength.","Nicholas Nohling","Okay, great. And then when you think about 2014, you are confident that you can get back up to mid single digit growth, what are the businesses that you look at to see the inflection point that's going to get the overall company to get back into that mid single digit? Is it a turnaround in the industrial business? Where is the focus points to where the business is going to turn?","Robert F. Friel","So I would say, when we talk about mid single digit growth for '14, the assumption is that the fundamental end markets are not going to change significantly. And so what's going to make the difference to a large sense is either comps in our business and, particularly, where we talk about Medical Imaging. So when I was discussing with Ross earlier, if you look at 2012, we had a very strong growth in Medical Imaging, clearly greater than the market. And in hindsight, it was really probably some ordering patterns that our customer, maybe sort of built some inventory. And we had to sort of burn that off in '13. So Medical Imaging will probably not grow in '13. And going into '14, we think we'll have that inventory burned off, and you'll see sort of normal market growth of sort of mid to high single digits. So that's an indication where it's more unique to our business rather than market. And then I think the other areas are largely driven by new product introductions or fundamental changes in the businesses that we think can -- should allow us to get to more of a mid single digit organic growth.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Rob, can you elaborate a bit on Europe? How did the orders pace through the quarter? And I guess, given where you left off in September, what are you thinking for 4Q there? I think comps get a little bit easier year-over-year.","Robert F. Friel","Yes. So when we look -- and I would say this is true not only of Europe but we didn't see a significant change in ordering patterns really through the quarter relative to, let's say, period periods -- previous periods. So consequently, our view is that Europe in Q4 looks probably fairly similar to Q3. And for us, it was sort of slightly down, down low single digits. So that's our assumption. In fact, when we look at Q4 generally from a geographic perspective, our assumption is, it really looks very similar to Q3. So Europe down slightly, America is in the sort of low- to mid-single digits and Asia probably more mid single digits.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And when we think about your assumption that the end market conditions next year are unchanged, should we think about the natural improvement in the business that you would get just from macroeconomic conditions being slightly better on, say, GDP, view as serving as an offset to something on the Human Health side? Or would be upside? Just sort of where your expectation's were...","Robert F. Friel","No. I would say right now, if there was a better GDP growth in 2014, I think that probably would be more -- I would think of that more of upside, than I would as sort of offsetting concerns in other parts of the business.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of -- from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Andy, could you quantify the 3 factors that contributed to the gross margin pressure in the third quarter? And then as we'd look into the fourth quarter margin ramp, what are some of the puts and takes between mix, restructuring and otherwise that gives you confidence in the uptick, sequentially?","Frank A. Wilson","Yes, of the 3 items I would say the first 2 I mentioned, which is really around investments as we opened up the center of innovation. And the second one...","Robert F. Friel","The informatics.","Frank A. Wilson","The informatics, I would say that's probably about a little less than half of the impact. And I would say the remainder of that would have been the margin headwinds, the mix headwinds in emerging -- in the Environmental Health. So that's the way I would split it. I think if you look at the fourth quarter, we are going to start to see an improvement in the gross margins because we've now completed the Hopkinton transition. We also have completed, as I spoke before, the transition to Asia, which provides us with some savings also on the margin side as we optimize our supply chain. And then there were some minor restructuring that will also help us in the fourth quarter. So I see -- there could be some continued pressures within Environmental Health but I think we'll be able to offset some of those, one, by not having to spend in the fourth quarter, but two, we're starting to realize the savings of those initiatives that we have completed.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then on the cash flow front, pretty nice progress on the DSO side but still only about 70% free cash flow conversion. How should we think about that metric as we look out into '14? And was there also a divestiture benefit in the investing cash flow line as well?","Frank A. Wilson","It was. It was a small -- it was the divestiture at an Asian facility but it was single-digit, $1.5 million. The way to look at I think cash flow going forward is, certainly in the last 2 or 3 quarters, we've seen a buildup of inventory. As we started to do consolidation activities around the manufacturing facilities, we've had to had duplicative levels of inventory. I think you'll start to see those bleed down in the fourth quarter. I think you'll also start to see those improve as we get through the year. I think on the DSO side and the receivables side, that continues to be a challenge. We have -- I think have made good progress against our aging, but we have a lot of customers that are putting additional pressure on stretching those receivables out. So we continue to have to manage that. But I think all-in, I think we should start to see more of a normalization of that working capital and I think that will eventually end up allowing us to get closer to that 1:1 conversion of net income to free cash flow, but we have a ways to go to get there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Rob, I wanted to go back to the comments you made earlier on OneSource. It sounds like you're getting good traction there. Can you just talk to the degree that this is going deeper with existing customers? Or are these competitive wins? And then to what degree are you bundling informatics? You called that out as a decent opportunity. So I'm just wondering how often [indiscernible]","Robert F. Friel","As I would say, when you think about the growth we've seen, it's really a little bit of both. So it's continuing to do more with our existing customers, but we've had a couple of nice wins here in the first couple of quarters of the year. And that puts a little pressure on gross margins as well. Andy didn't talk about that. But when we win a OneSource contract, there's obviously some investments upfront to do that and obviously that improves the profitability going forward. But I think, we have had some nice wins. I would say not as much as penetration outside of pharma up to this point and I think that provides another opportunity, but we continue to see opportunity there. But I would say, we're not getting as much traction there. With regard to the informatics business and the deployment into OneSource, we've got a number of sites where we're doing that but that's still probably a relatively small percentage of revenue. But we think it's a nice opportunity for us and it provides a significant differentiation. And I think when you talk to the customers as to why they chose or choose PerkinElmer in a lot of these competitive situations, I think the capability to bundle informatics and our historical OneSource capability is a big factor.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then if we think about the labs business you guys just launched, the pre-eclampsia screening test, can you maybe just talk about how you think about that opportunity and then further menu buildout? Is there ongoing opportunity? Can you just talk to the investments there?","Robert F. Friel","I think as we look at our screening business, whether it's newborn or prenatal, we continue to see that as a good growth opportunity and it's both sort of penetrating new markets but continuing to build out the menu. And I would say the menu expansion as well as the penetration of additional, whether it's countries or reaching more children, it's all contributed to our view that this is an area of the business that I think can over a long period of time grow mid- to high-single digits. And so in any given period, it may be driven by penetration into countries or markets or it may be driven by menu expansion.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then one last one on Imaging and actually on In Vivo Imaging, so for Caliper, can you just talk about how that business, I mean, you had a nice recovery last quarter after the March quarter issues? But can you maybe just talk to whether that business is kind of back on track and the outlook there?","Robert F. Friel","Yes. So it grew mid-single digits in the third quarter. So again, this has been a little bit less than what we've seen historically. And I think sequestration continues to have an impact on dampening some of demand there. But I think we continue to feel very good about that business. And I think, as we go into '14, we think that will be a big contributor getting to that mid single digit organic growth we talked about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Zarak Khurshid from Wedbush Securities.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","So the developments with A1 sound pretty interesting. Can you provide a little color just on the broader opportunity there, and timing around the Chinese mandate and tenders and other opportunities in Asia?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, so as you pointed out, we were -- we feel good about that. There were 7 tenders in the last quarter and we won 5 of those. So we feel good about our win rate. I would say the revenue ramp-up has not been as significant as we would like because some of the locations in China are sort of late in funding it. As you may know, the Chinese government mandates nucleic acid testing for blood screening by beginning of 2015. So there's still some time to ramp up. But we feel good about our win rate and we think this provides a significant market growth opportunity for us. But I would say, the revenue is still sort of the single million dollar range. It will start to ramp in '14, but I think you'll see the real growth occur in the 2015 timeframe.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Great. That's very helpful. And then the DairyGuard opportunity sounds pretty interesting to us. Can you just maybe talk about the -- I guess, the selling process there, in terms of -- are these current customers that you're already selling into? And how does that business look in terms of a razor, razor blade model and just overall opportunity?","Robert F. Friel","So we have a good food business today. It continues to do well. And think of this as a new product offering. I think in a lot of these end markets it's all around getting innovation into the marketplace that allows our customers to be able to find things that they couldn't see before, again, sensitivity, speed, accuracy and those types of things. So we're excited about the opportunity. As I mentioned, this is utilizing our FTIR capability combined with some significant capabilities that we have around algorithms. So we think it's an exciting market for us. We do think this is a unique offering in the marketplace from the perspective of there's not an analyzer today out in the marketplace that can look at powdered milk for pollutants or adulterants. And so it's early days. Like I said, it's going to be introduced at a dairy show here on Friday. But we feel good about it. We have a channel into food already. And so this will be largely through our direct channel into the food industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So one housekeeping question. Top line FX impact you're looking for in Q4?","Frank A. Wilson","It will be a little less than 100 basis points, which is similar to what it was last year.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. Okay. And there's been some chatter coming out of China about potentially relaxing the 1-child policy. Have you heard anything on that recently? And obviously it will be a positive for your business if that were to happen.","Robert F. Friel","So I would say we've heard the same chatter that you have. But I would -- we don't have any more definitive information as to when that might be relaxed. But like you said, there's a lot of discussion around that. And obviously, that would be a positive for the business. And we think probably over time, it will probably to take a couple of years to ramp up, but it could lead to a $20 million to $25 million increase in revenue for us over multiple years.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. You mentioned something about some pricing pressure in the environmental markets, if I heard you correctly. Was that local vendors or is that the usual suspects just being a little bit more aggressive in the emerging markets?","Robert F. Friel","I would say probably more of the latter. And where you see it more aggressively is in government tenders.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you. Just one final question. A lot of noise recently in the bioinformatics space, a lot of acquisitions obviously, big push on it. What's going on with Spotfire and Geospiza. And I guess, are you -- can you talk about a little bit about how you're -- are you winning any new contracts, what's going on in terms of the growth rate? I'm always still a little bit curious on how to model that business.","Robert F. Friel","So first of all, I think the noise in that area hopefully validates that it's attractive, so we feel good about that. So as I think about our approach, it's really targeted at really a higher level of integration of information. So we're quite excited about the Spotfire clinical deal. And when we combine that with our previous capabilities, think of our approach as really building a platform through the interface of research in clinical, so really more focus on translational opportunities. And of course, that leverages our knowledge, not only in the research area, but our experience in diagnostics. So we're sort of more of a platform play across research and clinical versus a specialized play on a particular technology. So maybe that helps you sort of differentiate that. And Andy alluded to this in his comments, we continue to see nice growth in informatics. We continue to get good traction with particularly the large pharma. In particular, we had a user group meeting here a couple of weeks ago where we had, what we call, the Executive Customer Advisory Board. It's attended by the top 15 global pharmaceutical companies. And they continue to sort of embrace our strategy of this sort of translation opportunity in medicine. So we continue to be quite excited about it. And we think it can grow double digits for the foreseeable future from a top line perspective. And obviously, this is a business that has very nice operating margins associated with it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the newborn business, just wondering if you put a little more color on the trends you saw this quarter geographically. Any notable tenders on the horizon as well just outside the U.S. that we should be aware of?","Robert F. Friel","Well, the U.S. we get helped by the growth -- in birth. For us it looks like it's about a 2% number, sort of low single digits. We saw some nice growth in South America. And I think Andy mentioned the fact that in China, we continue to see good adoption there, so very strong growth in APAC. We did not see as much growth in the EMEA region. And I think some of that was just some delay in spending. We did get some pushout -- we had mentioned a number of years ago that we had put some big installations into the Middle East. And some of the disruption there I think has delayed some investment. So from a geographic perspective, Europe sort of down slightly, Americas, call it mid single digits, South America and APAC very strong growth, sort of north of 20%.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just a follow-up on the Caliper franchise. If we look across the NGS landscape, a lot of the major players there have made some interesting technology acquisitions and sample prep. You guys have obviously had a pretty good track record in playing around the edges there pretty successfully. Just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about the long-term plus maybe you have regarding a new product development and how you plan to participate in the continued growth of sequencing, as we look towards toward 2014 and beyond?","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I think it's similar to what we've talked about in the past, where we think there's real value opportunity in the sequencing workflow to be in the front end, in the automation and sample prep. And we'll continue to innovate there. It's an area we continue to make significant investments. We hope to come out with some products hopefully in '14 that will continue to advance innovation in that area. And also in the back end, in the informatics area and leveraging what we're doing with Geospiza and now using some of the capabilities with Spotfire. So I think our strategy will continue to be in those focused areas. And as you're pointing that out, that's -- we think that's a nice growth area and I think we're well-positioned in those 2 spaces.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan with Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to figure out, maybe on the fourth quarter guidance, I know you called out the $10 million to $12 million, the kind of one-timers. If we strip those out, like, can you just give us a high level view, how would you characterize the demand environment for your businesses in the fourth quarter? We think stable, maybe weakening a bit, improving a bit? How would you think about it from a high level?","Robert F. Friel","No, I think it's stable, as I sort of alluded to, with the exception of Medical Imaging, which is really sort of a year-over-year comp issue, and so we're looking to see some improvement there. But I think order trends, and I talked about even toward the latter part of Q3, I think are fairly stable here. So we've got some concerns as we voiced in this sort of $10 million. But other than that, we feel pretty good about the demand profile in the market.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe, Andy, to the extent the environment remains muted possibly, we don't get this industrial recovery that could mean, maybe PMI does, I suggest and it doesn't translate into increased demand and we get to '14 and the top line hasn't recovered to the extent you hoped for, how much of the margin expansion is in your control, given the discrete actions you guys have already taken, and how much is dependent upon top line? Such that, let's say, you grew 3% next year, what -- can you frame a little bit of a margin sensitivity towards maybe a 3% growth and a 6% growth or however you want to phrase it to give us a sense of how much is in your control?","Frank A. Wilson","Maybe I'll take it to an even more draconian level and say if we really are kind of volume neutral going forward, we have a certain amount of savings that should generate about 100 basis points of margin expansion. And as we start to look out at the top line starting to improve, I think if we get to that 5% to 6%, mid-single digit level that we hope to in 2014, we have some fairly significant leverage, not only on the gross margin line but even more significantly in the operating margin line. But I think we've -- in the past, when we've been at those levels and we've been able to do certainly well north of 100, in some cases, north of 150, I think we're in a much better position today. So I think if we can get to those types of revenue numbers, we should see some fairly robust margin expansion.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe one more, just on the acquisition strategy, I know you guys have discussed how, given the business is optimized, you feel you have the right pieces to the puzzle but now you're looking at maybe some tuck-ins here incrementally. I just want to go back to the Thermo Life deal and just kind of check in with you guys now. I think you guys have discussed in the past your OneSource business, which is critical and growing nicely, is sticky, given some of the informatics business as you can put on that. But just stepping back, I just would love to get your take on the acquisition strategy, kind of going forward from here, whether directly addressing Thermo Life or just how do you think about opportunities as they come up?","Robert F. Friel","So I think you've characterized it well from the standpoint of, we feel good about the portfolio but always looking for opportunities to improve it, and so, I think right now, our approach is continually look at bolt-ons and look in those areas where we can continue to be differentiated in our offerings. So I think one of the reasons, I mentioned before that we've been successful in OneSource is when we combine it with deploying the informatics capability, that starts to really differentiate us in the marketplace. And so that's the area that we want to focus on. So obviously, the Imaging area is an area that we like both from a growth perspective and our internal capabilities. You know our emerging diagnostic capabilities are ones that we think we can continue to build and work off the terrific channel we have there. And so again it's going to be probably focused in those areas where we both have good market positions today but also see nice growth prospects and continue to differentiate us from other competitors.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Just a couple of quick ones. One, I was wondering if you could tell us how much of your total revenue comes from places like India and Southeast Asia, or maybe just emerging markets minus China or something like that?","Frank A. Wilson","Yes. This is Andy. Our total emerging market exposure is around 28% and. I would say, China is around 11%, 12% of that and the rest is pretty widely distributed. In total, it's a little north of 25% of our total revenue.","Robert F. Friel","But India specifically is around 2% to 3%. And if you look at Southeast Asia as a whole, it probably adds another 6%-ish. So southeast Asia and India will be something sort of south of 10%.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Okay, got you. And then just on your guidance I guess, for the fourth quarter, for the full year, I understand the $10 million to $12 million of revenue impact. Is that the main driver to the top end of your EPS guidance coming down? Is that the right way to think about it? Because I also saw you're saying your effective tax rate is also going to come down 1% as well. I'm just trying to think about what the moving pieces are there.","Robert F. Friel","Yes, I mean that's the major driver to coming off the top end, because I think we felt that in order to get to top end of our guidance previously, we would have had to have been closer to the top end of the revenue guidance. And I think because of some of the things we talked about before, we think it's right now prudent to sort of guide down and, consequently, if we're not going to get to the top end of the revenue, it's unrealistic to think we get to the top end of the EPS.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Okay, got you. And then just final thing, there was an article in the press a week or so ago talking about some air quality monitoring business that you've won in China. I'm just wondering if you could provide any more color or timing or size on that.","Robert F. Friel","Yes. So that's a partnership we have with the China State Environmental Protection Administration. And it's really a partnership with them to help set the air quality standards as well as test for heavy medical particles in the air. To me it sort of speaks to the terrific relationships and capabilities we have broadly in emerging markets but specifically in China. And I would say, for the next couple of quarters, I wouldn't think of it is a huge revenue driver. But I think, again, it's the relationships we build with the government agencies. And as we come out with more innovation and new products, I think it opens up the opportunity to grow fairly significantly. And as you know, China is dedicating a significant amount of resources to improve their air quality. So we're quite excited about it. But I would say for the next couple of quarters, that's not going to be a significant revenue contributor.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Leerink Swann.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to clarify, so did gross margin in the quarter, did it come in line with your internal plan or was there some variance from plan?","Frank A. Wilson","It was down slightly from plan, partly because of some of the mix shift that we saw in Environmental Health. We had not forecasted that level of mix and mix headwinds.","Robert F. Friel","Yes. So when Andy talked about the 3 factors, clearly the informatics investment was in our plan. Post the Q2 announcement to move those other 2 facilities in, we suspected there will be a little bit of additional cost through our cost of sales line. But I think the mix and to some extent the pricing pressure was a little bit more than we thought.","Frank A. Wilson","And I think the last item is we had really hoped to complete the Hopkinton move at the beginning of the third quarter. We really didn't open the facility until the beginning of the fourth quarter. So the savings we had hoped to get will -- are still there. They're just pushed out a quarter.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, can you give us an update on how a couple of your important growth drivers for '14 are tracking, maybe something around the order book for the iQT and also the cell-free fetal DNA?","Robert F. Friel","So I mentioned little bit before that we continue to see good receptivity in the marketplace as we talk to potential customers and KOLs, but because of a specific supplier issue around one of the components the actual shipment of the product will not occur until the first quarter of 2014. Again, minimal impact in Q4. And we really don't think it's going to have a significant impact in 2014 as well. Again but based on early indications, we feel good about that. And we continue to make nice progress on our contracting with regard to NIPT. I think now we're up over 160 million covered lives. And again we feel good about the growth opportunities but that will also be more of a 2014 growth driver. Some revenue this year, but relatively small.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","You said that supply issue is not going to impact you on iQT, that's not going to impact you in 2014?","Robert F. Friel","No, we don't think -- minimal but not much of a big impact. It's a supplier issue, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Criscuolo from Mizuho.","Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","On the facility relocations, specifically, the international relocations, does that have any positive effect on the tax rate going forward?","Frank A. Wilson","Well, we do have an opportunity with Singapore to leverage our tax planning. So there is potentially a modest benefit from that. I think it really -- the bigger fluctuations around the tax rate really are around where our operating income is domiciled. So I think it's difficult to say or pinpoint how much it's going to be. It is somewhat of a tailwind. And as we kind of move through '14, we'll probably update you on that progress.","Robert F. Friel","Yes. But I would say by moving the manufacturing out, it does put some downward pressure on the tax rate.","Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Got you. And on the informatics, the bioinformatics businesses that you have, do they have similar margin profiles to the typical software industry margins?","Robert F. Friel","So it depends a little bit on what part of the software business. So I would say, the electronic notebook business, I would say, yes. The Spotfire is a little lower because -- think of that as sort of a licensing agreement, so still very good margins. But because we're paying some licensing to TIBCO for that, there's lower margins associated with the Spotfire business as compared to the electronic notebook business.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Rob Friel for closing remarks.","Robert F. Friel","Great. Well, first of all, thank you for your questions. So in summary, I'm pleased with how the company is executing on balancing growth investments while being responsive to global economic conditions. Again, just to reinforce, I remain confident we have created a really great foundation to deliver long-term value to our shareholders while helping customers solve critical challenges in both Human and Environmental Health. Thank you for your continued interest in PerkinElmer and have a great evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day."]}}
