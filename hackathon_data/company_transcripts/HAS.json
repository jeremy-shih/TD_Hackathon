If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. ","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Debbie Hancock, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning are Brian Goldner, Hasbro's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Deb Thomas, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer. ","Today, we will begin with Brian and Deb providing commentary on the company's performance, and then we will take your questions. Our earnings release was issued this morning and is available on our website. Additionally, presentation slides containing information covered in today's earnings release and call are also available on our site. ","The press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP adjustments and non-GAAP financial measures. Our call today will discuss certain adjusted measures, which include these non-GAAP adjustments. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the release and presentation. Please note that whenever we discuss earnings per share, or EPS, we are referring to earnings per diluted share. ","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management's expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters. There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. Some of those factors are set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our most recent 10-Q, in today's press release and in our other public disclosures. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call. ","I would now like to introduce Brian Goldner. Brian?","Brian Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The Hasbro teams around the world are doing an excellent job navigating a challenging and dynamic industry environment. We remain focused on executing our Brand Blueprint to profitably grow for the long term. Our strong financial position enables us to continue investing in our brands, in consumer insights, in innovation, in storytelling and in our teams while making strategic long-term decisions to accelerate our efforts and to advance our business. ","The global retail environment is rapidly evolving. How consumers discover brands, engage with brands and ultimately purchase products within brands are converging. Consumers' shopping and buying actions are moving in all directions, from brick-and-mortar to omni-channel, while adding mobile. Hasbro continues to onboard new skills and talents needed to thrive as a global play and entertainment company in a converged retail world. ","In the first quarter, we took steps to accelerate our commercial organization's transformation. Much of this impact will be in Europe, where we have new leadership, and we are working to clear the excess inventory we discussed with you at year end. This transformation is already evident in the U.S. And over the past 3 years, we have grown our retail distribution by more than 21,000 doors net of recent store closures at traditional retailers. And we have developed our digital and content to commerce capabilities. ","The liquidation of Toys\"R\"Us in the U.S. and in the U.K., along with ongoing uncertainty around its other operations, has created near-term disruption in our business. The liquidation began in the first quarter and will continue with increasingly lower liquidation pricing in the second quarter. We anticipate the revenue impact will be most pronounced in the first half of the year with a lesser impact in the third and fourth quarters, including the important holiday season. We expect the U.S. liquidation will conclude at the end of the second quarter, and we still don't have resolution on the International markets plans. Our expectation continues to be that it will take about a year to work through this disruption, and we will drive growth in 2019 and beyond. ","In addition to the Toys\"R\"Us impact, we entered the year with work to do to clear through carryforward inventory, in particular, in Europe. We also planned our business to phase revenue later in the year. ","The quarter's reported financials reflect these factors on shipments across brands and categories. However, consumer takeaway demonstrates the strength of our brands and initiatives. Hasbro brands and Partner Brands are selling well. Our marketing efforts and product innovations are driving high demand across retailers. Franchise Brands, Partner Brands and Hasbro Gaming takeaway is up sizably. ","Online point of sale continues to grow significantly faster than total point of sale, and revenues grew in each product category. In the U.S., even when you remove Toys\"R\"Us from the analysis, consumer takeaway is significantly up across our franchise, partner and gaming categories. ","Our global retailers view this as an opportunity to gain share in a key consumer category, and they are partnering with us to develop growth plans for our brands going forward. We managed our new initiatives, shipping in the quarter and beyond, to avoid being caught up in the liquidation process. Our new Quick Strike products, which we previewed with you at Toy Fair and tap into consumer trends, are coming later this year. ","We're working aggressively around the world to put the impact of Toys\"R\"Us behind us. Importantly, this is not something happening to our company. We're taking control of the situation, making strategic decisions in how we approach the market, how we grow and the steps we are taking to build our capabilities and transform our organization. We have great confidence in the outlook for our brands and the ability of Hasbro to become even stronger in a rapidly developing converged retail environment. ","Franchise Brand point of sale grew across the brands in this portfolio. With significant innovation, combined with multi-screen storytelling, we have confidence in the underlying demand for our brands. ","TRANSFORMERS: Bumblebee, our first film under our new Paramount production and distribution agreement, hits theaters this December and marks an important evolution in Hasbro's role as storytellers. ","MAGIC: THE GATHERING began this year as planned, with revenues down in the first quarter. While point-of-sale data for MAGIC: THE GATHERING is not captured by NPD, in March, we saw positive fan reaction to the spring set, Dominaria, which fans celebrated at pre-release events this past weekend, and it goes on sale next weekend. ","Magic: The Gathering Arena, our new digital platform, is moving to the next stage of the beta process and is now being streamed and shared with more players ahead of its launch later in 2018. Feedback continues to be positive, and we're making continual enhancements during this period prior to launch. ","Within Hasbro Gaming, consumer demand remains strong. New launches, such as Hearing Things and Don't Step In It performed well and tapped into social gaming trends. In addition, DUNGEONS & DRAGONS and JENGA grew revenues. We continue to see immense interest in gaming from consumers of all ages, and Hasbro is investing to further leverage our advantage and reach in this area. ","Partner Brand point of sale increased behind the MARVEL lineup and BEYBLADE, which is off to a very strong start in its second year. We couldn't be more excited about the success of Black Panther. And early on, we agreed with MARVEL that this property had strong potential. As a result, the Black Panther product line is the broadest line we have ever created for a Marvel Studios origin film, including Iron Man; Captain America; Thor; and even the ensemble film, Guardians of the Galaxy. ","Point of sale of Hasbro items from Black Panther are performing well, ahead of everyone's expectations. We're working to satisfy demand and deliver new products throughout the year to capitalize on the May home entertainment release and the key holiday season. We also began shipping Avengers: Infinity War product in the first quarter. We expect both properties to contribute throughout 2018. ","STAR WARS remained the #1 property in the G9 markets according to NPD, and we continue to see improvement in the year-over-year point-of-sale comparisons. Solo: A Star Wars Story product, is now available ahead of the film's release on May 25. ","During the quarter, we launched our Has Lab crowdsourcing campaign. Our first initiative is the largest STAR WARS vehicle ever from Hasbro, Jabba's Sail Barge. The campaign exceeded our expectations with over 8,000 backers for this $499 product. This showcased not only amazing innovation from our team, but the power of digital consumer engagement to launch meaningful direct-to-consumer initiatives. ","Looking forward in 2018, there are going to be continued challenges while new opportunities arise. We believe we have made the best decisions to position us for a good year, and most importantly, to continue to grow our business going forward. ","Our medium-term guidance, which we shared in February, remains firmly in place. 2018 will be a year of adjustment. But beyond this year, we continue to believe that over the next few years, developed economies can grow low to mid-single digits through innovation, entertainment and market share gains and emerging markets can grow double digits, both absent the impact of foreign exchange. We believe operating margins are not only sustainable, but will improve over the next 2 to 3 years. Finally, we anticipate our annual operating cash flow in the range of $600 million to $700 million. ","I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deborah Thomas","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. This was a challenging quarter. We said early on it would be challenging, and it became even more so when Toys\"R\"Us moved to liquidate its stores in the U.S. and the U.K. But our teams have shown great resolve and are working effectively through the issues. We're taking steps to strengthen our business, including accelerating actions to transform our commercial organization, in particular, outside the U.S. And we're positioned and planning for long-term growth. ","Hasbro is executing from a very healthy financial position. The first quarter is our smallest quarter, and changes in the business are magnified during this period. While we don't plan to completely offset all the Toys\"R\"Us disruption this year, the impact will decrease in the second half. Incremental store closures are happening now, and there is near-term uncertainty in several of their remaining International businesses. While this will further impact 2018 shipments, we do not expect further material expenses. ","Our cash flow outlook remains intact. And despite a $59.1 million bad debt charge related to Toys\"R\"Us, we are targeting operating cash flow in the $600 million to $700 million range for the year. We ended the quarter with just under $1.6 billion in cash while returning $109.6 million to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. An 11% increase in the quarterly dividend takes effect for our next dividend payment in May. ","The impact of lost revenues from Toys\"R\"Us and our efforts to work through retail inventory is evident across both U.S. and Canada and International segment results. In the U.S. and Canada segment, revenues declined 19%. Partner Brand revenue increased slightly, but Franchise Brands, Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brands revenues declined. Point of sale is up, with only Emerging Brands declining slightly. Retail inventory declined as we worked through inventory and managed the Toys\"R\"Us liquidation in the U.S. ","The U.S. and Canada segment reported an operating loss in the quarter due to lower revenues and $52.3 million of expenses related to Toys\"R\"Us, which was primarily bad debt. Adjusted operating profit was $28.9 million, which is the result of lower revenue in the quarter and higher freight and warehousing expenses. ","International segment revenues declined 17%, including a favorable $19.5 million impact from foreign exchange. Latin America and Asia Pacific grew revenues but were more than offset by a 28% decline in Europe. The lower revenues in Europe were the result of carryforward retail inventory we are working to clear through, and to a lesser extent, the U.K. liquidation and uncertainty around other Toys\"R\"Us operations. In addition, a French retailer was put in receivership during the quarter. ","The International segment reported an operating loss of $56.1 million. This includes $11.2 million of expense associated with Toys\"R\"Us. Excluding this item, the segment had an adjusted operating loss of $44.9 million. The operating loss was primarily the result of lower revenues. ","Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues increased 21% behind growth in Consumer Products and digital gaming. As we discussed at Toy Fair, the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard meant revenues received from our licensees will be recorded in a more ratable basis throughout the year as opposed to a bigger uptick in the fourth quarter. The adoption of the standard also contributed to the segment's higher revenues. Operating profits increased 23% on the higher revenues. ","Overall, Hasbro operating profit margin was negatively impacted by expenses associated with Toys\"R\"Us and severance costs from our commercial organization transformation. Adjusted operating profit declined due to lower revenues which could not absorb the company's fixed cost in the smaller first quarter. ","It is early in the year, however. Our current full year outlook, absent the expenses associated with Toys\"R\"Us and severance, is that we could achieve an operating profit margin in line with 2017's level of 15.6%. ","As Brian said, we believe we can increase operating profit margin in future years. Earlier this year, I outlined several margin levers to drive operating profit margin expansion going forward, including growth in higher-margin Franchise Brands, Hasbro Gaming and Entertainment and Licensing revenues as well as profit improvement in our emerging markets and efficiencies from our system investments. Our future outlook is not impacted by this near-term disruption. ","Cost of sales declined as a percentage of revenue, driven by growth in higher-margin Entertainment and Licensing revenues and a disciplined commercial approach to pricing and shipping product into our global retailers. We expect cost of sales to decline on a full year basis and approach, but perhaps not match, the 38% level we reported in 2016. ","Underlying royalty expense declined on lower Partner Brand revenues. However, our reported royalty expense in the quarter increased as we incurred accelerated expense associated with lower Toys\"R\"Us revenue for our Partner Brands. For the full year, underlying royalties as a percentage of revenues are expected to be in line to down slightly versus last year's rate of 7.8%. ","Product development declined in dollars in the quarter, but on a full year basis, as a percentage of revenue, is expected to be consistent with 2017. Program production amortization increased as we're amortizing MY LITTLE PONY: THE MOVIE production expense in addition to television programming. Program amortization as a percentage of revenue for the full year should be flat to up slightly versus last year. ","SD&A includes several unusual items, notably $59.1 million of bad debt associated with Toys\"R\"Us and severance cost from accelerating our commercial organization transformation. Absent these items, SD&A increased due to foreign exchange, investment in IT systems and higher freight and warehousing expenses. Our underlying full year SD&A forecast is for a slight increase as a percentage of revenue. ","Turning to our results below operating profit. Other income declined slightly, primarily due to a smaller gain on foreign currency this year versus last. ","Our underlying tax rate, absent the impact of tax reform, was 16.5% compared to an underlying rate of 24.9% last year and 19.9% for the full year 2017. The lower rate reflects the benefit of U.S. tax reform. But during the quarter, we also recorded a discrete charge of $47.8 million or $0.38 per diluted share related to an increase in our repatriation tax liability and a reversal of tax benefits no longer permitted under new guidance. As we stated at year end, the charge we took then was provisional and expected to change as there was clarification to the new law. We anticipate there will be additional guidance on tax reform that will require consideration and interpretation going forward. We expect our full year underlying tax rate to be at the high end of our previously projected range of 15% to 17%. ","For the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share was $0.10, and reported earnings per share was a loss of $0.90. Hasbro's balance sheet is strong. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, and we paid $70.8 million in dividends and repurchased $38.8 million in common stock. Both our debt-to-EBITDA and EBITDA-to-interest ratios, at 1.9 and 9.2, respectively, are favorable to our targets. ","Receivables decreased 9% and days sales outstanding were 78 days. We recorded a bad debt charge for Toys\"R\"Us in the quarter, and we believe we are adequately reserved for our historical shipments. We don't expect to have any material expenses associated with Toys\"R\"Us going forward. ","Inventories increased on lower revenues as we held more in our warehouses during the quarter. Approximately 1\/4 of the increase in inventory was the result of foreign exchange. As Brian discussed, we're working closely with our global retailers to reallocate this product. In the U.S., retail inventories declined in the quarter. Internationally, retail inventories have also declined, but we have further work to do in Europe. We are making progress and are on plan to lower retail inventories to our targeted levels. ","In closing, we are facing near-term disruption in the market, but we have confidence in our long-term prospects. Consumers are seeking out and purchasing Hasbro brands, and we have a very strong lineup for the rest of the year. We are deliberate in how we approach the market to ensure our global retailers have success with our brands this year and in future years. We are on solid financial footing and are taking the necessary steps to put Toys\"R\"Us behind us and return to profitable growth as soon as next year. ","We will now open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies.","Stephanie Wissink","Two questions, just to dig in a little bit more, Deb, to your comments on the inventory. I think you mentioned 1\/4 of the inventory increase is related to FX. Can we unpack the other 3\/4? Specifically, just curious if there's anything related to what you plan to ship in the second quarter, most notably Avengers and STAR WARS and then home entertainment release for Black Panther. Should we be looking at some of that inventory as allocated to those initiatives?","Deborah Thomas","Yes, Steph. And you're exactly right. About 1\/4 of the increase in our inventory balance was due to FX. The remainder is really good -- due to good inventory. We've got Avengers shipping. We are leading up into all great the new initiatives that we have coming this year and all the great entertainment as well as the new initiatives that we haven't released, really, out into the market yet. So what we're seeing in our inventory is all good inventory. Part of it was from our deliberate decision not to put some into the market because we didn't want to have a lot of our good, new initiatives competing with liquidating inventory at our retailers. So we will see that inventory moving into the market throughout the year, and we're not worried about it at all. From a retail inventory standpoint, our retail inventories are down, particularly in the U.S., and internationally as well.","Stephanie Wissink","All right. And then one follow-up. A vendor that had talked about higher freight expenses, and that's something we're hearing consistently across many vendors. Can you talk a little bit about how long in duration you expect that inflation to continue and where you're seeing it within your markets around the world?","Deborah Thomas","Absolutely. We're seeing it -- a lot of it is really coming in the U.S. and it's a little bit throughout Europe as well. And it's really coming from the trucking industry and higher due to the new electronic logging device rules and driver shortages. The contracting supply and increasing demand is expected to manifest itself really kind of throughout 2018, but it is in our outlook. We highlighted it for the first quarter because it's a bit different from last quarter. And you see that impact in SD&A as opposed to upping cost of sales because it's really a selling expense and getting the inventory to the retail location for selling. So it's in our outlook and in everything we've talked about for the year.","Stephanie Wissink","And then one for you, Brian, just bigger-picture, as you sit back now and observe some of the channel shift, and I see you're making some changes to your commercial organization. But how should we think about the 2- or 3-year trend in the business? And where do you see the biggest opportunities to really drive the advantage versus your competitors?","Brian Goldner","Yes. So year-to-date, we've seen through NPD that the industry has grown, and we've kept pace with that growth and we've kept pace in the United States. And in fact, we remain #1 company in the G11 markets and in fact grew market share in 5 of those 10 markets and held our own in the others. We believe the industry will continue to grow low to mid-single digits. We've made and had lots of meetings with our key retailers. They're very excited about the opportunity to garner share in markets like the U.S. And for perspective, as Toys\"R\"Us liquidates, the Toys\"R\"Us U.S. business represented about 2\/3 of our global Toys\"R\"Us business. So as we move through this, there's a real market share opportunity for our other retailers. We are seeing that converged retail marketplace take hold. We had made significant progress in the U.S. We have lots of great capabilities.","We had begun to onboard those capabilities in markets like Asia. And we needed to accelerate those efforts that we had indicated to you back at Toy Fair that we were doing. For example, the global online business, that we'd set up the team, as well as the global retail channels team. And we felt that we had an opportunity to accelerate those efforts in Europe. And we also have new leadership there that we're very excited about. So taking a new approach to markets, recognizing that there is growth in the industry. And our global retailers are also wanting to grow with us. We have market initiatives that are really growing our brands. And POS have grown and retail inventories are down. But as Deb said, we made some decisions about how we deployed new inventory, really good inventory, in light of the liquidation that's taking place in the near term that we expect to conclude by June.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Arpine Kocharyan with UBS.","Arpine Kocharyan","Could you please give a breakdown of exactly what percent of decline was from Toys\"R\"Us this quarter? And I know you talked about the impact being less later in the year, but could you specifically talk about what percentage of Toys\"R\"Us retail disruption is being absorbed by competitors at this time?","Brian Goldner","Yes. So first, Arpine, if you look at the situation in this first half of the year, it's directly related to Toys\"R\"Us. Clearly, this conversation and our business would be in a very different short-term position were Toys\"R\"Us still in existence in the United States, but the fact is it isn't. And so our teams are moving quickly to transition and transform and to move forward in an appreciable way. What's really exciting is that our global retailers are very excited about garnering that additional market share. They're building additional promotions. They're building additional space for the industry. Having had a number of good retail meetings recently, our retailers are very excited, I believe that the opportunity to absorb all of the Toys\"R\"Us business is present. And in fact, we're just building those plans to do that. It just takes some time from the moment that we finally heard of liquidation to the time when you can execute new plans with new initiatives does take some time as you build out those new windows of opportunity for other retailers.","Arpine Kocharyan","That's helpful. And then just going back to the retail numbers, could you clarify, was that Easter-adjusted? So POS is up for Hasbro and the industry easter-adjusted because Easter started early? And then I have a quick follow-up on inventory.","Brian Goldner","Yes. So retail in the first -- POS was up for the first quarter. And it was up globally, it was up across every one of our categories, except for Emerging Brands. Very strong growth for Games, Franchise Brands, Partner Brands. And then Easter-to-Easter, the business was up and it was up around the world as well and was up for all of our categories, with the exception of Emerging Brands. So Easter-to-Easter, the business was up.","Arpine Kocharyan","That's helpful. And then one more follow-up on the inventory on hand. I'm not surprised that it was 72% of top line because you have a weaker seasonally quarter that sort of things get magnified in this quarter. But I was surprised to see it still up substantially year-over-year, FX-adjusted. Because if you -- even if you were to sort of adjust for Toys\"R\"Us sort of holding a little bit more on hand, Easter was early this year, which means that, that inventory on hand should have actually been lighter when you closed the quarter. Or am I missing something?","Brian Goldner","Yes. So we've made some specific strategic decisions on how we're deploying our inventory around our new initiatives for brands that are selling incredibly well. Recognize that the first phase of the Toys\"R\"Us business was announced bankruptcy last fall, followed by, around Toy Fair, the belief that they would begin to close some stores. And then following Toy Fair and our opportunity to talk to investors, they then declared that they would liquidate. So at that point, we really made some decisions about where do we deploy new, good inventory for brands that are selling really well in the face of a short-term liquidation. So we took some decisions. Obviously, we've deployed inventory for new initiatives where there are shelf-set dates, like Avengers and Solo: A Star Wars Story. All those areas, that's where we've deployed, but we've also been thoughtful about where to put those inventories as we head into the second quarter as we have new initiatives coming from our Quick Strike initiatives that we sort of previewed for you at New York Toy Fair. And so we feel very comfortable about the quality of our inventory. We feel very good about the POS we're seeing across the different categories of the business, and the fact is our retail inventories are down in the U.S. and around the world. So we're really planning to run out some of those inventories and then build our initiatives with our global retailers, who, as I said, are excited about our business and we're really excited to grow with them. And we're building those plans now.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Ng","I have one for Deb and one for Brian. Deb, gross margins held up surprisingly well this quarter, and I think you guys gave a good outlook, too. Can you talk about why that was the case despite fixed cost deleveraging from the lower-than-expected revenue?","Deborah Thomas","Well, thanks, Mike. We had talked about at Toy Fair that we expected our gross margins could approximate 2016 levels. And in fact, we planned our business that way. We've gotten some questions about with the Toys\"R\"Us business going away, does that mean our gross margins will go down? Is that a more profitable business? And in fact, as we've said many times, we're agnostic to that. It's not a more profitable business from a gross margin standpoint than other retailers. So that's really been our focus. And when we talk about in our prepared remarks, we've been very disciplined as to what we've put into the market, how we've priced it and when we put it in to maintain those gross margins.","Michael Ng","Okay. And then Brian, can you talk about how the exit of Toys\"R\"Us might affect industry toy sales and the landscape? For example, what happens to some of the smaller toy manufacturers that may have relied more on that channel than Hasbro has? Do you see the opportunity to take some market share from these players? And will this create some tuck-in M&A opportunities for Hasbro and other well-capitalized toy players? And then lastly, do you anticipate other retailers, like a Walmart or Target, to allocate more shelf space to toys?","Brian Goldner","Yes. So if you -- as I've mentioned, we've been having lots of meetings with our retailers, and there's lots of interest in continuing to grow with us and in this key category. As retailers see it, the toy and game business are key categories for them. And yes, I would expect to see incremental space assigned to toys. I think they're building robust plans, and it just takes some time to build that out. There's a great opportunity across a number of dimensions for a number of different kinds of consumers that were Toys\"R\"Us shoppers, particularly in the United States. For us, we continue to believe there's great opportunity for growth. Obviously, we see opportunities to pick up brands. Most notably, we talked about it at Toy Fair, the fact that we are going to be now managing the Power Ranger business. We're very excited about that. And we'll continue to look selectively at new brand opportunities. Having said that, we also have some great brands in our vault that we're beginning to develop and develop storytelling around.","We've kicked off our relationship with Paramount, a more robust relationship that will give us an opportunity to take some of our brands, like M.A.S.K. and ROM and Visionaries and Micronauts out to the marketplace. And then you've also heard from us opportunities to work more significantly and substantially with Netflix. And we're excited about Super Monsters. And of course, with Nickelodeon on their Top Wing property. So again, thoughtfully and smartly adopting some new brands that we'll bring into the portfolio. And then lots of new innovations coming for a number of our different brands. Really, it's just about that transition and transformation of our business that we need to go through, through the first half of this year in the U.S. particularly. And then we're beginning to hear some positive notes around some retailers, some of the Toys\"R\"Us regions perhaps being picked up by other retailers or other companies. And so we'll have more on that shortly, we hope.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory Badishkanian","Could you just quantify the POS in the U.S. and maybe just the global number? I don't think I heard the number.","Brian Goldner","Yes. So the number in the U.S. POS was up double digits, and that was up double digits year-on-year, Easter-to-Easter. And globally, it was up double digits and up high single digits in the Easter-to-Easter view globally.","Gregory Badishkanian","Okay. All right. Good. And then just as we think about the Toys\"R\"Us impact, does that go away in the first quarter of next year? Is that what you meant about -- is that -- can we infer that from what you had said?","Brian Goldner","Yes. Look, Deb and I both believe, and our teams are lining up great growth plans for 2019 and beyond. I believe we'll get back on the kind of growth trajectory you've seen from us. We've reaffirmed our medium-term guidance here this morning. We're absolutely certain that we have the brands, the portfolio, the marketing initiatives and the innovation to achieve that kind of a growth. So that's what we believe. It's going to take, as I said, about a year to work through this, particularly the first half of this year. And then depending on what happens in the other regions around the world for Toys\"R\"Us, that will obviously have that impact in Qs 3 and 4. But by Q3 and 4 in the U.S, where, as I said, historically, Toys\"R\"Us 2\/3 of the Toys\"R\"Us business was being done in the U.S., that goes away. And we begin to build really robust plans in earnest with other retailers around our brands that are selling quite well and retail inventories that are down.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","So Brian, and Deb, I know you don't like to give very specific revenue guidance. Deb, thanks for all the color on the below-line item stuff. But it would be helpful if you could just give us a more specific road map for the rest of the year in terms of revenues. Because when you reported this morning, I think a lot of us believe that you can -- shouldn't think the year regarding Toys\"R\"Us, but the color that you've given is you've indicated that there would be further disruption, but at declining levels. And we know that the impact will be more on the revenue side, likely on not the expense side, based on what you've said. But just really in the spirit of trying to eliminate the potential for your company to miss sell-side revenue and estimates for the remainder of the year, I think it would be very helpful for us if you could walk us through how to think about the rest of the quarters in light of the continued liquidation.","Deborah Thomas","Sure. Well, Felicia, if we think about Toys\"R\"Us, we think about -- we'll just -- we can go back to Toy Fair and what we said, that we knew there would be disruption in the early half of the year. And we continue to believe that. But we have overall confidence in our business. And as we look at the spread of the year, the first and the second quarters are normally very low-revenue quarters. So of course, we believe that we'll see a bigger impact in the first part of that year. When you start to get into the holiday season, we believe it'll be less disruptive, and we'll work through the impact overall in about a year. And whether that's first quarter next year or stretches out a bit, it's still within a year period. But overall, we're very confident in our business. We have a plan that gets us through 2018 in good shape. We still are confident in our plans to grow our business in 2019 and beyond. We've reiterated our medium-term guidance. So it's really -- and consumer takeaway is good, so that's there as well. So for us, it's really about just working through the disruption, which we think will be much more pronounced in the early half of the year.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. So let's peel back the layers a little bit. So it sounds like, for 2018, you probably won't see revenue growth. Is that fair?","Brian Goldner","Well, look, I think the way to look at it is you're transitioning in the U.S. and Qs three and four that are a bigger quarters with new initiatives, entertainment and robust retailer support, it's all present. Now we just have to put all the plans together. Obviously, this has all happened over a very short period of time. So we see the opportunity there. We just need to now build and develop those plans and execute those plans. So that's the thought process there. And then if you go out around the world and look at our Entertainment and Licensing business, it continues to grow. We saw growth in digital gaming and Consumer Products in the quarter. We've seen growth in Latin America and in Asia Pacific. We continue to believe in our Wizards of the Coast team and their business, and we've seen great response to Dominaria, which comes in Q2 as well, as Magic: The Gathering Arena, which is still in closed beta, but increasingly spreading the opportunity to play the game. And the feedback has been phenomenal. We continue to enhance that. So I think we have one of the broadest portfolios with strengthened sell-through, with retail inventories down, strong retailer support and plans that the teams are developing in real time across the U.S. and around the world. So we just -- it's early days relative to the Toys\"R\"Us liquidation, and we'll update you as we get closer to the third and fourth quarter.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. So maybe just to better understand the mechanics, which would be helpful. You're obviously not shipping any more into Toys\"R\"Us, so on a year-over-year basis, that's decline.","Brian Goldner","That stopped in -- that would stop -- that had stopped in the first quarter.","Felicia Hendrix","Right. And then the other impacts would be just the unknowns, would be just how the liquidation would affect your sales elsewhere, just in terms of competitive pricing and what people take.","Brian Goldner","No. Remember, so they're not getting any new inventory, they have to sell through the inventory they had. So as we said, we've been thoughtful about the initiatives coming to the market that wouldn't get caught up in the Toys\"R\"Us liquidation and shipping those outside of that window, and of course, building plans with our retailers for Qs 3 and 4, where retail space is inherently historically grown. And now you'll see even more robust plans from our partners around our brands that are really growing. So it's -- again, it's just a matter of latency, the lag between an intention to develop new plans and grow and then executing those plans. But it's -- there's no controlling weakness, and executing. And our retailers are very ambitious and enthusiastic about our business. And we are about their business.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. So given the size of the second quarter, probably, you would say magnitude somewhat less than the first, but kind of in the ballpark -- like a similar ballpark?","Brian Goldner","Yes, look. Yes, I think that the unknown here a bit in Q2, and again remember, historically, a lower-revenues quarter historically, is the size of the discounts that come along with liquidation. As the liquidation goes on towards conclusion, the discounts, the percent discounts get bigger. And then it will all conclude, as we understand, in June. So the discounts go on larger. However, there's no new inventory that they have. It's the inventory that was shipped to them in the earlier part of the first quarter, and then that will sell through. We begin to execute new initiatives throughout the second quarter, so certainly, a number of new initiatives coming in Q2, particularly around entertainment and home entertainment for Black Panther, Avengers and other new initiatives coming from our teams and the Quick Strike initiatives. And then for the third and fourth quarter, the more robust plans around new innovations for the fall and for holiday.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. That makes sense. And then just last for me is just with your reiteration of the $600 million to $700 million in operating cash flow, impressive, given what's going on here. But I presume just, like, where you fell in the range shifted because otherwise, I'm just having problems putting to you reiterating that number.","Deborah Thomas","We still believe in the range of $600 million to $700 million of operating cash flow for this year.","Felicia Hendrix","Yes. I know that, I was just thinking kind of...","Deborah Thomas","Well, I'm not going to tell you exactly the number, Felicia.","Felicia Hendrix","No. I mean, it's just, logically, it would seem that where you fall...","Deborah Thomas","Suffice to say, it probably isn't at -- we would probably have moved from the top end of that range. However, our cash flow generation remains strong. And as Brian said, we have a strong business. The consumer wants our product, and it will find a home. So our cash, we still believe in our cash flow generation. Financially, we're sound. Our debt's not going up. And we will work through this.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with MorningStar.","Jaime Katz","So I'm curious, you guys had recently mentioned at one of the events that you'd spoken at, that there are these 3 new initiatives that are coming out this year that haven't been announced. And I assume that's going to be postponed until the second half, given the commentary surrounding Toys\"R\"Us and what you've just said about not introducing anything new until some of that is behind us.","Brian Goldner","Yes. No, please don't take what I said as that we won't introduce new initiatives. We have plenty of new initiatives for Q2. I was trying to comment on the fact that we would, in first quarter, with additional good toy inventory that was of good quality. So obviously didn't want to deploy that until we had a good perspective on what the liquidation looked like and what the timing looked like. Obviously didn't want to put new initiatives in the market that would be caught up in shipping to and in liquidating through Toys\"R\"Us. But we have plenty of new initiatives in the second quarter. We have initiatives around the home entertainment release of Black Panther. We have Avengers. We have at least one Quick Strike initiative coming in the quarter. We have lots of new innovations from a number of our brands. And I have to say, across our Franchise Brand portfolio, we've seen great growth in POS for every one of our retail Franchise Brands, and strong growth for those brands and continued momentum. So no, all that we were trying to say is where are we, how are we deploying new-initiative inventory between Qs 1 and 2 and then going into the third and fourth quarter.","Jaime Katz","Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. And then for -- I think you had mentioned Top Wing, but I'm curious for some of these other license partnerships. I think you're having more competitors that are interested in participating, obviously, in content-driven licenses. Is it getting a little bit easier because you guys have such a significant portfolio of experience with this, like, proven track record? Or is it actually getting more expensive to obtain these licensed partnerships because there are more people sort of coming to bat for them?","Brian Goldner","We're working with partners earlier and earlier stages and in more strategic ways. We're very pleased to continue to build our relationship with Netflix. As you know, we built -- we produced an original series for them on Stretch Armstrong, an animated series. It's performing well on the network on their -- in streaming. And then we began to work with them on Stranger Things in the very early days, and we're rolling that product out now nationally, but it was with a retailer for last fall. And it sold incredibly well, both the MONOPOLY game as well as an Eggo game. If you know the story, you know what I'm talking about. And then continuing to build relationship with Paramount and Nickelodeon as part of Viacom. And again, what we would say is that we do have a lot of experience and we are selective and strategic about the partnerships we take on.","Obviously, we continue to be incredibly excited about the lineup from the Walt Disney Company, focusing on MARVEL. We have 6 MARVEL movies this year where we are supporting in a significant way and really extending and expanding our reach there. STAR WARS, the POS really has lined up well, and we're very excited about the Solo movie. And of course, going into 2019, additional entertainment. And then DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN, with FROZEN 2 coming next year. So again, lining up with some of the best partners. And I think the adage we talk about here at the company is we treat their brands like our brands and bring great consumer insights and innovation to those brands with dedicated teams, resources. And that's been our focus. And I really haven't seen a change in the landscape in an appreciable way.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel.","Andrew Crum","Could you give us an update on expectations around clearing the inventory overhang in Europe? And then I guess specifically, as it relates to STAR WARS, address the inventory situation there and retailers' willingness to take on more STAR WARS inventory ahead of the Solo film.","Deborah Thomas","Well, we continue to work through the inventory overhang in Europe. We feel that the U.S. retail inventory is down in those pockets that we had excess inventory, but we still think there's a bit of work to do in Europe. So we'll see that impact us throughout the year, albeit to a lesser and lesser extent as we move through the year. And Brian, do you want to take the STAR WARS question?","Brian Goldner","Yes. Look, we've seen good -- really good sell-through STAR WARS in the first quarter. The retail inventory of STAR WARS is down double digits, and it really sets us up well. The team's done a really good job of moving through inventory there. We'll -- obviously, we'll continue to sell an array of STAR WARS-branded inventory throughout the year. And then we're very excited about the Solo movie that's coming now. And that product hit shelves in April for the May movie. And then, of course, we will track through. We're also very excited about new kids-oriented entertainment coming for the second half of the year. And I know that announcement is coming any day now from the Walt Disney Company, but we're very excited about that. We think that's also well-timed. And it's a very exciting initiative that we'll support in a considerable way.","Andrew Crum","Got it. And then shifting to BEYBLADE, I think you've mentioned that it was off to a very strong start. And year 2 of the license, can you talk about how that trajectory looks as compared to, I believe it was 2011, you guys did about $480 million of BEYBLADE revenue that year, and that was year 2 of the license. So just curious as to how BEYBLADE is tracking relative to the last product cycle.","Brian Goldner","Yes. BEYBLADE is tracking incredibly well. It is the second year of the cycle this time. We're seeing great uptake. We have dual exposure, both from broadcasters around the world as well as streaming content on Netflix. And we also have an incredible number of young people playing the digital app and hundreds of millions of games being played, competitions being played online, which is inspiring their off-line analog play. It's a new play pattern with this burst. And in fact, the SwitchStrike product, it's launching in this period, is really fun because they can change the way the tops actually rotate and that adds a level of strategy and thought to the game play. But as you know, Drew, I'm not going to comment specifically as it pertains to the last time. However, I think we've told you now that we're incredibly excited about this. And it's certainly accelerating as it has in other second years of the cycle. I'm not going to try to range it partly because it's sometimes hard to range because, of course, this is a lot about word-of-mouth and kids playing it and seeing it out at retail being played and online. And then also obviously, we have this near-term disruption going on that we need to think about and replan that part of the business with other retailers who obviously want to grow with BEYBLADEs.","Andrew Crum","Okay. Got it. And then just one last one for me. Brian, is there sense that there's any impact across the portfolio from Fortnite, which is this phenom free-to-play battle layout video game that just -- it's been an incredible success with kids and teenagers, is there sense that there's any impact on your business? Or maybe not.","Brian Goldner","Well, we really like Fortnite. It's a really fun game. Our digital gaming business is also up both in the licensed area as well as at Backflip. People increasingly are playing games, and we think that's fantastic. They should them play them any way they want, anytime and anywhere. And obviously, we're serving our games similarly. We like the Fortnite game. And I would say we haven't really seen an impact with respect to that game.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with B. Riley FBR.","Susan Anderson","I was wondering if you could give -- I know you gave some color on just the performance of products, but maybe if, by segment, how things performed versus your expectations include -- excluding Toys\"R\"Us. Were there any other pressure points more than you had expected? Like, was Europe worse than you saw it? And also maybe if you could talk about NERF and how that performed in the quarter. And I think you have some new product coming out in second half. What will that mean for revenues? And is this something similar to the impact like NERF NITRO was?","Brian Goldner","Yes. So a number of new initiatives coming from NERF this year. Obviously, our fastest-growing segment is Nerf Rival, and then our largest segment is Elite and then we have Modulus. All 3 of those segments are up sizably in POS. We have some new product in there and expanded product development and growth in addition to new channels because of a new development we've made at different price points and building that opportunity. Our retail inventory for NERF is down. And we'll bring new initiatives for the second half. We have a major new initiative that we haven't talked about specifically for the second half of the year that we're excited about. And so that we continue to believe, over time, that NERF will continue to track well. NERF NITRO has performed incredibly well internationally and well in the U.S. And obviously, we're excited about its continued progress.","If you look at categories, I think if you just consider the fact that there was an evolving situation with Toys\"R\"Us, we obviously shipped, Toys\"R\"Us a year ago was our number three customer, significantly less in the first quarter this year than a year ago, of course. And so we are redeploying, transitioning and transforming our business, including our retail sales organization, to bring on new capabilities and changing that composition of our retail team, including how we manage digital assets, content to commerce, digital and social marketing, data analytics. All of those elements are really important for how we build the business. So I would say, clearly, Toys\"R\"Us is the reason that the business is where it is in this first quarter. Obviously, that's what we're working through. And we will put Toys\"R\"Us in the U.S. in the rearview mirror in the next few quarters. And that's our point of view. And we'll continue to grow in 2019 and beyond.","Susan Anderson","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And the last one on Black Panther. Obviously, a great success, and it looks like Avengers: Infinity War is also setting up well. Do you think that sets up MARVEL to continue to outperform this year? And then has there been any early reads on the early products for this movie?","Brian Goldner","Yes. So MARVEL has outperformed and performed incredibly well in the first quarter. The point of sale for MARVEL is very strong. We have -- there are 6 theatrical releases throughout this year that we're supporting, including Black Panther, Avengers, and then even a lineup that's really fun for Deadpool, Ant-Man and Wasp, Venom and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, they're all supported by robust product lines, and that stretches throughout the calendar year. We're very excited about the lineup and innovation in our product lines. We have new products coming for Black Panther beyond the home entertainment window for the holidays, including product in the MARVEL LEGENDS series for Black Panther, which is great. We're very excited about our Hero Vision product, which is a augmented reality product that's coming around Avengers: Infinity War. And we also have the Assembler Gear, that's that modular and customizable role-play system. So again, a lot of innovation and very robust entertainment coming from MARVEL, so we're very excited.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo.","Timothy Conder","A lot of questions have been answered, but a couple here. Deb, on the inventories, it sounded like, in a previous answer, you had mentioned that those should be normalized, take the year in Europe to get those normalized in the channel. And it sounds like elsewhere in the channel, you feel pretty comfortable. So just to reaffirm that. And then -- and when do you then see the company-level inventories back to levels that you would term normal?","Deborah Thomas","Well, yes, that is what we said about Europe. We still have a bit of work to do there, although the levels have come down quite a bit on the retail side. From our inventory, we've talked quite a bit about why it was up and that it's a good quality with items like BEYBLADEs and Avengers and NERF and BABY ALIVE in it. And we also said at Toy Fair, and we continue to believe, as we move more to an online retail model, and we saw the acceleration of that cutting into the end of last year and certainly with Toys\"R\"Us going away, we see that being a large piece of what's going to pick up those revenues, go-forward, be it through our omni-channel retailers like Walmart or Target; or a more pure play, like Amazon or Alibaba or Tmall. You -- I would expect that our inventory levels would run higher than they have in the past because we want to make sure that we have the right inventory on hand to supply those retailers when they want it. And they tend to take it much closer to when they're going to sell through than when -- than put it in a warehouse and have that longer lead time like more traditional brick-and-mortar retailers have. So we expect our inventory levels to be a bit higher, probably not as high as this quarter because we deliberately held inventory and with the revenue decline. It is all good inventory. It will move, but we would expect they'd probably run a bit higher than they have in the past.","Brian Goldner","Yes. To Deb's point, if you just look at the mix shift of domestic to direct import in the first quarter, it was five points higher on the domestic side. So it's 80-20, 80%, 20%. So it went five points higher on the domestic side.","Timothy Conder","Okay. And then I guess in a little bit in relation to that in the International front, not much comment on China or Russia, which has been very strong for your sales and the industry over the last couple of years. Any update you could provide us there?","Brian Goldner","Yes. China, it continues to track very well for us. We talked about the impact of the emerging markets was really in Brazil as we finalized that cleanup, and move forward, we're more optimistic about the Brazilian retail economy and consumer sentiment for the full year 2018. And just moving through and finishing up some work there. And then in Russia, similarly, it was where we had some inventory that we wanted to clean up in the first quarter. But again, feel very good about the Russian business. It's been a growth business for us. And we continue to reiterate our beliefs that emerging markets overall will grow double digits, absent FX, over time. We've seen our Asia business perform well and our Chinese business perform extremely well.","Timothy Conder","Okay. And then lastly, any more organizational changes that you anticipate here? Or were those pretty well expensed and accrued for in Q1 here?","Deborah Thomas","So there's always things that we do throughout the business. And as we said, we had planned this to happen, actually, throughout the year. However, we wouldn't expect anything of this level throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick Johnson","So what was the onetime revenue and bottom line impact from ASC 606?","Deborah Thomas","It was immaterial.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. And can you tell us what the Toys\"R\"Us gross revenues were in the first quarter?","Brian Goldner","No. We've said that the Toys\"R\"Us revenues were down sizably, obviously significantly, Q1 '18 versus Q1 '17.","Deborah Thomas","I would say they weren't material either. And don't forget, there's disruption remaining in some of the rest of their business. So while the U.S. is a big piece, we're also being very careful and prudent throughout the quarter with their other businesses as there remains this uncertainty as to what's going to happen to them long term.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. An accounting question for you. So when Toys\"R\"Us goes into liquidation, do you reserve -- or do you reverse those sales allowances that were booked against the prior revenue since that inventory isn't going to be supported by you anymore?","Deborah Thomas","Depending on what the allowance is. Because if you recall, some of it is for promotional items that actually happened within the quarter. So we record our revenues net, and what net balance we have is what we would reserve for that we felt we wouldn't collect at the end of the day.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. And then the $61 million after-tax bad debt, what was that on a pretax basis?","Deborah Thomas","It was $59.1 million on a pretax basis -- or about $50 million on a pretax basis. In total, the impact was $70 million.","Gerrick Johnson","So wait, on just on the Toys\"R\"Us bad debt, just to be clear, what was the pretax and what was the after-tax impact just from Toys\"R\"Us bad debt?","Deborah Thomas","On just the bad debt, I believe I said that it was $59.1 million on just the bad debt.","Gerrick Johnson","Is that pre or post-tax?","Deborah Thomas","That's pretax.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. My last question is, you said you stopped shipping some items because you did not want to compete against Toys\"R\"Us liquidation. How much of that also is from retailers not wanting to compete against that liquidation and their decision to cut back on orders?","Brian Goldner","No. It wasn't really related to that. We've been flowing goods throughout. We have very strong POS, so the demand is there. It was a really decision about some new initiatives that could have occurred in one quarter versus the other. It's just timing on certain things. But no, our retailers are very interested in growing with us. Obviously, historically and for this year, Q1 and Q2 are lower-revenue quarters on average. And our retail partners are gearing up for the Q3 and Q4. Just takes time for them to expand their plans with us and to continue to add new initiatives that should enable them to pick up the Toys\"R\"Us business in any number of ways.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric Handler","Deb, one question for you. Wondered if you could dig in a little bit more on the puts and takes into the gross margin. It seems like with the gaming business down -- or the Games business down 20%, that seems like it's a big headwind for your gross margin. What was in Entertainment and Licensing that really helped drive the growth in the gross margin?","Deborah Thomas","Well, very exciting in Entertainment and Licensing. And Brian mentioned it earlier when we talked about our relationship with Netflix is Stretch Armstrong. So we see quite a bit of revenue coming from that new initiative in the first quarter in Entertainment and Licensing. And the rest was a mix within our digital business. TRANSFORMERS: EARTH WARS continues to do well. And on the digital side, that business is performing well. As well as our Consumer Products business from a licensing standpoint as well. But I get very excited about Stretch Armstrong, so I'll point that one out again. And really, from a mix standpoint in gross margin, in addition to the impacts from Entertainment and Licensing, it really was just a function of mix and getting better margins on some of the things that we normally would have flowed into the business and having reasonable hedges to protect our pricing and not going overboard on allowances. So it's really the discipline that we instill in our business to try to hit that gross margin goal.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with D.A. Davidson.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Is there any way, just to help with modeling, if Toys\"R\"Us was 9% of your sales in 2017, in the first half quarters, would it be 15% of your sales or 10% to 15% of sales? Can you give some -- like, what percent was Toys\"R\"Us in the first quarter '17? That would be helpful. And then secondly, there's been some talk in the industry that actually having fewer brick-and-mortar locations for toy sales, because it's an impulse-purchase item, actually will curtail demand over the long term. And I've heard estimates of even 10% to 20% of demand would kind of go away. Do you have any views on that?","Brian Goldner","Yes. That's not really, Linda, what we've seen with demand in the toy industry. We've expanded our retail footprint. We obviously produce different kinds of products for different kinds of retailers at different price points with different levels of sophistication and interactivity so that every child can participate in our brands at every price point. We want them to be able to have a toy or a game that enthralls and delights them. So what we're seen is an expanding retail footprint. I've mentioned that we have more than 21,000 new doors net of all the closures we just described in the United States over the last 3 years, and these are all kind of new channels. We built this team to enable us to build the right kind of product for the right kind of retail destination. We don't believe that there will be any business that will go away in natural course because again, we're building innovative products. ","We're telling great stories around those products, either us or our partners. And we're building new play patterns. So we see people buy online. We see increasingly this pickup in store, which adds to the basket, so people do come into retail on an increasing basis. You're going to see a number of new ways that consumers can pick up product, get product, from reserving online to picking up today to buying online and picking up in stores. And so again, I think we're building the capability in this converged retail model that allows the consumer to move in any number of ways across the shopping and buying environment. And there is -- there's no reason in our minds, and the evidence is there, that there should be no gap in what's available to people to purchase. And we believe the industry will continue to grow.

Please go ahead.","Debbie Hancock - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning are Brian Goldner, Hasbro's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Deb Thomas, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer. Today we will begin with Brian and Deb providing commentary on the company's performance and then we will take your questions.","Our second quarter earnings release was issued this morning and is available on our website. Additionally, presentation slides containing information covered in today's earnings release and call are also available on our site. The press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that whenever we discuss earnings per share or EPS, we are referring to earnings per diluted share. Today's discussion of net earnings and EPS will exclude from last year second quarter results an unfavorable tax adjustment of $13.8 million or $0.10 per share as it does not speak to the underlying performance of Hasbro. A reconciliation to reported amounts is included in the earnings release and presentation accompanying this call.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management's expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters. These forward-looking statements may include comments concerning our product and entertainment plans, anticipated product performance, business opportunities, plans and strategies, the potential impact of foreign exchange translation, costs, our financial goals and expectations for our future financial performance.","There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements.

You should review such factors together with any forward-looking statements made on today's call. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.","I would now like to introduce Brian Goldner. Brian?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The positive momentum in our business continued in the second quarter and throughout the first half of 2015 with strong underlying demand in our Franchise and Partner brands, across geographies. While foreign exchange clearly had a negative impact on our reported results, absent foreign exchange, second quarter revenues increased 5% and the International segment grew 9%.","We spoke with you in April about several challenges we faced in the second quarter, including the anniversary of TRANSFORMERS: AGE OF EXTINCTION movie shipments, the shift of the release scheduled for MAGIC: THE GATHERING, and the timing of Easter. Despite these negative influences, our revenues grew absent FX and it is clear there is momentum in our brands around the world.","Although Hasbro Franchise Brands declined in the quarter, they increased 3% in the first six months of the year and 11% on a constant currency basis for the six-month period. Partner brands MARVEL, JURASSIC WORLD and STAR WARS all contributed to growth in the quarter and the first half of the year. Importantly, consumer take-away as measured by point-of-sale trends was positive in nearly every major market we track in the second quarter and was positive in all these markets year-to-date, with several countries posting double-digit gains.","On a recent trip to Latin America, I was reminded of how far we have come in just a few years in this region. Today, we are becoming a leader player in the Latin American market. The team is implementing our brand blueprint with tremendous retail execution, supported by engaging storytelling. Even though the economic and currency environment is a challenge, it is clear in everything we do that our teams in Latin America are creating the world's best play experiences.","Looking at overall Hasbro second quarter performance, Hasbro Franchise Brands were led by growth in PLAY-DOH, NERF, MONOPOLY and LITTLEST PET SHOP. The MY LITTLE PONY brand continues to be as popular as ever and point-of-sale increased meaningfully in nearly every country we track. On an as-reported basis, MY LITTLE PONY revenues declined in the quarter and first half of the year but grew in both periods absent the impact of foreign exchange.","Our new fall theme, Cutie Mark Magic, is off to a great start at retail and our all new MY LITTLE PONY EQUESTRIA GIRLS Friendship Games movie and associated product will be out in September. As we discussed in April, MAGIC: THE GATHERING faced a difficult comparison. Last year's major set release for the first half of the year occurred in the second quarter and this year it was in the first quarter. MAGIC: THE GATHERING revenues increased for the first half of 2015.","Finally, TRANSFORMERS revenues declined as expected following a movie year. Transformers: Robots in Disguise television programming and product are both performing well. TRANSFORMERS point-of-sale was positive in all major markets we track through the first six months of this year and up in many markets for the second quarter as we began to anniversary the mid-May on-shelf state for movie product.","For our Partner brands, compelling storytelling is clearly driving consumer engagement and interest. JURASSIC WORLD has been a tremendous success at the box office, and coupled with the strength of our line and strong global retail execution, is performing better than expected. Hasbro's portfolio of MARVEL lines also had a strong second quarter as retailers focused their merchandising activities around the global theatrical launch of Marvel's Avengers Age of Ultron. In addition, products supporting Marvel's Ant-Man are now hitting store shelves in time for the July 17 release.","We also recently expanded our relationship with Disney Consumer Products with the announcement of Playmation, a groundbreaking system of connected toys that use smart technology to inspire kids to run around and use their imaginations as they become the hero or heroine of stories from across The Walt Disney Company. Our teams collaborated with Disney Consumer Products on the development of Playmation and we are manufacturing and distributing the systems. Playmation Marvel Avengers preorders began July 7 and product will be available in October. We are excited about working together on this truly groundbreaking play experience and supporting future systems including STAR WARS in 2016.","STAR WARS shipments and point-of-sale in the second quarter were up. STAR WARS Rebels product is driving demand and we are seeing anticipation building ahead of the theatrical release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Hasbro's STAR WARS line based on the film will be at retail on September 4 and we unveiled our first Star Wars: The Force Awakens Black Series action figures a few weeks ago at San Diego Comic-Con. It is clear from our discussions with you that STAR WARS continues to be a major area of interest. Our expectations around timing have not changed and the first significant shipments commenced this quarter. We will continue to wave in new product throughout 2015 and in 2016 as the film will continue to be in theaters next year and we will further support the home entertainment release. As a result of the timing of the movie, we continue to anticipate revenues being somewhat equally split between the two years.","In addition to STAR WARS we have a tremendous fall and holiday lineup for the remainder of 2015 across our Franchise, Challenger and Partner brands. Content development for Hasbro brands remains a priority for our teams. In partnership with Paramount, in June, we brought together a group of tremendously talented writers to begin the creative development on the theatrical future of the Transformers Universe.","At San Diego Comic-Con we announced a new relationship with Machinima on an all-new digital series targeting the teen and adult TRANSFORMERS fans. Finally, earlier this month we announced that we will be collaborating with Lionsgate to bring MONOPOLY to the big screen. We have a tremendous writer, Andrew Niccol, who wrote The Truman Show. The film will be produced by Lionsgate and Hasbro's Allspark Pictures with Lionsgate financing the movie.","Our Games business remains critically important to our brand portfolio and we continue investing in gaming across our brands. Games revenues were flat over the first six months of the year. Our underlying trends are good and we have many new innovations for the second half of the year. These include an all-new, fan-driven MONOPOLY HERE & NOW and the addition of the Internet phenomenon PIE FACE to our portfolio. We are also driving several entertainment backlines supporting both the Minions movie and STAR WARS.","In addition, we recently launched the MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena of the Planeswalkers game which gives us a new footprint in the strategy board gaming category. As we further invest in global brand building, we announced last week that we signed a letter of intent to sell our games factories in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts and Waterford, Ireland to Cartamundi. It was critical for us to find the right owners for these operations. We know Cartamundi well, as we have worked together for years. We believe that within Cartamundi we had found owners with a strong heritage of manufacturing, a passion for communities and for their people.","They will employ all regular manufacturing and distribution employees at both sites and continue to manufacture much of Hasbro's traditional games business. Our agreement includes a five-year commitment to these facilities. The financial impact from this transaction is minimal and strategically it is the right move for Hasbro and for our people across these operations.","As we enter the second half of the year, we know there is a tremendous amount of work to be done to successfully deliver 2015 and to drive our company into 2016 and beyond through strategic investments and global execution of the brand blueprint. We are in a position of strength in the global marketplace with good momentum in our brands and tremendous innovation in our lines.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. In both the second quarter and throughout the first six months of the year, we experienced good momentum in our brands, improvement in our underlying profitability, and a strong balance sheet. Over the past 12 months we've generated $581 million of operating cash flow and we ended the quarter with $858 million in cash.","We continue to make important investments back into our business, in particular into strategic brands and new systems while also returning excess cash to shareholders. Through the first six months of the year, we returned $158 million through our dividend and share repurchase program. As evidenced by our reported results, the foreign exchange environment remains challenging but growth in our brands and strong consumer demand supported by the pricing and hedging actions we've taken to help offset the negative currency impact is enabling us to effectively manage the challenge. Our International teams have done a great job in understanding their markets and its needs during this time.","Looking at our segments for the second quarter, revenues in the USA and Canada segment increased 1%. Growth in the Boys and Preschool categories more than offset a decline in the Games and Girls categories. Growth in Franchise brands NERF, PLAY-DOH, MY LITTLE PONY and LITTLEST PET SHOP along with shipments of JURASSIC WORLD, STAR WARS and DISNEY DESCENDANTS contributed to the year-over-year growth.","Growth in the U.S. was partially offset by declines in Canada following Target's decision to exit the country. Consumer demand remains strong with point-of-sale in the U.S. increasing in the quarter and growing in both the U.S. and Canada over the first six months of the year. Point-of-sale for Franchise brands increased in both markets for the quarter and year-to-date. Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment was essentially flat year-over-year at 12.2% of revenues. International segment revenues declined 9%, Europe was down 14% and Asia-Pacific was down 6% while Latin America posted growth of 1%. Emerging market revenues were also down declining 11% in reported revenues. Growth in the Preschool category was more than offset by declines in the Boys, Games and Girls categories. Franchise brands PLAY-DOH, MONOPOLY and NERF, along with Partner brands MARVEL and JURASSIC WORLD were positive contributors to the quarter.","Absent the negative $69.5 million impact of foreign exchange, International segment revenues grew 9% and emerging markets grew approximately 9%. $43 million of the foreign exchange impact was in Europe with most of the remaining impact in Latin America. Absent FX, Europe grew 6%, Latin America increased 23%, and Asia-Pacific was up 1%. Operating profit in the International segment declined 13% reflecting the negative impact of foreign exchange. Absent this impact, operating profit increased versus 2014.","Finally, revenues in the Entertainment and Licensing Segment were flat with 2014. The segments performance is being driven by Entertainment-backed Licensing revenues. Operating profit declined $7.2 million as a result of a less favorable revenue mix, higher amortization expense and the timing of expenses in the quarter versus last year.","Turning to overall expenses for Hasbro, cost of sales in the quarter was favorably impacted by product mix including higher margins, royalty bearing product revenues, as well as the benefit of foreign currency hedges and the impact of pricing actions we've taken to help offset the negative impact of foreign currency. In total, cost of sales declined to 37% of revenues versus 38.6% in 2014. As a result of the revenue decline from TRANSFORMERS: AGE OF EXTINCTION movie product, royalties declined year-over-year to 7.2% of revenues. For the first six months, royalties are 7.7% of revenue.","Given the strength of our Partner brands year-to-date, cost of sales has trended lower than our previous expectations and royalties have trended higher. We expect both of these trends to continue for the remainder of the year. Product development increased from last year to 7.2% of revenues. As was the case in the first quarter, this reflects the investment we're making in a number of brand initiatives, in particular, in the development of the Disney Princess and Frozen properties ahead of the 2016 launch.","We continue to invest in innovation and the future of our business including investments in new brands. As the majority of these expenses are U.S. dollar based, we expect product development to be slightly above the high end of our previously-stated range which was 5% to 5.5% of revenue. Advertising was flat year-over-year as a percent of revenues as we continue to drive efficiency in our global advertising model. And intangible amortization increased in the quarter as we recorded the final quarter of amortization associated with digital gaming rights we re-acquired in 2005 and 2007. For the full year, intangible amortization is anticipated to be approximately $44 million, $26 million of which has been recorded over the first six months.","SG&A increased 5% in the quarter to 26.7% of revenues. This increase was driven by similar factors to the first quarter including higher equity compensation, higher depreciation and continued investment in our business including MAGIC: THE GATHERING digital platform. These increases were partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. As we said before, we believe these trends will continue and that SG&A will be higher versus 2014's level of 20.8%.","Turning to results below operating profit, other income from the quarter was $2.3 million compared to $4.8 million in 2014. Profitability improvements and our 40% share of the operating income from the Discovery Family Channel were offset by higher losses from foreign exchange. The second quarter underlying tax rate was 27.1% versus 26.8% in 2014. We expect our full year underlying tax rate to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5% reflecting continued higher anticipated earnings in the U.S. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.33 versus the adjusted earnings per share of $0.36 in 2014. We returned $79 million to shareholders in the quarter, $57.4 million in dividends and $21.6 million in share repurchases.","Receivables at quarter end were down 4% but increased 10% absent the impact of foreign-exchange. DSOs were 80 days, consistent with last year. Inventory decreased $89 million versus last year, $20 million of this decline represents the assets we're selling to Cartamundi and are now presented in current assets. Excluding both the pending sale of the factories and the impact of foreign exchange, inventory is essentially flat year-over-year.","As Brian stated earlier, the pending sale of our factories to Cartamundi is not expected to have a significant impact on our income statement. In addition to the inventory reclassification, $26 million of property, plant and equipment have been transferred to other assets because they are now held for sale.","As we begin the second half of the year, we have good momentum in our business and remain in a strong financial position. We're making necessary investments to position Hasbro for long-term growth while executing across brands and geographies in the near-term.","Brian and I would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on a great quarter.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Steph.","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Steph.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","I've two bigger-picture questions, if I could. Brian, you've been running this business now for close to almost 10 years. I wanted just to talk about the sightlines you have or the visibility over a multiyear period into the business today, maybe versus when you took the CEO role several years ago. And then, Deb just a question for you on cash flow priorities, we're looking at a nice cash flow cycle now, can you talk a little bit about prioritization of cash, maybe even looking at some of the brand partnerships you have or some acquisitions that you might be interested in? Thank you.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Steph, not to get too philosophical this early in the morning, I would say for me there's always been a quote or to kind of paraphrase from Bill Gates who said, \"People overestimate what they can do in two years, and underestimate what they can do in 10.\" And I think what you are really seeing is a byproduct of our teams around the world having worked together over the last decade in building the brand blueprint, recognizing how important consumer insights are, and investing in those consumer insights, investing in product innovation and storytelling and storytelling of all kinds of formats.","And as I look out to answer your specific question about sightlines, we believe now we've fully assembled the brand blueprint; we'll continue to invest in aspects of our business. Right now we're investing in MAGIC: THE GATHERING online. We want to continue to improve people's participation in our brands at every turn. We'll continue to invest in product development. You see some of that this year with investments in Disney Princess and over trend investments in R&D. But over the long-term, we feel that the blueprint has been assembled. We'll continue to add parts to it and pieces to it and we'll continue to execute across global geography. So we feel very good as a team that we have the right skill sets and we continue to on-board new leadership and new employees all the time who are helping us to deliver what you are seeing now.","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And that really ties in nicely to, actually, to the cash prioritization question because as we said consistently first and foremost, we want to invest in our business. And while we are always open to acquisitions, we are skeptical because we've seen that as we continue to invest and just invest in the skills we need around the blueprint, our brands and the new brands that we are investing and creating we believe will give the greatest return to our shareholders. So from a cash prioritization standpoint first and foremost we'll continue to invest in our business and then return excess to shareholders through our dividend and our share repurchase program.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Yes, thanks very much. Deb, I think in the press release or in the PowerPoint presentation you talked about increased investment in the back half of the year. Can you talk about specifically what those are? Are there any P&L impacts above and beyond what you guys have already provided in your cost and expense trends? And then also, when you look at your gross margin you talked about you expect to \u2013 it sounds like you expect it to be above what you originally projected for the start of the year, in the back half of the year, could you talk about some of the puts and takes for gross margin?","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Absolutely. Good morning, Eric. You are right, as we look at the investments, they are not really new investments we're making in the business. It's a continuation of what we've talked about previously. Investing in systems, Brian spoke earlier about our investments, our continued investments in MAGIC: THE GATHERING online. We continue to invest obviously ahead of revenues on the Disney Princess and Frozen lines, doing that because most of those investments are in U.S. dollars. It's just driving those rates a bit higher than we thought as we've seen foreign currency kind of settle out on the revenue line.","So really for us it's nothing new from an investment standpoint. It's just we are seeing more the impact of the continued foreign exchange trends on the percentages and driving that up. From a gross margin standpoint, our Partner brands continue to exceed our expectations and we believe that trend we see today will continue. What that does is to remind everyone when we have entertainment-backed property, they tend to command a higher price point and with that, they also carry higher royalties. So really what we were trying to say is we had called that gross margin would be around the same level it was and that we'd be able to sustain the level of what it was for the full year 2014. We think it may be a bit higher but in line with that we think our royalty expense will be a bit higher as well. So really what we're saying is if you look at the two together we are not expecting anything significantly different than what we told you at year-end. We're just acknowledging that that mix is a bit different and that's really what you are seeing in that gross margin line is mix.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead with your questions.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I know it's early days and the DESCENDANTS movie isn't coming out until the end of the month but wondering if you can just touch upon the retail takeaway there? And then also, Brian, a little further looking in the Girls category in general. You guys have a lot of exciting things in your pipeline to come that I'm sure everybody is really looking forward to seeing, but the Girls space looks like it could be pretty crowded next year, including the reintroduction of Bratz and Mattel has talked about some relationship that they have with DC Comics in Girl Action Figures. So just wondering how you're thinking about the Girls space next year as well? Thanks.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning. In the quarter, we shipped only a very little bit of DESCENDANTS, most of it's shipping now. We haven't yet seen retail takeaway to speak of, maybe a day or two, so I wouldn't really want to comment on retail takeaway quite yet. The movie does come at the very end of the month and we are very excited about the DESCENDANTS movie and the associated marketing around it. I think it will really resonate with the audience and we are very excited to get our first product line out there.","We are incredibly enthused by our efforts on all the R&D and innovation we are putting into the Princess line. The feedback we've had from retailers is that our Princess line is fantastic. Our marketing plans will be very robust and our partnership with Disney will enable us to launch in a very strong manner. We actually believe over time, we may be able to do better than the Princess line has done historically because of the innovation we're bringing to the line, global scope and scale of our two companies together, our partnership and commitment to grow Princess and Frozen business. So that's our focus and we believe that we have standout brands there.","MY LITTLE PONY, we've just begun to launch Cutie Mark Magic for the fall. It's already seeing very good takeaway in the fall as well this fall. September, we have an all new Equestria Girls movie breaking, the Friendship Games. And so whether it's short-term, medium-term, or even longer-term, we believe we have very compelling brands in the Girls space. We've built this business over time and we intend to continue to be incredibly innovative and bring very fun experiences to girls all around the world.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And then, Deb, can you just tell us what you're seeing on the sales adjustment side just for your business? Are you seeing any changes year-over-year?","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, not really. I mean our brands continue to do well. As you know, we report our sales net because we believe that that's actually the cash we'll collect and we think that's the best representation for our shareholders. But it's really we see nothing unusual. As Brian mentioned, our POS is strong and our retail takeaway has been good. Our retailers are excited about what we're heading into the fall with. So nothing unusual.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then...","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Felicia, yeah, if you look at \u2013 you just take Franchise brand. We can talk about POS but Franchise brand's POS in the quarter was up double digits, up 17%. So we're seeing great takeaway of our brands and they are resonating around the world.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Since you just offered it, let's talk a little more about POS.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Yeah, the POS is up nearly everywhere in the world. It was down a drop in Canada in the quarter but that's owing to something Deb mentioned, which was the exit of a retailer out of that region. But if you go around the world where we get the POS data, it's up double digits in several countries, in Mexico and Australia, the U.K., Spain. We're seeing good strong single-digit growth in France and Germany and the U.S. So again, across the business we're seeing great takeaway and we're seeing good market share gains in most of the countries where market share is measured, albeit I would take those numbers directionally. But certainly, we believe that that's indicative of the strength of the brand.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Taposh Bari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter as well. Brian, I wanted to ask about the Boys segment. It seemed like it outperformed expectations in light of the fact that you were anniversarying the TRANSFORMERS theatrical release last year. I guess the question is: are you seeing a difference in the cadence of the fall-off post-movie in that property specifically? The reason I ask is that the Entertainment and Licensing Segment also seemed to outperform our expectations and wondering if there's something going on there related to that property as well.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Taposh, I think it's a great insight on your part because in fact TRANSFORMERS year-to-date I would say is outperforming the trend you might see otherwise. Year-to-date the brand is down about half of what you would expect from the fall-off of the movie, although in the quarter it is off about what you would expect up against the movie, and that just relates to the shipments we would've had this time last year in movie shipments. In the U.S., for example, the POS through the end of the quarter in TRANSFORMERS was only down single digits. So you really are seeing both in terms of year-to-date shipments being down half as much as what you would have expected and the POS, the associated POS.","The movie-related product is certainly a major headwind versus a year ago but the TV-related product is performing quite well around the world and a very innovative product line and it's working quite well. As well, the Licensing business, inside of Entertainment and Licensing has performed quite well, it's continued to perform well in the quarter and year-to-date.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then, Deb, for you, just going back to the cash question. So you've got about $850 million at the midpoint of this year, which is materially above where it was last year, yet the pace of buyback is well below from where it was last year. So I guess as a question: can you remind us how you think about buyback? And why you're buying back less this year versus last?","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Well, first and foremost, we want to invest in our business, so much of that buyback is flexible depending on our level of investment. Beyond that investment in the business, we always prioritize our dividend, it's the promise we've made to our shareholders, we want to make sure we can maintain and our directors had increased our dividend again this year, I think for 10 years out of the last 11 years. So that's our prioritization and then we use our excess cash to go to the buyback. In 2014 we had mentioned we were able to cost-effectively bring some excess cash back to the U.S. and we returned that to shareholders through buyback. This year, we continue to believe that we'll be more in line with the 2013 levels than 2014.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks a lot. Best of luck into holiday.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning. When you guys talk about STAR WARS being evenly split, are you talking only about Episode VII product or does that include also Rogue One?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, we're really focused on \u2013 good morning \u2013 we're focused on the Episode VII product. We've had a lot of questions around what do we see as the tempo of Episode VII, and so we're just trying to get people the sense that we see it. Roughly equally split at this point albeit we'll update you as we get closer to movie timing and to our retail set date of September the 4th, but at this point, as we look at the business, lots of anticipation around the launch of the movie. The feedback we got for our first product at Comic-Con was phenomenal in the Black Series action figure. And we're seeing the tempo of Episode VII be roughly half, remembering that after December 18 the movie will continue in theaters for some time and roll into 2016 and then of course you have the home entertainment window.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. If we add in Rogue One, I guess 2016 will be bigger. But moving on to royalties. I was kind of expecting royalties to be down with Avengers, JURASSIC WORLD and so forth versus TRANSFORMERS which I thought would have a lower royalty than the others. So can you just explain a little bit more clearly I guess, why royalties were the way they were in the quarter?","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we mentioned the impact on royalties of TRANSFORMERS, year-on-year, so that's actually if you look at the revenue mix, it really is just how our royalty expense flows.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Gerrick, if you remember in the quarter in addition to some entertainment properties that performed quite well, NERF performed incredibly well, continues to grow, and so that's a lower royalty bearing item obviously it's our own brand. It has higher operating margin, and so that's really helped the mix of royalties in the quarter. And then of course TRANSFORMERS shipments, movie shipments were down, and as you know we don't pay for the movie production but we do provide a royalty to Paramount on movie-related sales.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And one last one, if I may. Mattel mentioned that the majority of this year's FX hit to gross margin would be in the back half because it'd be locked up in cost of goods sold, locked up in inventory and then flows through in the back half. Should we expect a similar dynamic for you guys?","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we think on a full-year basis we mentioned our gross margin should be a bit higher but our royalties will also be a bit higher. We have a fair amount hedged of product costs through the rest of the year. I think last year we had about 78% hedged of our product purchases and we probably have just a little bit less than that this year. So we've kind of built that protection into our gross margin for the year. For us the change is really going to be about product mix.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. Great. Thank you.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Gerrick.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Brian, could you remind us what the release schedule looks for like for MAGIC in the third quarter this year versus last year? And in the second quarter, what did Games do ex MAGIC?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In the second quarter, our traditional Games business was up a bit, and so that would be \u2013 let's call it board games business was up a bit in the quarter. In Wizards of the Coast in the quarter we also had a reduction of Duel Masters which they're restaging in Japan, so that was a bit of the impact in the Games business. As we go forward for MAGIC, there are a number of initiatives that are going across the brand. As we've talked about, we're investing to continue to improve and seek more players in MAGIC Online. We have Magic Duels. Hopefully you've downloaded it by now onto your iPhone. It's a great digital game that really introduces people to the play. And as we look at the holiday period, we'll have a couple of releases for MAGIC for the remainder of the year.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And is there any update on JEM AND THE HOLOGRAMS from a theatrical release perspective? Any product initiative launches you have? And how would you characterize the pipeline of content from Allspark as you look ahead?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The date is October 23 for the movie. We've already gotten some very positive feedback from audiences. As you know, early you get feedback and make sure you're on the right track. We're feeling very excited about the movie and we'll have a range of licensed product and some collector-oriented toys during the launch of the film, a great program from Sephora and several other licensees. But it's really our first step in reintroducing JEM AND THE HOLOGRAMS to audiences around the world and we'll build momentum around product, particularly toy product, as we move beyond the film, so not for this year but into the next couple of years.","And as you look at Allspark, the next major production is the MY LITTLE PONY animated film, which will come out in 2017. We'll announce a distributor shortly for that film. And again, we are able to make that movie for more of a nominal cost than a traditional animated film given all of our experience and expertise in animated television production, although this certainly will be on scale with all the other animated films you've seen in terms of quality and the look and the feel of the movie. The music as well as the cast is quite good but I won't steal the team's thunder. They'll announce some of that shortly. And that will be the next project from Allspark.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just one last question, Brian. We're hearing that retailers are going to dedicate a lot of shelf space to STAR WARS in the second half. Does that potentially cannibalize against other Boys properties that you have? Or do you anticipate retailers flexing space up in order to accommodate all your properties and brands?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think it's more of the latter of what you said. I think they're flexing space up. They're going to use a lot of space that wouldn't otherwise be dedicated to the modular or to end caps. I think you're going to find distinct locations for STAR WARS product in addition to more traditional locations. Remember year-to-date, MARVEL is performing incredibly well, and so I think retailers will continue to want to support the MARVEL lines. In the quarter and year-to-date, MARVEL has performed incredibly strongly. In the quarter, STAR WARS has performed well. The POS for both of those are very strong double-digits. So I would imagine retailers would want to support both. And then, of course, you have brands like NERF that continue to perform within the Boys arena. I'd say retailers are supporting more brands and more initiatives. I don't see cannibalization.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Advisors. Please go ahead with your question.","Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Just a couple here. One on Disney Princess. Brian, you talked about how the retailers are on the early showing of the line very receptive. Can you give us any framework of how you anticipate? Will there be any initial sell down of what's in the channel in the early part of 2016? And then how we should think about the cadence of that coming in and maybe scale of what you expect to do relative to what maybe Mattel is going to exit the year with, just directionally, I guess. And then, Deb, a clarification on your comments on an earlier question. So gross margins are better, royalties are higher, and it sounds like those two alone offset but then you also talked about some other expenses being a little bit higher. So I know you don't give EPS guidance but when you net all that down, if you gave EPS guidance, would that net all the way through a little bit lower? Or sort of in line?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right, so, if you \u2013 Tim, if you look at what's going on right now in the market, I would say there's discounting going on now at retail. In fact, you'll see that going on. I can't really comment on what the size of inventories will look like in January but I will tell you we will launch a full line of product in January and add to that as we go throughout the year. Certainly, 2016 is a year where we work to get to scale. We've been investing this year ahead of revenues, so that we can have a very strong launch for the line and then continue to grow it over the next several years. We do believe that there is upside in that business versus historical trends.","Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","As far as our expenses, Tim, we were saying that while you might see different items in the mix and I think I got asked the question about overall expenses earlier as well, our plan for the year really hasn't changed but what we see is mix and the mix in our line item has changed, and with the continued impact of Forex \u2013 as a matter of fact if you look at, kind of at our quarter end rates, our 2014 revenues would have been $286 million less than they actually were \u2013 with the impact the continued impact of Forex and just the timing of some of those expenses. Some of the percentages will look a bit different as you go through the full year.","Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then largely on STAR WARS, Brian, you gave, thank you for the color also about retailers flexing up space and you're not anticipating cannibalization. How are you and Disney approaching, I guess, sort of a big rush in early saturation? It sounded like you talked about multiple things being scaled out this year and even into next year. Is there any additional color you could provide on that? It would be appreciated. Thank you.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So on September 4 we'll have our full product lineup of STAR WARS product, but as you know we are experts at waving in new characters within those SKUs. And so you'll see us using our wave management techniques to bring new characters in constantly and new play patterns in as well. So what you see on September 4 will then be refreshed with new characters as we get closer to the film, as we introduce people, or the film introduces people to new characters. We'll then have characters that will follow that in time for Christmas and into New Year. And then you will have new waves of product and characters that will come in first quarter, second quarter and throughout 2016.","So we're trying to say that we're going to constantly refresh and update that product line as we've been known to do. It will give us an opportunity to continue to bring new innovation in everything from role-play to vehicles to action figures. And I think you are going to be really impressed with and we'll hopefully be able to share with you shortly what the product line looks like. Retailers have been very happy with the product lineup and are very excited.","Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you, and congrats on the good start to the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jim Chartier with Monness, Crespi. Please go ahead with your questions.","Jim A. Chartier - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions: first, could you just go into a little more detail on what drove the strength in NERF? Was it primarily Modulus and do you have any new shipments for (47:11) in the quarter? And then second, can you just talk about what's going on with Duel Masters? When do you plan to restage that business in Japan? Thanks.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, the restage of Duel Masters is going on as we speak. And the team has been working on several new initiatives around Duel Masters over time. In NERF, it's a combination of really strong carryover items from holiday that have continued to perform quite well. And then we have a number of new spring items. It is not related to Modulus. Modulus really comes in mostly in the second half of this year. And that will be more of the holiday offering, but the performance has continued to be quite strong, item for item and the user-generated content continues to grow.","Jim A. Chartier - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks and best of luck.","Operator","Thank you. At this time I will turn the floor back to Ms. Debbie Hancock for additional comments.","Debbie Hancock - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Rob, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today.

Please go ahead.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning are Brian Goldner, Hasbro's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Deb Thomas, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer.","Today we will begin with Brian and Deb providing commentary on the Company\u2019s quarterly performance and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Our third quarter earnings release was issued this morning and is available on our Web site. Additionally, presentation slides containing information covered in today\u2019s earnings release and call are also available on our site.","The press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that whenever we discuss earnings per share, or EPS, we\u2019re referring to earnings per diluted share.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management\u2019s expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters.","These forward-looking statements may include comments concerning our product and entertainment plans; anticipated product performance; business opportunities, plans and strategies; costs and cost savings initiatives; financial goals and expectations for our future financial performance.","There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. Some of those factors are set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K, our most recent 10-Q, in today\u2019s press release and in our other public disclosures.","You should review such factors together with any forward-looking statements made on today\u2019s call. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.","I\u2019d now like to introduce Brian Goldner. Brian?","Brian Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the third quarter, we continue to execute our brand blueprint globally, driving momentum in our franchise brands and key partner brands.","We delivered growth in all regions, including the emerging markets where our investments are fueling continued double-digit growth and profitability gains. We took strategic steps to position us for long-term growth, including the addition of Disney Princess and Frozen to our gross portfolio beginning in 2016. Finally, we continue to evolve and improve our content led branded play strategy and I will speak to this effort shortly.","Third quarter revenues increased 7%. We grew across all major operating segments of Hasbro including a return to growth in the U.S and Canada segment and continued growth in the international and our entertainment and licensing segments. Profitability increased as adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased 9% and our operating profit margin was 19.4% of revenues.","Our focus on Hasbro franchise brands and key partner brands fueled these results. Franchise brand revenues increased 36% in the third quarter. All seven franchise brands grew double-digit in the quarter. Additionally, point of sale at our top five U.S retailers for Hasbro franchise brands was up more than 30% in the quarter and year-to-date.","Let\u2019s highlight a few of these brands. NERF continues to be the brand of choice. According to NPD, if we combine NERF and NERF REBELLE it would be the second largest property in the U.S year-to-date through August. NERF revenues grew in the Boys and Girls categories globally, including in both the U.S. and Canada and international segments and point of sale was strong growing double-digits in several markets.","MAGIC: THE GATHERING also grew globally increasing in both the U.S. and Canada segment and international segment. The response to the July release of the Magic 2015 Core Set and September release of Khans of Tarkir positions the brand well into 2015. We believe there is tremendous future potential for MAGIC: THE GATHERING, as it continues to grow around the world. We are investing in the brand both in digital and analog play through technology and storytelling.","TRANSFORMERS: AGE OF EXTINCTION delivered over $1 billion at the global box office. This result coupled with an innovative new line drove strong year-over-year revenue gains in TRANSFORMERS. Through the first nine months of the year, TRANSFORMERS revenues are greater in international markets than in the U.S. and Canada segment, reflecting the mix of box office results and the global expansion of Hasbro.","Overall, the brand is performing in line with the last movie year and we\u2019re well into the development for the next installments of TRANSFORMERS content. This includes new television programming as well as collaborating with the filmmakers on our next ideas to reinvent and reimagine the TRANSFORMERS brand in movies.","Moving to Girls, the reimagination of LITTLEST PET SHOP is at retail now. While still early on, initial consumer reaction and takeaway is encouraging. MY LITTLE PONY revenues continue to grow in toy and licensed merchandise for both core MY LITTLE PONY and MY LITTLE PONY EQUESTRIA GIRLS.","The second film MY LITTLE PONY EQUESTRIA GIRLS: RAINBOW ROCKS launched in the U.S on September 27. The first box office weekend exceeded last year\u2019s box office by 37% and on a per theater basis ticket sales in the first three weeks grew in average of 19% in North America. The film will be distributed globally on networks around the world and in support of our all-screen strategy.","Our key partner brands contributed to revenue growth this past quarter, driven by our relationship with the Walt Disney Company. Revenues continue to grow in Marvel properties this past quarter, supported by both film and animation, products based on The Avengers and Spider-Man franchises grew revenues in the quarter. Additionally, Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy contributed to the quarters year-over-year results.","Building on our relationship with the Walt Disney Company for Marvel and Star Wars, during the third quarter we established a new strategic merchandising relationship with Disney consumer products with a globally popular Disney Princess and Frozen properties.","Through this new agreement, Hasbro will develop small and fashion dolls based on Disney Princess stories and characters as well as Frozen. Hasbro\u2019s line will be at retailers beginning in 2016. Our design, development and marketing teams are truly excited to bring their expertise in Girls and consumer driven innovation to the future of Disney Princess and Frozen.","This new relationship is a terrific compliment to the prolific Boys entertainment slate over the next several years, including film and television entertainment from Marvel and Lucas Film as well as the next theatrical installments of Hasbro\u2019s brands G.I. Joe and TRANSFORMERS.","As I mentioned at the start, we continue to evolve and improve our content led branded play strategy. To accelerate the progress and success of our joint venture television network, Discovery took a majority ownership position in the network during the third quarter, increasing its stake to 60%.","On October 13th, Discovery Family debuted. Through our five-year partnership, the Hub Network has enjoyed solid ratings gains, subscriber and advertiser growth and is now profitable. Discovery Family builds on the network\u2019s leadership in co-viewing were kids and families watch together and on the strengths of both Hasbro and Discovery to enhance the value of the network for the audience and for our shareholders.","Furthering our all-screen content strategy, we\u2019re building our storytelling and omni screen capabilities globally, reaching kids and families everywhere they\u2019re consuming content. Hasbro will continue to develop new programming in addition to our already rich programming library for Discovery Family and for networks and screens globally as we continue to build brands through storytelling.","In the first quarter 2015, we\u2019re launching the next installment of TRANSFORMERS television programming, TRANSFORMERS: ROBOTS IN DISGUISE. The all new show will debut on Cartoon Network in the U.S., the top rated primetime network for Boys ages 6 to 11 and 9 to 14.","Hasbro has developed tremendous expertise in producing animation. We are working with the world\u2019s best studios and we know how to produce top quality animation cost effectively. As our content strategy and all screen strategy evolve, we\u2019re building upon our experience in animation and storytelling.","In addition to television, there are select films where we\u2019re taking greater control of the process. We have two movies we\u2019re currently developing under our new film label, Allspark Pictures. These films are MY LITTLE PONY and JEM AND THE HOLOGRAMS.","Building on the global success of MY LITTLE PONY, we recently announced we\u2019re developing a MY LITTLE PONY animated feature. We have hired a great writer with strong credentials in animated film. In addition, we\u2019re producing a JEM AND THE HOLOGORAMS: LIVE ACTION FEATURE, directed by Jon Chu. The JEM AND THE HOLOGRAM story was reimagined from a Hasbro vault brand and inspired by the social media driven lives of girls today. The film is scheduled for release on October 23, 2015 and will be distributed by Universal Worldwide, with whom we co-finance the film.","We envision Allspark Pictures as a new way to make fresh and compelling movies based on new and existing Hasbro brands for audiences globally. Given Halloween is upon us, on October 24 and in partnership with Universal, Ouija will be out in theatres. This is an all-new spooky story that is true to the Ouija brand and rated PG 13.","In closing, we\u2019ve entered the holiday season well positioned driving our brands through innovation and consumer insights, supported by engaging marketing programs and strong retail execution around the world.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deb Thomas","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As Brian said, we had a good third quarter as we grew revenues in all regions and across our franchise brands. Hasbro\u2019s operating profit and operating profit margin increased. We\u2019ve continued to invest in our business for long-term growth, added a key new license beginning in 2016 while remaining focused on improving profitability and returning cash to our shareholders through our stock buyback program and dividend.","Before I review the quarter, I want to remind you of several items that impacted both this year\u2019s and last year\u2019s third quarters.","In the third quarter of this year, we restructured our investment in the Hub Network joint venture, reducing our ownership to 40% of the network. In connection with this restructuring, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $11.6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2014. This net charge is primarily related to the costs associated with recording the fair value of a put-call option exercisable at the end of 2021 that Hasbro and Discovery entered into related to this transaction.","In last year's third quarter, there were a number of factors impacting our reported earnings. This included a pre-tax charge of $75.5 million or $0.50 per diluted share related to an adverse arbitration award. A pre-tax charge of $4.1 million or $0.03 per diluted share associated with restructuring and partial pension settlement charges and a $23.6 million or $0.18 per diluted share favorable tax adjustment.","We have included a reconciliation to reported amounts in today's release. During the rest of my discussion of our business, I\u2019ll exclude these items as they do not speak to the underlying performance of Hasbro.","Looking at our segments, third quarter revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 4%. Revenues in both the Boys and Games categories grew in the quarter, partially offset by declines in the Girls and Preschool categories.","The Girls category decline was primarily the result of an expected decline in FURBY. The Preschool decline was primarily due to the challenging comparisons within Sesame Street, which included a difficult comparison with Big Hugs Elmo in last year's results.","Overall in the U.S., we had positive point of sale trends at our top five retailers and our inventory at retail was down slightly at quarter end. At the same time, retailers are expanding inventory to support our growing brands. Point of sale was up in Canada as well.","Segment operating profit in the U.S. and Canada increased 16% in the quarter, reflecting the higher revenue levels, favorable mix and improved expense leverage in the quarter, despite being partially offset by a challenging environment in Canada. We also continue to invest in our business, including support of key initiatives such as MAGIC: THE GATHERING.","In the international segment, third quarter revenues increased 11% with 7% growth in Europe, 24% growth in Latin America and 11% growth in Asia Pacific. ","Foreign exchange had a negative $9.7 million impact on revenue for the segment in the quarter. Internationally, the Boys, Girls and Preschool categories all grew and more than offset a decline in the Games category.","Within the Girls category, FURBY revenues declined, but not as significantly as in the U.S and Canada as non-English speaking markets are in their first year of FURBY boom. Operating profit increased 10% in the international segment on higher revenues, which were slightly offset by higher expenses related to supporting our expanding international and emerging markets business.","Entertainment and licensing segment revenues grew 10% fueled primarily by lifestyle licensing revenues for Hasbro franchise brands, including MY LITTLE PONY and TRANSFORMERS. The Entertainment and licensing segment operating profit declined to $493,000 in the quarter.","The benefit of higher licensing revenue was offset by lower television and digital streaming revenue as well as the acceleration of programming costs associated with Kaijudo programming. We decided to exit this brand and therefore have lower future revenues to amortize production costs against.","While Kaijudo\u2019s retailer and player community continue to grow into August, it did not meet our expectations and Kaijudo\u2019s Vortex card set, which released on August 29, was the games final paper trading card game release.","Looking at our overall expenses and profitability, operating profit dollars and margin increased in the third quarter on higher revenue levels, partially offset by continued investments in growing our business for the long-term.","Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue in the quarter declined. This decline continues to reflect growth in entertainment properties, including TRANSFORMERS and Marvel properties, as well as higher entertainment and licensing revenues.","As entertainment-backed revenues grew, royalty expense also increased. In the third quarter, royalties increased to 6.6% of revenues versus 6.3% last year. Through the first nine months, royalties as a percentage of revenues are equal to our five-year average of 7.3%. We continue to believe the full-year will be around this average.","Product development was 4% of revenues, a decrease of 2% year-over-year. In the third quarter of last year we had higher product development expenses due to the write-off of early film development for movies which had not yet moved to production. Our investment in innovation remains paramount to driving the future growth of Hasbro.","In addition to our ongoing focus on innovation, in the fourth quarter 2014, we\u2019ve begun investing in developing products for the Disney Princess and Frozen properties. Our investment for this exciting new line will ramp up in 2015 ahead of revenues. As the related revenues will not start to be recognized until 2016, we expect this investment to result in higher product development expense as a percent of revenues with our product development spending at the high-end or slightly above our previously communicated target of product development spending of 4.5% to 5% of revenues.","In future years, as we begin to recognize revenues, we expect to return to this more normalized range. In the third quarter, intangible amortization declined slightly year-over-year as some of our assets have become fully amortized.","Program production cost amortization increased $6 million in the quarter, primarily due to the write-off of television programming I referenced earlier. As Brian discussed, content development is fundamental to our strategy going forward, and we will continue to invest in content supporting our brands.","SG&A declined slightly as a percent of quarterly revenues, reflecting the impact of higher revenues. These expenses reflect continued investments in our business, including international operations and MAGIC: THE GATHERING.","Turning to our results below operating profit for the quarter, excluding the impact of our restructured investment in the Hub Network we mentioned earlier, other expense was $4.2 million compared to $1.6 million in 2013. This includes a $6.2 million loss from foreign exchange versus a slight gain in 2013.","We also recorded our 50% share in the Hub Network in this line. In the third quarter, this improved to a profit of $1.9 million versus a loss of $91,000 last year. In future periods this line will reflect our 40% share of the Discovery Family Channel.","As I mentioned, we recorded a charge primarily associated with recording the fair value of a put call option that the Company and Discovery entered into relating to this transaction as well as certain other items, including our share of restructuring charges. We anticipate there could be further expenses associated with restructuring the network in the fourth quarter of 2014 as Discovery Family channel plans are finalized.","The third quarter underlying tax rate increased to 27.8% versus 26.5% in the third quarter of 2013. We expect our full-year underlying tax rate to be in the range of 27% to 28%, reflecting higher anticipated earnings in the United States.","For the third quarter, average diluted shares were 128.7 million shares, compared to 131.8 million last year. The actual amount of shares outstanding at the end of the third quarter 2014 was 126.2 million. Diluted earnings per share, absent charges in the third quarter of 2014 were $1.46 versus $1.31 in 2013.","At quarter end, cash totaled $452.2 million, reflecting our higher levels of share purchases. In the third quarter, we returned a $179.2 million to shareholders, $54.7 million in cash dividends and $124.5 million in share repurchases. At quarter end, $183.6 million remained available at our current share repurchase authorization. In the first nine months of the year, we repurchased 6.4 million shares returning $341.3 million to shareholders.","Receivables at quarter end increased 8% versus 2013 and compared to a 7% increase in revenue. DSOs were 80 days in both 2014 and 2013. Inventories increased $52 million versus last year. Inventory to support our emerging markets growth was the biggest component of this increase. Year-over-year inventories were also up in developed economies to support anticipated higher revenue levels in 2014.","Versus the second quarter, inventory increased slightly by $6 million. Additionally, our inventory at retail is well positioned to support the fourth quarter across the major markets where we are able to track these levels.","As I mentioned, retail inventory declined slightly in the U.S., but increased in many of the brands with strong point of sale trends. Outside the U.S., inventories up in some markets, but also well positioned to support the holiday season.","With three quarters behind us, the full success of our year will be determined by how consumers embrace our products this holiday season. We are well positioned with innovative brands, inventory in all of our key locations, and strong marketing programs to capitalize on the holiday season.","Before we take your questions, I'd like to turn the call back over to Brian for a few additional remarks. Brian?","Brian Goldner","Thank you, Deb. I want to take a moment and recognize David Hargreaves, Hasbro's Chief strategy Officer. Many of you know David personally. Last week he announced that after 32 years, he will be retiring from Hasbro in February. David\u2019s stewardship, vision, and business acumen have been instrumental in our success today as a branded play company.","There is no question Hasbro would not be where it is today without David\u2019s leadership. His legacy will be defined by his tireless work ethic, his belief that Hasbro comes first, and his competitive drive to ensure Hasbro's success is sustainable for generations to come. For me personally he has been a trusted partner and advisor. Please join me in thanking David for his dedication and all the significant contributions to Hasbro and wishing him all the best as he begins this exciting new chapter in his life.","Deb and I are now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Sean McGowan with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","Thank you and I will echo those sentiments on David. It\u2019s been a pleasure to work with him over the years. A couple of things, if I could ask about, one, can you help us understand the strategy and the kind of bracket the exposure with you getting directly into film production? Why the change and how much money are we talking about being put up?","Brian Goldner","Good morning, Sean.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","Good morning.","Brian Goldner","Allspark Pictures is really just an evolutionary step in our content strategy as we think about ourselves as a branded play company. Recognize that over the last few years since we started the studio and began working as a joint venture partner on the Hub, we have already produced 1,250 half hours of kid\u2019s animation and programming. We\u2019ve also produced a few movies with the EQUESTRIA GIRLS. So we\u2019ve already produced full length animated movies. The difference here is really the format of going out and ensuring that rather than getting just a few theaters like we do for EQUESTRIA GIRLS where we get 400, 500 theaters, we want to go out and get more theaters and we want to have a partner that will distribute our movies first in theatrical and then allow us to go through all the different other stages of distribution for that entertainment. So we don't really view in the short-term any kind of material expenses and the technology in animation has really changed so dramatically we\u2019re on the forefront of developing animation and we see that movies can be produced very economically and as you can see we have not had material impact from the movies we produced thus far and while these budgets may be bigger, they\u2019re certainly not as big as the big animated theatricals from other people.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","But didn't you say that the JEM was going to be a live action?","Brian Goldner","Correct. You know JEM again very small budget movie relative to live action movies. It\u2019s an opportunity to take a brand out of the vault, tell the new story and reinvent the brand and then put it out across all the elements of our brand blueprint. So again, we don\u2019t see that budget as significantly material. In fact, the movie has been primarily shot already.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","Great. Okay if I could follow-on with one regarding MAGIC. Could you give us some sense of how much it was up in the quarter?","Brian Goldner","MAGIC was up double-digits in the quarter.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","Well, that covers a pretty broad range, doesn\u2019t it? So, I think it was pretty crucial to see how these new releases were going to go to date. Did they meet your expectation?","Brian Goldner","Yes, Tarkir has been a great release. The fans have really enjoyed it thus far. Still early days, because you know it\u2019s just been released. We talked about earlier in the year the fact that the releases really do matter. This is a storytelling brand first and foremost and engagement with characters is critical. So this is on track with our expectations and MAGIC continues to demonstrate both short and long-term great potential and we continue to invest in the brand both on the analog and digital side as we see great opportunities not only for this year, but for many years to come in MAGIC: THE GATHERING and growing it as a true global brand, as one of our major franchise brands.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","And are you still seeing an increase in the percentage of the total revenue that\u2019s coming from digital?","Brian Goldner","Yes, we continue to see digital continue to grow over time and we\u2019d expect over time that it would continue to grow.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Crum - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Okay, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Brian, I wonder if you could comment on point of sales for the Games business in the quarter. If I missed that, I apologize. And then, you also mentioned that the Games business was down overseas and I just want to understand what the variance was there relative to the performance in the domestic market?","Brian Goldner","Yes, so you have a couple of places where there are some differences by category depending on what the comp was a year-ago. And remember some of our international markets run games a little behind us just as they have more of the FURBY business for example right now, because FURBY boom is still running through those markets and you see that we\u2019re up against the bigger comp in the U.S. on that brand and therefore against the category of Girls. So we don\u2019t see that there was anything there except timing with games being down internationally as we continue to build some of the new releases. If you look at POS where we have POS data in several countries, overall POS in toys and games was up in the U.S and it was up for all the countries we measured, so Canada, Mexico, Australia, France, U.K. and Spain. The only place our POS overall as a company was down a little bit was in Germany. POS in games was down a bit in the third quarter in the U.S.","Drew Crum - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then, if I could switch over to Disney Princess, I think you made some comments on the increased product development costs you are anticipating as a percentage of revenue next year. As you think about the royalties associated with this license, where should we expect that to trend once you get into 2016 relative to that five-year average? And then in addition to that, can you provide any commentary around minimum guarantees, anything that was paid out in the third quarter or anything that we should anticipate for the balance of the year or over the life of the licenses?","Brian Goldner","Yes, happy to do that. First and foremost, the Disney pitch for Princess and Frozen business was a creative pitch. And as you know we\u2019ve developed great consumer insights in innovation, in our Girls business, we\u2019ve been driving our Girls business and growing it globally and that was the most important element of our presentation to the team. Second, while we don't disclose royalty rates for any of our agreements, I'll tell you that the development of dolls is very different than action figures and the markets for dolls and action figures are very different. And therefore the royalty rates for dolls are not as high as action figures, because of what goes into producing and the content that goes into the lines, the fashion that goes into the lines and other elements. ","And then in terms of the minimum guarantee, we certainly believe the minimum guarantee is at the level that we should be able to earn this out over a multi-year period. We didn't disclose the minimum guarantee because we didn't feel that it was material and for perspective I remind you that in 2013 we did disclose the minimum guarantee for our Marvel and Lucas agreements. And as you may remember, that totaled an additional 80 million for Marvel and up to 225 million for Star Wars. So we're trying to give you a perspective there that again we don\u2019t believe that the minimum guarantees in the Disney Princess and Frozen lines is material in the same way.","Drew Crum - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Okay, very helpful. Thanks, Brian. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Stephanie Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question.","Stephanie Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone. I will echo the sentiments on David as well. Just a couple questions. First clarification, if you could, Brian. I think you mentioned franchise brands up 36%, total revenues up 7%. Can you talk a little bit about the non-franchise brands, which ones are a drag, either expected or otherwise? And then just a higher level question regarding the cost of introducing new brands into the Toy category. How do you see that playing out here over the next few years? How do you think about kind of the build versus buy strategy and how should we think about the cash prioritization here over the next couple of years? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Yes, that\u2019s a good question. The thing to note for the most part, if you look at our brand the impact that a brand like FURBY has in the third quarter, that\u2019s a -- it was a big drag or headwind relative to the growth that you\u2019re seeing in our franchise brands, FURBY was down in the quarter by around 50% versus a year-ago. We told you in the last quarter\u2019s call that 70% of the revenues would happen in the second half of the year. And again, order of magnitude, if you took Beyblade and FURBY together in Q3, up against a year-ago, we\u2019re talking about an impact of $150-ish million relative to year-ago\u2019s revenues. So that\u2019s what you\u2019re really seeing when you talk about some of the non-franchise headwinds and comping up against some very strong numbers a year-ago in both of those brands as a good perspective of why you see those differences. ","In terms of building brand, I think we built a brand blueprint. We built the assets and we continue to hone our capabilities to launch our new brands and vault brands into the toy space, into the branded play space beyond just toys. We're building a model that enables us to do that and we\u2019re adding capability all the time to create that. Also growing our franchise brands is very cost effective. They tend to have higher operating margins, launching of vault brand has similar high operating margins over time. There are investments that we make in our business all the time to build our business whether its MAGIC: THE GATHERING or MY LITTLE PONY content or TRANSFORMERS TV series or frankly working with PLAY-DOH in China with partners to make a PLAY-DOH TV series there, that\u2019s all part of a modern branded play company going to market globally and enthralling audiences and consumers and our customers that we have the brands that have the momentum and are quite salient for the end users.","Stephanie Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. Best of luck guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of James Hardiman of Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Couple of questions on the hub, it seems like the financial impact of your lower stake is fairly in consequential. Can you maybe speak to whether or not the overall TV strategy is changing at all, I think once upon a time you gave us some guidepost with respect to TV related merchandise and incremental TV related merchandise. How are we doing there versus sort of your expectations and how should we think about just the overall strategy going forward?","Brian Goldner","The impact for TV merchandise is fairly significant. As you can see whether you look at the MY LITTLE PONY business or the early days of building back our littlest touchup business, what we have done in TRANSFORMERS and certainly TRANSFORMERS RESCUE BOTS which has contributed to our pre-school business and that Preschool show that\u2019s out around the world. The changes we\u2019ve made to the relationship on now Discovery Family was the hub really allows a couple of things to happen. First and foremost we still have a significant number of hours each day to program on that network which give us the opportunity to put up both our library shows as well as select new productions on to the network, and as you know that\u2019s been one of the keys to unlocking our international TV efforts to have a domestic outlet to put shows on the air is critical to international broadcasters as they make their decisions for placement and so we continue to have that as an asset for us. So we believe we will continue to grow our TV related merchandise as we have, we think the thesis there is incredibly strong. Discovery now having more of the ownership and consolidation will continue to build what we\u2019ve seen as an early strength of the network that\u2019s co-viewing in primetime and Discovery obviously has libraries worth of programming and ideas for shows that should help us to build that primetime audience that co-viewing audience. And then the final point is that, Hasbro has the flexibility now in this new relationship to put select new shows or original productions outside of Discovery Family. You\u2019ll note that we just announced that our new transformers TV series, ROBOTS IN DISGUISE that will go on the air early next year, will go directly to Cartoon Network because we feel that\u2019s a better environment, a very strong environment to drive Boys ratings and to generate merchandise sales. So it\u2019s a -- overall this move helps us to reinforce what we\u2019ve done thus far and to strengthen our position going forward in television.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research","That\u2019s very helpful. And then just briefly on TRANSFORMERS. I think you mentioned that you\u2019re running pretty comparable to where we were for the last movie. How should we think about that Domestic versus International? Is it fair to say that International is growing versus last time around and we continue to see some contraction domestically and I guess just bigger picture, how is the TRANSFORMERS sales going versus how you thought about them heading into the year given some meaningful tailwinds?","Brian Goldner","Yes. So, if you look at TRANSFORMERS over the first three movies, two of the years right around $500 million and one year the middle year was closer to $600 million. We\u2019ve said, the last movie year we\u2019re tracking kind of comparable to that. Its very heartening for us with all the effort and the investments we\u2019ve made in emerging markets not only to see the overall emerging market growth that we\u2019ve experienced over the last several quarters and continued into this quarter, but to see transformers as a major calling card for our company into emerging markets to see audiences and consumers coming our and buying TRANSFORMERS and really enjoying the brand. And also to see the kind of success that we had in China. We know that\u2019s a great long-term opportunity for our company to have TRANSFORMERS be such a ubiquitous and beloved property there, pertains very good things for our company as we continue to build in that region.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research","Thanks a lot. Thanks Brian.","Brian Goldner","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","Hi, good morning. Thank you. Just with staying on that Transformers theme for a second, Brian, can you just tell us the mix that you're seeing so far International versus US as it's compared to -- as it was compared to the last movie?","Brian Goldner","Yes, it\u2019s again -- in percentage terms slightly more developed internationally and particularly I think it\u2019s important, that within international territories you also -- have to also look at emerging markets versus developed economies. It\u2019s very much what we talked to you back as early as even February and the year ago, that the pyramid of growth has been kind of turned a bit on its head as we continue to see the growth in multiplexes and malls globally, markets like Russia, China, Korea, Colombia, Brazil play a bigger role in our entertainment box office. The movie industry is certainly seeing that and we also are seeing that growth and enabling us to introduce new kids and new consumers to our brands and we\u2019re seeing the up tick in sales a result.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","Okay, great. And when you say sales like -- when you say comparable, I just want to be clear, are you talking about kind of sell-in or POS?","Brian Goldner","Well, obviously the POS is strong behind sell-in and sort of running comparable to the sales, so we are seeing very strong global or international POS. We\u2019re seeing some good POS building for TRANSFORMERS as we get into the third, into the fourth quarter. But again it\u2019s definitely, if you look at -- look at the brand, TRANSFORMERS obviously is still up significantly versus a year ago and is contributing to the company this year. In the U.S. and internationally, and we continue to see TRANSFORMERS contributing significantly to our U.S. business versus the last movie. What we\u2019re saying is that the sales are more diversified to the international markets. So we\u2019re just giving you a perspective more longer term as it continue -- as Hasbro and the brand continue to be a more global company.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","Right, helpful. Thank you. And then just on the POS trends that you and Deb talked about in the prepared remarks, I was just wondering -- the momentum that you've seen since the second quarter in POS, has that increased -- have you seen an acceleration? Has it kind of stayed the same? So I just wanted to get some color on that.","Deb Thomas","I think it\u2019s really been consistent. As you head into the all important holiday season, our expectation is that we\u2019ll see -- certainly from our standpoint we have had that consistent momentum, but we are heading into the all important holiday season. When I think all retailers are hoping that the POS picks up overall.","Brian Goldner","And obviously you\u2019ve seen the results in our franchise brands and the POS are on our franchise brands has been equally strong, we talked about that, that again I think what we\u2019re seeing. If you look at the holiday season into the U.S. not surprisingly a very selective consumer that\u2019s buying the brands that are incredibly meaningful to them, our franchise brands are thus far been incredibly meaningful and our desired and I think we\u2019ll continue to drive that into the holiday. Obviously the bulk of our media spend starts right around now and in through the holiday period and so, we think we\u2019re set up well for this holiday season recognizing that sales continue to happen later and that the consumer is selective and we\u2019re happy to see that they\u2019re selecting a raft at Hasbro\u2019s brands.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","Thank you. Final question, just Deb, on royalties, the absolute number you reported was a bit different than what we were looking for. So, I was just wondering, can you just help us kind of bridge the year-over-year -- kind of the puts and takes year-over-year and sequentially in royalties -- for royalties?","Deb Thomas","Well really the biggest impact on royalties this year was the mix and we did put a reconciliation in, because last year we had an impact on royalties from the settlement of an arbitration award and we had an impact this year. So, year-on-year it\u2019s up a bit. Its mostly due to product mix, but for the full year we still expect to land about that five year average of I think 7.3% was the five year average and we were contracting along that rate earlier in the year as well.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. I'm curious if you guys are seeing any overarching trends in the Preschool category. It seems like both you and your closest competitor seem to be struggling the most in that category. So I didn't know if there was something else going on maybe at the retail level? And are there any new initiatives from Backflip that would be helpful for us to understand any of the digital business going forward?","Brian Goldner","Sure. If we look at Preschool we have seen great global growth for one of our newest franchise brands and PLAY-DOH which continues to accelerate. It\u2019s a play pattern that\u2019s highly relevant to kids and did their parents globally. We are also seeing good strength where we have character base Preschool products like TRANSFORMERS RESCUE BOTS where we\u2019re seeing growth. I will say the core playschool business a couple of years ago, we really needed to focus in on making that business sustainable for the long-term which meant building back some of the profitability in that brand and ensuring that we can make great innovative products that our customers and Hasbro could make money on and to build unique innovation. So we\u2019re willing to really focus in on the profit side and get to the right revenue level. I think now we\u2019ll start to turn on and drive more of the revenue side having rethought the way to go forward in that business. And I do think that it requires a level of innovation and differentiation that we can provide in playschool. I think it\u2019s just going to take a bit longer in our core business. But having seen a lot of our future products and where the innovation is going I\u2019m very heartened that that teams got their arms around it and that you\u2019ll be seeing some great products from playschool core over the next several years.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","And then any new news on the Backflip front?","Brian Goldner","Sure. Yes, so Backflip is our -- I won't say exactly what new initiatives they\u2019re working on, obviously a highly competitive category. But they have a couple of at least one big franchise brand in DragonVale we\u2019ll continue to work there. And then as we had always imagined that as we got through the early days we would start to focus in on Hasbro brands that would have great meaning to them, and they still have a very strong and continue to build on their network of daily active users and monthly active users and you\u2019ll see Hasbro brands on the Backflip platform. If you\u2019ve looked lately you may have seen a NERF Hoops App that\u2019s really fun to play. That\u2019s a little reminiscing of Paper Toss but now you get to play in a NERF environment which is quite fun and a network builder for us there and they will continue to launch a number of new games this year finishing this year \u201914 and some pretty robust bus plans for 2015. So, again as we go long-term we\u2019re very pleased with and excited to be in the mobile gaming space and a great team out at Backflip.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Mike Swartz, SunTrust Robinson. Please proceed with your questions.","Michael Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Hi, good morning everyone. Maybe you can provide us some more color just how you're thinking about kind of go-forward investing in terms of ad and marketing dollars. How do you look at that versus trade brick-and-mortar versus maybe the digital or e-commerce realm?","Brian Goldner","Number of years ago we used to talked about and, I mean I think I remember talking to you guys about building a seven layer cake. And today it\u2019s more like 70 layer cake. And I think the teams have gotten incredibly smart about how to build more of a digital presence and the social media and digital presence we built recognizing that digital cost less out of pocket than over the air media, but requires expertise that we brought onboard inside the company, and we continue to build in that space. Advertising still has a very powerful, an immediate impact to the sales of our products when done well and so you\u2019ll continue to see us investing in television and off-screens, short form media and long form media, so webisodes and shorts and all kind of videos. If you go online I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see the ubiquity we\u2019re building around our brands online to give kids and family short form content. You also see that we built our digital asset delivery so that as we look at online retailing you now get a full immerse of experience. You can get a virtual product experience in so many different ways online and get to make a purchase decision right there online and we\u2019re doing that with lots of our retail partners. So marketing is just become more complex, not necessarily more costly given the expertise we\u2019ve brought onboard, but certainly we are working in every element that matters to consumers and fans of our brands and building those new capabilities. And I do think that over time that roughly 10% (indiscernible) recognizing that we also view royalties as somewhat of a marketing expense. I have talked to you before about looking at those two lines together as a way to see the impact of our brands and that would in fact be the case. And then of course our own programming efforts and animation efforts add to that and have enabled us to build hundreds of million of dollars worth of merchandising sales for our brands around the animated stories we\u2019re telling.","Michael Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Great, that's extremely helpful. And then maybe for Deb, just how do we think about -- with the strengthening dollar here, how do we think about the impact of currency or maybe top line and earnings over the next let's call it 12 months? Is there a rule of thumb or \u2026?","Deb Thomas","That\u2019s a good question Mike, because we saw the U.S. dollar really strengthen significantly in September. And while we do have significant hedges for our transaction exposure particularly product purchases and royalties we don\u2019t hedge a 100%, so we did have a little bit of an impact in Q3. But we have significant hedges in place for \u201914 and \u201915 right now, so that\u2019s on the product side but again not 100%. But based on our revenue mix the translation piece is the bigger piece. So if you think about and we disclosed this in our 10-K last year about 55% of our revenues are U.S. dollar based revenues is because of how we sell them into the market, but the euro is our next biggest exposure and that was about 18% of our 2013 revenues. So if the euro was to stay at levels that it\u2019s at currently last years Q4 revenues would have been about $20 million lower than they actually were. So, if you kind of think about that about 18% of full year revenue our euro based and as the dollar strengthens and the euro declines against it that does have an impact. Our next biggest exposure was the pound but that\u2019s only about 5%. So that doesn\u2019t have as significant an impact. And when you think about that flowing through to the bottom line there\u2019s a bit on our un-hedged portion of inventory and that\u2019s what we saw in the quarter just because of the precipitous decline that happened in September. But we have hedged probably about 75% to 80% of our product purchases euro based right now. So that\u2019s less of an impact but the translation impact could be significant and it tends to be about 10% to 15% of the top line impact on the bottom line.","Michael Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, that's fantastic. So, I would assume then the impact in the third quarter was maybe a little more than that 10% to 15%?","Deb Thomas","No, it was probably about that impact.","Michael Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, that's great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The next question comes from the line of Timothy Conder of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Timothy Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Thank you and my congratulations to David on his career and best of wishes. A couple of things, and thank you also for the color on the Disney Princess, Brian, that\u2019s much appreciated. A couple things relating to Canada. You commented that it was challenging. Was that due to FX there also or is it in demand I guess this is the first question? And then you were very excited at Toy Fair about DohVinci as it relates to the Girls category. Just any update on the early trends that you're seeing there? And related to Sesame Street within Preschool, granted you had very difficult comps, but in general how is that business trending versus your expectations at this point? Say from when you got into the business?","Brian Goldner","Sorry, repeat the third part.","Timothy Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","The Sesame Street, Brian -- how is that trending overall versus your expectations?","Brian Goldner","Thank you. Yes, so let\u2019s start with Canada. As you know we\u2019ve had some changes up there in retailers and retail strategies and obviously working through that with our partners. The demand profile in the market has been a bit different than the U.S. We\u2019re now seeing some strong growth in POS in the third quarter, so double digit growth in POS in Canada in the third quarter. And so it\u2019s lagging a little bit for us versus some of our shipments but we certainly have robust plans for the holiday season up there. But yes, as you know over the last year or two there has been some shaking out in changes within the retail landscape, and we\u2019re just working through that. So, we don\u2019t see there\u2019s any long-term impact. In fact we continue to believe that Canada should perform fairly well this year. Second, in DohVinci we\u2019re incredibly happy with the early results albeit early days. The consumer feedback has been fantastic its really a fun product line to play with and we believe we\u2019re entering a really good -- with a really good new innovative product line in a great category and a great extension for DohVinci and we have seen good uptake not only here in the U.S. but in several markets around the world. And then finally Sesame Street I think that mostly in Sesame Street we had a very big Elmo last year, and that drives a lot of dollars as you know. So it can cloud or obfuscate that sort of results the underlying trends on that brand. And I think as we go forward we\u2019re incredibly excited not only about Sesame Street in several countries but some very fun early results for Furchester in the U.K. and that TV series. And so I think that and some new leadership at Sesame Street. So all around I would say that long-term we can remain very excited about the Sesame Street business and we have some great product lineups coming up over both this year and in future years.","Timothy Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And then -- thank you and two more quick questions here. One, do you anticipate China being profitable this year? And then secondly, Deb, you had mentioned that some things are now fully amortized. Any broad update to the change in your overall amortization expectations here for the balance of the year or looking out to \u201915, \u201916?","Deb Thomas","No I think Tim, from an amortizations standpoint we remained comfortable with what we had in the 10-K because that included the Backflip which was the big update we had. So as we see things trending out we remain comfortable that that was a consistent expectation.","Brian Goldner","Yes, in China, right now we\u2019re probably about breakeven recognizing that we said we\u2019ll continue to invest in that market for the longer term to build it over time. As you know, this is just one example among many that TRANSFORMERS had such ubiquity in the box office and yet we\u2019re still building points of distribution so that the majority of Chinese consumers can enjoy the brand from a product standpoint and licensing standpoint so that requires additional investments and we\u2019re building our joint venture relationship with Alpha (indiscernible) and it was also luckily the year of the PONY, so MY LITTLE PONY got a good shot in the arm, but we continue to build that brand in that market place as well. We again see China long-term as a great opportunity for us. But it\u2019s not time to just start to look only at profitability as the key criteria for that market. We see many years of revenues, growth and we\u2019ll get to profitability over a period. But first we want to build the ubiquity of our brands in line with the story telling that we\u2019re putting into the market.","Timothy Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Eric Handler with MKM. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Handler - MKM Partners","Yes, thanks for taking my question. Two questions for you actually. As you continue to build out your infrastructure internationally, can you maybe discuss how the Marvel products have evolved there in terms of the percentage of revenue coming from domestic versus international as the movies continue to succeed and do quite nicely? And then you've got Avengers 2 coming out next year and China is actually a big part of the success of a superhero genre, so I would be interested in your thoughts on that. And secondly, when you look at MAGIC: THE GATHERING, are we -- do you think we are going to be at a point where we're seeing a lot more cyclicality or volatility in the revenue stream that's going to be a lot more dependent upon new card releases than ever before given the competition that we're seeing from Activision with this Hearthstone game?","Brian Goldner","Yes, let me start with Hearthstone. Our game is both in analog and digital game and the power of that brand is in the ability to have 100s of 1000s of face-to-face tournaments going on around the world every year and to have players engage in the analog business as well as the digital business, and we\u2019ll continue to build upon both lines. The brand is related and releases do make a big difference to that brand, but that\u2019s not a new phenomenon and it continues as we\u2019ve said. It\u2019s a brand that tends to go more release driven than more seasonally driven. And we\u2019ve talked about that over a long period of time and so there are bigger and smaller releases of characteristic going on over time. There\u2019s a curation that that team goes through to really work with their fans and understand how best to layout the story over time. And so that continues to be a story telling led brand that\u2019s enjoyed both in analog that is completely unique to the market place and have nothing to do with some of the light digital games that are out there from competitors. We do in fact have a light game as well that can be played on the iPad that Duals with the Planeswalkers. And then a much more immersive game in MAGIC: THE GATHERING online which our fans quite like and we\u2019ll continue to drive and invest in both sides of that. As it comes to the Marvel business, Marvel was a significant contributor to our business. This quarter we expect that Marvel will continue to contribute over many years to come as will Star Wars. We have seen a great impact to the partnering Marvel becoming part of the Walt Disney Company, Walt Disney\u2019s Global Scope and Scale has helped Marvel to become more of a global brand. The Box Office results as we see more and more audience and members going out around the world and watching movies globally. The Box Office being more internationally focused are relative to the U.S. Box Office. The proportion of international to the U.S. box office has been helpful in building that brand out around the world. And our marketing partnership in putting great innovative products out around the world for example, the TITAN hero series, the 12 inch figures that sell at an SRP of about $9.99 have really helped in emerging markets, allow young kids to get great product in their hands at a very value oriented price point. So it\u2019s the innovative product lines like Mashups and TITAN HEROES series, MASHERS as well as what Marvel and Disney have done to build the global footprint of the label and the movie successes. As well as where they\u2019re putting the animation out around the world all helps to contribute to make that brand a more global brand, that\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited not only about 2014 but many years to come for both Marvel and Lucas film.","Eric Handler - MKM Partners","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Gerrick Johnson - BMO Capital Markets","Hi, good morning. I would just like to revisit Magic once again now that the releases are out; third quarter offsetting sort of a weak first half. What was the nine months for Magic? I think that should be a good comparison at this point, both point of sale and shipments? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Yes, so year-to-date Magic is up mid single digits. In the quarter it was up double digits. So it\u2019s the momentum is building but Magic year-to-date through the third quarter was up.","Gerrick Johnson - BMO Capital Markets","Okay, great. And you gave us some good direction on the cost of the Princess license, you have any sort of guidance for the revenue that could generate from this? Mattel gave us a range on their call, but I was wondering if you could give us an idea of where you thought it might shake out in \u201916 and beyond? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","I think if you look at what we\u2019ve done in our gross business, the team has done a phenomenal job and customers and consumers around the world are really enjoying the innovation. The consumer insight that we brought to those brands, the story telling and what we can do as an IP owner in building out the MY LITTLE PONY business, the EQUESTRIA GIRLS business and what we\u2019re now doing with Littlest Pet Shop. And I think that was first and foremost recognized by the Walt Disney Company as great innovative company that\u2019s growing significantly in the Girls space. So, we obviously think that Disney will have a significant positive impact in adding Princess and Frozen in 2016, we\u2019re not going to size the business for you. But to say that, as we\u2019ve said before we really feel like our girls business is in the early innings of what's possible. Our brands have just begun to grow over the last few years in a more significant way and we feel very good about the new relationship and we will begin shipping the line in 2016.","Gerrick Johnson - BMO Capital Markets","Great.

If you've any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Debbie Hancock, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Joining me this morning are Brian Goldner, Hasbro's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Deb Thomas, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer. Today, we will begin with Brian and Deb providing commentary on the company's performance and then we will take your questions.","Our earnings release and presentation slides for today's call are posted on our investor website. The press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP adjustments and non-GAAP financial measures. Our call today will discuss certain adjusted measures, which exclude these non-GAAP adjustments. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the press release and presentation.

There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. These factors include those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our most recent 10-Q, in today's press release and in our other public disclosures. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.","I would now like to introduce Brian Goldner. Brian?","Brian Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. The Hasbro team executed another good quarter, including revenue growth of 9% and operating profit gains of 47%.","Revenues were up around our blueprint and across multiple regions, including growth in the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific. Our commitment to creating the world's best play experiences through innovation and storytelling for our consumers, fans and audiences, drove revenue gains of 6% and adjusted operating profit growth of 73% for the first six months of the year.","Behind a retro release slate and continued strength in digital gaming, MAGIC: THE GATHERING delivered an outstanding quarter and first half of the year. The War of the Spark set was extremely well received by players across formats, driving robust quarterly growth in tabletop and digital. Player engagement expanded with the global increases in total unique players and new players. This in turn, drove an incremental increase in MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena games played with approximately 400 million played in the quarter and 1.1 billion since the game entered open beta in September of last year.","In addition, the Modern Horizon set released during the second quarter exceeded expectations and contributed to higher tabletop revenues during the quarter. This release timing was earlier in 2019 versus last year, when a similar release occurred in the fourth quarter. Importantly, MAGIC's second quarter performance was driven by growing engagement and monetization of tabletop and arena and through special releases like Modern Horizons that are launched once per year, this year in the second quarter.","The team also delivered initial shipments of the Core Set 2020 which launched on July 12th in store and on Arena, further contributing to the above planned second quarter.","We're also investing to ensure the long-term success of MAGIC: THE GATHERING and Arena, with higher year-over-year spend to drive awareness and engagement and in support of an expanded event schedule. The team hosted a successful Mythic Championship played on Arena in June featuring 68 of the top MAGIC players who competed for a share of the $750,000 prize pool. Later this year, we are running several additional Mythic Championships for Arena and tabletop.","We are also increasing our development investment in future digital games and expertise across multiple properties that will come to market over the next several years. This includes new games for MAGIC and for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS which also grew revenues this quarter.","At retail, second quarter consumer takeaway was up mid-single-digits excluding Toys\u201cR\u201dUs. This in part reflected the shift of Easter into the second quarter, but we're also seeing overall positive point-of-sale trends.","In the U.S. point-of-sale was up double-digits in the second quarter and up slightly through the first half. Global point-of-sale for the first half of the year declined mid single-digits primarily due to Europe. In Europe, POS has picked up in recent weeks, fueled by continued improvement in the underlying business, new initiatives such as NERF Fortnite and growth in Marvel and MONOPOLY.","The U.S. team navigated a dynamic trade and inventory environment during the quarter. While no new material tariffs have been enacted on our products, we did incur incremental expenses to prepare for the potentiality of tariffs in the U.S. The team did an exhaustive amount of work and is extremely well prepared for what would be a very challenging and damaging impact if tariffs were implemented. Deb will speak in more detail about the implications.","Importantly, following a challenging 2018, we are recapturing share across a broad range of retailers. E-commerce has accelerated substantially, with both omnichannel and pure-play retailers driving revenue and point-of-sale growth significantly above the rest of the business.","Last week Hasbro brands delivered strong growth during Amazon's Prime Day event. In Amazon markets around the world, games PLAY-DOH and NERF were among the standout drivers. We're leveraging online and digital to engage directly with consumers, launching two new HasLab projects this month through Hasbro Pulse and delivering innovative new shopping and social media experiences across geographies.","This past weekend at San Diego Comic-Con, we had a major show presence that we also shared with fans through social media live from the shelf floor with interviews, behind-the-scenes information, news around upcoming product and preorder launches. Fans could purchase limited edition products on site as well as through Hasbro Pulse and select retailers.","Hasbro's investments in brand-driven storytelling uniquely positions us to monetize content to commerce experiences across online platforms. In addition to e-comm growth, new retailers for Hasbro entered the category or expanded their offering over the past year and we are supporting toys and games throughout the year.","During the second quarter new channels including value, drug and grocery as well as fan retailers delivered higher revenues for Hasbro brands.","Our overall retail inventory declined in the quarter as our mix of retailers and consumer purchasing behavior shift to channels, which carry less weeks of inventory. Omni-channel retailers are moving towards online e-comm best practices for their physical store businesses.","Profitability and carrying lower inventories remains a top priority for our global retailers, and we anticipate this will be an increasingly important factor in their purchasing decisions.","In Europe, our turnaround is well underway and we delivered growth in both revenue and profit in the quarter. Retail inventory is significantly improved and declined further. Despite ongoing economic uncertainty in the region, the team is successfully executing its plan and Europe revenues and profits are up over the first half of the year.","With much of the year ahead of us, we continue to expect to stabilize revenues and improve profit for the full year 2019. Over the first half of the year global revenues increased for several Franchise Brands including PLAY-DOH, MONOPOLY and TRANSFORMERS. We also launched POWER RANGERS in North America with international markets to roll out through this year.","Point of sale is up on these brands as well as for BABY ALIVE. NERF POS turned positive in the second quarter with the success of NERF Fortnite, which is now rolling out internationally and we have new NERF products hitting the market throughout the second half and in some geographies next year.","Within our Partner Brand portfolio, Hasbro toys and games for Marvel's AVENGERS: END GAME and Spider-Man franchises along with innovation in Hasbro's preschool line of Marvel superhero adventurers and new MEGA MIGHTIES 10-inch figures delivered revenue growth in the quarter.","As we look to the fourth quarter, retailers have strong plans for the October 4th launch of Hasbro product for both Frozen 2 and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Our team is ready for the most important quarters of the year. We are driving revenues around amazing innovation and storytelling and as this management team has done in the past, we're investing for future profitable growth.","Following a strong first half, our view of the year has not changed and we believe we are well positioned to deliver profitable growth for the full year 2019. I'd like to now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deb Thomas","Thank you, Brian, and good morning everyone. Our second quarter results reflect the outstanding execution of our entire global team, producing strong quarterly revenue and profit gains in a very dynamic environment.","Revenue growth came from several brands, but was led by MAGIC: THE GATHERING. Given a robust release schedule, which was more heavily weighted to the first half of this year versus last and the positive momentum in the brand, we forecasted a strong first half for Magic and it came in ahead of our expectations.","Magic's revenue growth was further supported by growth in other Franchise Brands, MONOPOLY and PLAY-DOH, the launch of POWER RANGERS and also Hasbro products from the MARVEL brand, notably in support of Avengers: End Game and Spider-Man: Far From Home.","The quarter's higher revenues and favorable mix contributed to a 250 basis point increase in gross margin. Combined with our cost-saving activities and ongoing cost management, we delivered a 330 basis point increase in operating profit margin to 13%.","During the quarter, we successfully settled our U.S. pension plan liability and recorded a pre-tax charge of $110.8 million within the other expense line. Due primarily to the performance of our investments prior to the settlement of this liability, this charge is less than the $140 million to $150 million estimate we provided at Toy Fair.","The $0.11 per share we reported for the second quarter included a $0.68 per share charge for the pension settlement. Excluding the charge, adjusted EPS was $0.78 per share. After generating $741.5 million in operating cash flow over the trailing 12-month period, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash. Our inventory is in a good position, both in the quality and level of inventory, declining $45.5 million year-over-year.","Within our segments, revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 14%. Franchise Brand revenues increased, led by MAGIC: THE GATHERING along with PLAY-DOH, TRANSFORMERS and MONOPOLY. Partner Brands behind Marvel growth and Emerging Brands including the POWER RANGERS launch increased revenues, while Hasbro Gaming declined.","Retail inventory at quarter end was down slightly and of good quality. As Brian spoke to, retailers are focused on running their business with less inventory than they've had in the past and we expect this will continue to influence retailers' buying decisions this holiday season.","Operating profit for the segment increased 46% to $106.6 million. The increase was driven by revenue growth led by MAGIC: THE GATHERING and was only partially offset by higher intangible asset amortization expense associated with POWER RANGERS and higher warehousing expense.","Warehousing expense included bringing more product into the country than planned, to position ourselves ahead of potential tariffs. As a result, our U.S. on-hand inventory also increased. As Brian mentioned, the team did a tremendous job this quarter assessing and acting on the potential implementation of tariffs. It is an extremely complex issue, with far-reaching implications within the business.","While no tariffs on our products have been enacted in the U.S. at this point, I would like to review how this could impact the business, namely on the price of product, inventory, our tax rate, the cadence in revenues and manufacturing footprint. A tariff increases the price to bring our product into the country. This would be borne by the importer, which is primarily Hasbro. We would pass this increase on to the customer through higher prices on the tariffed items. We notified our retailers of this plan during the quarter. Given the status of tariff implementation, no price changes were enacted.","Retailers have the option to take ownership of inventory in the U.S. or directly from our contract manufacturing location, known as direct import. In 2018, 35% of our U.S. and Canada revenues were delivered through direct import. Tariffs would essentially eliminate this program for items being produced in China.","In fact, in the second quarter, some retailers briefly paused direct import orders, and all are watching it closely. As a result, we expect to see direct import orders decline as a percent of the total this year. While we can build other programs over time, in the near-term, Hasbro will be the primary importer. This increases shipping and warehousing costs and would impact the mix of income and expenses and ultimately our tax rate.","This would also mean product ownership is passed to the retailer later, impacting the cadence of revenues between quarters. For example, in the fourth quarter, retailers place some direct import orders for first quarter on shelf dates. Instead, they would take this product in the U.S. during the first quarter itself. While this would level out over time, it would have an impact in the initial period on fourth quarter shipment.","Finally, as we've discussed in the past, as part of our risk management program, we've been diversifying our manufacturing footprint for several years. During the quarter, we increased our resources invested in this program to accelerate our plans further and as a result, have taken on more costs.","China will continue to be an important part of our global supply network. Last year, 67% of the products we sold in the U.S. came from China, and we believe we can get to approximately 50% by year-end 2020. We also sourced 20% of products sold in the U.S. from U.S. manufacturers. We've done the work and are prepared to address tariffs if they happen, but continue to believe they would be very disruptive to our business and consumers in the near term.","Moving to the International segment. Revenues declined 1%, including a negative $20.1 million impact from foreign exchange. Excluding FX, revenues increased 5% in the segment behind growth in Europe and Asia Pacific. Latin America declined 1% excluding FX. Led by Europe, retail and on-hand inventories in this segment continue to decline. Revenues grew in Franchise Brands led by MAGIC: THE GATHERING and Emerging Brands behind POWER RANGERS. Partner Brand revenues were flat, but increased absent FX in the quarter with growth in Marvel. Hasbro Gaming revenues were down.","The International segment increased operating profit to $14.6 million. The profit improvement resulted from favorable mix, driven by growth in MAGIC: THE GATHERING and our continued focus on cost management. Entertainment, Licensing and Digital segment revenues grew 28% to $96.5 million. Digital gaming, primarily Magic: The Gathering Arena and to a lesser extent, consumer product licensing drove the revenue growth.","Operating profit in the segment declined to $7.9 million due to higher program production expense and increased investments in digital gaming marketing and future game development. As we have discussed, we continue investing in future gaming initiatives to drive long-term profitable revenue growth, particularly in our MAGIC: THE GATHERING and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS brands. We anticipate full year program production amortization to be in the range of 1% to 1.5% of total company revenue, down from the first half rate of 1.8%.","Looking at the balance of the year for the segment, I'd remind you, we signed a multi-year digital streaming agreement for Hasbro television programming during the third quarter of 2018. Also, Arena entered open beta in September 2018 and we recorded our first meaningful revenues for the game in the fourth quarter of last year.","Overall, Hasbro operating profit improved to $128.3 million or 13% of revenue. Higher revenues and the improved gross margin I spoke to earlier contributed to this improvement, along with the favorable impact of our cost-saving activity and a continued focus on cost management. This improvement was partially offset by factors I have already discussed, most notably investments in digital gaming, higher program production expense, and higher intangible asset amortization.","Turning to our results below operating profit, other expense of $100.2 million includes the $110.8 million pretax charge for settling our U.S. pension plan liability. Excluding this charge, other income was $10.6 million and increased primarily due to foreign currency transaction games this year versus loss last year.","Our underlying tax rate for the quarter was 18.3% versus 17.4% last year. We believe the full year tax rate will trend to the middle to high end of our guided 17.5% to 19% range and could potentially go slightly above the high end due to our own response to potential tariffs. Our financial strength is evident in our strong balance sheet and cash flow including quarter end cash position of $1.2 billion, lower inventory, and DSOs flat to last year at 74 days.","Brian and I have spoken today about the timing of revenues and expenses as we enter our largest revenue and profit quarters of the year. We recognize that our retailers are focused on increasing profit and carrying lower inventory levels, while driving their point-of-sale. We know and have communicated that we are investing and managing incremental expenses both planned and unplanned as discussed that we will be absorbing. This also includes higher planned incentive compensation given our outlook for this year versus a year ago.","That being said, we continue to expect to return to profitable growth in 2019. Our teams have executed an excellent start to the year and we are excited to deliver on the many amazing brands and entertainment initiatives coming this holiday season, while continuing to invest for future growth.","We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Handler","Yes, couple of questions. First, Deb, I mean, you talked about last year in the third quarter you had, I believe it was your Netflix deal. Wondered, if you could talk a little bit more about, what's incremental and for new product shipments in 3Q this year versus 3Q last year?","Deb Thomas","Sure. Well, I'll talk a little bit about the \u2013 the streaming deal that we did last year, which is as you recall, we just point out because just from comparative issues, if we think about entertainment licensing in the third quarter of last year because we had delivered full season and live our content at the time revenue recognition, it made a little bit of a bump that quarter, so that's why we really pointed it out.","And of course, as we look to the fall or the third and fourth quarter, we have an amazing product offerings in a lot of our new brands that we've talked about. And I know Brian can elaborate on some of those like some of the products we have coming out. And then in fourth quarter, we're very excited for all the entertainment driven initiatives in FROZEN and in STAR WARS in the fourth quarter.","So we're really excited about the back half of the year. We just wanted to make sure we pointed out some of these little quirky things that would impact the comparability of our quarter's year-on-year.","Brian Goldner","Yeah. One of the more notable brands that's rolling out throughout the year, new innovation as the headline and digital engagement is certainly NERF. We saw the NERF POS go up in Q2. A few markets have the new NERF Fortnite product like the U.S. and a couple of countries around the world. But it's really expanding right now, so Q3 is where it takes hold in major markets around the world.","We'll have more than 20 new NERF Fortnite items rolling out in new innovation also for elite, zombie, rival and mega. We also have this new high-performance value-oriented product that launches in the very near term, so that's third quarter. This is for the value shopper that really is looking for the NERF performance. We know the kids and young people really want to play with NERF.","And we want to give them the opportunity to experience our kind of innovation and performance for that under $20 price point. So we certainly expect further NERF momentum in the second half with many of these new initiatives.","You'll also see some new protectable innovation coming later this year. We've seen great momentum year-to-date and TRANSFORMERS is up, we have new initiatives in the fall there, and BABY ALIVE, our gaming initiatives. PLAY-DOH is up.","And then as Deb said, we get into the fourth quarter and we add to that several new initiatives most notably Frozen 2 and Star Wars both are set on October the 4th and shelves around the world.","But we also have a number of big new initiatives from MAGIC in the second half of the year. We'll have at least two more mythic championships for both arena and for tabletop this year, and they'll both occur in the third and then the fourth quarter.","A number of new game releases and announcements coming, as well as continued momentum, we believe for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, so really a strong lineup as we hit third and fourth quarter.","Eric Handler","Great. And then just as a follow-up Deb. So you had a significant increase in your programming cost amortization in 2Q, $23 million very sizable number, was there any big deliveries from that? Was that a function of Bumblebee movie profits and expensing associated with that?","Deb Thomas","Sure. Well, what you're seeing in the quarter is that some incremental expense associated with production content and primarily with Bumblebee. But our full year expectation on that line is up slightly from last year. But we are expecting the full year to be about 1% to 1.5% of company revenues. We actually anticipate our revenue share from film and home entertainment to begin in the second half of this year. And if you recall, we had thought, based on earlier estimates we received, it wouldn't come until very late in the year or in 2020.","So we've already recorded meaningful revenue and profit from the merchandise and toys and games and Consumer Products and digital gaming associated with the film. And now, we'll start to see the revenue and the amortization. So we're very happy with the financial return on our investment. But also, more importantly, the longer-term benefits this film has brought to reset the franchise and all of its storytelling go forward.","Eric Handler","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Stephanie Wissink with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Ashley Hogan","Good morning. This is Ashley on for Steph. Thanks for taking our questions and congrats on the quarter. I think you guys hit almost all of our questions. But just on China.","Brian Goldner","Good morning.","Ashley Hogan","Good morning. Just on China production exposure, what percent of U.S. goods are produced in China now? And what could it be by year-end?","Brian Goldner","Yes. We had said that, in China, right now, coming to the U.S. is just under two-thirds. We think by year end 2020, it could be around 50%. And recall that 20% of our production for the U.S. takes place in the U.S. We use all third-party manufacturers. We're increasingly spreading our footprint and adding new geographies for production globally.","That includes new production in India and Vietnam. So we feel very good about where we're going. And having said all that, we also want to reaffirm that China continues to be a high-quality, low-cost place to make toys and games and it will continue to be part of our global network in a major way.","Ashley Hogan","All right. Thanks so much and congrats again on the quarter.","Brian Goldner","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Ng","Hi. Good morning. Thank you very much for the question.","Brian Goldner","Good morning.","Michael Ng","I just have one on MAGIC. Based on what we know about the total gaming growth and the E&L growth in the quarter, it seems like tabletop was a larger contributor to MAGIC. Is that the right way to think about it? And then, could you talk a little bit about whether War of the Spark or Modern Horizons was a bigger contributor to growth? I'm kind of surprised, you guys called out Modern Horizons as a big contributor, but I'm just trying to think about future momentum here? Thank you very much.","Brian Goldner","Sure. Well, overall, the MAGIC: THE GATHERING franchise saw strong growth. The largest games in the quarter were from tabletop, as you indicated. But we did see the Arena product and game represent our second-highest growth in the quarter.","What we saw is that in-store player growth is up 12% year-over-year in total unique players and up 11% year-over-year in new player growth behind the War of the Spark release, and that's driven by storytelling and game play. Some of you may know this is a combination of a five-year story arc that brings together our Planeswalkers.","And so, driven by storytelling and animated feature quality trailers, gameplay and social. But it does tie directly to the Arena gameplay, so they are synchronous as we go forward. We did see that -- and know that MAGIC is available in 11 languages and most of those saw significant demand above plan and we've gone for repeat -- reprints there.","The Modern Horizons set did ship in the quarter and the response was tremendous. It's most comparable to a set that we released last fourth quarter. So we highlighted just to, again, talk about how storytelling comes at different times for MAGIC throughout any given year and to recognize that it really did take hold with our fans and it was a very exciting set release.","We are seeing real momentum and engagement in monetization around Magic: The Gathering Arena. We continue to see progress there. We continue to have our Mythic Championships. And then also late in the quarter, we saw the core set 2020 began to ship and that will continue into Q3. So, we have a lot of new news for the back half of the year. And we also, of course, will go to our official launch for Arena, which will likely occur in the next four months or so.","And I talked about having a couple more Mythic Championships for both Arena and tabletop toward the end of the year. What was really heartening to see was that our Mythic Championship III, which came in June, had 1.4 million viewer hours, which made it the number two property globally as we look at Twitch, which was even better than the Mythic Championship that happened earlier in the year. So, we're seeing the momentum in all the key KPIs for MAGIC and Magic Arena. But we did want to highlight also the success of the tabletop business.","Michael Ng","Great. Thank you very much. And if I could just have a quick follow-up, what do you expect to be the key changes for Arena once it leaves open beta and goes into the official launch? Is it more marketing? More content? I just love to hear your plans there. Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Yeah. Well, they're continuing to offer new elements within the feature set and constantly updating the feature set based on player feedback. We really love hearing from our players. You're going to see more competition. We've got more of the esports elements that are beginning. You certainly will see and we've talked about the discrete marketing that will hit the P&L during the time of the launch.","And really, the way I'd look at it and illustrate the point is that, right now the people that were engaged in MAGIC are aware of Magic Arena. And yet over the history of MAGIC to-date, there've been 38 million players and not all of those players are currently playing. There\u2019s a lot of latent and lapsed users and they need to be told about and marketed too, so that they are aware of the ability to go play Arena, go play MAGIC online and play that with their friends and neighbors all around the world. That's really an exciting element and I think that's going to be one of the biggest shifts you'll see as we go forward, the opportunity to ignite new fan engagement and latent and lapsed user player engagement.","Michael Ng","Great. Thank you very much, Brian.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","Hi, thanks very much, great quarter. I just had a question on, what is your sense of initial investment cadence for Arena for the back half as you get into the second half of the year and as well as 2020? What components of those marketing costs go away as we look into next year? It seems like those investments in Arena picked up in Q2 versus Q1. I just want to have a good sense of that flow-through in the back half and -- as well as how you look at it for 2020?","Brian Goldner","Yeah. So Deb can comment on some of the key points on the P&L where Arena development, game development, game marketing hit, because they hit a couple of different points on the P&L. But I think the way to look at it is, we will see increase spend in marketing and esports engagement in arena as we go to launch. And remember, that Arena as well as many of our new digital games that are coming as part of our new suite of games that we'll launch for MAGIC and then for D&D should be thought of as games as a service. So, it's ongoing, they're constantly being updated, new feature sets are being offered, new content is being offered, new adventures, new ways to play.","So, we do expect to the point that our operating margin in eL&D will be superior to the rest of the company's average operating profit margin and in some instances by a long measure. We certainly see that in our Entertainment and Licensing area and we see that in Consumer Products as superior margins as well as with the Wizards of the Coast brands, our gaming business overall. So, that you will continue to see that we can create that higher operating margin and it will be that way. However, we are also spending at a higher level.","Deb Thomas","Right. So, you may see that margin be a bit lower on a percentage standpoint, but still as Brian said, superior to the rest of the company. And that's really due to the amortization, right. You think about the capitalization of the product and in launch, you've got amortization of it, some of which you see in product development, some of which you see in admin line, as well as the marketing we've talked about for the launch.","And in addition to that, we're investing in future gaming. So, most importantly, as you know us right, we don't like to sit on our laurels, we're thinking multi-years out. And to create that future profitable growth for the business in the gaming side of the business, we are investing in that longer term larger game play.","We've seen success in Arena in what we've done to-date and we'd like to make sure that that success continues with other games and in other formats as well as we go forward. So, you'll see a bit of that in product development admin as well as the marketing.","Brian Goldner","Yes. We continue to see the opportunity to double the size of the Wizards of the Coast brands as we've done over the last five years, over the next five years, but we're really seeing digital take hold and our game players and gamers around the world are really enjoying the games we're offering.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","Great. Thank you. That's really helpful. And then regarding ForEx, so I know there's nothing concrete yet in that regard, but given elevated risk, could you talk about the expense to which toymakers could pass on those costs given some retail price points that can't really change like $9.99 and $19.99 at retail? I guess what type of assistance do you expect to get from retailers?","Deb Thomas","Yes, I think that's a great question Arpin\u00e9. It\u2019s -- as you look at it, there are these price points that once you break them it starts to impact kind of the elasticity of demand for the product. And for us it's always been about innovation and driving value in product that consumers are willing to pay for. But the unfortunate thing with tariffs if they do come into play is the consumers is ultimately going to feel that price pressure, because the cost to react to it -- we always talk about being able to reengineer product, and take cost out, or move to different jurisdictions for manufacturing, but that takes a bit of time. And depending when they come, we can pass those price increases on to our retailers, but our expectation as we look at it would be that retailers would not want their margin to decline as well. So, that would get passed along to consumers.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","Great. Thank you. Great quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi. Thank you. Deb can we just stay on this tariff topic for a moment and all the color that you gave us was really helpful. Just to be clear though regarding the direct orders and what's currently happening at retail regardless of the fact that there are currently no tariffs on toys, should we expect to see any impact this year in the fourth quarter with the direct orders? Or were you just giving us hypotheticals?","Deb Thomas","I think that if tariffs were to come into play, our expectation is we would see an impact. Right now, it's early. I mean, honestly, we've seen some of our retailers changed their ordering patterns. But it's early in the year, and we're really excited. We have so many great initiatives coming toward the end of this year.","And we \u2013 as we \u2013 Brian and I have talked about we expect those to continue into 2020. So as we think about spring sets and reorders and things like that, I think a lot of it is dependent on what we'll actually see. But if tariffs were to come into play, we would expect an impact in the fourth quarter.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. So it's more of a conditional, but you're not expecting anything yet?","Deb Thomas","Right.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And then just on the \u2013 moving on to the gross margins. Your gross margins were significantly better than we expected. And I'm just wondering were there any one-time items in there? Or it's just the upside, the function of the better-than-expected revenues versus what the Street was expecting? I'm just wondering, if again there was a one-time items or perhaps increase in digital is changing the complexion of gross margins?","Deb Thomas","A bit, what really is impacting it is product mix and we talked about higher \u2013 even MAGIC: THE GATHERING performing higher than our expectations. So what you're really seeing is the impact of mix from entertainment, licensing and digital as well as the strong performance of Magic tabletop and we've talked about gaming tends to have higher margins overall for our business. And it's was just the strength of the quarter.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. So given what you know today and given kind of how you talked about your expectations at Toy Fair in terms of your overall margin, should we think about that differently?","Deb Thomas","No. I think from a expectation standpoint, I mean, we still expect full year profitable growth and we talked about that in our prepared remarks and we still expect that dependent on mix toward the end of the year. And whether we had tariffs or not that could impact our gross margin, but our beliefs are still the same.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Great. And Brian just to kind of get back to Arena \u2013 I mean to Magic for a second. I think in a normalized year given kind of your more first-half weighted releases of Magic versus other years it would seem like you would have a tougher compare in the second half.","But just based on the things that you've said so far on this call, it sounds like given your initiatives, we might not see that for the second half. Is that the right way to think about that?","Brian Goldner","Well, look I think the underlying growth and engagement in Magic Arena is really substantial. Having said that, there is that quarterly compare, it's Q4 2018 versus the second quarter this year and that's why we highlighted modern horizons.","Look overall, Magic has been on a growth trajectory. We expect over time it compounds and continues to grow. It's part of our plan in expanding the reach and engagement of our Wizards of the Coast brands.","I don't want to \u2013 really want to comment and forecast Magic Q-for-Q. But I would say that, overall we're very happy with the progress on MAGIC: THE GATHERING and it certainly is set up well for its launch later this year.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Thanks. And final one for me. Just back to you Deb, just with your buyback. Are you -- given the stock strength, are you still planning on repurchasing $100 million to $150 million in repurchases for the year?","Deb Thomas ","Yes. Well, as you know, we've always said we're opportunistic with our repurchases, just based on market conditions and other factors. So our level will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, but our expectation is still that we'll repurchase $100 million to $150 million this year.","Felicia Hendrix ","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Brian Goldner","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Tim Conder","Thank you. I'd like to continue on a little bit of Felicia's question here. And Deb, if you could just maybe remind us or refresh up any timing differences between Q3 and Q4, this year versus last year? And whether that -- again, with the warehousing expenses you talked about, the timing of some of the revenues, is any of the timing between Q3 and Q4 changed? It seems that you all alluded to that in your preamble?","Deb Thomas","Yes. I think, from a timing standpoint, as we talk about some direct comparisons with the sale of our streaming content last year in the third quarter, is something that we wouldn't expect that there would be a comparable item this year. As you recall, that's like a multiyear deal, so we do that every few years.","And also, just some of the timing of the releases, as Brian has spoken about with MAGIC. Those are really the big timing issues for us for the quarters. And beyond that, I think that, with -- as long as tariffs don't come into play and, I say, if, but we're hopeful that they won't, that could have an impact. That -- and again, that is just timing between fourth quarter and first quarter. It's a matter of shipping domestically versus that direct import and when the retailer actually takes ownership of that. But beyond that, we don't have any expectations.","From an expense standpoint, we are starting to amortize the film, because we're expecting revenue from BUMBLEBEE. So we talked about expecting between 1% and 1.5% of revenue on program production and amortization. And also, the product development will continue with respect to our future gaming initiative within the quarter.","Brian Goldner","Yes. And then, in the fourth quarter, Deb mentioned it, but to put it in the context of this question, we're clearly very excited about October the 4th, it's Triple Force Friday. We'll be supporting all the elements of the Star Wars program and launch. We have really an amazing array of new Star Wars product in support of the film, in support of the Fallen Order video game, in support of The Mandalorian, which begins on Disney Plus.","We've seen over this past weekend, it was Comic-Con and I just looked at the top sellers for us. We sold an amazing array of collector oriented product and fan oriented product with our Hasbro Pulse and live from the floor of Comic-Con. But the Star Wars items continue to be top sellers.","Our fans really love them. Our team does an amazing job in bringing innovation to them. So we're very excited there. Year-to-date, in the -- or I should say in the second quarter, we're very happy to see in the U.S. that the new initiatives we have for our entire fashion doll lineup around our Disney brands, including Princess and FROZEN are up.","And so we're seeing new momentum as a result of new product innovation, the support of Aladdin, as well as the comfy Princess segment that we spoke about before, new ways to look at our Princesses in a more modern way. And then, we're very excited about Frozen 2 which comes in the fourth quarter.","So clearly, not only the fourth quarter will be positively impacted by all the Disney initiatives, we certainly believe that 2020 gets a major lift as a result of the Disney initiatives. We've seen how Marvel has contributed to performance in the quarter and year-to-date. And so, I think we've spoken about some of the big elements that relate to or reflect timing.","Tim Conder","Okay. So then the -- again the MAGIC this year timing skewed to the first half of the year is one of the big differences and the other things that you just described?","Brian Goldner","Well, I think that certainly in tabletop, people had asked historically would tabletop be impacted negatively by Arena, and the answer is emphatically no. In fact, tabletop has probably shown more momentum as a result of all the engagement around Arena, around the tournament play and esports and the viewership on Twitch, and so the compare of Q2 this year being even bigger than Q4 last year and Modern Horizons, we just wanted to point that out.","We certainly have seen the growth of MAGIC over time and MAGIC: THE GATHERING has doubled in size over the last number of years. We expect MAGIC and the Wizards of the Coast brands to continue to grow toward doubling and we said we could double those brands over time.","D&D, DUNGEONS & DRAGONS we haven't even spoken about, but it was up in the quarter. It's showing some great momentum and we expect to talk more about digital gaming in that brand as well its coming. For both brands, we're also engaged in a lot of storytelling. You saw some of the announcements around the MAGIC: THE GATHERING animated series; it's coming to Netflix, headlined by the Russo brothers who are amazing creative stewards for that brand and working with our team at Wizards of the Coast and our studios team. And so we're very excited about activating storytelling across all forms and formats for those brands.","Tim Conder","And then lastly if I may, the emerging markets, any comments or expectations in changes in LatAm? And then any comment on China in particular? And then any color on POWER RANGERS contribution during the quarter? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Sure. Yeah. China was up a bit in the quarter. And if you take out ForEx, our emerging markets year-to-date are about flat up a little. We expect to continue to get back in momentum. If you take Latin America year-to-date, it's flat to up a bit. And again, we made a few on-the-ground changes in Mexico in supply chain that caused some timing shifts, but I don't see anything there that are long-term challenges to the region. The team has done a very good job there. And we have a lot of new initiatives that will hit in Latin America as well as in China.","And so, we feel good about that. You had a second part of your question. POWER RANGERS. Thank you. Yeah. So on POWER RANGERS, it's really very early days. We've launched in North America. We've seen just a bit of revenue, literally just a bit of revenue in Europe. So it rolls out throughout the rest of the year. So, it's not a major contributor yet, although the early signs are quite positive. The ratings are top-ratings in its time period. Our partners broadcast or linear cable channels like Nickelodeon, we're seeing great engagement online. Our fans really love our new fan oriented lightning collection. And again, early days, whether its consumer products, digital gaming, our toys and games or the show itself all signs are positive for POWER RANGERS.","Tim Conder","Okay. Thank you and very good quarter.","Brian Goldner","Okay. Thanks, Tim.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ray Stochel with Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed with your question.","Ray Stochel","Great. Thanks for taking my question. The retailers want less inventory comment. Is that a mix of retailer\u2019s year-over-year or versus maybe even 2017 and prior changing with Toys\u201cR\u201dUs? Or is that more on a like-for-like basis?","And then if it's more on a like-for-like basis, I guess, my question would be, why wouldn't retailers new to the toy category or growing in the toy category due to the lack of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs last year want to build deeper inventories now that they know what their customers want and better understand what products their customers want? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","Yes. So, it is a multi-variable sort of answer. You're right that we have new retailers as part of our expanded channel strategy and expanded channel footprint who are taking more inventory and are building inventory. You saw in the U.S., our inventories are up single-digits in the quarter partly around the potentiality of tariffs and partly around the sales of our brands.","What we're really talking about our online retailers and omnichannel retailers who have the benefit of seeing the momentum and the major step-up we saw this past quarter in online sales trying to replicate the best practice they're taking from their online or omnichannel businesses and pairing weak supply and seeing what the opportunities are to continue to hone their inventories and to optimize inventories around maximizing sales.","And so they do expect to continue to grow in sales. They do want us to continue to provide our top-selling brands and franchises. They want to make sure that they are well positioned for major launches around our story-led brands and our partner story-led brands. We're just commenting on the fact that overall they are operating with less weak supply in an omni or online world and with the goal or target to be more like that in their brick-and-mortar businesses. ","Ray Stochel","Got it. And do you think that that initiative from retailers where they're in some cases even testing some products online and then bringing that to retail if they are really successful is a long-term benefit for you guys? Or something that's a bit of a challenge? I'd love to know if there's any longer term thoughts on what that means for your business?","Brian Goldner","Yes. No, look we really like our direct-to-consumer initiatives and direct-through-retailer initiatives that we're undertaking. We rebranded and relaunched our Hasbro toy shop to really focus on what we call Hasbro Pulse now, our fan-oriented content-to-commerce site, an initiative. Our fans are really enjoying it, because they get to get unique content and unique products.","We're also working with retailers in a similar fashion in a direct way. So, that not every product we launch is a mega volume product. It may be around a specific audience that's able to find that product now in a manner that they couldn't have found it before. In the second quarter, if I look at online sales momentum, which has, as I said, stepped up appreciably versus any percent gains we've seen in the past, we go from strength-to-strength where people are able to find our new NERF Fortnite products whether they can find them at retail, new DISNEY PRINCESS offerings, new PLAY-DOH offerings, new gaming offerings.","So, whether or not people are able to find those products at their local stores, they're able to find those products associated with the digital engagement, social engagement, content engagement, or story-led engagement that they are experiencing in other venues and able to bring that play home, which we think is very good for our business. And we think we uniquely differentiated ourselves through our strategy and our execution.","Ray Stochel","Great. Thanks so much again.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Jaime Katz","Hi. Good morning. I just have one quick question on Europe. It seems to have sequentially stabilized. And I'm curious if there is \u2013 if that's just because we are lapping some of the noise around Toys\u201cR\u201dUs in Europe, or if there are some other factor you guys are seeing? And any commentary you have on consumer behavior in the region, would be helpful? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","Sure. Well, in Europe revenues were up 1% or 6% absent FX. Inventories are down. Retail inventories are down by about a third across Europe. Our channel strategy both omni-channel and online channel strategy capabilities are really taking hold.","And it really speaks to a new array of top or leading retailers for the region ones that we haven't really had as top retailers prior including Amazon and Smith, that's EMEA in Russia.","We're seeing good POS gains across many major markets. The one market where POS is a bit down and is hampering overall European POS is still the U.K.. We're really seeing growth in major Franchise Brands including BABY ALIVE, MONOPOLY and MAGIC: THE GATHERING really good progress on PLAY-DOH.","The NERF Fortnite as I mentioned earlier that product is just beginning to have a presence in the region. Only a few markets have seen some inventory. And so we expect that to help continue to build momentum.","The MARVEL franchises have made a really good contribution to growth. POWER RANGERS is just beginning to roll out in those markets. And year-to-date TRANSFORMERS is up and set for a really good 2019.","Year-to-date Hasbro gaming is up in the region. DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is up and Magic is up \u2013 MAGIC: THE GATHERING is up. We also saw that Playskool and FurReal contributed.","So overall, we feel good about where we are and what we've said before about Europe, which is we intend to stabilize the region in the area of revenues and we expect an improvement in profitability and that's what we saw in Q2. That's what you've seen thus far year-to-date and we feel we're set up well for the second half.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Crum","Okay. Thanks. Hey, guy. Good morning. Brian, I think you mentioned that POS has picked up recently for NERF. Can you update us on your expectations for the brand in 2019?","Your prior commentary suggests the declines would moderate versus last year. I'm just wondering, if there's any change there. And then separately, there are a couple of new SVOD services rolling out. Is there an opportunity for Hasbro to sell content to these platforms? Are you guys locked in with exclusives with your current partners? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","Yeah. So \u2013 on the SVOD front, we have about 50 different SVOD details globally. We are creating all kinds of new media windows for our new content launches whether it's on a linear channel like Cartoon Network, and then going online or streamed with another provider in a unique way or window ensuring that we also have YouTube content, where appropriate in shorter form.","And so we have some limitations as it relates to our linear joint venture with Discovery Family. But we also have opportunities for a lot of our content across any number of SVOD platforms, and we're really taking advantage of that. Plus, we have a number of new brands that are in development and new initiatives around brands that we're very excited about like our TRANSFORMERS fan-oriented content set for next year with Netflix, War for Cybertron Trilogy. So there are lots of ways to look at new media models and I think the team is exploring them and has done a really good job of bringing our brands to life in content and stream and linear platforms around the world.","For NERF, I had mentioned that POS was up in Q2. Really, we've only seen the new NERF Fortnite product in a few markets. But where it has taken hold, like in the U.S., it's really shown tremendous momentum. And so, we do believe the new NERF Fortnite innovation, as well as our Alpha Strike innovation that's coming shortly and also new proprietary innovation, just sort of signals the next era of new product innovation and digital engagement for the brand.","So our feeling about the brand earlier in the year, that if we could get these elements to work for us, as we have, the teams' done a very good job in marketing them. The feedback from fans has been tremendous. And yet, we've not yet rolled NERF Fortnite out to many markets around the world. We continue to believe that NERF will regain momentum and also revenues and sales throughout 2019.","Drew Crum","Got it. Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO. Please proceed with your question.","Gerrick Johnson","Hey, good morning. I have one balance sheet\u2026","Deb Thomas","Good morning.","Gerrick Johnson","Hi. One balance sheet and two MAGIC questions. First on the balance sheet, you mentioned U.S. inventory higher to mitigate tariffs, as well as more domestic fulfillment. You have a couple of big 3Q programs, channel for Frozen 2 and Star Wars. So why is your inventory down 7.5%?","Deb Thomas","It's really about Europe and our international markets. So a piece of it is FX, right? And we haven't talked about FX but we've had a pretty significant negative impact from FX, but it also reduced the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. But what -- the biggest decline that you're seeing in our overall held inventory, as well as our retail inventory, that we've talked about, is within Europe. And beyond that, our Latin America inventory is down quite a bit as well.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. Good. Thank you. And on MAGIC. Can you tell us how much the early release of the MAGIC sets impacted the second quarter?","Brian Goldner","The early release? No. It's just a timing of different -- as you know, a different story-led card releases. I did give you a sense for the fact that tabletop was the largest gain in the quarter. And I think Mike had asked that question. And that digital was our second-highest growth in the quarter. And then, it obviously was around both War of the Spark as well as Modern Horizons. And then late in the quarter, we began shipping the core set 2020. So we kind of have given you broadly order of magnitude impact for the quarter.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. And then, you did comment to the footnotes that Wizards of the Coast digital gaming revenue was about $11 million in 2Q 2018. So how did 2Q 2019 compare to that?","Brian Goldner","Well, as you know, it's now reported inside of entertainment licensing and digital. So while we also saw games in Consumer Products and some other areas like digital gaming, not related to Wizards gaming, it's in those numbers.","Deb Thomas","Right. And we also talked about the fact that we hadn\u2019t -- we didn't really see the first meaningful revenue from Arena until the fourth quarter of 2018.","Brian Goldner","So that will be the first comp.","Deb Thomas","Right.","Brian Goldner","The first comp will be in the fourth quarter 2018 versus this Q4 2019.","Gerrick Johnson","All right. Thank you, guys.","Brian Goldner","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your questions.","Linda Bolton Weiser","Hi. I was just curious about the girls brand within franchise brand, MY LITTLE PONY and BABY ALIVE. MY LITTLE PONY hasn't really posted growth in many quarters. Can you just talk about the outlook for those girls brands within franchise?","Brian Goldner","Sure. Look, MY LITTLE PONY, it's our last year of the current television series, which is the ninth season. And we are transitioning to new let's call it TV-based entertainment as well as streamed entertainment. It's very exciting, the team's really working on something and I can't say much more than that. We're also working on the next animated feature film that will be CGI film from our Boulder Studios, Boulder Media. And we're very excited about where that goes. So, at times, brands are in transition and we've made a -- are making a transition on MY LITTLE PONY. Our mantra here is always to reinvent reignite and reimagine brands and we're actively doing that for PONY.","For BABY ALIVE, we're -- we've been seeing good momentum. The brand is up in Europe and I would say down in a couple of other territories. But really it's just related to the timing of different price points of products that were available a year ago versus this year. We're very excited about several fall initiatives including a very big new initiative called the Happy Hungry Baby. And so, I think the team has done a very nice job of stepping forward in that brand.","Linda Bolton Weiser","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I will turn the call back to Debbie Hancock for closing remarks.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, Rob, and thank you everyone for joining the call today.

","Informed by our proprietary global consumer insights and industry-leading brand-building capabilities, Hasbro\u2019s global teams worked to do more than just respond to a very disruptive market last year. In 2018, our teams actively managed through the year but also took strategic steps to drive long-term success in a rapidly changing environment.","Over the course of a 12-month period, we re-imagined and re-designed our go-to-market strategy and re-shaped our organization to become a more agile, modern and digitally-driven play and entertainment company.","We meaningfully diversified our retail mix and grew online point of sale double digits, absent the impact of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs. We pivoted to a digital-first approach making Hasbro a complete e-comm partner. As a result, according to Edge Market Share, Hasbro was the number one toy and game company on Amazon in the U.S. and Canada.","We streamlined and focused our teams, cutting costs across the business. We identified greater savings than originally anticipated and now expect $70 million to $80 million in gross savings by 2020 from our organizational actions. $50 million to $55 million of these savings are expected this year after we reinvest","We further diversified our global sourcing efforts, reducing our risk and better managing our costs. We are on track to lower our Chinese manufacturing to 60% of total by the end of 2020. We invested in developing innovation across brands, price points and channels. We look forward to sharing many of these with you at Toy Fair.","We purchased POWER RANGERS, adding a new entertainment brand to our global portfolio. We couldn\u2019t be more excited with how our original television series and line looks for 2019 and our retailers share our excitement.","We grew Magic: The Gathering revenues behind positive tabletop performance as well as the move to open beta for our new digital initiative Magic: The Gathering Arena. Arena is poised for a successful launch this year, including a major new esports initiative. We are investing and innovating to make gaming a greater growth driver for Hasbro over the short and long-term. You will hear more about our plans at our investor event next week.","We successfully re-engaged families, kids and fans in the Transformers franchise with our feature film Bumblebee and are charting a path forward across the blueprint in entertainment, gaming, publishing and merchandise for this valuable franchise.","And we returned $559 million of excess cash to you, our shareholders, through our dividend and share repurchase.","Today, we announced the Board increased our quarterly dividend 8% to $0.68 per share. This represents the 15th dividend increase in 16 years. While the 2018 industry headline was a major retailer bankruptcy, this event created a ripple which went deeper and magnified the impact of ongoing, underlying changes in the industry, including the rapid growth of online retail globally and a heightened focus by retailers on profit and inventory management.","For Hasbro, in addition to losing hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from Toys\u201cR\u201dUs, the liquidation of an additional hundreds of millions of dollars of their retail inventory sold into the market at large discounts was more impactful to 2018 than we, and industry experts, estimated. It is an unprecedented yet finite event.","Prior to its initial bankruptcy filing, Toys\u201cR\u201dUs was our third largest customer in the U.S., and our second largest customer in Europe and Asia-Pacific. In Europe, its bankruptcy added to a market already dealing with disintermediation across retail by online and omni-channel retailers, as well as political and economic headwinds, notably in the UK. According to NPD, the European toy and game market declined 4% last year across the top six markets.","As we discussed at the start of 2018, even before the European Toys\u201cR\u201dUs bankruptcy, reducing our European retail inventory was the top priority for our teams. Given the dynamic retail environment, it was a bigger negative impact than initially expected to both our top line and operating profit as the team executed this task.","Retailers ended the year with significantly lower inventory, down approximately 27%. Our goal is to stabilize Europe this year and grow beyond 2019.","In the U.S., mass market retailers capitalized on the share opportunity in the toy and game category, but importantly also increased their focus on inventory management, implementing new behaviors and technologies this past holiday season. They ended the year with less Hasbro retail inventory than prior years. This is a trend we anticipate continuing.","Including the loss of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs, Hasbro\u2019s U.S. retail inventories were down approximately 24% last year. Point of sale in the U.S. and Canada, excluding Toys\u201cR\u201dUs, increased for the year and in the fourth quarter.","For the full year, Hasbro revenues declined 12% to $4.6 billion, including a 13% decline in the fourth quarter. Several brands delivered positive performances. Franchise Brands, MONOPOLY and MAGIC: THE GATHERING both grew revenues last year. DUNGEONS & DRAGONS delivered another record year within our Gaming portfolio. Our plans for an expanded universe of gaming behind D&D is taking shape in analog and digital game play.","Our new collectibles lines, Lost Kitties and Yellies, along with Power Rangers licensing revenue in the second half of the year, contributed to growth in Emerging Brands. Global point of sale for Franchise Brands, Emerging Brands and our gaming category, including MONOPOLY, was up for the year and the fourth quarter excluding Toys\u201cR\u201dUs in both periods.","Given their strong representation at Toys\u201cR\u201dUs, certain brands and categories were disproportionately impacted by its bankruptcy and liquidation. Nerf is one example of a brand that due to its performance and innovation received larger shelf space at the retailer.","In addition, increased competition, principally at lower price points, contributed to a decline in Nerf revenues last year. Nerf remains by far the industry leader and we are building on Hasbro\u2019s long standing reputation for innovation, performance, accuracy and safety.","Beginning with our new Gamer series, Nerf Fortnite and NERF Overwatch, we are entering a new innovation cycle for the brand that will deliver compelling product across price points in 2019, 2020 and beyond. We\u2019ll share more about our plans at Toy Fair but given the competitive nature of the industry we will be waiting to share some initiatives and plans closer to their launch dates.","Within Partner Brand\u2019s, Hasbro\u2019s MARVEL portfolio and BEYBLADE delivered very strong performances behind innovative product and great entertainment. After an outstanding box office and merchandise year, Marvel\u2019s 2019 theatrical line up is impressive and includes a diverse portfolio led by Marvel Studios\u2019 Captain Marvel in March and Avengers: End Game in April, as well as Columbia Pictures\u2019 Spider-Man: Far From Home in July. These strong Partner Brand performances were offset by declines in Star Wars, Disney Princess, Frozen and Trolls, each of which has significant new entertainment for 2019 or 2020.","The Walt Disney Company continues to set the standard for tremendous stories with highly merchandisable content and 2019 is poised to be another amazing year. In addition to the robust Marvel slate, Hasbro will be delivering innovation and marketing programs to engage kids and fans in the Star Wars franchise throughout the year.","Coming soon for the franchise is The Mandalorian, an all-new live action television series from executive producer Jon Favreau on Disney\u2019s upcoming streaming service, Disney+; the opening of a major new theme park land, Galaxy\u2019s Edge, in both Anaheim and Orlando; and Star Wars: Episode IX which debuts in theatres December of this year, with its impact reaching across both 2019 and 2020.","The Disney Princess franchise will benefit from new entertainment, including the live action Aladdin film in theatres this May. The highly anticipated theatrical release, Disney Animation\u2019s Frozen 2, is set to debut Thanksgiving 2019, and will be a factor in both 2019 and 2020.","Hasbro is supporting the film with a complete line of fashion and small dolls, playsets, castles, Play-Doh products and games. In addition, Trolls will release all new theatrical entertainment in 2020.","Throughout 2018, the Hasbro team worked in real time to use our industry-leading capabilities as well as adding new capabilities to drive share recapture from the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs bankruptcy and liquidation. While in the short term we didn\u2019t achieve all the share recapture we were driving for given the higher than anticipated impact of the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs stores\u2019 liquidation, we did create share shifts and new channel opportunities that will benefit us in 2019 and beyond.","Importantly, by lowering retail inventories and having tremendous new brand initiatives, we have laid the groundwork that will enable us to stabilize Europe, while making plans to return Hasbro to growth this year.","Our growth plan is multi-faceted and is based on our ability to grow our brands, deliver compelling new gaming experiences across all formats, create engaging entertainment, and expand our consumer products, while fueling our digital commerce with digital marketing leveraging a right-sized expense model. As a result, we are well positioned to grow Hasbro this year and beyond.","Next week at Toy Fair, Deb, John and our amazing teams will dive deeper into our plans and brand initiatives. We hope you will join us.","I now like to turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deborah Thomas","Thank you, Brian and good morning everyone. Following several years of growing Hasbro\u2019s revenues and earnings, our global teams faced significant challenges in 2018.","According to NPD, the toy industry declined for the first time since 2009, decreasing 2% across the G11 markets for the year and 6% in the fourth quarter. The bankruptcy of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs was the most impactful event to our business. In addition, several other retailers around the world closed their doors and, as Brian spoke to, several implemented new approaches to managing inventory which decreased their late fourth quarter re-order levels versus historical patterns.","In Europe, throughout the year, our teams diligently lowered retail inventory levels to reposition the business going forward. This European activity meaningfully impacted the revenue and profitability of our International segment and was nearly as impactful as Toys\u201cR\u201dUs to our overall business.","Our investments in brands, gaming and content drove growth in higher margin initiatives including MONOPOLY, Magic: The Gathering, Dungeons & Dragons and Entertainment & Licensing. We continue to invest to expand our portfolio across channels and categories.","We are taking steps to right size our expense base and align behind our highest priority initiatives. As discussed earlier, and detailed in the reconciliations to the earnings release, we incurred certain charges in 2018 related to organizational changes, the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs bankruptcy, and asset impairments, which totaled $267 million. Excluding these charges operating profit margin was 13.1%.","Lower revenues coupled with higher costs to clear inventory were the primary drivers of the decline. We reduced operating expenses but lost leverage. Most of the savings from our actions will be delivered in 2019 and beyond, and we will begin to drive increases in our operating profit margin.","Our cash generation is in line with our targets and we ended with $1.2 billion in cash. During the year, we returned $559.4 million to our shareholders, an increase of approximately $131 million versus the prior year, and the Board voted to increase the quarterly dividend 8% this year.","Investing in the business remains our top capital priority. We made important investments last year in brand innovation and acquisition, digital gaming capabilities, organizational change and talent, storytelling and content capabilities, as well as in our supply chain all to drive long-term profitable growth.","Within our segments, the U.S. and Canada segment revenues declined 10% for the year, and 9% in the fourth quarter. The segment was negatively impacted by the loss of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs revenues, the impact of its liquidation on the U.S. market and by retailer efforts to more tightly manage inventory this holiday season.","Our revenues across brand portfolio categories declined. Excluding Toys\u201cR\u201dUs, point of sale increased for the year and across all four brand portfolio categories, including Franchise Brands, Partner Brands, Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brands.","Between the loss of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs and the steps mass market retailers took to manage inventory during the holiday, retail inventories are down significantly at year end.","Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment declined 25% as reported.","Adjusted segment operating profit, excluding the $46 million of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs-related charges, declined 16% and represented 17.6% of revenues versus 19.0% in 2017. Lower revenues drove the decline, along with a higher mix of close out sales in the year.","International segment revenues declined 17%, including an unfavorable $41.7 million impact of foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, full year revenues declined in Europe and Asia Pacific but were flat in Latin America. Emerging Brand revenues increased, but the remaining three Brand Portfolio categories declined.","Europe revenues declined 24% for the year, or $335.0 Million. $9.0 million of the decline was related to foreign exchange. Our efforts to clear retail inventory and the bankruptcy of several toy specialty retailers last year were the primary factors in the decline. Toys\u201cR\u201dUs was most impactful, but Ludendo in France and Top-Toy in the Nordics also closed. While we expect continued consumer and retailer challenges in Europe, our goal is to stabilize the business in 2019, positioning it to return to growth in future years.","In Latin America, revenues declined 6% including a negative $31.2 million impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the currency impact, the region was flat year-over-year led by revenue gains in Mexico. Point of sale increased for the region despite ongoing political and economic instability.","Asia Pacific revenues were down 5%, including a $1.6 million negative foreign exchange impact. Australia\u2019s decline was most impactful to the region as it was hurt by the closing of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs as well as retailers inventory management.","Revenue increased across the Asian countries, led by our new office in India. China was flat year-over-year despite a tough comparison with 2017\u2019s Transformers: The Last Knight movie merchandise. After premiering last month, Bumblebee has earned over $167 million at the Chinese box office.","Within Europe and Latin America, macroeconomic factors and retailer health continue to impact our decisions around extending credit to certain retailers. While this has resulted in an improvement in our DSO, it also has impacted our revenues in the near term.","Operating profit in the International segment declined 79%, excluding $8 million of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs related charges. As was the case throughout 2018, lower revenues combined with higher costs to clear inventory drove the decline in operating profit.","We have taken steps to lower our fixed cost base, notably in Europe, and to better align with our business priorities and the skill sets required to grow Hasbro in 2019 and beyond.","Entertainment & Licensing segment revenues increased 5% for the year due to changes in revenue recognition and a multi-year digital streaming agreement for Hasbro television programming.","Our Consumer Products business was negatively impacted by difficult movie year comparisons, as both the My Little Pony movie and Transformers: The Last Knight were in theatres during 2017, as well as the loss of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs.","The adoption of the new revenue recognition standard contributed to higher revenues in the segment on a full year basis as revenue from multi-year agreements are now recognized ratably across the license term.","As we had outlined throughout 2018, this new revenue recognition also resulted in less revenue recognized in the fourth quarter due to more being recognized earlier in the year.","The segment\u2019s operating profit as reported was $17.3 million. The segment\u2019s adjusted operating profit margin, excluding impairment charges, was 34.7% versus 33.8% in 2017.","During the fourth quarter, we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests, including for Backflip Studios. Mobile gaming is a dynamic market and the team modified its long-term plan to succeed in this space. This included organizational changes and the pacing of launch dates for games in development, as well as bringing in development partners for future releases.","Our long-term plan also provides for investments in advertising and the right in-house capabilities to succeed. As a result of the changes to Backflip\u2019s long-term plan, we concluded the associated goodwill was impaired and we recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $86.3 million in the fourth quarter.","Overall, Hasbro operating profit margin declined year-over-year. The team is very focused on managing costs and improving our margin in 2019 and beyond. As part of these efforts, we incurred $89.3 million in pre-tax severance costs last year and anticipate delivering $70 to $80 million of gross annualized savings by 2020. We plan to reinvest $10 to $15 million this year to bring on board relevant skill sets and talent.","Moving on to costs, on an as reported basis, cost of sales increased to 40.4% of revenues from 39% in 2017. The 140-basis point increase resulted from higher levels of close out sales, higher obsolescence reserves to end the year and lower gains on FX hedges.","Growth in higher margin revenues, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING and the Entertainment & Licensing segment, partially offset this impact.","We invested in innovation, spending 5.4% of revenues on product development. We are looking forward to sharing with you many of these new initiatives at Toy Fair, but also in future years as our investments are focused several years out.","The lower dollar amount in 2018 was driven by the capitalization of certain Magic: The Gathering Arena costs versus 2017 when they were expensed.","Program production amortization increased to 1% of revenues reflecting the delivery of a multi-year streaming deal for Hasbro television content and amortization of our investment in the My Little Pony movie.","As reported SD&A included $257 million of charges related to the items discussed earlier. Excluding these charges, SD&A decreased by an approximate $94 million in 2018.","Stock compensation and bonus expense declined. This was partially offset by higher shipping and warehousing costs in the U.S. and higher bad debt provisions in Europe.","Turning to our results below operating profit. Other income, net was $30.2 million versus $74.1 million last year. While many factors contributed to the change, the three primary drivers were as follows.","In 2017 we realized a $19.9 million gain due to a change in the value of a long-term liability due to U.S. tax reform. In addition, we had $10.8 million of foreign currency losses in 2018 versus a $1.3 million gain in 2017. Also, due to accounting standard changes beginning in 2018, pension expense for our frozen plans is now recognized in this line and totaled $5.8 million.","Our underlying tax rate was 18.3% versus 19.9% last year. The impact from tax reform changes to the U.S. tax code was offset by a significant change in the mix of where the Company earned its profits, mainly the result of lower European revenues.","Our effective tax rate for the year absent the impact of U.S tax reform and the Non-GAAP charges was 9.1% compared to 9.5% in 2017. This includes discrete items such as the benefit of tax planning, reassessment of historical tax reserves, accounting standard governing stock compensation and audit settlements.","Adjusted earnings per share, excluding $268 million of after-tax charges, was $3.85. On a reported basis, including the $2.11 of charges, net earnings were $1.74 per share.","Our year end balance sheet remains strong. We generated $646.0 million in operating cash flow during the year and today we announced that the board declared an 8% quarterly dividend increase payable in May. Receivables decreased 15% and were down 12% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Days sales outstanding decreased 2 days to 78 days.","Hasbro-owned inventories increased 2% at year end and were up 7% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Inventory levels declined internationally, led by Europe, but increased in the U.S. and in the new Hasbro-operated markets of India and Japan. The quality of our inventory is good, and we began 2019 with significantly lower retail inventory in several major markets, including the U.S. and Europe.","The global team managed through a very disruptive year, working closely with our retailers, engaging directly with our consumers and aligning around our growth plan. We have a solid financial foundation upon which we are operating and investing which affords us the ability to take actions for the long-term, while also pivoting our near-term behaviors to reflect a rapidly changing global market.","Our teams have tremendous innovation and strategic plans for this and future years, and we look forward to sharing more of those with you on Friday, February 15 at our New York Toy Fair Investor event.","We will now open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning.","Brian Goldner","Good morning.","Deborah Thomas","Morning.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi. Brian or Deb, I'm just wondering if it would be possible to give us adjusted numbers ex Toys-R-Us or some kind of indication of how much the 13% of sales decline was attributed to Toys-R-Us.","Brian Goldner","Well, the way we look at the business, Toys-R-Us is wrapped up in our results, and we could look at and have seen growth in other customers. We've seen growth in other channels. So we talked about the fact that we've opened other doors, and whether it's value or online, we've talked about the growth there.","But given that we have these big ongoingly successful brands over time, these brands are more impacted by the Toys-R-Us bankruptcy and liquidation, and we've talked about that.","But again, we expect to return to growth in 2019, and in the fourth quarter the big difference was that our estimates of what the liquidation would represent and what experts had indicated about people's purchasing product to be given away sooner versus later were both off.","And therefore the liquidation had a greater impact in the fourth quarter, but we have these big brands and franchises, as well as our partner brands that were being supported substantially by Toys-R-Us but other retailers. And we expect to now return to growth across a number of those brands. We also had a number of brands grow within the year and in the fourth quarter.","Deborah Thomas","And I think if we had to rate them, Felicia, and we tried to convey that as well in our prepared remarks, but it's - Toys-R-Us really was the most impactful to our business, and you think about the fourth quarter and the holiday season and for the reasons that Brian talked about.","It was, you know, the inventory that was in the channel, which us and experts had estimated would have been cleared through by the end of the third quarter. It really hadn't. And, you know, so that really was the most impactful, and after that it was really Europe. And it's the things we've been talking about all year.","Felicia Hendrix","And just in terms of like the mismatch between the estimates and the reality, do you think that's just more because this is something that was just so challenging to kind of forecast versus, you know, perhaps it being a consumer-related issue?","Brian Goldner","Yeah, you know, this was an unprecedented yet finite event, and I think that as we look back on our track record from 2012 to 2017, we've been delivering on the medium-term objectives we outlined for you. Over that period we achieved 5% in revenue growth CAGR. We achieved 13% net earnings growth CAGR, double-digit growth in emerging market, an expansion of operating profit margin by one full percentage point. We saw the emerging market grow double digits.","So the fact is we expect to return in 2019 to growth, and we see this as a finite event that began in the fall of 2017, if you remember. And to remind people, we still shipped product to Toys-R-Us in the first quarter of last year, 2018, but we do see the headwinds from the Toys-R-Us bankruptcy that we've experienced since the fall of '17 that intensified during the liquidation dissipating during the first quarter of '19.","And we are going experience and generate tailwinds in 2019, and that comes from things that Deb and I outlined. The innovation, a strong entertainment slate, retail inventory's down, our inventory in a great position with inventory down in Europe, and new capabilities that we're on-boarding and addressing our organization to be digital and very strong.","Felicia Hendrix","Thank you for that. It actually kind of touches upon the kind of follow-up I have is - because I think on the last call you had said that the Toys-R-Us disruption could continue into the first half. Sounds like, you know, just from a comp perspective, maybe the first quarter, but past the first quarter are you kind of moving forward or is it still going to be kind of a first half noisy type of thing?","Brian Goldner","Yeah, so in the US, we continue to ship in first quarter, and then US no longer ship because, if you recall, right after Toy Fair last year Toys-R-Us announced the liquidation. I think the only other country that goes this little bit beyond is Australia. So you'll probably have a bit of an impact there, and then they ultimately liquidated there.","But yes, 2019's about a return to growth, about move beyond the Toys-R-Us bankruptcy and liquidation, and we expect to see growth this year, as well a growth in operating profit and an expansion of our operating profit margin in our plans.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Then just my final is just on POS, you both said it was up ex Toys-R-Us. Just wondering if you could give us some magnitude. Was it up low single digits, mid single digits? Just some more color might be helpful.","Brian Goldner","Yeah, so overall POS globally without Toys-R-Us...was overall globally POS was just down like less than 1% and North America was up low single digits, and Europe was down high single digits. Latin America was up. Asia-Pac was down mid single digits."," But our global franchise brands were up low single digits. Emerging brands were up mid single digits, and our games business was up low single digits. Partner brands were down.","Felicia Hendrix","Right, and the Europe is because of the transition that you're having there or was it something else being down high single digits?","Brian Goldner","Yeah, the transition and the market, exactly. And the fact is we wanted to ensure that we had completed our goal, our task, and our plan of eliminating retail inventory, and we also reduced our inventory.","And the great part that we're hearing is as teams are leaving Nuremberg and working on the year's plan for 2019, the conversation is really shifted to be about the plan forward, growing our business, and going after the innovations and the entertainment-led brands that we have for the year.","Felicia Hendrix","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Arpine Kocharyan with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","Arpine Kocharyan","Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to go back to retail inventory for a second, because it seems like POS globally including Toys-R-Us would be down but then shipments were down as well. But if you look at Q3, that was the case, right? You were down double digits and POS was down double digit, yet we saw inventory impact in places like Europe heading into Q4. I guess what's inventory situation ex Toys-R-Us at retail?","And then owned inventory was up constant currency, and we're heading into Q1 where you have also Easter shift and, as you mentioned, some impact from Toys-R-Us disruption.","Could you just go over what's contributing to that owned inventory to be up ahead of a quarter that's going to be seasonally obviously weak and you have Easter shift? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Brian Goldner","Yeah, so our inventories are up nominally about $10 million year-on-year, and remember that going into the year, not only do we have new initiatives coming in the first quarter and a number of them new product, whether it's entertainment led like Captain Marvel, our other new brand initiatives like Transformers that goes into its home entertainment window. It performed incredibly well at fourth quarter. It was up in the quarter both in the US and internationally, so up overall.","And then we head into the second quarter with a number of entertainment initiatives there as well. The Avengers is back in theaters. We have Spiderman that hits theaters. Both in the second quarter, and as I said brands like Play Doh, although not up for the year, had great momentum.","And we're really seeing where new initiatives around that brand are taking hold, and we're seeing a good performance there. So I think that we're positioning ourself for a good year, and I know, Deb, you want to...","Deborah Thomas","Yeah. And just from a geographic standpoint, our owned inventories are down significantly in Europe. They're up a tad in the US, and Brian spoke to a lot of the things that are hitting early in the year. And they're also up in markets where we have new offices, so, you know, for example, we have an office in Japan now. We didn't have that a year ago...","Brian Goldner","And in India.","Deborah Thomas","India, as well, which we've been building in the year, but most of the increase is really coming from that.","Brian Goldner","Yeah, so we're down\u2026","Arpine Kocharyan","Right\u2026","Brian Goldner","We\u2019re down in our owned inventory substantially in Europe as well as retail inventory, and down in retail inventory in the United States. So I think we're really well-positioned in very high quality inventory.","Arpine Kocharyan","Right, right. No, thank you. I'm just also wondering about your mentioning of stabilization for Europe this year versus sort of growth and return to growth beyond '19. I think you mentioned inventories were down 27% in that market. Wouldn't that set you up to grow nicely this year in Europe then? Because inventories are down so much?","Brian Goldner","Well, look, I think we really, as a team, as you can hear, are very thoughtful about the way we plan out our businesses, and we recognize that we can grow our overall business and stabilize Europe in 2019. We want to ensure that the changes that we're making are taking hold. We've organized our business very differently right now, and going forward Amazon is our number one customer in Europe. Toys-R-Us no longer really operates as a top customer in Europe. We have it in a couple of territories under new ownership.","We have Smith's, which is a fantastic toy specialist, which was in the UK, but now bought the German, Austrian, and Switzerland business. And so they've grown to become a top customer for us.","So it's just all the shifting dynamics that we want the team to be able to accomplish a number of objectives, and for us we want to make sure we're very clear that stabilizing Europe this year and growing it beyond in an environment where we grow our business overall would be a great accomplishment.","Arpine Kocharyan","Great. Great. And then I have a, just switching gears to gaming, you mentioned in the release and I think in prepared remarks that there are some initiatives to redesign your go-to market strategy for digital. Does that change anything in terms of Magic: The Gathering Arena outlook for the year and the profitability profile for that franchise? There's a lot of investor excitement around Magic Arena for this year. Anything you could tell in that regard would be very helpful.","Brian Goldner","Yeah, Magic Arena is performing very strongly for us and exceeding the measures for engagement and stickiness. You know, it's early days. We're still in the open beta. We haven't officially launched, and yet in the fourth quarter we had nearly 350 million games of Magic played in Arena. On average, a Magic player is playing for about 8 hours per week. The e-sports viewership during the quarter was doubled on Twitch. It's now a top 10 viewed game.","And so we are also seeing as we look at measures of engagement and monetization, they are beating our early estimates. The other great part about what the team is doing, and they are doing a fantastic job, currently Arena is available on PC, but given they're using something called the Unity engine it gives us a flexibility to move to other formats over time.","So again, we're in early days. We haven't even launched yet. We'll launch later this year. But all the indications are quite strong for Arena.","Deborah Thomas","And we'll talk more about Arena at Toy Fair next week at our investor event next Friday, but when we were really talking about gaming and mobile gaming, it's really the Backflip mobile gaming. We were talking about it.","Because of the changes we've seen, we modified our plans, and frankly we think we modified them to be more successful with the way that mobile gaming has moved go forward. It just created an accounting remeasurement, and from an accounting standpoint that created the goodwill impairment.","So we believe that all the modifications to the plan are good. The pacing is better based on what we've seen. We're investing to make sure the games are successful when they launch through advertising and user acquisition. It's just those changes created the goodwill impairment from an accounting standpoint.","Arpine Kocharyan","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question's from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Ng","Great. Thank you for the time. I have two questions about margins. First, and apologies if I missed the nuance, but when you talk to a return to growth in 2019, is that a return to profitable growth, which I would define as margin expansion? And could you just help us think about how those margins will look next year? And then second - Oh, sorry. Go ahead.","Brian Goldner","No, you go ahead, Mike. Sorry.","Michael Ng","Okay. And the second question was just about the gross margin headwinds in the quarter, which you said included higher levels of closeouts and higher obsolescence. It seems to me that those are probably discrete issues related to Toys-R-Us and Europe. Is that true? And if that is, should we see a snapback back to more normal margins in 4Q '19 if it's a more normal revenue quarter, all else being equal? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Yeah, so we do want to talk extensively about our plan go forward next week at our analyst event for 2019 and we'll do that, but I'll tell you at a high level we expect margin expansion this year, an improvement in profitability across the company, and an improvement of profitability in Europe despite my comments about stabilizing the business in terms of revenues. And, Deb, I don't know if you wan to comment on anything else now.","Deborah Thomas","I have to save something for next week's Toy Fair. But I would agree with Brian's comment, and we will get into more detail on the components next Friday.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Badishkanian","Great, thanks. Just on Nerf, Nerf had more exposure than most of your brands to Toys-R-Us. Can you talk about the impact from Toys-R-Us versus the competition within the category that you also discussed that we saw, and then how impactful could some of the licensing partnerships be like the Fortnite partnership going forward to reaccelerate the brand?","Brian Goldner","Yeah. So Nerf by far remains the leader in the category, and you're right. The liquidation had a major impact on Nerf in the near term. We had mentioned before that 2 million Nerf units went into the market during the Toys-R-Us liquidation. Due to its performance and innovation, Nerf also received also received larger shelf space at Toys-R-Us, and we saw and in the third quarter we talked about the fact that we'd seen the impact from liquidation. Us and industry third-party data had indicated that much of that would have been gifted, and in fact we've seen a continued impact from that liquidation.","Well, we know the blaster category is very competitive, and we are aggressively driving our position in the market. And we believe that when you buy a Nerf, you don't just buy our innovation but best performance, quality, safety.","And so as we go into the year we're entering a new innovation cycle with propriety consumer insights in R&D. We do start with the gamer series this spring in Nerf Overwatch and Nerf Fortnite, which launch in March.","And then we have all new innovation across price points with protectable innovations. And we're going to show some but not all of it at Toy Fair, because again we feel that a lot of competitors are using our insights and innovations to create their products.","And so we'll talk more about that. We've got a great lineup and very exciting things to say and to show in the showroom. But we feel very strongly that we can return Nerf to growth in '19 and beyond.","Greg Badishkanian","Good. And just on some entertainment, Star Wars, Disney Princess, 2019, so outside of being a big movie year for you, anything you're planning to do differently that you're able to talk about on those two properties?","Brian Goldner","Yeah, I think, you know, Star Wars did have a difficult year as you compared to Solo to Last Jedi film from 2017. We're very excited about what LucasFilm and Disney have put together for the year. The franchise is going to be well supported with new entertainment and also experiences this year for the first time.","We're going to be delivering innovation in marketing programs directly to kids. We have Galaxy of Adventures, which we'll support, which is a kid-focused initiative with short form content on their Star Wars YouTube channel.","There's also new entertainment experiences because The Mandalorian is an all-new TV series. It's executive produced by John Favreau that comes on Disney+. We're also seeing the opening of a major new theme park land with Galaxy's Edge, which is both in Anaheim and in Orlando. And then we get to the end of the year with the movie, Star Wars Episode IX which debuts in theaters in December.","And that impact from the film and all of our efforts will reach across both 2019 and 2020. So we're really excited about a full year effort. Lots of really good product, very innovative product throughout the year corresponding to the entertainment. And then Princess\u2026","Greg Badishkanian","Would that be like a - yeah.","Brian Goldner","No, no. Go ahead. Sorry.","Greg Badishkanian","Will it be like a 50\/50 split on Star Wars because it's the end of the year, or is it like 60, 40 or 40, 60? How do you\u2026","Brian Goldner","Well, look, it's we're for the first time in a couple years back to the entertainment cycle we had seen in 2017, so coming out of all that we've experienced on Star Wars -- Remember that both Star Wars and Princes and Frozen were also very well represented at Toys-R-Us globally, and we know that had a significant impact.","So in addition to being up against some of the major entertainment from 2017, there's that impact as well. So, you know, what I'd say is that we absolutely believe that Star Wars will have an impact in '19 and '20, but I won't quite yet express what percent of that business would come in which year.","Greg Badishkanian","Sure. And Disney Princess, I'm sorry, you were going to\u2026","Brian Goldner","Oh! That's okay. You know, so Disney Princess, there was a lot of filmed and television entertainment in 2017, which we were up against, and so the brand did have tough comps. As well as I just mentioned, it was well-supported at Toys-R-Us, so that combination certainly impacted the brand. We're very excited about a number of initiatives that are coming for Princess this year.","We have a movie that comes, Aladdin, in May of this year, which is a live action film that we will support. We also have a Disney Princess capsule programs around, some new product that's very exciting to see princesses in a different light. If you saw the Wreck-It Ralph movie, there was a great scene in there of the princesses having a slumber party, and we're playing off of that with our partners at Disney.","And then we get to the year end in November, and extremely excited about a full array of product for Frozen 2. And, of course, being a November film, it will stretch and impact from 2019 through 2020, and I'm sure beyond.","Greg Badishkanian","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.","Tim Conder","Thank you, and good morning. Brian, as you called out earlier, you know, you guys had great performance and execution 2012 to '17, and even in China, given everything that's going on over there, even in '18 here you guys have outperformed the industry. But I'll just ask the elephant in the room question here.","As Toys-R-Us started to unravel, initially you didn't have the largest exposure or percent of sales, and yet it seems like that and Europe has been more problematic for you all relative to others in the industry. Can you kind of expand on what happened there?","And then with the shift to digital, I think you called out on the third quarter call, that you need more distribution centers in Europe to react more quickly to the retailers' needs. Is that part of the equation? And kind of where do we stand with that?","Brian Goldner","Yeah, so on the first point, you've heard others talk about brands that were ongoingly successful or big brands that had been in the market for a number of years, like our brands like Nerf and My Little Pony and our games business, where they were being incredibly well-supported by Toys-R-Us.","There was a bigger or outsized impact to those brands than brands that might be rebuilding over some period of time, and you also see where we had brand new innovations that weren't involved with the liquidation, whether that be for Monopoly or Magic: The Gathering or Dungeons & Dragons or even Transformers in the fourth quarter. Those brands performed quite well, and so you can see really the differences.","You also see the difference when you compare Latin America, where there was no Toys-R-Us, or in Canada, where Toys-R-Us changed hands pretty seamlessly. We saw really good performances.","And in Asia, even though we changed ownership of Toys-R-Us and Toys-R-Us is the second largest customer for us there, our business in Asia was good and our business in China was flat. So I think that we have had a level of success with our brands.","As you mentioned and I'll reiterate, from 2012 to '17 we've grown our revenues at 5% and net earnings at 13% growth rates and expanded operating margins. So we view this as an event. We also believe, and I'll walk you through it in more detail next week, that we have every reason to believe and all the plans in place to get back into that kind of a performance post the Toys-R-Us event.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then the distribution in Europe, just the\u2026","Brian Goldner","Yeah, we continue to -- We always look at our footprint, and really it's not just distribution but it's capabilities and channel strategy. So today, as I mentioned, Amazon is our number one customer in Europe, and we've moved to be more oriented toward a digital-first strategy to bring our capabilities we'd built in the US, being a top performer on online platforms, to Europe, and that's been a focus.","We've also focused on where and how inventory gets placed into the market. We've also focused on our short-form content, content-to-commerce, and we'll continue to look at our footprint for warehousing.","Deborah Thomas","And I'd also add, Tim, and we've talked about this throughout the year, we've been very thoughtful. Given the economic situation in some of these countries, we've been very careful with extending credit, and as a matter of fact our cash collections have improved.","You see that in our continuously strong cash flow, which was within our targets, based on the fact that we focused on making sure our collections were strong. We're reducing our DSOs. We've been extending credit to the right customers.","So we've been very thoughtful about how we go into these new doors, who we extend our credit to, and making sure we can collect it at the end of the day. So you've seen some of that disruption this year, and we'll continue to do that go forward.","But we believe based on all the changes we've made, the distribution efficiencies we've put in place, that we're really well positioned to stabilize and grow, in Europe and throughout our other markets.","Tim Conder","And again, yeah, the cash management, given everything that went on, has been very good, so congratulations on that. As it relates to -- you talked about stabilizing Europe, profits grow in Europe for '19, and then profits grow overall for the company in '19, maybe just give us a little bit of an update.","You'd talked about getting back to that however benchmark you want to have it, the high 15, low 16 in change, operating margin. Where do we stand and how does that play and look now given the bump here we've had in '18?","Brian Goldner","Well, look. I think many people have asked, but, you know, we did experience an unprecedented event, and industry experts have likened it to be the worst event in the industry in the last decade. So we have to re-rate our business off of our performance and where we ended 2018.","We ended the year 2018 with the highest revenues in the industry at $4.6 billion with a strong profitability, albeit lower than prior year given all of the issues that we took on and all the changes the team's made.","And so we grow from here, and we'll walk you through a progression of how we continue to rebuild our profitability and expand our operating profit margin and perform across a number of dimensions over time. But I think that's a great conversation for next week.","Tim Conder","Sounds great. Thanks, Brian. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.","Drew Crum","Okay, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Brian, can you talk about the product roadmap for Power Rangers this year? Is it a global launch or staggered, a global launch in 2Q or is it staggered? Was the relative of the line -- I think you mentioned some new content coming on board. Any detail you can provide there is appreciated.","And then I guess separately I think that you mentioned in your preamble you expect to be at 60% exposure to China by 2020. Is there a longer term goal you have in mind for the business? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","Yeah, we'll continue, on production side, we're going to continue to look at new places to put product. Some of that has to do with just expanding our footprint. Some of it has to do with trying to mitigate some of the...that you face in certain geographies around the world. People have asked about tariffs.","One place we do experience tariffs is in Brazil, so local production of some products is helpful in mitigating those kinds of impacts. We continue to look at how to make sure we're making product in the right place, recognize we're making a really innovative product line that requires all kinds and different types of manufacturing.","So we really believe in our asset-light type model, which gives us great flexibility to get great innovation, pricing, and a great reliable, safe product. So it's the next benchmark at end of 2020 to be 60% out of China.","In the US, about a fifth of our products are already made in the US, and about two-thirds we take in the US is coming from China already. For us, again, it's just a progression, and the team there is doing a great job in expanding our footprint and bringing new brands and our current brands to new geographies for manufacturing.","In terms of Power Rangers, we're incredibly excited. We have our new series that will launch later this spring called Beast Morphers for Power Rangers. The product line is extensive. It's now been shown around the world at multiple toy fairs, and retailers are very excited.","Our consumer products teams are really stepping up behind that excitement. So this is a new original series that's produced by the same team that had produced Power Rangers before, albeit with new energy and a connection between our teams and the original core Saban team that's really just tremendous. And we're incredibly excited.","It will launch in North America in Q2, and then launches in the rest of the world throughout the remainder of the year. So it's a rollout. Obviously English-speaking territories before it goes to translated territories, in terms of language, but 2020 plans and beyond are even more robust because we get it for a full year and then we do intend to add a movie to the mix in the next few years.","And so, again, we will build this brand. This brand had been far bigger in the past than it was at present, and we feel like there's a lot of opportunity. It reminds me a lot of the early days of some of our Hasbro brands, where we really looked at how big they had been in their history and asked ourselves, how big could we make this in the future? And we believe in the power and the potential of Power Rangers.","Drew Crum","Brian, can you remind us where you're getting distribution for the television series?","Brian Goldner","Sure. We have a great partnership with Nickelodeon, and we have a commitment from them. Great new leadership at Nickelodeon with Brian Robins and the team, and Bob Bakish has been incredibly supportive of our efforts there and also our efforts with Paramount, parenthetically, where we would produce the movie alongside of our relationship on Transformers and other films. So they have a great team there, and we feel very strongly about our opportunity to work with them and to build this brand together.","Drew Crum","Yeah. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Swartz with SunTrust. Please proceed with your questions.","Michael Swartz","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Brian Goldner","Hey, good morning.","Michael Swartz","Just a quick, quick point of clarification, Brian. I don't know if I had this right, but when you talked about inventory's down I think 20% plus in both North America and Europe. Was that excluding Toys-R-Us?","Brian Goldner","No, that includes Toys-R-Us, but inventories are down across the board. And remember, the way the order pattern worked that what we could see is that while retailers were out for share recapture, they also were out for managing yearend inventories.","So we were careful in working with them. We did not end the year with our own inventories up more than the $10 million, but retail inventories in the US were down 24% and in Europe were down 27%. And some portion of that is Toys-R-Us, and then there's a substantial portion of that that's also other retail.","But remember also, remember also that we're opening new doors of retail. We've opened tens of thousands of new doors of retail, everything from food, drug, club, I'll leave something out, sporting goods.","And so we have a great channel strategy and product development that's marrying up to bring the right products to the right channels and the right price points with the right retail margins and margins for Hasbro.","Michael Swartz","Okay. That's helpful. And just adding on to that, I mean, I think, one of the major challenges you've had later in the year was some of the mass retailers tightening up on inventory.","I guess, in your early talks with them about how they're thinking about '19, is there incremental risk that they get even tighter with their inventory levels? Or do you think that's now kind of normalized or stabilized?","Brian Goldner","Well, look, I think the way we view it is, it was definitely a change in the business related to the fact that Toys-R-Us was no longer going to exist with inventories in stock in December, and so as a result one can gain market share without necessarily being fully in stock at the end of the year. And we will always work on our inventories, and just in time our new warehouse in the Midwest is all about ensuring that we get better at just-in-time inventory.","We're using even flexible space in that warehouse where we'll able to within a day or two move inventory from our inventory to other retailers' inventory. And so we'll continue to hone this, but I don't believe that there's a step change in inventory.","I believe it's just going to be a perpetual drumbeat to improve inventory, inventory management, just-in-time inventory, around our initiatives go forward, and the team is absolutely prepared for that.","Michael Swartz","Okay. Great. And then one final question if I may, just I guess a little more clarity on the cost savings that you outlined for '19 and '20. I think I was getting the gross and the net amounts confused, so you can go back over that quickly one more time.","Deborah Thomas","Sure. By 2020, we expect to achieve gross cost savings of $70 to $80 million, and, you know, we've got a transition period, because while we put the plan in place we'll be executing it throughout this year. So in 2019 net of the add backs that we expect to do to, you know, for the items that we continue to invest in.","If you think about we talked a bit about Arena and Wizards of the Coast Earlier, we continue to make investments in our business because that does remain our number one capital priority because we want to make sure we're set up for the long-term. We've always been that way as a company. So we continue to make investments, so the net is 50 to 55 in 2019.","Michael Swartz","Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks, Deb.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Eric Handler with MPM Partners. Please proceed with your questions.","Eric Handler","Thanks, and good morning. Wonder if you could talk about, with all of the new doors that you've opened and different types of retailers in the last year, I'm curious if there are any segments that you found to be better than expected or over delivered and what they might be able to do. And then I've got a follow-up question after that.","Brian Goldner","Yeah, look, it really -- this comes back to incredible kudos I give to our product development team and our marketing teams, because it all begins with great product development that's made in the right manner for the right type of retail.","So we've been able to recognize the increased demand for exclusivities among retailers to give them a position on our brands that allows them to market our brands and to feel that they can make a fair return on our brands.","So if we're going to a gaming type company, we want to give them the right array of product that's focused on that gaming fan and collector and the fan economy. If it's a sporting good store, it would probably more focused on our Nerf business and giving them products that are right for their audience.","And so it's really those handshakes and those partnerships that are really important, and then we also have to get to value and discount stores and make sure we're making a product that can be sold to achieve a lower absolute price point and still retain margin for us and for the retailer.","You know, I think that we've made a major pivot here over time where we really want to ensure that kids at every socioeconomic level have an opportunity to play with and participate in our brands, and we work all the time with our teams make sure that we can provide a great product for them.","So that's been a process that's ongoing, but also you really see it take hold when you add so many doors, so many thousands of doors, at retail in the US and now applying that same channel strategy to Europe. We're seeing thousands of new doors opening in Europe.","Eric Handler","Okay. And then a question on mobile. It was interesting what you've been saying here. Electronic Arts has some similar issues, it seems, in mobile. I'm just curious, what is your strategy here with mobile, what you can do with Backflip, what -- It seems like the top -- You need to have a top 10 games if you're going to be really successful in mobile and how that view shapes what you want to do?","Brian Goldner","Yeah, I think the first dynamic that you really have seen, and it's a long of arc of change that's gone on in the industry. There was a time not that many years ago, because change is happening so quickly, where the most important thing you could do is develop the game, and then you'd put it out on the market.","And I'll call it the kind of fire-and-forget approach to the game, where the first day you put it on the market might be its most important day. And today, of course, we all know that's evolved to be one of the important days but not the most important. The most important days come as you look at D7, 14, 21, 28 retention.","So we go off and we work on in small markets around the world, looking at the monetization model, which means proportionally as you look at the composition of your teams, you need more people who are in data analytics and monetization. You still need great artists and creators, but you have to find the right balance between the two.","So that's been the big arc of change, and so as that change has occurred where we're now looking at games that last years -- You know, DragonVale is a key game of Backflip, and it's now enjoying its eighth year of success. Or our Transformers: Earth War has been out several years, and it's been reinvented over several different periods.","So we do have some games that really track. We're adding some new games, but we also want the team to focus on getting it right creatively from an immersive standpoint but also games that are really able to monetize over time.","And that takes more time and more dedicated focus. For that reason, the long-term plan changes, and therefore you have the associated impact to goodwill. I don't know if you want to comment.","Deborah Thomas","No, you're right. And, you know, some of the changes are you work with development partners on certain things. And you're right. We, you know, took some organizational actions in the fourth quarter to reflect that, and we feel we're well setup with that plan go forward.","Eric Handler","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ray Stochel with Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed with your question.","Ray Stochel","Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. How are you thinking about your collectibles business across all your franchises? And is that something you plan to lean into in fiscal '19? And do you need a greater presence, especially within franchise brands given the changes occurring in the market? And then one quick follow-up question after that.","Brian Goldner","Yeah, look, the way we plan out our brands are based on proprietary consumer insights, and we spend so much time understanding our audience. And our goal is to understand the audience better than anyone for all of our brands.","In addition -- So that really focuses on our franchise brands and other brands, and there may be collectible aspects to those brands because the audience or the consumer tells us that, that they want to participate in those ways.","And then on the other side, we've had our quick strike initiatives, which have been successful, and we saw the impact of those in the fourth quarter, like Lost Kitties and Yellies, where we saw a social media trend and using social media scraping and listening we found a fun new trend that was unique and original.","And we put it in the market to good success, and so we're going to follow the audience and the consumer. We don't have a overarching mandate at the company to come up with just collectibles for collectibles' sake.","There are a lot of companies out there that have done a really good job in this space, and we applaud the innovation and the efforts around companies where their businesses have been built with a single brand. And we don't really create product based on a business objective only. We're really looking at the consumer and the audience, first and foremost.","Ray Stochel","Great. Thanks. And then could you comment on Hasbro Toy Shop? I know you're making some changes there. Is there any way to think about how that could impact 1Q and then how that could impact, you know, 2019, 2020, and beyond?","Brian Goldner","It's really exciting. What we're doing there is moving Hasbro Toy Shop to be Hasbro Pulse. The effort there is a combination of a lot of efforts we've had across the company where we are engaging with our fans, and we've seen the fan economy grow.","We've spoken to you over years about the importance of the fan economy. We have used see-now, buy-now strategies for different shows around the world. We obviously are a big participant in ComicCon. We have brands that track incredibly well with that fan base.","Our Transformers business has a huge fan-orientation. We put content out for the older adult in that brand and for the fan. And so this is bringing together several of our capabilities to build a direct consumer offering that has both content and commerce, but it is organized and focused on our fans across a multitude of brands, from partner brands to our own brands.","And we're very excited. It's early days. I don't know, Deb, if you want to comment further on investments, but obviously you'll hear more about it. John will probably walk you through some elements of this next week at Toy Fair.","Ray Stochel","Great. Thanks again.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Steph Wissink with Jaffray's. Please proceed with your question.","Steph Wissink","All right, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I want to just put a finer point, maybe it's a question for each of you, a finer point on a few of your comments. So, Brian, this one's for you. You said inventory in Europe down 27%. That does include Toys-R-Us, but channel seems very clean. You've rebalanced your retail mix. You have a really strong pipeline for '19. So why only use the word \"stabilize\"? Why will that business not grow? That's the first question.","Brian Goldner","So, Steph, you know us. You know we want to make sure we get things right before we run at pace. The team's been working feverishly for the last 18 months or so. If you recall, we talked about changes to the organization that we were making, and we took a charge, in fact, to modernize our organization prior to the announcement of the liquidation of Toys-R-Us. So we were already on the case, and yet it does take a period of time, and yet it's not forever.","So I feel that what's important to reassure people of is that in an environment where we stabilize Europe, we can grow our company, and therefore with all of the other factors, including announcements we're hearing this week from the Bank of England and others about re-rating growth rates in countries and across territories, that our company is strong, our balance sheet is strong, our strategies are sound, and our brands are powerful.","So it's just a matter of making sure people feel comfortable and confident that we're not relying on something to occur. Rather we are going to plan appropriately, conservatively, for that in the context of all the initiatives that we have.","Steph Wissink","All right, that's very helpful. And then, Deb, one for you, and this is really on incremental margins in 2019. So if we look at 2018 was really a sales impact year, but you were still investing behind the business. So the margins were probably a bit lower.","In 2019 you get a boost from sales. If the investment levels are stable, we give you some credit for your cost savings and Magic and some of the film revenues, it would imply that the incremental margins are going to expand quite sharply. Is that the appropriate way to think about the 2019 opportunity and maybe 2019 as the first year in a multi-year opportunity?","Deborah Thomas","So we'll give a bit more specific guidance on some of the factors, and, you know, I remind you we've paid for some of these investments and we'll continue to invest in the business. So for example we had a good discussion earlier about Power Rangers that we are super excited for the long-term, and we think, we continue to say that could be a future franchise brand of ours, performing all the way around the blueprint.","But with that comes amortization, so we only have a partial year of revenues from that acquisition, but we have a full year of amortization. So we have some things and some investments that will offset, but we do see our operating profit margin expanding over time.","And we'll give some guidance next week of where we see that expanding to, but we remain very focused on that. We're very focused on making sure that when we have revenue growth, we're able to take the leverage of that through to our operating profit, through to our earnings, and then take those positive earnings and return any excess cash after we keep investing for the long-term to our shareholders. That remains our strategy.","Steph Wissink","Thanks, and then one more, Brian, or maybe John, if he's still in the room. Is this with respect to 2019, your comments seem to suggest that you're consistently if not even more confident than the opportunity set in 2019.","But I just wanted to make sure we're hearing you correctly that your franchise and your games business ex Toys-R-Us did grow this year at the POS level, your inventories are very clean, your partner slate, Brian, you went through extensively. It sounds like it could be even a kind of double positive year, a lot of content coming through.","So if we think about kind of the staging of 2019, you had a growth versus your historic average in that mid single digits. Are we hearing you correctly that your confidence level remains high and the growth potential -- not guidance per se, but just the growth potential is there to really set you out on kind of a new baseline for a multi-year trajectory?","Brian Goldner","Now, so first and foremost, I think there -- I'll walk you through our new view toward broadly what we'll call kind of medium term guidance next week. Because there are some puts and takes, and a good example is that we don't believe we can rely on the kind of double digit growth we've achieved in the emerging markets over the past five years, 2012 through 2017, going forward.","And yet in our plan we believe we can achieve the low-to-mid singles digit growth that we have achieved. In fact, the 5% growth rate is what we had achieved historically, and we're going to say low-to-mid single digits growth in developed economies.","The faster growth will come from gaming, which is an area that we have been focusing on and investing, but again that's a newer investment for us and we want to get to see the returns.","You are right that, let's just look at the US, US without Toys-R-Us, where we had the greatest impact, where Toys-R-Us represented globally two-thirds of the Toys-R-Us business was in the US, without Toys-R-Us, in the US every category of our business was up for the year in POS.","But I also want to recognize that you have the tempering effect of emerging markets, offset by the very exciting early days of our launch of Arena and the acceleration of Magic and Dungeons & Dragons.","So a longer conversation, but suffice it say we feel good about our track record, what we've achieved, and next week we're going to reaffirm the next phase of growth for Hasbro.","Steph Wissink","Thank you. We'll see you next week.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.","Gerrick Johnson","Last four questions, that is. They're really quick.","Brian Goldner","Gerrick, I'd expect nothing less.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. First one, should we expect more severance charges in 2019?","Deborah Thomas","Well, I think you can never say never, right? But right now, as we look through to 2019, I would say there's nothing significant that we're thinking of right now. However, there are always severance charges in our business.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay, great. Thanks. And on Transformers, can you talk about that? How did that perform to your expectations? And is there anything you can give us on expectations for bottom line contribution or expense? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Yeah, sure. On Transformers, in the fourth quarter was up both in the US and internationally, so up overall. We really successfully reengaged fans and families with Bumblebee. It's done over $450 million globally.","The early indications as we enter the New Year are for a strong ESP and home entertainment window, and we believe that the enterprise for Bumblebee, including the film, is profitable for Hasbro go forward.","Obviously we're in the early days. Haven't hit the home entertainment window yet. We haven't even opened in Japan yet, and the movie is still in theaters.","In addition to the feature film, which is an important element and we are working on new films ideas with Paramount in partnership with Jim Giannopoulos and that team, and they're fantastic, we also have television on Cartoon Network, Netflix offering, and preschool offering. So across the board, it's a brand that really embodies our brand blueprint strategy, and we continue to believe very strongly in the power of the franchise.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay, great. Thank you. And on Power Rangers, are you accelerating the timetable for full activation? Or is this consistent with what you were planning before?","Brian Goldner","It's pretty consistent with what we were planning before. What we didn't know but know now is that we've been through several of the major toy fairs and have shown the product line to several of the industry experts, and they're all giving us very enthusiastic response to the brand.","We've really made, see change, improvement to the product line, to the innovation, to price points. Looking forward to showing you the Mega Mighties line and what that does for brands like Marvel but also in areas like Power Rangers. It's an exciting time, and we're looking forward to kicking that off.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. Yeah, that's a great brand. Looking forward to that. My last question is franchise brands down 9% in the year, so you have an easy comp going forward. Do you expect growth in franchise brands in '19? And maybe is it too early to start asking about 2020? Thank you?","Brian Goldner","Yeah, yeah. I don't want to comment on franchise brands only because it's early, early days, and I wouldn't give you guidance by a product category at this point. Remember that our franchise brands in 2018 were brands that were strongly supported by Toys-R-Us.","The impact is clear. We've described how that happens. But underlying that, we did have, in the fourth quarter, three of those franchise brands grow with Magic and Monopoly and Transformers. And, again, I feel like we have real opportunity as we go forward. We saw real momentum even though the brand didn't absolutely grow in the fourth quarter with Play Doh. So look, I feel that we're on a good track with great innovation and great teams on those brands.","Gerrick Johnson","Right. Thank you, Brian. I'll see you next week. Thanks.","Brian Goldner","Yeah, see you next week. Thanks, Gerrick.","Deborah Thomas","See you then.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the floor back to Debbie Hancock for closing remarks.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today.

Please go ahead.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning are Brian Goldner, Hasbro's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Deb Thomas, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer.","Today, we will begin with Brian and Deb providing commentary on the company's performance, and then we will take your questions. Our earnings release was issued this morning and is available on our investor website. Additionally, presentation slides containing information covered in today's earnings release and call are also available on our investor website.","The press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP adjustments and non-GAAP financial measures. Our call today will discuss certain adjusted measures, which include these non-GAAP adjustments. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the release and presentation. Please note that whenever we discuss earnings per share, or EPS, we are referring to earnings per diluted share.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management's expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters. There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. Some of those factors are set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our most recent 10-Q, in today's press release and in our other public disclosures. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.","I would now like to introduce Brian Goldner. Brian?","Brian Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2018 is unfolding as expected as our teams managed the liquidation of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs in many markets and addressed the rapidly evolving European retail landscape.","As anticipated, revenues were down in the quarter, reflecting both lower Toys\u201cR\u201dUs revenues and the impact of its liquidation on the marketplace. Importantly, consumer takeaway remains positive, and retailer inventories declined. We were ranked number one in the G 11 markets every month in 2018 through May according to NPD and we are investing to deliver break frame innovation, compelling entertainment and a modern commercial organization.","We\u2019ve also maintained good operating margins; despite expense deleverage resulting from lower revenues. In addition to investing back in our business, we\u2019ve returned excess cash to our shareholders this year, with an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend and the repurchase of approximately $113 million of Hasbro shares through the first two quarters.","We anticipate repurchasing additional shares opportunistically throughout the second half of the year, which will take our total purchases beyond the $150 million target we previously communicated.","With Toys\u201cR\u201dUs out of the U.S. market, retailers are executing meaningful plans to capitalize on the opportunity. This includes expansion of existing retailers, significant online programs, as well as new retailers delivering on unique consumer offerings.","As we said before, we don't expect to recapture all of the lost revenue in 2018, but by 2019, we should have moved beyond Toys\u201cR\u201dUs.","In Europe, our team is effectively addressing the evolving retail environment, which is characterized by a rapid growth in online purchases and the changing dynamics of brick-and-mortar retailing. The closing of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs in most markets coupled with additional retailer bankruptcies and ongoing retail challenges is impacting our European business and the industry in Europe this year.","In fact, according to NPD toys and game sales in Europe are down through May. We also began 2018 with too much inventory at retail in a number of brands. These factors created a near term situation, which we anticipate will take through the remainder of 2018 to resolve.","We accelerated our investment to create a modern commercial organization in Europe, with the right cost base for this new omni-channel marketplace. Our Brand Blueprint enables us to capitalize on this converged retail consumer behavior by delivering content to commerce, digital marketing and innovative product offerings across all channels of retail.","Online point-of-sale for Hasbro products continues to grow at a rate several times faster than overall, retail. We've established a global online team to ensure that we are investing in the analytics, supply chain, and consumer programs which drive profitable growth.","We are investing in digital media and marketing to develop direct-to-consumer engagement around the world. We are also creating online exclusive products and programs to support many of our retailers, including Walmart and Target and retail event such as JD.com's J.D. Day Amazon\u2019s Prime Day and 11\/11 Ali Baba singles day.","We established a global channels team focused on the opportunity beyond mass retail, toy specialty and online. Activating across new channels begins with product development to create the right brands, products and price points for each channel and retailer, supported by the best retail partnerships and executions.","We\u2019ve made significant progress in the U.S. over the past few years, and this is the roadmap our regions are following and executing locally. In 2018, Consumer Takeaway is up for Hasbro franchise brands, Hasbro Gaming and Partner Brands.","During the quarter, we acquired Power Rangers, further enhancing our story led brand portfolio. We see tremendous opportunity to expand this iconic property with a broader, more innovative line, which we will further develop both geographically and more deeply across retailers, while executing around Hasbro's brand Blueprint, including consumer products digital gaming and multiscreen content.","Our line will be in the North American market in spring 2019, and will then roll out around the world. 2019 will be a transition year as retailers sell through the prior product. By 2020, the team will be well on its way to fully activating Power Rangers across the entire blueprint.","Hasbro\u2019s gaming portfolio is one of our biggest long-term opportunities. In the second quarter, our total gaming category revenues, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING and MONOPOLY grew 14% with growth in both of these franchise brands as well as growth in DUNGEONS and DRAGONS, DUEL MASTER, JENGA and DON\u2019T STEP IN IT.","Point-of-sale increased in the quarter and through the first six months. Hasbro is uniquely positioned to grow in face-to-face gaming, with our Wizards of the Coast Portfolio and in Digital Gaming.","MAGIC: THE GATHERING had a strong second quarter, driven by growth in Dominaria released earlier this quarter as well as double-digit increase in new player\u2019s year-over-year. DUNGEONS and DRAGONS continue to deliver revenue growth as fans reengage with this brand and it attracts new players.","MONOPOLY grew behind consumer insight driven innovation, including the all new Cheater's Edition. In the second half of this year, we will further support the property with several new launches.","In 2018, there are several new games based on social insights, including Don't Lose Your Cool, Chow Crown and Connect Four Shots. This quarter, we\u2019ve taken the social listening and faster market approach beyond games, with the successful launch of Lost Kitties and Lock Stars within our emerging brands portfolio.","In our franchise brand portfolio, in addition to our games brands, Baby Alive revenues increased in the quarter. Our second annual NERF FEST is starting now. After a successful debut last year, we made this a global marketing and retail event taking place in 37 different markets, featuring seven new innovative blasters.","In addition, we recently announced the highly anticipated NERF Laser Ops Pro. We continue to execute our multi screen content strategy for TRANSFORMERS, with new product innovations supporting each of our unique stories. In addition to our feature film TRANSFORMERS, Bumblebee coming in December, we have a new kid targeted animated series \u201cTransformers Cyberverse\u201d this fall airing on Cartoon Network.","We also continue with our fan targeted Power of the Prime Series and pre-school targeted Rescue Bots series with all new content and product innovation. Our animation studio is producing both the Transformers Cyberverse and Rescue Bot series.","Paramount and Hasbro's Allspark Pictures are exploring dates for future films in support of the TRANSFORMERS franchise. The shift from 2019 to a later date was driven by the final timing of the Bumblebee films theatrical release this December and the home entertainment window which takes place in 2019.","Our partner brands also benefited from multiscreen entertainment with both BEYBLADE and the MARVEL portfolio delivering revenue growth and strong point-of-sale gains. Hasbro's Marble, Toy Line saw extremely positive results behind Avengers, Infinity War, as well as continued robust sales for Black Panther merchandise.","In addition, Dead Pool, Ant Man & The Wasp, Venom and Spider-Man into the Spider Verse are being supported by robust product lines and strong retail and marketing programs. Star Wars revenue grew slightly in the quarter. In the U.S. point-of-sale was positive. Our product line for Image result for Star Wars story","variety.com","Solo: A Star Wars Story was well received by consumers as was our fan focus, Black Series and new vintage collection. Outside the U.S. we are successfully selling through carryforward inventory.","In closing, our teams are working to develop multiyear growth plans with our retailers and we affirm our objective of delivering long-term profitable growth. Our brands have good momentum, and are supported with meaningful innovation, storytelling and marketing program slated for the remainder of the year.","As we look beyond 2018, we expect to return to growth. 2019 is setting up to be a great year with engaging storytelling and multiscreen content along with new brand innovation and robust entertainment slate, including the launch of Power Rangers.","I would now like to turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deborah Thomas","Thank you, Brian and good morning everyone. Overall, the Hasbro teams delivered a good quarter, despite challenges in the market. Revenues and profits continue to be negatively impacted by the liquidation of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs, both in terms of lower revenues and the carry-on effective steep discounts on the market.","While the biggest revenue impact is in the U.S. Toys\u201cR\u201dUs affected many markets around the world. The retailer closed in major markets such as the U.K. and Australia and created ongoing uncertainty in other countries as potential acquirers had been or in process of being secured.","These countries include Canada, Germany, Austria and Switzerland and in Asia where the sale process is ongoing. Hasbro's diverse product portfolio helped offset the margin impact of lower revenues.","Growth in gaming brands such as MAGIC: THE GATHERING, MONOPOLY, DUNGEONS and DRAGONS and DUAL MASTERS combined with higher revenues in the entertainment and licensing segment positively impacted margins and helped to partially offset the deleverage we had fixed expenses in the quarter.","Throughout the short-term disruption, our strong balance sheet has allowed us to continue investing for future long-term growth while also returning cash to shareholders. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash. This reflects cash payments of approximately $155 million for Power Rangers and the return of approximately $260 million to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases this year.","Within our segments, the U.S. and Canada segment revenues declined 7% with lower revenues in all brand portfolio categories. Retail inventory is down and point-of-sale increased both with and without the impact of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs.","U.S. and Canada segment operating profit declined in line with the revenue decline to $76.2 million or 16.6% of revenues. This was a 10 basis point improvement versus second quarter last year and operating profit margin.","Favorable product mix offset the deleveraging of expenses from lower revenues. International segment revenues declined 11%, including a favorable $2.6 million impact from foreign exchange.","Revenue declined in each region during the quarter. In Europe, in addition to the loss of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs in most markets, our teams are clearing through carry forward retail inventory. Changing retail dynamics in developed and emerging markets are also impacting our decisions around extending credit. Both factors negatively impacted revenue this quarter and we expect that they will have a continued impact for the remainder of 2018.","Retail inventories are down meaningfully since the start of the year, but there is more work to be done. Currency had a favorable $6.2 million impact on European revenues. In Latin America, the political and economic environment disrupted the quarter. Currency devaluation had a $5.5 million dollar impact, notably in Mexico and Argentina and Brazil dealt with the trucking strike which made the delivery of goods difficult.","We are still catching up. Despite the challenges, revenues grew 2% absent foreign exchange and point-of-sale was up in the quarter. In Asia Pacific, we were cautious with how we ship to Toys\u201cR\u201dUs Asia, but we continue working with them.","In Australia, the retailers shut down in June. This region also faced difficult comparisons with last year's TRANSFORMERS movie as this franchise has a very strong heritage in Asia. Currency had a favorable $2 million revenue impact in the region.","The international segment reported operating profit of the $173,000. The lower operating profit was primarily the result of lower revenues, which were unable to absorb fixed costs. We continue to look to right size our cost structure in line with the changing retail landscape.","Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues increased 26%. As was the case last quarter, the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard impacts when we record revenues from our licensees.","In addition to the ongoing success in our licensing and entertainment businesses, the adoption of this standard contributed to the segments higher revenues. The segment\u2019s operating profit increased 64%.","Overall, Hasbro operating profit margin declined 60 basis points. As we enter the most important half of our year, absent charges associated with Toys\u201cR\u201dUs and organizational changes, full-year operating profit margin could approach last year's level. Most importantly, we continue to see profit improvement opportunity in 2019 and beyond.","Cost of sales declined 50 basis points. Favorable product mix from higher revenues in gaming brands such as MAGIC: THE GATHERING as well as Entertainment and Licensing revenues partially offset the impact of lower overall revenue.","We expect the loss of Toys \"R\" Us, combined with continued pressure of higher retail inventories primarily in Europe to have a short-term impact on our gross margin for the full year 2018. However, we believe that over the next few years there is nothing prohibiting us from returning to a 62% gross margin.","Royalty expense declined in dollars, and as a percentage of revenue on lower partner brand revenues. Intangible amortization was down year-over-year and included approximately $1 million associated with the acquisition of Power Rangers.","We anticipate approximately $10 million in incremental amortization expense in the second half of 2018 due to the acquisition, and approximately $21 million in 2019. As Brian indicated, in 2019 we\u2019ll begin to record revenue associated with our line for this brand.","Program production amortization increased as we are amortizing \u201cMY LITTLE PONY\u201d, the movie production expense in addition to television programming. During the second quarter, we began contributing to financing films under our arrangement with Paramount, funding part of the production cost for Bumblebee.","We will not begin amortizing any production costs in relation to this contribution until 2019. SG&A increased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to higher freight and warehousing expenses. The higher freight costs are mainly caused by new trucking regulations and driver shortages in the U.S. and the warehousing expenses, the result of higher inventories at our warehouses.","Below operating profit, other income declined in the quarter, largely due to a greater loss on foreign exchange this year versus last. Our underlying tax rate absent discrete event was 17.4% compared to an underlying rate of 24.7% last year, and 19.9% for the full year 2017.","The lower rate reflects the benefit of U.S. tax reform. We believe our full year underlying tax rate will be at the high-end of our previously communicated range of 15% to 17%. There were no tax reform updates this quarter, although we continue to expect additional guidance on tax reform that will require consideration and interpretation going forward.","For the second quarter, earnings per share were $0.48. In mid June, we closed on our acquisition of Power Rangers and other entertainment assets from Saban Properties. At closing, we paid approximately $155 million in cash and issued approximately 3.1 million shares of common stock to Saban.","We have remaining cash payments of $100 million due in 2019. Due to the timing of when the shares were issued, they had very little impact on our share count for the earnings-per-share in the quarter, but will impact shares outstanding going forward.","During the second quarter, we repurchased $74.1 million in common stock, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $112.9 million. We expect to continue opportunistically reproaching shares in the open market, and now expect to exceed our previously communicated target of $150 million for the year.","Our full year repurchases could offset the shares issued in connection with the Power Rangers acquisition depending on market conditions. Actual shares outstanding at quarter end were $127.5 million and $565.1 million remained available in our current share repurchase authorization.","Hasbro's balance sheet remains strong. Both our debt-to-EBITDA any EBITDA to interest\u2019s ratios at 2.0 and 9.1 respectively are favorable to our targets. Receivables decreased 13% and days sales outstanding decreased to 74 days.","Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, receivables declined 10%. While Hasbro revenues were down point-of-sale increased and retail inventory of Hasbro product declined during the quarter. Our owned inventory increased primarily in the U.S. to support greater retailer activation in the second half of the year.","Foreign exchange decreased the inventory value by $12.5 million. In Europe, inventory is down at retail and at Hasbro. We are through the first half of the year, which is the period when we anticipated the greatest disruption to our business.","Now the real work begins. Our teams around the world are executing the biggest quarters of our year, including the holiday season. We are collaborating with retailers to activate our joint plans and the important toy and game categories, not just for successful 2018, but for many years to come.","Our teams will be focused on managing costs in the year, we've lost a significant customer and faced geographic challenges. At the same time, we strategically investing to ensure we have the brands, entertainment and skill sets to be successful for years to come.","We will now open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. First question is from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please state your questions.","Michael Ng","Good morning. Thanks for the question. I have one for Brian and one for Deb. First for Brian, it looks like the Wizards of the Coast and MONOPOLY revenue increased by $40 million combined, that\u2019s a pretty meaningful acceleration, especially Q-on-Q. I was just wondering if you could help size the outperformance, whether that was from Dominaria versus Amonkhet or D&D and then I have a follow up for Deb.","Brian Goldner","Sure. Well clearly we have seen great growth in both MAGIC: THE GATHERING and Monopoly. And for MONOPOLY, there are a couple of different initiatives that are going on there. We saw the gamer addition that began earlier this year, it\u2019s continued to perform at a very high level, and then we launch the cheaters addition just recently and it\u2019s off to a great start that will roll out nationally in the next couple of weeks.","For MAGIC: THE GATHERING storytelling has always been the focus of the brand and in fact in the second quarter Dominaria performed at a very high level. The reception to Dominaria was very strong and we\u2019ve continued to see great uptake in gamers and an increase in new gamers coming on board, which is fantastic.","For the rest of the year, you'll see some new launches in Q3 and then again in Q4, we\u2019re returning to some of the favorite territories for our games, fans. We continue to listen to our gamers and hear their feedback, and we\u2019re also seeing in addition, the great increased in interest and the positive feedback for Magic Arena. We\u2019ve now had more than a million people sign up for the closed beta and making great progress there, and we continue to get great feedback and the KPIs were quite good.","So both brands are certainly contributing and we\u2019re going to support those brands with additional initiatives for the remainder of the year.","Michael Ng","Great, thanks. And Deb, sorry if I missed this, but could you comment on how much the with Toys\u201cR\u201dUs and ex Toys\u201cR\u201dUs POS was up a global U.S. and international. And sorry, just Brian a follow-up, could you comment on with the margin differential looks like for MTG Arena versus the traditional card set. Are we talking hundreds of basis points or thousands of basis points better? Thank you.","Deborah Thomas","So from a POS standpoint, we did say that PO, global POS was up in the quarter and year-to-date with Toys\u201cR\u201dUs and without Toys\u201cR\u201dUs it was down a smidgen the quarter but up year-to-date.","Michael Ng","And Brian?","Brian Goldner","Yes so, if you look at the business, obviously MAGIC is very profitable business for us and we haven't communicated the difference, but clearly we\u2019re investing in Arena right now, so you have the software investments and we want to continue to build and launch the brand successfully, but over time, clearly the software is accretive margin to the analog game.","Michael Ng","Great. Thank you, both.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.","Stephanie Wissink","Thanks. Good morning everyone. I just want to follow-up on Michael question regarding the gaming business and Magic Arena. Brian, could you talk a little bit about that platform and that software investment. Is it possible, you could leverage some of that for other properties in the future?","Brian Goldner","Well, we are certainly investing and continue to iterate for Arena. It\u2019s very exciting to see as we are bringing on more capability to the number of people signing up in the closed beta and that our intention is we\u2019ll launch Magic Arena this year, but then we\u2019ll add to that a suite of other games around our MAGIC: THE GATHERING business as well. Dungeons and Dragons, which was also up in the quarter continues to see new gamers come on board at double-digit levels. And I think we are building the capability of the company across a number of different dimensions and face-to-face gaming in our analog games business and role-playing games.","And then of course you know in the digital gaming arena, both \u2013 both in MAGIC: THE GATHERING, Wizards of the Coast, but also in mobile games. And we said that over time, as we had doubled the size of MAGIC: THE GATHERING over years, we felt that there was an opportunity to continue to grow that brand and overtime to double it again, and it's going to come from the suite of games that Chris and his team are leading, both the analog side with growth as well as these additional new digital games.","Stephanie Wissink","Thank you. Deb, if I could just ask one follow up on your operating margin commentary. I think on the first quarter call you said you would expect to achieve operating profit margins in line with 2017s level of 15.6%. On this call today, you said you thought you could approach last year's level. So might just be a small tweak in the wording, but could you maybe help us think about how your thinking about the operating margin target level for the year? Thank you.","Deborah Thomas","Sure, Steff. On \u2013 there was a slight change, and what we\u2019re seeing is just some pressures on some of our gross margin items as we go forward. So while we say that and we look forward, you know, we think the teams executed very well this quarter. Our inventory at retail is down in every virtually every region. You know our held inventory is up and it's up to meet primarily in the U.S. to meet the expected demand for the rest of the year. However, we think that there could be just a bit of pressure on that, but most, we could see the levels of last year, but most importantly, we still firmly believe that we\u2019re set up growth in operating profit after this disruption from Toys\u201cR\u201dUs kind of gets worked fully out of our system.","Stephanie Wissink","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Arpine Kocharyan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Arpine Kocharyan","Hi, thank you good morning. In terms order book for the back half, would it be possible to quantify how much competitors are absorbing currently in terms of what you actually have on the order book, and then I have a quick follow-up question on operating margin.","Brian Goldner","Well Arpine, are you asking what our retailers are taking or do you say competitors?","Arpine Kocharyan","Right. It seems to me that initial interest was given by end of August in terms of big retailers in terms of what you're looking at linear feed today, what they've committed in terms of absorption from Toys\u201cR\u201dUs. What they are adding in linear feed, any color for the backup would be helpful.","Brian Goldner","Sure. While we are making significant and meaningful plans to capitalize on the opportunity with our retailers. Clearly, our major partners that we've been working with for years are stepping up in a number of different ways and that we are very excited about the plans that the team has put together in order for them to execute a share recapture plan recognizing the new U.S. alone. There's a $3.5 billion retail opportunity across the industry.","And we have seen good industry growth year-to-date, so we expect that we \u2013 our retailers are excited about the opportunity and teams executing. I would say that between our major retailers that will -- are making plans and are stepping up, and the additional online opportunity as well as converge retail omni-channel opportunities and then some new retailers who are in many cases focused on specific audiences, whether that be gamers or fans or in the sporting-goods area, that you could see promotions and linear footage is similar to year ago.","Now we\u2019ve said, we expect to make significant progress this year, but we\u2019re not suggesting that we are going to make up all the difference of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs this year. Because of course, we want to partner with all of our retailers to ensure that we not only get this great growth in their business but that that growth is sustainable over time so that we can be successful together as we continue to grow our business in the industry.","Arpine Kocharyan","Right, right now that\u2019s helpful. And then just back to the operating profit margin, first half is obviously down, that would imply for you to come in flat year-over-year that would have to imply that back half has to be up something like 200 basis points. Is it that your Toys\u201cR\u201dUs disruption, your expectation from Toys\u201cR\u201dUs disruption is less? Or is it that there is some mix that's happening in the back half that gives you confidence, you can make up that operating profit margin differential for the back half?","Brian Goldner","Let me comment and I know Deb would comment as well. We have a lot of new initiatives coming in the second half of the year. We have a lot of new products. And we talk about our NERF business and NERF Fest we commented on. The lot of new product innovations, seven new blasters supporting 37 different markets across all the segments of NERF, so lot of innovative product coming into the marketplace. Obviously NERF enjoys strong operating margin given that's a franchise brand. We've seen great growth in BABY ALIVE. We've seen growth in our gaming portfolio.","We continue to believe our games business will perform at a high level. So the mix certainly is beneficial as we continue to grow in these areas. And then as some of our issues continue to dissipate we work through the retail inventories and we work with our retailers again to build programs, all of that has a benefit and gives us leverage and operating margin.","Deborah Thomas","We are seeing some continued retail disruption particularly outside the U.S. and that's been impacting some our credit decisions and in some of the emerging markets as well where we've not been extending the credit. So, we still believe that we still strive for that profitable growth that Hasbro has been about for the past several years. You hear us talk about all the time. This year, there's just disruption because of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs and we continue to watch the retail environment, but fundamentally we still believe in a very focused on operating profit growth after we work through this disruption.","Arpine Kocharyan","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Badishkanian","Thanks. Just few questions on Europe which is a little bit soft. Is it basically in line with the expectations and how much of the impact was from Toys\u201cR\u201dUs versus the retail dynamics there? Then also I think you mentioned NPD for the industry was down in the first half. How does the industry compared to Hasbro's POS?","Brian Goldner","On the industry side the industry was up year to-date about 6% and if you take our business we were up similarly year-to-date. When you take out the impact between Easter to Easter. So, in Europe our sales decline was greater than the industry and it was really driven the couple \u2013 there are couple of markets where the industry was down particularly in the UK and in France as was our business and we continue to work through that. I think was heartening if you look at the lineup is our retail inventories are down and our shipments are down far more than our sell-through. So we've been able to get to a better place where we have cleaner retail channels and now new initiatives coming in for the second half of the year. And so I see that the team making great progress partnering with retailers and set up well for a good second half.","Greg Badishkanian","And so that basically this is going according to expectations and did you mention Toys\"R\"Us impact?","Brian Goldner","Yes. The Toys\u201cR\u201dUs, remember the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs liquidated in -- Toys\u201cR\u201dUs liquidated in the UK and then in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, there's a new owner. And then in France, Spain and Poland we have almost no activity but no new owners, so our expectation is that that business goes away. And that what's going on in Europe. So there's the impact across a number of different markets. Then Deb mentioned there are some credit terms that we had to work out in some of the markets and particularly in our emerging-market business we want to ensure that we're working with new retailers that they can only take product but pay us for that product and that's been part of the process as we go through growth in the changing retail landscape where you have the acceleration of online retailing and omni channel retail and you do have certain retailers who are landlocked and unable to compete multi-nationally across Europe and so their at a disadvantage versus online retailers who have access to the entire EU. And so those are the dynamics that we're seeing shift and change and that's how we're partnering with different retailers to ensure that we have a good mix and the right programs through the holiday.","Greg Badishkanian","Thanks for the color.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays Bank. Please state your question.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Brian Goldner","Good morning.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi. So you guys have given us some color as to where you're now and how do you think a bit about the rest of the year? But admittedly it's still a bit difficult to model? So I'm just wondering do you think that second quarter revenue declines will be the worst of the year, Deb, I know you said the worst is now behind? But I did want some help thinking through that clearly with Toys\u201cR\u201dUs liquidation complete in the U.S., the worst is behind, seems like Europe there been has some lingering and also I don't want to take the U.S. too for granted because how much inventory do you think is currently being stuck in consumers pantries as they took advantage of the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs liquidation which could affect holiday period?","Brian Goldner","Let me comment on the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs, the discussion about pantry. I'd say that remember that when Toys\u201cR\u201dUs was liquidating they didn't have access to any of the new initiatives that were coming for the second half of the year. We also have two big entertainment initiatives that come in a Spider-Man movie as well as our Transformers Bumblebee movie. The home entertainment windows come with new product around Avengers. We have additional product that's comes in the second half for Black Panther. So there's a lot of new product initiatives I noted, the new product initiatives for NERF and BABY ALIVE and really across the board. So that's not all -- that wasn't all at Toys\u201cR\u201dUs and certainly now we're working with our retailers on new product and new initiatives.","Deborah Thomas","And we've said from the beginning Felicia you're right that we felt the biggest disruption would be in the early part of the year. From Toys\u201cR\u201dUs, so I'm not going to comment on whether we expect Q3 or Q4 to be up, but we think the biggest percentage impact certainly from the decline is behind us, because we're going into the bigger quarters of the year. Everything gets kind of magnified in the first and second quarter. So we think after this year the disruption in total should be behind us which is really what we're focusing on.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Helpful. Thank you. And then, Brian, as you talk about your new retailer initiatives, I was just wondering if you could call out for us how much of that will be online versus brick-and-mortar? And then also how much of the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs business do you think transition for the other retailers? And how much do you think is lost permanently?","Brian Goldner","I really don't think long-term that that business is loss as the result of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs going from the marketplace. The reason in part is that Toys\u201cR\u201dUs for us wasn't a retailer, there been some discussion out there that it was a more profitable retailer, that's not the case. In fact we can work with all of our other retailers and incentivized to do that. We're agnostic about how we grow. I think you're going to see linear footage expand this holiday as it has in past holidays because people are very excited about giving fans and families the opportunity to shop and have that wonderful Christmas holiday experience and give kids and families the opportunity to see product on display and immersive entertainment experiences at retail.","Certainly there will be increased online programs and omni channel programs. Our team is working on number of content to commerce initiatives and other ways of connecting. And clearly every retail visit is been informed by at least three quarters of them are being informed by some online shopping as well where people are trying to determine what it is they're interested in. They may have look at a short video or some piece of content or search for the product. So I think what we're really talking about and what we've try to mention a lot is that this idea of converge retail is really taking hold not only in the U.S. but around the world.","And so what we're providing and the teams are working on is that digital engagement and the in-store engagement that marries up, that connects consumers to our experiences where consumer insights, innovations and those story led initiatives whether it be some bespoke content or user generated content because our fans are so engaged all contributes to the to the process of selling.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Helpful. And then just a finish on Power Rangers, as we begin to model that into the future, should we expect to be higher margin property versus your total operating margin?","Brian Goldner","It should -- Power Rangers over time and we've said that the team will have the full array of brand blueprint initiatives by 2020. And by 2020 and beyond it should look more like a Franchise Brand.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay.","Brian Goldner","Obviously it's a Franchise Brand in the making because it's new to us and we need a little time to work through 2019 transition year. But yes, in fact one of the points of rationale to acquire the brand is that it is a brand that should operate like a Franchise Brand in operating profit terms which as we know our Franchise Brands enjoy higher than company average operating margin, and also a significant opportunity for growth given where the brand had been most recently.","Felicia Hendrix","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Crum","Thanks. Good morning everyone. Brian, I wonder if you could comment on the potential for a tariff and any update on what Hasbro's doing in anticipation of that? And I think this is very topical little over year ago and you made the decision to move PLAY-DOH manufacturing to the U.S. And I think at the time you said you hope to have more then 3% of your manufacturing outside of China. So just want to get an update there? And then I have a follow-up.","Brian Goldner","Yes. Thanks. So we do have 30% of our manufacturing today outside of China and we'll head toward 40% over just the next few years. We're manufacturing in a number of territories. For the U.S., we source 25% of U.S. revenues in the United States in manufacturing locally across five different states. We'll add to that, the PLAY-DOH manufacturing that will come this fall we're gearing up for that now. And so that should add that to our revenues garnered from U.S. manufacturing for the U.S. And so again, the U.S. business overall still receives 35% of its products outside of China, but 65% from Chinese manufacturing, and again we are moving more production outside of China. We found some great new partners and territories that provide very high quality product that can meet with our specification.","And in terms of the tariffs we've been working with and talking to the administration and our congressional delegations to ensure we're communicating just how terrible an impact the ongoing tariff or trade war would be. Thus far we've only seen nonmaterial changes to the tariff schemes of other countries that don't really impact our business. Our toy business is not been part of the 303 designation that is currently been put in place. But we continue to monitor the situation and we continue to talk and firmly believe in a free trade environment as the best course for our company and for the industry.","Drew Crum","Got it. Okay. Very helpful. And then going back to the Power Rangers side from your margin commentary and the guidance on the amortization, any detail you can provide in terms of revenue run rate you're expecting and I guess separate from that what are your plans in terms of content development and whether its television programming or feature films?","Brian Goldner","Yes. So we're really excited about the new series that's just in early development. Obviously, we're working with the team now on the creative, but it was already underway by the time we had made the transaction. And as of the Beast Wars for TV series that we'll launch next spring, we have an arrangement with Nickelodeon through 2021 for the U.S. and then the TV show is distributed more than 150 territories globally. We're then working in earnest that on the next TV series and how you reinvent the brand for 2020 and beyond. We do expect to also have motion pictures over the medium term, so we'll add and have new movie development as well, and we really do feel this brand is very right for creative development, for engaging with our fans, kids and families audience.","And I think you're going to see some really exciting product from the team already. Just the 2019 lineup is a very robust. We were developing that as a licensee at first and we've shown that to retailers. They're very excited. And you have to recognize that a lot of the prior product and business was being done with few retailers and certainly not in a global footprint. So both from the depth and breadth of retail as well as the breadth of geographic territories where the product will now exist both gives us an opportunity for growth.","Drew Crum","And Brain, would you guys do the film in-house or is that something that you would outsource or partner with a larger studio?","Brian Goldner","Yes. You know again we have a great production team that's come on board. And as part of the acquisition we brought over the team that's been working on the creative. We're so excited that they're on board. We're also excited the Haim is continued as creative consultant. And if you recall the movie that was done in 2017 was done in partnership with a studio, so our expectation is we would do that in partnership with the studio and distributed it similarly recognizing that we'll pick the optimal budget and the optimal creative to ensure that it's a profitable endeavor for both us and our studio partner and that we make those investments prudently around content recognizing. We understand what the return looks like. We did it successfully with the MY LITTLE PONY movie in animation. And this one we of course would share with a studio partner.","Drew Crum","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Jaime Katz","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I'm curious given that some of the working capital metrics that you guys report have improved? Are you guys still sticking with the 600 and 700 million in operating cash flow expectations for the year? Or do you may be think you can come in at high end or potentially even exceed that number?","Deborah Thomas","No. We still believe that our cash flow will be between 600 to 700 million and just given the pressure of on the year, we would probably be closer to the bottom end of that range than the top end.","Jaime Katz","Okay. And then, can you remind me where the Paramount Bumblebee asset would be? Does that go into the other asset category and then you amortize it over time? I can't exactly recall the accounting process of that asset?","Deborah Thomas","Yes. It's in our other long-term assets and you'll see that that we had the payment go out in the cash flow this quarter, our contribution, our cash flow is up for program production cash flow this quarter. And then it will be amortized over time. There won't be amortization associated with that until for 2019 though.","Jaime Katz","Excellent. Thank you.","Brian Goldner","The next question is from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Tim Conder","Thank you. Just a couple of questions. You've touched a little bit on Star Wars, but maybe what you're doing or potentially DISNEY is doing, as Star Wars appears to have kind of maybe hit a little bit of a wall of late. And then any comments on DISNEY PRINCESS? And then maybe Brian shifting to TRANSFORMERS, you commented someone on that obviously the difficult of year-over-year comp, but then the shift out of some of the properties. Are you looking leaning more towards a reboot or maybe just a little more colors you can give to us looking at over the next year or two here with the franchise?","Brian Goldner","Sure. Star Wars in revenue terms was up a bit in the quarter and we're seeing POS up in the high single-digits in the U.S. even ex Toys\u201cR\u201dUs and up higher if you include Toys\u201cR\u201dUs. We're also engaging across a number dimensions not only kid oriented product but the fan oriented products performing quite strongly in Black Series. We had a very successful launch of our HasLab product which was the sale barge if you recall where we crowd-funded that and we ended up with nearly twice as many subscribers as we had required in order to move forward with that product.","And then of course Episode nine comes December 20, 2019. What I've said all along we still believe which is that with Star Wars having more and more regular entertainment and visibility to that entertainment that the brand would contribute at a more sustained higher-level and that's what we're seeing is that in fact Star Wars will probably look similar to a year ago and the days of surging in a movie year and shrinking in a non-movie year probably behind us instead it just becomes a really strong contributor year for year and quite good for us.","In terms of TRANSFORMERS, really given the timing of Bumblebee and the fact that we were able to put this new movie together that came directly out of all the work we had done in the writers room with all of these great creative stewards and it contributed to the thought process of future TRANSFORMERS, we were then able to get Bumblebee out for Christmas this year. And as you know the home entertainment window will then follow by a number of months, so really would end up in 2019 certainly in the first half of 2019. So to put another movie right on top of the home entertainment window for the Bumblebee movie really didn't make sense.","And then you combine that with the fact that we have a new partnership with some great new leadership at Paramount in Jim Gianopulos and with Godfrey and the team they are fantastic. And Andrew Gumpert is running that business for them. And we felt that we had an opportunity to bring in new creative to think about the brand both including the current chronology and outside the chronology recognize that Bumblebee is back in the 80s, that's a very important time period for both the brand as well for fans and we wanted to tell some new stories. And so it gives us the opportunity to tell really new stories around the brand and we have more than 30 years worth of cannon and we continue to invest in new comics and new animated series to ensure that we're making those equity investments in new mythology in cannon for the brand. And a lot of opportunity, lots of different direction we can go in for the creative and we're looking at a number of different ways we may go into the future.","Tim Conder","Okay, okay, helpful there. And DISNEY PRINCESS and then maybe one for Deb or Brian whoever wants to take this last one. The company inventories just wanted to revisit that. Deb you said it was primarily tilted towards and plan for the U.S., is that to maybe offset some potential tariff risk bringing that in earlier, smoothing out maybe the seasonal surge and freightenings, given that the challenges on freight for everybody? Or is there something else going on especially I guess given that POS continues to shift closer to consumer takeaway in Q4?","Brian Goldner","Yes. So let me comment on Princess and then I'll comment on inventory and certainly, Deb can also give you great detail. The Princess business is down year-on-year obviously we\u2019re up against some very strong comps from year ago where we had great entertainment for Beauty and the Beast and MOANA and other television oriented properties. And again we're innovating in the product line. You're going to see some great new product innovation for the holiday period this year and we'll continue to see the promotion around airings of airings of Frozen and Olaf's Frozen Adventure.","And then we go into 2019, we're very excited of course that the next Frozen movie comes next holiday and we'll build the business around that and obviously incredibly excited for that as a key driver of that property. In terms of inventory we've talked about the fact that we got beyond some of the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs liquidation and we have gotten completely beyond the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs with liquidation in the U.S. And now the team is working on bringing in new product for these third and fourth quarters. We've said that we probably hold a little bit more inventory because again we want to have the inventory on hand domestically to deploy closer to the time of sell-through.","Also we're working through with our retailers, because as you move from brick-and-mortar retail where you have longer weeks supply to online retailer where you have about half as many weeks supply. When you do on omni-channel it sort of a hybrid of the two, so it sort of in between, and we want to make sure we have product on hand, so that's part of the move that you're seeing here. And if you looked at our DI inventory or the product that's been direct ship versus domestic, you're seeing a bit of a shift in percentage terms moving a little bit more to domestic versus the direct import business.","And that's really all you're seeing there. So predominately that inventory is all. In the U.S. there is a bit of growth and inventory internationally as we've opened up the Indian market as well as Japan and so we need to service those markets and a couple other places around the world where we're seeing a great growth, but it's almost all out in the U.S.","Tim Conder","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Hi. I was wondering if you could comment on MY LITTLE PONY and how that's doing, and if you are still seeing some benefits to that Brand Franchise following the movie? And then just in general could you comment on your growth portfolio just in terms of really not having a lot of owned brand in that area. Of course you have the licensed DISNEY PRINCESS, but do you feel that you have what you wanted in terms of own brands in the girls area? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","The MY LITTLE PONY brand has certainly benefited from the movie home entertainment windows and now the movies move from home entertainment into a lot of the streaming services, its performing quite well and we continue to see in markets around the world where the streaming is taking place and the brand continues to hold up quite well and the POS is good. Revenues were down a little bit in the quarter, but again, POS is quite strong as we move to the disruption and the liquidation at Toys\u201cR\u201dUs.","Interestingly, as we've now gotten our TV series on the air on CCTV which is Chinese Television, we're seeing some great growth of MY LITTLE PONY in the China market behind that and you should expect to continue to see momentum in our brand as we've just launched the season eight in television and that will roll out around the world. And then again in the future we would expect to do another MY LITTLE PONY animated feature film, because again it contributed quite nicely and it's also a great way to tell story around that brand.","We do have a great line up in our girl's portfolio. We continue to partner with the Walt DISNEY Company on Descendants, PRINCESS and FROZEN, and we're very excited about what's to come there. Obviously, we've also launched some fun new properties that appeal to both girls and boys and LOST KITTIES and LOCK STARS which are off to great starts. This is an area where we're using social listening and consumer insights to move quickly into the market. And again over time, FURREAL FRIENDS has been a contributor. So we again feel like we have a good lineup in our girls business.","And then remember of course that BABY ALIVE is a new Franchise Brand. It's growing quite substantially. Lots of new innovation coming for the brand and performing at a very high level with a crazy amount of user generated content supporting that brand, in fact the statistics are there's been more than 7 billion views of user generated content for the BABY ALIVE franchise and so are really engaging with our fans online and in a modern story led way for that brand. So we feel good about our portfolio.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Thanks. Can I also ask about just following on the questions about the tariffs? If there were to be tariff, I mean, you've outlined how \u2013 what your exposure is manufacturing wise. But is there flexibility around pricing for the holiday toys? Or are those pricing decisions already kind of locked in with retailers in terms of the major programs. Would you have flexibility to take pricing if there were tariffs imposed in the second half?","Deborah Thomas","We do have met \u2013 we have met with most of our retailers to look at the new line that's coming in for the second half of the year. We could always take pricing late in the game, but it is more challenging at this time of the year. As we said before over the long-term we can always reengineer product to take some of the cost out to keep the price point optimal for the consumer, but on the short-term it would have some level of impact to the consumer if tariffs were imposed.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Handler","Yes. Thanks for taking my question and good morning. Two questions for you. First, Brian in terms of DISNEY PRINCESS, I'm just curious how big a lift did you get from Beauty and the Beast, the live-action film. As we look to 2019 not only do we have a lot in as a live-action film next year but there's also Dumbo and Lion King and is there a way for you guys to get involved with either of those two films with any type of product?","Brian Goldner","Yes. The teams working on something on few of those live-action films, I won't comment yet on what those are. But in terms of the PRINCESS and FROZEN business, clearly Beauty and the Beast had a major contribution. Obviously we know how important storytelling is to fans and families across all brands, how it connects with character and story and certainly then enables us to use the insights around the story and innovation to build great product lines.","So Beauty and the Beast contributed as did MOANA, as does Tangled then another properties as the Descendents, DISNEY DESCENDANTS on the DISNEY Channel original movie \u2013 as an DISNEY Channel original movie also contributed and we'd seen great continued sell-through of that product line that in the Descendents product line.","And so no story is clearly important. Obviously in this period we're up against the fact that year ago there were a lot of those entertainment initiatives and so we are very excited about 2019 for Aladdin as well certainly for FROZEN that comes near holiday 2019.","Eric Handler","Great. And just follow-up question on POWER RANGERS; wondered if you could sort of -- as we think about modeling this business what sort of -- is there a baseline revenue for POWER RANGERS and the additional brands acquired from Saban? And then when do certain licenses for toy product come back to you? Is that all next year. How do you think that? And what about renegotiating other consumer product licenses?","Brian Goldner","Yes. I would have you think about POWER RANGERS overtime in terms of the proportionality of our toy and game business to consumer product licensing to look similar to what we do for TRANSFORMERS or MY LITTLE PONY. So would have a very robust toy and game line from us, and then a very robust consumer products coming from a number of different partners. I would imagine overtime to develop a similar size, number of partners to what we have for TRANSFORMERS or MY LITTLE PONY by 2020 and beyond. And 2019 you're absolutely right there's a transition period, the prior company's product is in market through March and then our product launch is either in March or April depending on where you are in the world.","And so we get about nine months in market next year, but recognize there will be some amount of prior product that has to get move-through and sell-through in the early to mid part of 2019. So again, I think the best benchmark for our first full year effort would be 2020 where we're also able to activate entertainment and also work with our licensing partners. Many of the licensing partners that worked with Saban or partners that we work with before on PONY and TRANSFORMERS and so we think that the transition will be relatively seamless and we're also bringing on some key personnel from the POWER RANGER brand to ensure that that's the case.","Eric Handler","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Gerrick Johnson","Good morning. Thank you. I have three questions. First on, I think that it's coming, it's a clarification of POS. As you know we look at POS in term of retail dollars and I know you and Mattel always comment on POS and wholesale terms. So can you just talk about the U.S. and global POS at retail in dollars excluding Toys\u201cR\u201dUs?","Brian Goldner","Yes. If you take \u2013 if you look at -- take the data that we get recognized that the data that we have in POS and for the business is based on wholesale because that's what we get paid for that product. And then the up-and-down pricing that a retailer may exercise at any given period is really up to them using the discounts and allowances that we provide within the P&L of that property or that brand.","So if you take global POS without Toys\u201cR\u201dUs, North America were up both year to-date which remember takes out the \u2013 we're up high single-digits that takes out the impact of the fact that Easter came in the first quarter this year versus the second quarter of last year and that's an important distinction. And then even if you look in the calendar within the quarter which means you have both -- you take out both the benefit of the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs, POS as well as the Easter we're still up in North America, but by less.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. Now, again just be clear. Is that wholesale dollars or retail dollars you're talking about? Because retail dollars we look at that because we can see if things have been discounted. We can tell that in wholesale dollars, so that POS at high single digits in the first time. Is that in retail dollars or wholesale dollars? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","That's our wholesale, the way we can measure it is through what we sold that product for and what we're getting paid for and how much of that products dollar at our price went through the register because that's what we get transmitted from our retailers. The fact that they may have discounted that product we've still gotten paid to whatever that prices. If they've discounted it below that price that's been because they've used some allowance or something else that we provided which is the calculation from our gross sales which we don't report to our net revenues which we do report, so we've already taken out the dollars when we report net revenue, the dollars that we provide to retailers in discounts and allowances, so it's a very fair way to look at the sell-through of our products based on the fact that that's how we get paid.","Deborah Thomas","And Brian I would just add to that. That's why we look at it with and without Toys\u201cR\u201dUs because we know certainly in the U.S. Toys\u201cR\u201dUs had an impact because of the liquidation they were doing. However we provided no further discount dollars for that liquidation.","Brian Goldner","Exactly. So as I said take out Toys\u201cR\u201dUs and eliminate the comparisons of -- in other words compare yourself to a quarter a year ago where there was Easter to this year where there was no Easter and our North American business in the quarter was still up.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. I'll move on to the next one here. You talk a little bit about the MY LITTLE PONY movie and it contributed quite nicely. Can you talk more specifically about the economics from that movie, the financing and participation? Did that hit your targets?","Brian Goldner","Yes. The way the movie worked was we produced this movie with third-party studio. We had it distributed by Lionsgate. They took a distribution fee. We then created a toy and game line and we participated in the toys and games sales and earnings from the toys and games. The consumer products where we had hundreds of licensees and the royalty income that came from that, as well as from the movie after paying the distribution fee and allowing for recruitment of the marketing, so that the total economic value was positive for our company and continues to be positive as the content continues to run through home entertainment which actually performed even better than our expectation and now is what is streaming on a number of different platforms and we'll continue to be a story asset that will run through different territories.","And of course this really raised halo for the brand. And then of course we're using beyond that using the television series now that's airing around the world including with CCTV in China based on a growing relationship with them across TRANSFORMERS and MY LITTLE PONY and that's also beneficial. So the content is driving profitable growth for that brand and again disruption from Toys\u201cR\u201dUs certainly has interrupted the appearance of what the sales look like its down a bit because of all the changes in the market but our the period we've seen the POS growth.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay, Brian, we understand all that, the merchandising and the toy line. You're going to get that revenue anyway no matter who does the movie. So my question was specific, specific on the economics of the movie itself. Is it worthwhile for you to be doing this? Are you generating more economic profit doing it this way then another third party, that's why I'm trying to get at, understand all the merchandising aspect early [ph]? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Sure. So in fact doing the movie is beneficial to us economically. First of all, we get to not only pick the price point for the movie and produce it ourselves, but we receive producer fees for having produced the film. Then we get to calendarize the movie and to work with our retail partners to ensure that they are able to help us make that property and A-level property at their retail destination. If we weren't able to do that, if we were in a third-party arrangement, we have less control around the creative and around the price point. And so in fact, contributing to and participating in the franchise economics for film is accretive to the company.","Gerrick Johnson","All right. Great. That\u2019s a great answer. Thank you. And then lastly, just want to ask about franchisee and partner brands. You know they are both down, could you talk about the brands within those categories that were let\u2019s say, challenged and to put it differently an opportunity for improvement, so what was down in those two categories? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Yes, sure. Obviously in franchise Transformers was down, as it was up against year ago movie timing. It -- given your familiarity with that action category wasn't down as much as you would've expected in a -- year after movie. In fact, it\u2019s performed quite nicely and above those normative levels of being down by 50% or something like that. So it\u2019s done quite well given that it has other entertainment. In the quarter I talked about that MY LITTLE PONY was down a bit, but again you're dealing with retail disruption from Toys\u201cR\u201dUs and the loss of that retailer and not shipping new initiatives till the second half of the year. And then NERF was down a bit in shipments again, because that brand was very developed not only at all retail, but certainly at Toys\u201cR\u201dUs and so again you work through the disruption that's temporary, but POS was quite strong, and now we are lining up the second half of the year to be incredibly strong around NERF FEST, which is your call. Garrick last year, it was only in the U.S. and now is rolling out to 37 different countries, given how successful it was a year ago, and we literally have new innovation in every category. We have a new N-Strike Elite. We have a new Mega Thunderhawk. We have new Rival product. We have new Zombie strike product and new Modulus product as well as \u2013 as well as the launch of our Laser Ops product in the second half.","So, bringing innovation back into that brands following the liquidation of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs is perfectly timed for longer-term growth. In Partner brands, we\u2019ve talked about the brands that were down. Obviously TROLLS was down following the movie years. And we\u2019ve said that MARVEL contributed and that DISNEY PRINCESS was down. Obviously BEYBLADE is up, and continues to perform at a high level.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay, and thank you and you forget about over watching us by the way, but thanks for that.","Brian Goldner","Well, Overwatch comes later this year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Susan Anderson with B. Riley FBR. Please proceed with your questions.","Susan Anderson","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, when you look at shelf space either in your existing retailers, and then also new retailers that may be carrying toys now, I guess, with the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs disruption, do you think that you're gaining any space versus your competitors? In other words, I guess, once Toys\u201cR\u201dUs is gone, do you feel like you'll have more shelf space out there the same or less versus with Toys\u201cR\u201dUs?","Brian Goldner","Yes, I\u2019d said that given the work we\u2019ve doing with our major partners, that we\u2019ve been in business for years, and the new opportunities for online and omni-channel combined with some retailers that will focus on some specific audiences. I actually expect that the amount of promotion and linear footage available to the toy industry for the holiday could be very similar to last year's holiday.","Now given that we have one of the broadest portfolios of brands, where we focus on incredible innovation across a gaming portfolio in franchise brands and partner brands with incredible entertainment coming for the second half of the year in home entertainment as well as theatrical films from TRANSFORMERS and also from Spider-Man, the fact is our strong portfolio, with our commitment to innovation and storytelling from us and our partners puts us in a very good position not only for holiday 2018, but as we return to growth in 2019 and beyond. And we absolutely believe we will return to growth in 2019 and beyond with expanding operating profit margins over time and we can see how the business is developing along those lines.","Susan Anderson","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And just one follow-up on the inventory. I know you guys have talked about holding back inventory, so you want to compete with Toys\u201cR\u201dUs. Just curious have you guys started to ship any of that? And should we expect inventory to be more in line with sales by third quarter? Or is it really more fourth quarter?","And then I guess, on Europe too, excluding the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs pressure, how should we think about that cleaning up in terms of the timing?","Brian Goldner","Yes, So in Europe inventories, our inventories are down and retail inventories are down. And I would expect that we\u2019ll continue to manage our inventories relative to the demand in third and fourth quarter in Europe recognize that we had a lot of markets where Toys\u201cR\u201dUs existed and we do have the business of working through with our brick-and-mortar retailers. Their plans relative to the acceleration of online and omni channel retailers in the region.","In the U.S. I\u2019m not going to comment on whether inventory is going to be up or down in the fourth quarter. The goal of course is to ensure that our vast portfolio gets supported across all of these new initiatives that we have. And certainly, we will hold more of our own inventory and deploy a closer to those sale surges, we described that before and why that's important, so that we can deploy the inventory to the retailers into the partners that have the greatest levels of sell through so that we can match inventory to demand, even better than we have in the past.","And I think that's something we\u2019ve learned as the market continues to rapidly develop and evolve continuing on board that capability and to have that personnel and you\u2019ve seen us take some changes to the composition of our personnel and add capabilities to modernize those aspects of our business.","Susan Anderson","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of the question and answer session.

We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.","I would now like to introduce Brian Goldner. Brian?","Brian Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. First quarter\u2019s revenue operating profit and net earnings growth reflected a commitment to our strategy and the inherent benefits of focusing on Hasbro\u2019s franchise brands, key strategic partner brands and our ability to execute around the blueprint. The global Hasbro teams continue to perform at a very high level, delivering innovative brand experiences informed by global consumer insights and supported by compelling story telling. We are building deep and relevant brand connections with consumers across broad demographics and geographies.","First quarter revenues grew 16% and 20% absent FX, driven by Hasbro franchise brands, partner brands and strength across geographies. Hasbro\u2019s global teams delivered an extremely strong quarter with double digit revenue and operating profit growth in the U.S. and Canada and international segments. Internationally, we grew revenues despite the foreign exchange environment with strong gains in many developed economies. When adjusted for foreign exchange, we posted double digit revenue growth in all major geographic regions. Emerging market revenues increased 6% absent FX, and we continue to expect these markets to grow revenues double digits absent FX for 2016.","While consumer demand remains robust, we are beginning to see an impact on some retailers from the ongoing economic challenges. Global point of sale increased 27% in the quarter behind double digit growth in all major regions, North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific; and double digit growth in both toys and games. In the U.S. point of sale increased double digits in all categories boys, girls, games and preschool with growth in franchise and partner brands. In addition, according to NPD through the first two months of the year, we continued to gain share in nearly every major market. Overall, franchise brand revenues grew in the quarter. In total, toy and game revenues for franchise brands increased 9%, absent FX, increasing 12% in the U.S. and Canada segment and 6% in the international segment.","The first quarter had several unique and expected comparison challenges within the franchise brands which don\u2019t change our positive outlook for the full year. Q1 was a tough comparison within the entertainment and licensing category. Franchise brand revenues in the segment declined this year versus last year when we recorded revenue from multiyear digital streaming deal. The agreement includes MY LITTLE PONY, LITTLEST PET SHOP and TRANSFORMERS programming. The segment also had tough comparisons in consumer products and film revenues related to the 2014 Transformers movie recorded last year.","TRANSFORMERS toy and game revenues were also down versus a very strong first quarter of last year when it benefitted from the movie. Franchise brand POS in the quarter was up high-single-digits globally and double-digits in the U.S. more than overcoming the negative TRANSFORMERS comparison.","Within our franchise brands, NERF & PLAY-DOH continued to deliver strong growth. New innovations from NERF including mod Modulus and Rival are performing well and 2016 marks their first full year in the market.","PLAY-DOH continues to drive growth in play sets and compounds. This year, we are launching an entirely new system of play with PLAY-DOH Town that is now available in the U.S. and rolling out internationally throughout 2016. MY LITTLE PONY grew in the U.S. and Canada segment and absent FX in the international segment. We continue to deliver innovative new product, strong licensing programs and compelling entertainment, including the sixth season of MY LITTLE PONY: Friendship is Magic, which began airing March 26th.","In addition, the launch of the new EQUESTRIA GIRLS Mini Dolls! segment is off to a strong start. We are working through some retail inventory within EQUESTRIA GIRLS, but we are optimistic about the initial consumer reaction to our new offering and the overall outlook for MY LITTLE PONY globally.","As I mentioned, TRANSFORMERS revenue represented the most significant decline within our franchise brands for the quarter. New entertainment began late in the first quarter of this year with the second season of TRANSFORMERS: Robots in Disguise on Cartoon Network in the U.S. and currently rolling out internationally.","Machinima and Hasbro are unveiling all new entertainment targeting the older TRANSFORMERS band later this year. We are also actively developing the next chapter of the TRANSFORMERS theatrical stories. In February, Paramount Pictures dated TRANSFORMERS 5 for release on June 23, 2017 with two additional TRANSFORMERS films planned for June of 2018 and 2019. We have global teams of talented individuals working on this multi-year theatrical entertainment and innovation slate.","Overall games revenue was down slightly in the quarter and flat absent FX. PIE FACE continues to be in high demand. We also saw growth in our digital gaming licensing including YAHTZEE, which is being driven by our mobile gaming license with Scopely. DUEL MASTERS, a Japanese trading card game also contributed to growth in the quarter. We are investing to build great gaming experiences in both face-to-face and digital play environments.","Our outlook for MAGIC: THE GATHERING remains positive. The lease schedule fluctuates and revenue timing is story driven, but it is effectively driving engagement with players. We shipped the first set in the Shadows over Innistrad block on April 8th versus a first quarter release last year. It is off to a fabulous start with pre-release attendance of 20% and this validates our change to a two-set block. MAGIC recently achieved the milestone of 1 million active players in our organized play system.","We also have 65,000 players who play in premier events streamed to esports audiences. This is an area we\u2019re going to investing in to both grow, the number of events and the player base. The team at Wizards of the Coast is doing great work to foster both analog and digital play for the MAGIC community. We\u2019re very pleased to have Chris Cocks from Microsoft joining us as President of Wizards of the Coast. As we announced last week, Greg Leeds is leaving Hasbro. We are grateful for his contributions and wish him the best in his new endeavors.","The first quarter also benefited from the strength of our partner brands. Retail and consumer demand for STAR WARS remained very high and at this early stage of the year, we continue to believe 2016 revenues could be in line with last year. STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS was recently release in Home Entertainment and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is scheduled for release on December 16th.","The first quarter also marked the on shelf date for Hasbro\u2019s line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN fashion dolls and small dolls. Initial consumer reaction has been very positive and our approach of offering the entire range of DISNEY PRINCESS is resonating. New content and the all new characters of Moana and Elena of Avalor will further support our innovative products this year.","In addition, Marvel\u2019s Captain America: Civil War will be in theatres on May 6th. We have a robust line and strong planned retail promotional activity supporting this film. The first quarter was a good start to the year, but we know, there is a lot of the year left to deliver. For 2016 and beyond, we have an innovative line of both Hasbro brands and partner brands, and we are investing to deliver the best experiences to retailers and consumers globally. This includes continued strategic investment and further development of our capabilities around the brand blueprint including in storytelling digital gaming and our consumer products licensing efforts.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deb Thomas","Thank you, Brian and good morning everyone. The first quarter was a very good quarter for Hasbro. The strength of our results reflected the continued momentum in our business and strong execution by our global team. We grew revenues, operating profit and earnings, despite the continued negative impact from foreign exchange and challenging economic environment in some international market. We returned $93.2 million in cash to shareholders and ended the quarter with a very strong balance sheet well-positioned to support our 2016 growth outlook.","Looking at our segments for the first quarter 2016, revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 28%. The Boys growth and Preschool categories posted revenue growth while the Games category declined slightly. Hasbro franchise brand revenues increased and partner brands further contributed to growth with revenue increases in STAR WARS, DISNEY PRINCESS, FROZEN and DESCENDANTS as well as YOKAI WATCH. ","U.S. point of sale posted solid double digit growth in all categories and retail inventory continued to be a very good quality. Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 89%, reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by higher expense levels.","International segment revenues grew 13%. Excluding the negative $26.7 million impact from foreign exchange, international segment revenues increased 22%. Revenue in the segment grew in all four product categories Boys, Games, Girls and Preschool. Franchise brand revenues were down slightly as reported but grew absent FX.","Partner brands were also positive contributors including STAR WARS, DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN. Operating profit in the segment increased 50% to $2.9 million. Profit improvement on higher revenues was partially offset by increased expenses year-over-year. During the quarter, we also took a $13.8 million bad debt provision for potentially uncollectable receivable. This was the first significant provision taken since we began our expansion in 2008 into more international territories, notably emerging markets. Overall, we feel we\u2019ve taken the appropriate risks and mange our higher risk accounts very closely.","Current exchange rates in certain regions have changed favorably since the beginning of this year. Although the euro has strengthened, other currencies continued to weaken in the quarter. For the full year, we forecasted an approximate $100 million negative impact from foreign exchange compared to 2015. If rates in particularly euro stay favorable that impact would be much lower.","Entertainment and licensing segment revenues declined 30%. In the first quarter of last year, the segment benefited from a multiyear digital streaming deal for Hasbro Studios television programming. Consumer product licensing and entertainment revenues also declined in the quarter, most notably from the difficult comparison with last year\u2019s Transformers movie related merchandise and revenues. Licensing revenue is generally recorded in arrears and last year\u2019s first quarter reflected the holiday 2014 Transformers movie related revenue. Segment operating profit declined 67%. In addition to lower revenue, we continue to make investments in our consumer products team, digital gaming and storytelling to drive future growth in these higher profit margin revenue sources. These are strategically important capabilities which truly differentiate Hasbro\u2019s brands with both consumers and retailers.","Turning to overall expenses, higher revenues drove improved expense leverage and a 270 basis-point increase in operating profit margin for the quarter. We continue to see growth in partner brands which drive a lower cost of sales to revenue and higher royalty to sales ratios. Both measures were close to flat with last year levels as cost of sales for the quarter was 34.9% of revenues and royalties totaled 8.4%.","Product development dollar growth reflects continued investment in innovation across our brand portfolio including franchise, partner and new brands. Advertising remained approximately flat as a percentage of sales and intangible amortization declined reflecting some of our digital gaining assets becoming fully amortized in the second quarter of last year.","Program production cost amortization was also down in the quarter. In the first quarter of last year, this line reflected the higher revenue and associated amortizations with our streaming deal for Hasbro programming.","SG&A in the quarter was down as a percent of revenues. SG&A dollars increased 12%, primarily due to investments around our brand blueprint, bad debt and higher compensation expense. Our first quarter results support our ability to sustain and grow operating profit levels over time. While achieving this, we continue to make incremental investments in our brands including in the digital ecosystem for MAGIC: THE GATHERING and our IT systems to drive efficiencies and enhance innovation and in our talent and capabilities to execute our brand blueprint. In the first quarter, the strength of our business enabled us to deliver operating profit expansion while investing for future growth.","Turning to our results below operating profit for the quarter, other expense was $2.7 million versus income of $4.7 million last year. Increased profit is associated with our 40% share of the operating income in the Discovery Family channel combined with higher interest income on our investments was more than offset by larger losses from foreign exchange transactions. Underlying tax rate was 26.5%, down from 27% last year and essentially in line with 26.4% for the full year 2015. Diluted earnings per share was $0.38 compared to $0.21 last year.","Our balance sheet remained strong. Cash totaled $1.1 billion at quarter-end. We generated $294 million in operating cash flow during the quarter and $531 million over the past 12 months. During the first quarter, we returned $93.2 million to shareholders, $57.4 million in dividends and $35.8 million in share repurchases.","Our May 16th dividend payment will be the first quarter as a higher dividend rate of $0.51 per share, which the Board increased 11% in February. Receivables at quarter end were up 19% versus the 16% growth in revenues. And DSOs increased two days to 73 days. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, receivables increased approximately 23% versus 20% revenue growth absent FX. Overall, our accounts receivable are in good condition and collections continue to be strong.","Inventories increased 36% versus last year. Adjusting for a negative foreign exchange impact, inventory increased 41%, reflecting the new businesses we\u2019re supporting, the timing of entertainment, and our outlook for 2016. Overall, we believe we have the right amount and quality of inventory at retail and at Hasbro to meet our growth expectations for the year.","Throughout the first quarter, we maintained and improved upon the higher level of performance we delivered last year. While we have a great deal of the year left to go, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the innovation and entertainment driving our brands.","Brian and I are now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead with your questions.","Felicia Hendrix","Hey Brian, I just wanted to touch on a comment that you made in your prepared remarks about some retailers being affected from global economic challenges. I was just wondering, can you elaborate, is that globally, is that U.S., internationally; can you just talk about that comment a little bit more, please?","Brian Goldner","Sure. We are really referring to a few of our retailers in the emerging markets. Deb noted bad debt provision that we took in the quarter. And so, we are just indicating that we had a couple of retailers in the emerging markets that were challenged and where we felt that there was some revenue that would be uncollectable.","Deb Thomas","Consumer take away in those markets still continues to be strong. So, as we look at the emerging markets, we still have that outlook of double digit growth absent FX for the year.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And then in\u2026","Brian Goldner","Yes, this is -- yes, it\u2019s good point, I mean this isn\u2019t consumer related; we\u2019re not talking about the takeaways, and we talked about double digit growth in POS across all of our regions in the quarter, and we had very strong double digit growth throughout our business. And so, again, we are just referring to a few retailers where we took a provision.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful, thank you. And you gave us some nice color on games and puzzles and magic, and it looks like magic with the release in April, versus a first quarter release last year had some tough comp. Just wondering a couple of things in games and puzzles, first, I just wanted to clarify, did magic see growth in the first quarter? And then, also you had a management change in that division. So, I was just wondering if you could talk about the drivers behind that change and what you expect for games and puzzles for the rest of the year?","Brian Goldner","Yes, sure. If you look at our games business, first, I think really very encouraging was our strong double-digit growth in POS in that category for the first quarter. And so, we\u2019ve really seen, both in the U.S. and around the world, double-digit take away and growth in POS. If you look at games within the business, we\u2019ll call it face-to-face gaming was up a bit. But magic was down in the quarter. And we have talked a lot; hopefully people now understand that magic really is release driven, story driven. And therefore, we\u2019ll have ups and downs that may not run seasonally as much as other brands but rather just in response to the story releases and the decks that are released. The change at magic at Wizards of the Coast was planned some time ago. Greg had indicated his desire to go off and do some other things, and we wish him all the best. He\u2019s done a terrific job for us; he was here in Providence and Pawtucket before going to Wizards and he\u2019d run our boys business and he\u2019s been here with us for several years. We\u2019re very excited about Chris Cox coming on-board and he\u2019ll be with us starting in June. And not only is he a Magic: The Gathering player and role playing gamer overall, but he\u2019s also got some tremendous experience, most recently at Microsoft, so has both the analog and digital capability and will continue to drive us in both directions.","Felicia Hendrix","Great, thanks so much. And then just finally on -- your quarter was obviously very strong for a lot of different reasons. Just wondering how much of that was attributable to the Easter shift.","Brian Goldner","We definitely saw a very strong Easter for us in POS but our Easter was actually up significantly versus prior Easter. But we\u2019ve seen this continued strong POS and even after Easter this year our POS continues to be strong and the double digit POSes across every category and every geography. And I think it goes back to something we talked about in prepared remarks, and that\u2019s -- I think the thing that you\u2019re seeing in the first quarter that\u2019s obfuscating our otherwise very strong franchise brand results is just the payments that were made a year ago for stream content in a quarter that tends to be a bit lower in overall revenue, so has a bigger impact. So, if you take that out, our total franchise brands growth for the quarter was 9% and you saw double-digit growth in U.S. and high-single digit growth internationally for franchise brands. So again, the streaming payments made a year ago just get in the way of seeing that underlying strength and it\u2019s why you\u2019re also seeing our market shares grow all around the world.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.","Drew Crum","Okay, thanks, good morning, everyone. So Brian, you provided your updated view on expectations for STAR WARS, which is unchanged for the year. Can you kind of run us through what the puts and takes are and how you arrived at that number or that view? And then, continuing with Boys, how does Spiderman fit into the Company\u2019s plans for Marvel in 2016? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","So, if you look at the full year for STAR WARS in the calendar, clearly Home Entertainment has just broken for THE FORCE AWAKENS. Obviously we know the kind of contribution that will make to boys oriented business for the next several quarters. Then, we transition in the fall toward Rouge One, hopefully by now you\u2019ve seen of the early trailers; it\u2019s very exciting and clearly a story, a STAR WARS story and that is very relevant to global fans, both new and old, and we\u2019ll transition to the Rouge One product, but of course still the classic products both from FORCE AWAKENS and classic original STAR WARS products will continue to sell. We also have a continued strong emphasis on the fan economy and fan oriented product, which continues throughout the year and you\u2019ll see that reflected; we\u2019re seeing it reflected in our business presently and that\u2019s I think how you would look at the calendarization of STAR WARS for this year.","In terms of the Marvel business, I think the interesting thing here is we do have a movie coming up in Captain America: Civil War; hopefully you\u2019ve seen the materials there. But it\u2019s clearly a full array of all of our favorite characters from the Marvel universe. Interestingly the timing of the merchandizing of that is a month later this year than it was a year ago, and so that does have an impact on the first quarter\u2019s Marvel business as we time that, just it happens to be the shelf set dates are a month later this year than a year ago, although the movie date is roughly the same. And we\u2019ll roll into Captain America: Civil War, which as I said is a full array of characters including some of our favorites like the character you mentioned. And then of course, we get into \u201817 and we do have the Spiderman movie.","Drew Crum","Brian, just go back to your last comment, are you suggesting that you were not shipping Captain America products in the first quarter?","Brian Goldner","We -- not saying we didn\u2019t ship Captain America products in the first quarter, we\u2019re just saying that the timing shifted. So, it probably didn\u2019t have as big an impact as it did a year ago; so, to frame it out, the partner brand for partner brand, the puts and takes.","Drew Crum","Yes, got it, okay. And then just one last question, Deb, on the advertising, can you discuss the year-on-year increase? Typically we don\u2019t see when you have a heavy mix towards entertainment and contribution from partner brands, the increased advertising, just want to understand what\u2019s driving that.","Deb Thomas","Really just as we look at our full year expectations and look at rolling out our advertising, really just what you\u2019re seeing this year compared to last year is the impact of our expectations and how we\u2019re looking at funding the programs that will be running all year long against the revenue spread out over the quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","Alright, thanks, the name is Arpin\u00e9. Could you talk a little bit about U.S. retail takeaway in the quarter and how sort of to think about the Easter shift? And thank you for the Easter and Easter comparison; that was helpful. How do kind of think about what Easter shift was in terms of retail takeaway and your shipment in the U.S. of up about 28%?","Brian Goldner ","Yes. So, if you look at our POS, it\u2019s very strong across the Board in the U.S., up strong double-digits across all categories. For toys up strong double-digits and boys, similarly girls, preschool, and games were up double-digit, our franchise brands in the U.S. were up double-digits in POS. And we did see a very strong Easter, but we\u2019ve been seeing strong week-on-week POS, and as I indicated, our strong double-digit POS has continued beyond Easter.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","Okay, thank you. And then my second question is, Brian, back in February, you had said that you expected partner revenues to be closer to that 25% range higher than historical around 20. Partner brands came in stronger than franchise, although there is a bit of tough comp in entertainment and licensing but overall royalty rate was also up tiny bit. Could you share with us whether your guidance for full year of partner brands being, still at the higher end of that 20%, 25% range on royalty rates coming down as a percentage of sales for the full year; has that kind of guidance or expectation changed?","Brian Goldner","No, it hasn\u2019t changed. Our guidance is very much the same. In fact, if you look as a percent of revenues, our royalties are only up one-tenth of a percentage point in the quarter versus a year ago; so a very small change. The other element, as we said, the partner brands even in the first quarter where you have lower absolute revenues and the impact were only up slightly above the 25% number that we\u2019ve given at the high end of the range. So, again, over the four quarters, we still expect it to be at the high-end of the 20% to 25% range.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","That\u2019s helpful. So, absent the licensing -- entertainment and licensing tough comp, that one-off payment, you still expect franchise brands to grow at a higher rate was partner?","Brian Goldner","Well, I think it\u2019s very hearting. We\u2019re looking at the numbers and if you take the top 10 brands of our Company at this moment, in the quarter, six of the top 10 brands of our Company are franchise brands. And the top brand in our Company still in the first quarter is NERF. So, I think the portfolio management the teams are executing is quite strong; it\u2019s certainly a complement of franchise brands and partner brands revenues, so the other four brands within the top 10 are partner brands. But that\u2019s a great combination. And our strongest brand, top brand of the quarter is still NERF. And that combination allows us to continue to provide that guidance to you about royalties and about partner brands as a percent of revenue for the year.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Stephanie Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Stephanie Wissink","Thank you. Good morning and congratulations to everyone there on a fantastic quarter.","Brian Goldner","Thanks.","Stephanie Wissink","My question is just related to the profit growth versus the sales growth, which is a factor of three-fold in this quarter, really outstanding. Curious, Deb, if you can share with us how we should thinking about that over the next couple of quarters and the next couple of years. I think in Toy Fair you indicated your margin targets for the Q are roughly flattish, but a couple of hundred basis points of expansion in the first quarter. I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s changed the way you\u2019re thinking about the forward year and next couple of years?","Deb Thomas","We think based on our -- we talked a little bit about the fact that the first quarter is a log of small numbers for us. But what we\u2019re seeing is the improvement in our margins that we did say at year-end in the Toy Fair that we believe were sustainable and expandable over time, particularly as we ramped some of the new brands and gained more operating profit for us. So, the one item we did want to point out was the bad debt that was unusual for us, while we won\u2019t exclude it, it was the first one that we encountered as we\u2019ve expanded particularly into emerging markets. And we do have some high risk accounts, but we managed those very closely and do have reserves where we deem them appropriate. But overall, our margins have grown in all of our segments with the exception of entertainment and licensing. And again that streaming revenue because of the profitability of it has a big impact. But we do continue to believe that based on our current estimates that the guidance that we gave in February still holds.","Stephanie Wissink","Thank you. And then just one follow-up, Deb, on the inventory, I think you mentioned excluding currency up 41% year-over-year. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019d be willing to just eliminate the non-comparable for PRINCESS. I\u2019d imagine there is some ramp inventory there for PRINCESS. Is it more consistent with sales, if you back that out? I mean just look at it on a comparable basis.","Deb Thomas","Yes. I think as we look at our inventory overall, you have identified a big piece of it. I mean we\u2019re really ramping up for the business we see in the year ahead.","Stephanie Wissink","Thank you. Best of luck everyone.","Brian Goldner","If you look where inventory is, Steph, it\u2019s really nicely spread and it does follow our sales curves globally, so you get about a better third of the inventory increase in the U.S. and the other two thirds out internationally, as we\u2019re going in region for region.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Please go ahead with your questions.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning. This is actually Fred on for Greg. Just wondering if you guys could give a little bit more color on the DISNEY PRINCESS launch, how it\u2019s gone versus your expectation and where we think we\u2019re at this position?","Brian Goldner","Clearly, I think you said one of the keywords, which is it is clearly first quarter is a transitional quarter; we said that all long. Having said that, the teams have done -- our teams at Hasbro have done a fantastic job of launching the brand of beautiful products and it\u2019s been well-received by consumers and the early take away is quite good. We\u2019re ramping this business and we continue to believe that as we move forward, as we expand in revenues, we\u2019ll continue to improve our operating margin over time there. So, I would say that our guidance for what we want to achieve is being achieved and run on track for our expectations for PRINCESS.","Greg Badishkanian","Great. If we just looked at STAR WARS, is there anything that you guys learned from last year\u2019s movie that you are planning to implement for this coming year\u2019s release?","Brian Goldner","Clearly it was great for us to be able to have a major entertainment initiative in the fourth quarter; it\u2019s great to build the spread out, the entertainment initiatives across our portfolio, now almost 12 months a year; and that will continue to be the case, as we have more and more partners and our own brands, launching new story led initiatives throughout each year. The consumer certainly responded in kind and it gives us great courage to look at new windows for new launches, and will track similar to last year, kind of a similar tempo and template this year, as we have a fall set date for Rogue One product and that will roll into a holiday oriented movie. But, again, the teams are constantly picking up on new insights, and we\u2019re using those to the advantage of customers and consumers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Taposh Bari of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Taposh Bari","Hey, good morning everyone and congrats on another great quarter. Brian, on Girls, can you help us better understand how the segment performed excluding the DISNEY PRINCESS piece. And then, the follow up for that, how do we think about the transition of that property into your business? Should we think of 1Q as a kind of disproportion of beneficiary -- given the fact that it represents the initial shipment window for that property?","Brian Goldner","Well, if you look at it, clearly in a quarter where typically lower revenues it does have a disproportional impact; as you grow throughout the year, your revenues grow across the board. We had a number of our girls brands that performed well and grew in the quarter. So, we saw some great growth from some of what we would call our challenger brands including FurReal Friends Baby Alive and EASY-BAKE and then MY LITTLE PONY, as I said, the brand overall was up. The only place that had an impact where it flattens the result is because of the streaming revenues are assigned to the purchase of MY LITTLE PONY programming and LITTLEST PET SHOP programming a year ago. So, we had one brand in there that we\u2019re restaging for the fall which is Nerf Rebelle and clearly the brand is down at this movement, as we restage and get reoriented around that brand for the second half of the year. And again, PET SHOPT had very strong results in several territories including the U.S. and Canada. And we\u2019re beginning to make the shift, the change in evolution of that brand out internationally and over time, we would expect that brand to see more positive momentum overall.","Taposh Bari","On games, I just want to make sure, I understand the comment that you made. So, shipments were flat in constant currency but POS up double digits, did I hear that correctly?","Brian Goldner","It is, a strong double digit, yes.","Taposh Bari","Okay. So, is that entirely attributable to the magic shift in to take you there?","Brian Goldner","No, I don\u2019t -- we had lots of puts and takes, so we have lots of interesting and different brands that were up in the quarter. Our segment -- a lot of the brands within our family oriented segment were up including life and Life and YAHTZEE and several other brands. Obviously PIE FACE continues to be a strong contributor; DUEL MASTERS within the Yahtzee [ph] business was up. As I said, overall, face-to-face gaming was up a bit in the quarter. And I do think you have our coming off of a very strong fourth quarter, you still have product in the market and very strong POS, both in the U.S. and internationally for games.","Taposh Bari","Understood, and one last one for you, Brian, if you can comment on the health of the toy category, as we enter 2016. Again, category\u2019s been relatively flat for a while and it seems to be going through this revival. What are you hearing from your retailers, both brick and mortar and online; are they believers in the sustainability; are they dedicating more resources to the category? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","Well, I would say yes to really everything you\u2019ve said. Well, remember that last year we had a very had a very robust growth in U.S. and globally developed economies as well as emerging markets in the toy industry. So, I would say this is the second year of strong growth year-to-date; we are seeing high single digit growth rates, both in developed economies like U.S. and also throughout Europe. Retailers are very excited about the category, as we continue to have more story driven brands, more integrated play brands and more innovation in the category. Overall, POS was very strong, as I said, but as we\u2019ve noted before, online POS was even stronger, and many additional retailers that have been historically brick retailers are doing a very good job in omni-channel. And so, we saw great growth for several online retailers, both pure play as well as omni-channel retailers. So, I would say overall, the state of the industry is quite strong. And our indications are from projections that it will remain strong for the next several years.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please go ahead with your question.","Jaime Katz","Can you guys discuss if there were any pockets of excess inventory outside EQUESTRIA GIRLS? I know you were selling the channel for a lot of products but that seems to be the only product that was called out, as may be not performing exactly how you had expected?","Brian Goldner","Yes, as I mentioned, Nerf Rebelle, clearly, we are restaging that part of the NERF brand, had some inventory carried over, and we are restaging it for the second half. We had a great response from the global retailers to the new lineup of Nerf Rebelle products for the second half of the year. And our expectation is the brand should sell through some remaining inventory in the first half. But I would say those are really the two brands. The only other one, and I almost -- we\u2019ve talked about this over a number of calls is FURBY. We do have some remaining FURBY last hopefully quarter of FURBY headwinds, if we will. We are selling out some remaining FURBY up against a year ago.","Jaime Katz","Okay, and then I know you guys talked a little bit about bad debt, but I am curious on a more regional level. What you guys are seeing out of Brazil, which had historically been descent growth business and then whether or not Mexico is helping to offset that at all?","Brian Goldner","Brazil continues to be strong growth, just obviously you are having a currency impact. So absent, absent FX, the underlying growth in Brazil, our brands in Brazil are performing quite strongly. Clearly we are seeing growth in regions like Mexico, but Deb, do you want to comment on the environment?","Deb Thomas","No. Our business continues to be good. As of late, the real has done a bit better as all currencies have. And we did say in our prepared remarks, particularly if the euro holds up the way its trading right now that will have a positive impact on our expectations for foreign exchange, impact us for the full year, but we continue to see the market in Brazil being good and consumer takeaway being good as well.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo. Please go with your questions.","Tim Conder","Thank you. Congratulations also again on the ongoing great execution everyone. Just a couple of items; my apologies there. Staying on the currency, Deb, and just following on a few of those related questions, a little more color you said, if rates stay where they are, you talked about the 100 million reference stat that will be substantially better. Anymore color on the revenue, operating profits, again assuming rates stay where they are today? And did you guys put in on any additional hedging in Q1 that may be benefiting that now that rates have moved?","Deb Thomas","We hedge throughout the year, so we probably did put some hedges on in the first quarter. Overall, from a hedging standpoint, we hedged about 75% our product cost last year, and we are about hedged the same amount this year. So, we always try to make sure we say in a similar level. So, it\u2019s hard to tell where the rates are going to go. I think if you look at what all the experts are saying, they expect the dollar is strengthened. However, we are not seeing that particularly against the euro right now. So, if rates stay the way they are, we did put a chart in our earnings presentation, so you could see the make-up of our revenues by currency in the first quarter. And depending on what your expectations are for FX rates, you can just look it at that way. But are kind of hitting the point where we are getting comparable FX rates to last year in certain regions.","Tim Conder","Okay, I guess from a color standpoint, are you talking, $10million, $20 million difference versus that $100 million that you talked about in February?","Deb Thomas","Well, we\u2019ve got $30 million almost already in. So, as you look at the rest of the year, I mean if the euro continues to stay strong, it\u2019s actually trading above levels it was trading at last year. So, that could significantly change our expectations for the year, but again, it\u2019s too early to tell.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then any color, Brian, Deb, that you feel comfortable giving? I know part of it\u2019s sensitive with a specific streaming contract. But as far as the swing factor, the streaming contract and TRANSFORMERS together, how it impacted entertainment and licensing, was that the majority of the swing there, I mean can we just take it as all of it or any additional color you could just breakdown?","Brian Goldner","Yes, it was I think between the two -- between the fact that we\u2019re coming off. Remember, we\u2019ve said before that when we do licenses, we get paid the following quarter. So, obviously in first quarter of \u201815, we were collecting royalties for fourth quarter \u201814 in TRANSFORMERS and then of course we had the streaming deal, and I think both are exacerbated by the fact that you\u2019re dealing in a typically lower revenue\u2019s quarter, so more of an impact in percentage terms. And you\u2019re right, I think that\u2019s the bulk of the change.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then, any -- back to the bad debt and again, you said your POS was good in several areas. What -- can you give us any color as to where the majority of a retailer is concentrated where that bad debt was or where you\u2019re seeing maybe some of retailers, not the consumer have some issues?","Deb Thomas","Particularly, we were seeing some impact to certain retailers in our emerging markets. I did already comment that Brazil continues to be a strong market for us right now and do well; so other markets, not Brazil.","Brian Goldner","The other thing I wanted -- I\u2019d like to just note because we do have some big retailers, we\u2019re not talking about the big retailers that have represented the significant partners for us and growth engines for us in those areas, so Detsky Mir in Russia, PBKIDS Ri Happy and Brazil both are very strong, continue to be strong retailers, really talking about some retailers that were not among our top retailers but clearly retailers we\u2019ve been selling to.","Tim Conder","Very helpful. And lastly Brian, China, it would appear that that\u2019s been a -- continues to be a pretty good growth driver for you. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong there. And then just especially your e-commerce outlook in China and how that is trending over the last 12 months, 18 months whatever period here and then how you see that growth curve here over the balance of \u201816?","Brian Goldner","Well clearly, e-com in China is one of the key themes for future growth, even though we\u2019re getting growth today. I think future growth is even stronger, as we orient our Company and our business to e-com globally but also particularly in China it is a great disintermediary for that market, allows us to get to the vast majority of consumers, and it\u2019s an area of focus for us. China has shown some good growth but remember, our Asia Pacific business overall showed good growth, so beyond China, which is quite heartening to see, country for country, and Korea some great growth and Southeast Asia as well as our Australia and New Zealand business. So, China continues to be both the short and long term opportunity for us. We do have a great array of brands that are beloved in China, particularly brands like TRANSFORMERS and we\u2019ll continue to build the business. But I think e-com is one of the focuses for our company globally and also specific e-com focus in China.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Lee Giardano with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead with your question.","Lee Giardano","Thanks, good morning everybody. Deb, just to clarify on the tax rate, it looks like it came in around 21%. Should we still continue to look for 26.5% or 27% for the remainder of the year?","Deb Thomas","Yes, the adjustments that got us down to that 21% were discrete items. And our underlying tax rate is in the range of 26.5% to 27% that we talked about at year end.","Lee Giardano","Great, thanks. And just secondly following up on MY LITTLE PONY, what does the entertainment schedule look like this year and next and how do you view that brand going forward?","Brian Goldner","MY LITTLE PONY \u2018s next season is just launching now and rolling out around the world, it\u2019s the sixth season for the brand. And the theme this year is all about exploring EQUESTRIA and it ties together with lots of the initiatives that we have across the Company. We have very robust plans in multi categories for MY LITTLE PONY throughout this year, brand new toys and games products but also I\u2019ve seen some really wonderful product in our consumer products licensing business and apparel that\u2019s out internationally in the UK, very strong results in several categories of products setting all around the world in tune with that theme and that will roll into 2017. And then as you know for fall of 2017 November, we have our first animated feature film that will be distributed by Lionsgate in the MY LITTLE PONY movie.","So, we\u2019ll have television entertainment, streaming entertainment across a number of different over the top providers. Kids can find entertainment, both short form and long form. And then they can also find entertainment on digital games with some new digital games that we\u2019ll launch including one new MY LITTLE PONY digital game launching from BlackFoot studios; we continue to have a game from Gameloft throughout the year so story telling across a number of different dimensions and continue to feel very good about the brand. And as I\u2019ve mentioned, the new EQUESTRIA GIRLS line and launch is and going off quite well with the new Mini Dolls! segment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please proceed with your questions.","Eric Handler","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Forgive me, if you\u2019ve already gone through this. But, your U.S. and Canada business yet great revenue growth 28%, the margin increased but not as much as revenue growth. And I\u2019m just curious, what expense items particularly of note where there that sort of drove the margin below your revenue growth? And then secondly, looking at STAR WARS, was POS consistent through the quarter or was there a big shipment that occurred just prior to the Home Entertainment release?","Brian Goldner","So first of all, the operating profit in the U.S. business increased 89%. So, revenues were up 28%, operating profit was up 89%, and I\u2019m not sure\u2026","Eric Handler","Okay. Sorry. Yes.","Brian Goldner","The operating profit margin in the quarter was 17.7%, up against 12% a year ago. So, I just want to make sure, we\u2019re\u2026","Eric Handler","Right. Yes, sorry. I misspoke. So, what was it that actually allowed you to get that margin up 570 basis points?","Brian Goldner","Well, it\u2019s obviously the revenue increases and a great portfolio of franchise growth as well as partner growth. So, again, I mentioned that in the top 10 brands of our Company, we have six of our seven franchise brands, and then some partner brands. It\u2019s that blend should allow you to understand how we intend to improve operating margins over time, how our partner brands will remain at the top end of the 20% to 25% of revenues and why royalty should be roughly in line with our guidance for the year.","Eric Handler","Okay. And then STAR WARS?","Brian Goldner","STAR WARS, no, we\u2019ve been shipping STAR WARS throughout, we came off of a very strong movie, remember the movie has continued to play in theaters, so we continue to ships product as more and more people saw the movie. And then of course, there are all kinds of initiatives around the Home Entertainment windows, but those will continue. So, I wouldn\u2019t say that there was any one pulse of inventory into the market, but rather very strong sell-through throughout.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jim Chartier with Monness Crespi. Please proceed with your questions.","Jim Chartier","Thanks for taking my questions. First question on YOKAI WATCH, now that you\u2019ve had a couple of months with the product in the market, just want to get your update, your thoughts there on both kind of the U.S. and other markets, how it\u2019s been received. And the secondly on STAR WARS, Rogue One looks like has another female lead. So, just curious how the female business for STAR WARS is doing versus prior years and if you think that\u2019s an opportunity going forward? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","So, YOKAI is only in its first couple of months, as you correctly indicate and really rolling out around the world of entertainment. So, we\u2019ve really only seen entertainment in the U.S. and it will be going into international markets throughout the year. And early indications are quite good, but it\u2019s still very early days. Rogue One is exciting for everyone. And I think we continue to offer an array of products for all STAR WARS fans of all ages and genders and affiliations. And you\u2019ll see us continue to focus on product for everyone and product has been well received by everyone. And again, I think what you\u2019re seeing overall is a blending of such more historical delineation that we\u2019re really not focusing on our fostering, we\u2019re just making great products, we love the lead characters of these movies, and we\u2019re very excited about where STAR WARS is going. We also saw in the first quarter great sales of Lightsabers and I think Lightsabers are going to everyone, because everybody can be a Jedi.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your questions.","Gerrick Johnson","Hey, good morning. Do you guys have a street date for Rogue One; will there be a Rogue Friday?","Brian Goldner","I can only say at this point, fall; I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve announced the street date.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. And do you have the actual number for the bad debt expense?","Deb Thomas","We talked about the one particular charge we took; it was $13.8 million.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay, and also your franchise brands up 1% in the quarter but I thought I heard on the call you say 9%, what was the 9% number relation to?","Brian Goldner","So, I was trying to get across the fact that if you look at actual sales of our toys and games around the world, our franchise brands were up 9% and a brand like MY LITTLE PONLY was up 12%. So, I just -- again, given the typically smaller revenue quarter and then impact of the streaming deal, if you really look at the underlying consumer orientation of the brands and how it\u2019s performing, they are performing quite strongly.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay, I get it, ex the streaming deal. Lastly, in the past couple of quarters, you\u2019ve talked about MY LITTLE PONY performance in terms of core, I didn\u2019t hear this world this time core, you said it did grow in U.S.; was that core or was that in totality?","Brian Goldner","Well, it\u2019s a combination, because we have also EQUESTRIA GIRLS; so, it\u2019s the combination of all the elements.","Operator","Thank you.

Brian?","Brian Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The global Hasbro team delivered a good quarter and start to the year. Revenues increased 2% and absent a negative $24.3 million impact of foreign exchange grew 6%. New initiatives and innovation overcame tough comparisons with last year's first quarter. Our long-term investments in growth opportunities provided a meaningful contribution from our digital and e-sports initiative, Magic: The Gathering Arena as well as growth in Magic: The Gathering tabletop revenues.","Additional gains came from several other brands including Franchise Brands, PLAY-DOH, TRANSFORMERS, and MONOPOLY. We are beginning to see improvement in our commercial markets, notably in the U.S. and Europe. In Europe, revenues grew 8%, absent the impact of foreign exchange. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue stabilization as well as profit improvement for the region and the first quarter is in line with this plan.","Point-of-sale comparisons will remain challenged through the first half of the year as Toys \"R\" Us moved into liquidation in the U.S. during week 11 late in the first quarter of last year. In addition, Easter was later this year shifting from the first quarter into the second quarter. Absent Toys \"R\" Us, global point-of-sale for the quarter was down approximately 10% and in line with our expectations.","As consumers began Easter shopping and new initiatives came on shelf, including NERF Fortnite and Hasbro's line for Marvel Avengers: Endgame, point-of-sale improved posting positive Easter-to-Easter comparisons in the U.S. Retail inventories are of good quality and good levels, increasing in certain markets and brands as retailers prepared for Easter and new launches in April, including several entertainment initiatives as well as Hasbro's POWER RANGERS line launch in North America.","Throughout the quarter, the global team did an excellent job managing expenses, and we began to see the benefit of our cost savings initiatives. We delivered operating profit in the quarter and EPS of $0.21 per share. While most of the year is ahead of us, we remain on track to deliver profitable growth for the full year 2019.","Our outlook is anchored in innovation and execution around higher margin growth opportunities in key brand initiatives, many of which launch later in the year. We are leveraging our expertise and brand portfolio to drive unique gaming experiences. This kicked off with great success at our premier Magic: The Gathering Mythic Invitational at PAX East in March. John, Deb and I were on hand to see the team lead a tremendous event, which generated 2.7 million viewer hours on Twitch and paid out $1 million prize pool.","Engagement with Magic: The Gathering is growing in both digital gaming and analog tabletop. In-store player growth increased double digits and grew at an even higher rate for new players. The latest Magic card set, War of the Spark, was unveiled at PAX East and drove over 10 million views of the trailer, shattering the previous record.","In stores, in early May, War of the Spark is currently available for digital pre-order in Magic: The Gathering Arena and launches this week. Magic: The Gathering Arena is performing well with over 700 million games played to date during the Open Beta with the average player spending 8 hours per week in the game. We'll be further supporting the game with additional tournaments and marketing support as the year progresses.","As discussed at Toy Fair, we're also expanding the Magic: The Gathering franchise to reach a broader audience through an entirely new game designed for mobile. The team launched this game, Valor\u2019s Reach, into test markets during the first quarter.","In our face-to-face gaming portfolio, MONOPOLY is coming off a record year and continued to deliver growth based on insight-driven innovation and on-trend additions. MONOPOLY Cheaters Edition and MONOPOLY: Fortnite are performing well. MONOPOLY for millennials is rolling out globally building off its success in the U.S, and we recently launched our Game of Thrones Edition, which is off to a good start as the hit HBO show enters its final season.","In addition to our unparalleled gaming portfolio, we're building on the growing popularity of gaming across all formats around the world. This includes leveraging our industry-leading position with NERF for our gamer series. We launched NERF Fortnite late in the first quarter and it is off to a very strong start at retail. This new line joins Nerf Overwatch within our new gamer initiatives this spring.","Throughout the year, the NERF team has incredibly innovative line across price points backed by compelling digital-first marketing and campaigns. NERF Fortnite launched exclusively on HasbroPulse with preorders in February and then rolled out to retailers. HasbroPulse is a one-stop destination to engage directly with our target consumers and deliver social media engagement, product development initiatives, content, and commerce for fans.","To further our digital-first consumer approach, we added a strategic position during the first quarter with the appointment of Jamie Gutfreund to the newly-created role of Chief Consumer Experience Officer or CXO. Reporting to John Frascotti, Hasbro's President and COO, Jamie will oversee global marketing with the directive to further build deep connections between Hasbro's brands and global consumers. Jamie joined us last week from Wunderman Thompson where she served as Global CMO and helped establish the firm's reputation as a dynamic global digital organization.","Our investment in digital-first innovation and storytelling has kept us as the #1 toy and game company in the U.S. and Canada on Amazon according to Edge Market Share. A recent example of how we leveraged our social channels to deliver content to commerce programs comes from Star Wars Celebration where we drove strong preorders for our exclusive Emperor Palpatine Black Series figure and The Black Series Luke Skywalker Electronic X-Wing Pilot Helmet. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is coming to theaters on December 20, and with the first STAR WARS live-action series, The Mandalorian, premiering on Disney+ on November 12, and The Galaxy of Adventures animation for kids on multiple platforms, we will be supporting Star Wars extensively with new Hasbro products on shelf from October 4 as part of Triple Force Friday.","While our Partner Brands revenue was down in the quarter, robust entertainment for these brands builds throughout this year. In addition to STAR WARS, Marvel's upcoming 2019 theatrical lineup includes the highly-anticipated Avengers: Endgame later this week and Columbia Pictures' Spider-Man: Far from Home in July.","We're also very excited about Marvel's entertainment initiatives in support of kids and fans across key platforms like Disney+, Disney XD, and MARVEL HQ on YouTube. For DISNEY PRINCESS, we have an all new line at retail based on the new look from Ralph Breaks the Internet as well as Aladdin product supporting the upcoming May film. In addition, Hasbro's expansive line for the highly-anticipated Frozen 2 will be on shelf October 4 for the November film. Also within the Partner Brand portfolio, BEYBLADE continued to perform well leveraging new innovation and episodic programming to deliver another quarter of revenue and point-of-sale growth.","Storytelling across platforms is essential to building immersive brands. Bumblebee, currently available in home entertainment, along with our preschool kids and fan-oriented content, is driving revenue and point-of-sale growth for the TRANSFORMERS brand. Equally important, it is successfully introducing TRANSFORMERS to a new generation of kids and reengaging our core fans around the world. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2019, there's a lot of work to be done. Our teams are engaged and focused to deliver on our plan for profitable growth this year.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deborah Thomas","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. The team turned in a good start to the year delivering revenue growth against a difficult comparison with last year and executing to deliver operating profit in the quarter. Hasbro is in a strong financial position with the ability to invest in our business for long-term growth while managing costs and delivering on our planned net cost savings of $50 million to $55 million for the year.","We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash while returning $128.5 million to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. An 8% increase in the quarterly dividend takes effect for our next payment in May.","Within our segments, revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 1% behind growth in Franchise Brands including PLAY-DOH, Magic: The Gathering, TRANSFORMERS and MONOPOLY as well as growth in Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brands. This growth was partially offset by declines in the Partner Brand category. We ended the quarter with good levels and good quality of inventory at retail. It's still early in the year, but we're encouraged by the positive signs in the business.","Segment operating profit for the quarter was $13.5 million. Last year's first quarter included $52.3 million of expenses associated with Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, which was primarily bad debt, and we reported a loss of $26.6 million.","Adjusted operating cost at last year was $25.7 million. The segment's operating profit in 2019 was adversely impacted by product mix, higher intangible amortization associated with POWER RANGERS and start-up expenses in opening a new U.S. warehouse as well as investing in the Wizards of the Coast gaming brands.","International segment revenues declined 2% including a negative $23.4 million impact of foreign exchange. Excluding FX, revenues in the segment increased 6% and were up in Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific.","Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brand revenues increased. Franchise Brand revenues were flat as reported, but increased excluding foreign exchange. Partner Brand revenues declined in the quarter. The International segment reported an operating loss of $30.4 million compared to a $56.1 million operating loss last year, which included $11.2 million of expense associated with Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. The adjusted operating loss for last year's first quarter was $44.9 million. The smaller operating loss per share was driven by higher sales volumes, the benefit of cost savings, lower royalties and beneficial cost translation rates. This was partially offset by higher intangible amortization.","Finally, as Debbie mentioned earlier, we have renamed our Entertainment and Licensing segment as Entertainment, Licensing and Digital. We reclassified revenues of $10.4 million and operating profit of $3.2 million from the U.S. and Canada segment related to 2018. Reflecting this, segment revenues grew 24% this quarter. This was driven by revenues from Magic: The Gathering Arena as well as consumer product licensing.","Operating profit increased to $30 million or 32.6% of revenues driven by the higher revenue and lower amortization for film and television. This was partially offset by continued investments in the business including in digital gaming initiatives for Magic: The Gathering.","Overall, Hasbro operating profit improved to $36.1 million or 4.9% reflecting higher revenue, a favorable contribution from our cost-saving activities, lower stock compensation and good expense management.","Several of our expense categories were essentially in line with last year. However, royalty expense declined to 8.2% of revenues versus 9.7% last year. As a reminder, we incurred accelerated expense associated with Toys \u201cR\u201d Us in this line during the first quarter last year and the adjusted rate was 8.7%. The decline in royalties reflects lower Partner Brand revenues in the quarter.","Intangible amortization increased to $11.8 million as forecasted reflecting the POWER RANGERS acquisition. Program amortization declined as we amortized less television and film expense this year versus last year, which included MY LITTLE PONY, the movie production expense.","Advertising increased to 10.5% of revenues versus 9.5% last year. We forecasted amortizing to increase for the full year behind the launch of digital gaming initiatives including substantial marketing and e-sports expense throughout the year. We continue to expect full year advertising expense in the 10% range.","Last year, we recorded $59.1 million of bad debt expense related to Toys \u201cR\u201d Us in SG&A. Excluding this expense, SG&A declined approximately $25 million reflecting the early benefit of cost savings, lower stock compensation expense, good cost management by our teams and a favorable impact from foreign exchange. At the same time, we have start-up costs for new U.S. warehouse and invested in our Wizards of the Coast business.","Turning to our results for low operating profit, other income increased slightly primarily due to a larger gain on foreign currency transactions and higher interest income. Our underlying tax rate for the quarter was 18.5% versus 16.5% last year. The rate reflects a mix of jurisdictions where we earned profits and the impact of tax reform and is in the range of our full year underlying guidance of 17.5% to 19%. Including discrete items, the first quarter's effective tax rate was 9.7%.","We have recognized one-time events over the past 2 years that have provided considerable benefits to substantially lower our effective tax rate. Based on what we know today, we do not expect the impact of discrete events to be as significant as they were in 2018. For the first quarter, earnings per share was $0.21. Our balance sheet is strong, and we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash. We returned $79.3 million in dividend payments and $49.2 million in share repurchases.","During the quarter, as outlined in our POWER RANGERS acquisition agreement, we paid $87.5 million to Saban Properties, $12.5 million remains in escrow and will be paid out during the second quarter. Receivables increased 4% and day sales outstanding were 79 days, up 1 day from 78 days last year. Inventories decreased 5% and were essentially flat with the year ago, absent the impact of foreign exchange. The quality of our inventory both on hand at Hasbro and at our retailers is good. Retail inventory in certain brands and markets increased in the first quarter ahead of Easter and several new initiatives launching during the second quarter.","Finally, effective January 1 of this year, we adopted the new lease accounting standard. As a result, we recorded operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations or consolidated statement of cash flows for the quarter.","In closing, we're pleased with the start to the year. The team did a fantastic job driving revenue growth and managing costs. We will remain focused on both throughout the year as we support the new entertainment and brand initiatives coming to market over the course of the coming quarters.","We will now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Stephanie Wissink with Jefferies.","Stephanie Wissink","Nice start to the year. A question for you, Brian, really on the cadence of the quarter when we were together at Toys Fair, think your outlook for the quarter was maybe a bit more muted versus what you delivered, so can you talk a little bit about the areas that vested your plans, how you motivated the team to really take advantage of some of the opportunities? And then how should we think about the momentum in the business? Is this the start or are you coming in a bit better than what you had expected, so we should think about the first half as being a bit more lateral? If you can just help us with the quarterly progression, that would be great.","Brian Goldner","Sure. We did have a number of headwinds going into the year that we had spoken about, $26 million in Toys \"R\" Us shipments for the first quarter of last year, a shift of Easter to the second quarter, and of course, last year, Black Panther had performed incredibly well during the first quarter. Having said that, the team has done a very good job of growing our brands in the quarter. We saw growth in the Franchise Brands and Gaming and Emerging Brands, and we expect to see our Partner Brands begin to accelerate as we enter the second quarter. We've already seen Avengers performing well over-the-counter as we head to the movie this week later in the year and early in the third quarter, we'll have the Spider-Man movie, and so again entertainment progresses throughout the year and we're supporting our entertainment brands across a number of dimensions. We've also seen some really good progress in Europe, but I would encourage you to again think about our full year belief about getting back to profitable growth, and we'll see more new initiatives coming throughout the year. This is always a small quarter for us. We're very encouraged by what we're seeing. It's a bit more revenue than we'd expected, and we are seeing the early signs of that acceleration in Magic: The Gathering in both Arena as well as tabletop revenues, both being up in the quarter. We're seeing a number of new in-store players as well as new players, and so that also bodes well for that brand for the year and beyond.","As we look at POS and we take year-to-date POS through both years and to date, we're seeing that overall POS is down in the low-single digits, so we did see an acceleration of POS. Easter-to-Easter POS was up in the mid-single digits. And so, again the progress is really starting to take hold in the second quarter. So, we think the cadence of our business is as we described it earlier in the year. We are very committed to returning to profitable growth, and we think we're off to a very good start. The team has done a very good job around the world.","Stephanie Wissink","Deb, could I throw in one more. Just on the $58 million of reclassification, are you willing to give us that by quarters, just for our models so we can twitch the revenue lines?","Deborah Thomas","I think the team is working on that right now, and when we have it available, we'll disclose it. But right now, just to put it in perspective, it was about $10 million in the first quarter, which we had talked about we reclassified, and it would be $58 million for the full year, and the business is not as -- it's not as cyclical perhaps as the rest of our business, but in the first quarter, obviously, it made a bigger difference just because it's the first quarter and it's a low revenue quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Arpine Kocharian with UBS.","Arpine Kocharian","So Entertainment and Licensing revenue was quite strong. Would you be able to break down what was Consumer Product licensing contribution for the quarter and maybe take a chance to kind of run through a quick kind of how lumpy this revenue stream can be and how we should think about quarter-to-quarter cadence?","Brian Goldner","The lumpiness we normally would see in that quarter would be in the areas of film and television as we get paid for certain streaming income and certain streaming revenues as we deliver episodes typically. The rest follows cadence off of entertainment. We've talked before about Consumer Products licensing, revenues coming after entertainment initiatives by the company as we collect royalties and can count royalty income that comes into the company. And we did see good progress in Consumer Products this quarter. We've obviously had some great entertainment that's come over the last few quarters and notably in Bumblebee and other brands. And then, as we go forward, we expect that the new digital delineation will be important as the brands around Wizards of the Coast continue to grow. We've talked about a number of initiatives that the brands intend to execute over time not just arena. We have a new game in test market in the first quarter that's more of a casual mobile game, Valor's Reach, and we expect to continue to see revenues in that area. We're not going to break out the revenues by each area but suffice it to say that digital gaming was up Consumer Products, and of course, we talked about the first time we're reporting Arena and other games from Wizards of the Coast separately and ELB.","Arpine Kocharian","Great. And then in terms of the Magic: The Gathering transitioning out of beta mode, do you have any updates on the timing of that? I think you've said before by end of Q2 or potentially in the first half, which today means, I guess, end of sort of Q2, is there any update to that?","Brian Goldner","No. There's no real update thus far. We were very happy to see our Mythic Invitational at PAX East perform so incredibly well and the momentum around the game is palpable. It was great to see the fans enjoying the tournament, and also to see the response to War of the Spark and the new storytelling that comes in Q2 this year both in cards as well as on Arena. And I think the lineup and how they've synchronized the storytelling between the 2 platforms is really helping us as we do engage more players in tabletop as well as in the Arena game. And so, I\u2019m really looking forward to quarters to come and years to come around Magic: The Gathering, both Arena and tabletop.","Arpine Kocharian","And then one quick clarification, Brian. You mentioned low-single-digit increase in POS. Was that excluding Toys \"R\" Us or including Toys \"R\" Us?","Brian Goldner","Excluding Toys \"R\" Us.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel.","Andrew Crum","So Brian, you indicated you're starting to see some improvement in your commercial markets including Europe and that's usually reflected in the first quarter results, but doesn't seem to be suggested in your commentary for sales performance for the year. So maybe you could discuss that further. And was Europe profitable during the quarter?","Brian Goldner","Okay. Europe has seen profit improvement in the quarter in a substantial way. We've seen a number of markets perform above a year ago, and we're seeing a lot of progress in markets like France, Germany and Russia and Spain, reengaging consumers with new initiatives and the performance there is quite good. The reason we continue to talk about stabilization is the fact that revenues did grow 8% in the quarter, but were down 1% as reported. Obviously, FX will have an impact throughout the year as we've seen in the first quarter.","Also I know it is limited data, it's only the first couple of months, but thus far, according to NPD, Europe is down and also U.K. is down even more sizably. So we want to continue to see progress in those markets. We've seen progress in the U.K. We're clearly seeing great progress across the European business. The team's doing a great job in onboarding new capabilities and engaging across a growing array of retail footprint and new retailers, which is fantastic. We're seeing that around the world as we continue to expand the retail footprint, and we're seeing growth in new retail channels as well as growth with some of our mass-market partners and online. But again it's early days, and we feel that we're making the kind of progress we expected to make and the team is doing a great job.","Andrew Crum","Okay. Got it. And then just one other quick one, Deb. $49 million of share repurchases during the quarter seems to be pacing well ahead of your guidance for the year. Is there any change in terms of what you expect to repurchase in 2019?","Deborah Thomas","Yes. We still expect to repurchase between $100 million and $150 million, obviously, subject to market condition. And during the first period again just within -- you know, we put a grid in place that we repurchase up too. We just hit that amount within the grid. They just stay so much, but no change to our guidance for the full year.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix","I just wanted to return to Steph's question that was asked at the beginning. And Brian, you highlighted the various drivers to the quarter in your answer, but I think what a lot of us are just wanting to understand better is what was the biggest surprise in the quarter because you were pretty clear at Toy Fair that you'd be down for the reasons you reiterated. But what was the biggest delta between your budget and actual? Was it basically the strength in Europe or was it different products enter domestically. Just can you help us understand that?","Brian Goldner","Yes, sure. While we've seen really good momentum in TRANSFORMERS and we saw growth in the quarter, we've also seen a reengagement of our fans and as well engaging kids. The home entertainment has been very strong for the brand, and we're seeing great progress there. Overall, our Franchise Brands grew quite substantially and PLAY-DOH was off to a good start. MONOPOLY continues to perform at a high level. And then, of course, Magic and Magic Arena is doing really well and early days and that's certainly a strong contributor to growth in the quarter. And yes, we had expected to have advertising, marketing and additional spending around e-sports come later in the year. So our expectation was some more of those revenues might come around more of those type of initiatives once we get broader and we launch and go from open beta. We've just seen great progress and great engagement with the game and I think that those are some of the key drivers. And then there are brands underneath those brands that are also growing some growth in games and other key brands across the portfolio. But I think that that's clearly been one of the key drivers as the growth of Franchise Brands. Europe has made good progress, and we're very pleased with what the team has accomplished there. And yet, it's still early days. And so our expectation for the year continues to be profitable growth, and certain brands are ahead of our expectations.","Deborah Thomas","We also saw some earlier benefit from cost savings than we had expected and just good expense management by the team. They are all very focused on the fact that the first quarter is a small quarter and slight differences can have an impact. Some of our expenses, as Brian mentioned, shifted out. And overall on a full year basis, we still think that the guidance that we gave at Toy Fair is still in line with the full year. It's just in a small quarter when you're focused on having some of those things, they can make a difference even to go from a loss to a profit.","Brian Goldner","Yes, and it is good to see the progress the team is making against the loss of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us.","Deborah Thomas","Right.","Felicia Hendrix","And then -- yes, I want to get to that in a second. But just if you had to size it for all the things that you just listed, it was like Magic, the biggest surprise or is that just one of the many that you listed out?","Brian Goldner","Yes. Look, I think it's great to start a year with the growth of Franchise Brands and the growth of Magic. And I think -- one of the conversations we've had has been as Arena has come to the fore, what would happen to tabletop? And what's heartening to me is to see the engagement the team is creating in-store and with new players. The kinds of new card releases that they're putting out in addition to some of the story-led releases like War of the Spark are really engaging players in-store giving them an easier on-ramp to learn the game. And that's really taken hold. TRANSFORMERS, it's great to see that in addition to great box office and very strong performance in China within the global box office, to see the home entertainment perform at such a high level, to see our business across multiple dimensions performing. We have the additional content from kids, our core audience as well as the fan-oriented content all driving growth in engagement in that brand. A new approach to PLAY-DOH that includes online, social and entertainment, that's really taken hold and some new innovation there. Our wheel segment to get down a little closer to the earth so to speak. And PLAY-DOH is off to a very good start, so new ways to play with the brand. And throughout the year, you're going to see new innovations. So it's great to see the momentum the team is creating early in the year.","Felicia Hendrix","That's really helpful. And then just talking -- getting to the retail landscape. So we're, obviously, well out of the holiday period and Walmart and Target have shrunk their shelf space for toys. The -- we're still seeing toys in the kind of alternative retail channel, if you will, but with kind of Walmart and Target kind of getting more to like a normalized spread of toys in their stores and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us gone, can you just talk to us about where you're making up that the difference the most in the nonholiday times of the year?","Brian Goldner","Sure. Well first, we're seeing continued growth in online revenues. They were increased in high single digits in the quarter. Both pure-play e-com is up and our Amazon business continues to be up, but we're also seeing growth in sales around Walmart and Target and others. In Q1, we also saw the fan grocery, drug, club, department stores and convenience channels posting revenue growth. And then what's also interesting we talked about that Toys \u201cR\u201d Us was no longer in the U.S., but around the world toy specialty had taken hold. And if you exclude Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, toy specialty was also up in the quarter. And if so, whether it's Smyths Toys in Europe or new Toys \u201cR\u201d Us ownership in certain regions, we are seeing momentum there. I mean there are a couple of areas where we're yet to see that momentum. ","In the Pacific markets like Australia, we're still not seeing the growth in that market according to NPD because of the loss of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. And there are few other markets like the U.K. that still are down across the industry, but we're making good progress there to recapture share. And so I think, we talked about the objective of share recapture last year. We'd said we'd seen more share shifts through the holiday period versus share recapture. Now we're starting to see that share recapture that we'd intended to create. We're seeing a lot of merchandising for our products around our Franchise Brands and gaming as well as our Partner Brands coming into the year. And so more linear footage from nontraditional areas, but certainly great core partnerships as we go forward with retailers and it's really great to see.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Ng","My first one is just on the TRANSFORMERS strength. You guys have had 2 consecutive quarters of growth now. Do you think we could get growth in the overall TRANSFORMERS brand in 2019 despite not having a movie this year?","Brian Goldner","You know the team has created lots of demand around that brand in new and different ways. Going forward, we're breaking ground on new media models and partnership with people like -- companies like Netflix where we'll have a whole new entertainment initiative coming next year. The streams of content that we have, have really enabled our brand to step forward. And I'm not going to comment on one year versus another, but I do think that the way we're approaching TRANSFORMERS is really benefiting us. Our fan business is quite strong. This is where our initiative like HasbroPulse is also taking hold, and we've seen really good early results there where we've offered either first-to-market or exclusive product really engaging our fan. We do believe that fan economy is quite strong. So TRANSFORMERS is one of our biggest fan-oriented brands in the company, and we continue to want to drive fan business behind TRANSFORMERS and STAR WARS and MARVEL and PRINCESS and even MY LITTLE PONY. But for TRANSFORMERS, it's clearly benefiting the brand. So as we go forward, we're starting to work on the next movie, but there's a plenty of content coming for that brand over time.","Michael Ng","Okay. And then just on the MTG digital gaming revenue classification. It seems to imply a lot of that reclass comes later in the year. Is it right to describe the first 9 months of that MTG digital revenue in 2018 mostly or exclusively non-Arena products? And then all the Arena revenue was really just in the fourth quarter?","Deborah Thomas","Yes. I think we've had Magic on line for quite a while. If you go back just within a material part of the segment, as we reclassified it, I think you'll see most of the revenue from 2018 coming from other digital products rather than Arena.","Michael Ng","Right. And then Arena was only in the fourth quarter, right?","Deborah Thomas","We started to pick up a bit of revenue from Arena in the fourth quarter, but don't forget we went into open beta kind of...","Brian Goldner","December.","Deborah Thomas","Yes, within the fourth quarter and then started charging within that. So...","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo.","Timothy Conder","Thank you for the color so far. One thing, just -- and you've reiterated that it's early year in the year and obviously on a small quarter things get magnified either way, but wanted to check if your time line in getting back to your 2016 operating earnings margins, is that still as expected? And you said, you're still looking for this year to be expected, but any change in that time line at this point given the early success in several areas?","Brian Goldner","Yes. We've said that if we had a number of things break right for us, we felt that 2020 could be like 2017, and we continue to believe that. Again we're making good progress. It's great to see the momentum coming out of the first quarter. I think many people have asked and wondered whether the company would grow absent Toys \u201cR\u201d Us or how it would grow and so if you want to demonstrate that we're going to grow this year in a profitable manner. And then the team has done a great job in finding new retailers and new points of distribution and new modalities to sell around the world. And it's great to see many of the new capabilities and approach in Europe taking hold as well. So again, early days, but we believe that 2020 can look like 2017 as a few things break right for us.","Timothy Conder","Okay. And then you've commented on Europe and other international areas, but one exception just wanted to visit was Latin America. How has that trended? There's little bumps over the last year, so there -- and how's that looking at this point early on?","Brian Goldner","Yes. Latin America overall's looked good. It's grown -- obviously better growth absent forex. POS was up. Clearly, a market that had a less of an impact from shifting Toys \u201cR\u201d Us tides and we do have a toy specialty down there in market. Our emerging market business, which would include Brazil, was up in the quarter absent foreign exchange. So you know again making some progress. Brazil is not completely in the clear, but we're seeing a substantial progress versus where we were a year ago. Mexico has performed at a very high level and other markets up and down in the quarter.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric Handler","Two questions for you. First, wonder if you could dig in a little bit more on Magic: The Gathering. You saw a pretty sizable spike in viewers on Twitch during the tournament during PAX East. It has since settled down. I think we've got a new pack release coming up in the next week or so. How do you sort of look to shape your marketing over the next couple quarters to sort of keep demand or at least interest in the game elevated?","Brian Goldner","First, it's really heartening to see that more than 700 million games have been played thus far in the open beta. On average, people are spending about 8 hours per week. In Q1, we did more than double the viewer hours on Twitch for the Magic brand and now, Magic Arena is the top 10 e-sports brand. In fact, it's about #8. It was Top 3 during the Mythic Invitational event in that weekend. Our KPIs across the board continue to progress in terms of retention, engagement, monetization, and the game does officially launch later this year. We recognize we had $1 million tournament. We've said this year we would have a $10 million price pool. So we still have more -- the majority of the money to spend the rest of the year as well as bulk of the advertising and marketing related to going beyond the core fan to engage new fans that we're seeing coming to stores and starting to trial the game online. But that's -- our intention is to continue to build this as a very watchable, very engaging brand for gamers of all ages. It's exciting to see -- early days and exciting to see.","Eric Handler","Okay. And then, secondly, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how much of a correlation there is between the revenue of a movie that you're doing licensing with and toy sales? Specifically Avengers, looks like it could be an $800 million global weekend and probably over $2 billion of revenue -- box office revenue for the film. Wondering how that might impact toys? And then particularly China, where Bumblebee was quite big there early in the year, and now we're looking at a $200 million plus opening in China as well for the Avengers. How China might look this year versus last year?","Brian Goldner","Yes. China in the first quarter was up and -- for the company and POS looks good as well. For Avengers, we're incredibly excited. It's really early days. If you recall, last year, we had begun merchandising in Avengers: Infinity War a few weeks earlier in early March versus later in March this year. So we have about a 3 or 4-week shift in timing, but early days. Last 2, 3 weeks have been very strong. Marvel has historically been a key driver of our business, and we supported fully across every dimension from kids through fans and families. We're also focused on preschool. Our Mega Mighties in that area of our business is new initiative for the -- from the team is off to a very strong start. So we're focused on the preschool business as well with new innovative products for preschoolers. But we feel that Marvel and Avengers is going to have a very big year and you're right, China is a part of that equation. ","For Bumblebee, it goes beyond the movie to overall TRANSFORMERS. It's more of the more beloved brands in China. We're very happy to be in partnership with CCTV on a television episodic program that will go on air later this year in prime time on national television called Transformers Nezha. It's based on a combination of TRANSFORMERS and Chinese mythology, but the entertainment looks so good that broadcasters around the world are starting to say, this could be something we take out globally. And we're very excited about continuing to build that relationship with CCTV, other relationships with Tencent, between Magic and things we're doing in our entertainment business. They were part of the funding of the Bumblebee movie. And it's very exciting to see what's possible in China. And again, still early days after a number of years.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Ray Stochel with Consumer Edge.","Raymond Stochel","How are initial shipments of POWER RANGERS product performing? And how would you characterize the performance of Beast Morphers so far? And then if you could also give us an update on NERF and any innovation in the pipeline that we didn't see at Toy Fair that you can give us on NERF at this point?","Brian Goldner","Sure. Well, the launch of POWER RANGERS is starting in North America. The line launch there. We had some products ship in Q1, but limited. It will roll out in the subsequent quarters, both in North America and around the world. I'm very pleased with the ratings of the new show. It's a ratings leader in its time slot. It's offering a very strong lead out. And Nickelodeon's been a very good partner and helping us to market the new series. The team has done a great job in producing this transition from Saban to our own studio has been seamless, and I give the team a lot of credit for producing such a high quality show that's really beloved by kids and improved in a number of ways from the last production. So we're, obviously, very excited about POWER RANGERS, not only for this year, 9 months, but for 2020 as we'll have a full year impact. So very good there. And second question...","Raymond Stochel","The follow-up was on NERF. And if you could give us on -- an update on NERF and then any innovation in the pipeline that you couldn't give us at Toy Fair?","Brian Goldner","Sure. Sorry. On NERF, really excited to see the take away on Fortnite. That initiative now is rolling out around the world, but in the U.S. over the last 3 weeks and then going into Europe, it's been very strong. So it's great to be able to play the game in real life, and I think people are really responding to all of the marketing and content that's being created around that by us and by fans. Later this year, the team has an array of new initiatives and innovations coming. We've talked about covering multiple price points and providing innovation and high quality product at every price point and you'll see that, and that's about all say at this point. But stay tuned, it's a very exciting lineup for NERF not only for '19, but 2020 and beyond.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with D.A. Davidson.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Just on the cost side, I believe you said the SG&A expense was down $25 million year-over-year. Is there anyway you can quantify how much of that is just the headcount reduction initiative? And then I know you've got other initiatives as part of your cost cutting. Can you just touch on, did any of those make an affect in the quarter or are those things later to come? And then my second question is, just as Toy Story 4 hits soon, are you doing any of the categories for that in terms of the licensee? And do you expect the demand for those toys to impact any of your different product lines?","Deborah Thomas","Sure. So I'll take the cost savings, if that's okay, and then Brian, you can take the second one. From a cost savings standpoint, we are seeing our cost savings in line with where we thought it would be. It was actually a little bit better on the expense management side. We have some shifting of expense out of the quarter as well, but we still believe we're firmly on track to that $50 million to $55 million of net savings this year. And just as a reminder, it's still phasing in, which is why we said we would have a higher amount in 2020 when we get the annualized cost savings, though. I think the way that phasing is going, it will continue on through the first quarter and the second quarter and then we'll start to see kind of that full net savings by the fourth quarter, just the way the phasing is going on timing. As far as the other items, we did mention we've got some expense adjustments that kind of continue on with some of that line items in there including like if there's some compensation expense that's bit lower than a year ago, travel -- it's all things all the way through. ","Somewhat offsetting that is we did have some expense with respect to ramping up our warehouse in the U.S. and we talked about that at year-end. So kind of those startup costs we don't expect to have those levels for the rest of the year. And in addition to that, we continue making the investment in our Wizards of the Coast gaming brand. So all the gaming brands, there's an administrative piece that goes with that as well. So we're seeing good cost savings. We -- the whole team around the world, I've to just give them credit, everybody is very focused on expense management as well, and our cost savings are on track and we remain really focused on that. Brian, do you want to...","Brian Goldner","Sure. The team has put together a nice line up for Toy Story, particularly around Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head. As you know, they've been among the cast of the movie and -- historically and it's exciting to see them in the trailers that we've seen thus far, and so you'll see some initiatives from us around some key characters and around the brand.","Operator","Our final question today comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick Johnson","So retailers increased space during the holiday to bring more product and head more doors. Did that continue your first quarter or did they compress back to their original layouts?","Brian Goldner","Yes, we saw an incremental space in the first quarter. We've also seen it beyond our top retailers where we have performed quite well and they've had space a lot of those initiatives are also increasing as we get into this early second quarter recognized at Easter was in the second quarter. The boys' action isle for example a major retailer gets set closer to the Avengers movie. We said Avengers at the end of March around the world. So we are seeing incremental space there, but also as we go out, we talked about these new channels. We've seen great support around the new channels of retail in this first half of the year. And it's indicative of the momentum we're seeing Easter-to-Easter where we said we're up mid-single digits and year-to-date, we're just down couple of percent if we take year versus year recognizing we're still up against some Toys \u201cR\u201d Us headwinds for the first half of the year.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. Then going into second quarter when we compare to last year, do you think these retailers under ordered last year knowing they were facing the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us liquidation competition?","Brian Goldner","I think a number of things. I think that given the liquidation it had us changing strategy at that point, we thought we have far more new initiatives coming in the second quarter this year than we had a year ago, whether it's NERF Fortnite or the Avengers lineup followed by Spider-Man. We're also seeing really good momentum in BABY ALIVE and some new initiatives there. So I think it had to do with all of us trying to understand the market impact the year ago versus going back to our focus on innovation and insights in storytelling for this year and demonstrating that we can grow absent Toys \u201cR\u201d Us.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. Then Bumblebee, as it looks now, can you attempt to quantify the profit contribution from this one or perhaps the return on investment?","Brian Goldner","Yes. Overall, we're in the home entertainment window. Home entertainment is performing at a higher level than our original estimates. So that's quite good. We'll have some estimates from the studio coming up shortly as to where we'll be. And as Deb said, the income or cost associated with the movie will come later this year. The sales associated with Bumblebee have been quite strong. It's also haloed across the brand. We've done a number of what we call G1 or Generation 1 product lines for a number of retailers that have been reminiscent of our '80s product lines as a result of celebrating the '80s is part of the movie. So it's had an impact in our toys and games business, but also an impact in our mobile gaming business as TRANSFORMERS: EARTH WARS has picked up on content around Bumblebee as well are Consumer Products business. And that's in fact why you're seeing Consumer Products -- partly why you're seeing Consumer Products growing in the quarter.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. And I'm going to throw one more and then I'll save the rest for later on. The obvious follow-up to Felicia's question. Could there have been anything that was perhaps pulled into the quarter that could surprise to the downside in the second quarter?","Brian Goldner","No. We didn't really -- there weren't really no pull-ins. As I mentioned, the only brand that was only a few million dollars that shipped in the first quarter that was intended for the initiatives that kickoff in the second quarter was POWER RANGERS because, of course, we couldn't put the product on shelf until the very end of the first quarter, which is in fact what we did, and it was only in North America.","Deborah Thomas","And it was a small number...","Brian Goldner","And with that said, there was a ...","Deborah Thomas","I think we did see some shifting of expenses till later in the year, but again, I'll go back to what I said earlier is full year guidance remains the same.","Operator","I will now hand the call back to Debbie Hancock for closing remarks.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, Rob, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today.

","I would now like to introduce Brian Goldner. Brian?","Brian Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The Hasbro team delivered a tremendous third quarter, the highest revenue and earnings quarter in Hasbro\u2019s history. Revenues grew 14% behind innovative products and engaging storytelling, increasing across all major operating segments and geographies. Operating profit increased faster than revenues, up 19% and we continued investing to profitably grow for years to come. Our financial position is strong, and we returned $112 million in cash to shareholders during the quarter. ","As we develop Hasbro into a global play and entertainment company, we have built robust brand building capabilities, including storytelling that supports an expansive brand portfolio. Today, we're garnering a greater share of life than ever before by reaching broader demographics, play experiences, and geographies. Our innovation, marketing, and investments are informed by the global consumer insights we are uncovering as we engage with consumers and audiences across touch points and mediums. The investments we have made in our digital expertise enable our global teams to develop immersive brand experiences, which in turn elevate our connection with consumers and fans. This has far reaching implications in how we develop brands, engage with consumers, tell stories, and spend our marketing dollars. Our digital expertise is differentiating our brands. Thus far in 2016, videos Hasbro curated or created, along with user generated content, garnered nearly 5 billion views. ","Third quarter revenues grew at a double digit pace in both the US and Canada and international segments. Developed economies, including the US, Canada, UK, France, and Italy, each grew revenues double digits. Emerging markets increased 16% with strong growth in Latin America including Brazil as well as in Asia, including China. The industry also continued to grow, up 6% through August according to industry and company estimates, and Hasbro is gaining share. Importantly, we gained share in emerging markets such as Brazil and Russia as well as developed economies including the US, UK, Spain, Italy and Australia. ","Global point of sale increased slightly in the quarter, overcoming difficult entertainment comparisons at retail, including a later set date for Star Wars this year and post movie declines for Jurassic World. Girls and games POS increased, while Boys and Preschool declined. We are seeing strong POS as we start the fourth quarter. In respect to Hasbro\u2019s third quarter revenues, Hasbro franchise brands increased 2%. This growth was lead by Magic The Gathering, Nerf, Transformers, and Play-Doh. Nerf grew for the 15th consecutive quarter, while Play-Doh extended its growth streak to 20 straight quarters. In addition, Transformers and Magic The Gathering revenues increased. Transformers, Robots in Disguise animation, as well as streaming content from Machinima is supporting product lines which have strong initial consumer reaction. Importantly, Transformers has good momentum heading into 2017, which marks the first of 3 years with planned major theatrical entertainment. ","We have momentum in our gaming portfolio, with growth in several brands driving the 13% increase in the category. Magic The Gathering, Duel Masters, Pie Face, Simon and Bop-It were among the brands posting positive gains. Despite most of Magic\u2019s revenue not being included in our POS reports, POS for the games category grew. Hasbro's gaming portfolio is unmatched and we are cultivating gaming experiences across a multitude of platforms, including face to face gaming, off the board gaming, and digital gaming experiences, notably in Mobile. One of our newest games, Speak Out, has generated more than 100 million online views. Consumer takeaway has been extremely strong and we are working to catch up to demand. Within our mobile gaming portfolio, Backflip Studios is scheduled to unveil an all-new mobile game, DragonVale World, during the fourth quarter. This marks the first major release for this gaming property since Hasbro took a 70% stake in the studio. ","Backflip has also unveiled several new mobile games this year based on Hasbro brands, including Transformers, Earth Wars, and just last week My Little Pony Puzzle Party. The My Little Pony franchise continued to drive brand awareness through the strategic use of entertainment, pop culture events, and consumer products expansion. In a very competitive small doll segment, our holiday items and new launches are beginning to drive POS gains in many markets around the world. In 2017, the My Little Pony movie will bring global audiences to all new worlds, with both the core cast of characters, along with all new characters. ","In addition to our franchise brand and gaming portfolio, innovative new offerings at a variety of price points delivered growth for Baby Alive, Furby, and FurReal Friends. Within our partner brands portfolio, revenues increased 19%, driven by positive contributions from Hasbro's shipments of Disney Princess and Disney's Frozen, DreamWorks\u2019 Trolls and Yo-Kai Watch. For the full year, we now expect partner brand revenues to approach 30% of total Hasbro revenue. Hasbro's line of Disney Princess and Disney Frozen is off to a strong start, behind a favorable reception to our core Shemar fashion doll assortment. ","Overall, the brands are ahead of our plans for the year, and we recently expanded our offering with new holiday items, as well as new items in support of entertainment for Elena of Avalor and Moana. Star Wars continues to be a top global property with strong consumer and retail support around the world. Rogue One, a Star Wars story product, was on shelves September 30, which was several weeks later than last year's on-shelf date of September the 4th. This shift most notably impacted our US POS results. Our expectation remains that our 2016 Star Wars' revenue may match the level we achieved in 2015. ","In addition, Yo-Kai Watch and DreamWorks\u2019 Trolls contributed to our partner brand portfolio gains this quarter. Yo-Kai Watch is now available in global markets, including strong initial performances in several countries. Our DreamWorks Trolls line hit shelves in the third quarter. Working closely with DreamWorks throughout the development of the movie, we have a robust offering of dolls, plush games, and more in support of the global movie premieres over the next several weeks. ","In closing, we've made great strides throughout 2016, including the third quarter, which historically is the largest revenue quarter of our year. Hasbro and our retailers are well positioned to deliver on what we expect to be a strong holiday season for Hasbro brands. Our initiatives are resonating with consumers and we have good retailer support. In addition, inventory available at retail and at Hasbro is improved from this time last year. We are very well positioned heading into 2017 when the entertainment lineup from Hasbro and our partners is among the best we have ever experienced. ","I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deb Thomas","Thank you, Brian and good morning everyone. Our third quarter results highlighted the strength of Hasbro\u2019s business, across brands, geographies and our global team. Throughout 2016, we've exceeded our expectations in terms of performance, both on the top and bottom line and we're set for a strong finish to the year. 14% quarterly revenue growth drove a 19% increase in quarterly operating profit. We grew margins while investing in our business, in innovation across our brand portfolio, in storytelling across mediums, in our consumer product global talent and in digital expertise, including projects for Magic The Gathering, and new gaming launches at Backflip Studios. ","Over the trailing 12 month period, we generated $637 million in operating cash flow, ending the quarter with $830 million in cash in our balance sheet. As we look to the full year, we have good momentum in our brands, including our new line supporting Disney Princess and Disney\u2019s Frozen. In addition, we're supporting more motion pictures in the fourth quarter than last year. We have the right inventory in the right places, both at retail and in our warehouses to support this momentum. ","For the third quarter 2016, we grew revenues in each major operating segment. In the US and Canada segment, revenues increased 16%. Revenue growth in the games and girls categories more than offset declines in the boys in preschool categories. Hasbro franchise brand revenues grew 2% with growth in from Magic The Gathering, Nerf and Transformers. ","Partner brand revenues increased 13% in the segment, behind contributions from Hasbro\u2019s line of Disney Princess and Disney's Frozen, DreamWorks Trolls and to a lesser extent Yo-Kai Watch. Additional Hasbro brands, including Baby Alive, Easy Bake, Pie Face and Furby, also contributed to the year over year growth for the segment. ","US point of sales declined slightly in the quarter, given difficult comparisons to Jurassic World and a shift in timing for Star Wars on-shelf dates versus last year. POS increased in the mid-teens for the first three quarters, and is positive to start the fourth quarter. Retail inventory continued to be of very good quality and has grown primarily from the addition of new initiatives. ","Operating profit in the US and Canada segment increased 22% to $228 million or 24.4% of net revenues. Similar to prior quarters this year, higher revenues drove improved expense leverage. International segment revenues grew 13%, including a negative $3 million impact from foreign exchange. Within the international segment, the boys, girls in preschool categories grew, while the games category was flat. Franchise brand revenues increased 4% with growth in Magic The Gathering, Play-Doh, Nerf and Transformers. Partner brand revenues increased 30%, behind Hasbro\u2019s shipments of Disney's Princess and Disney's Frozen, Yo-Kai Watch and DreamWorks Trolls. Hasbro brands Baby Alive and Pie Face also contributed to the segments strong performance. ","Operating profit in the segment increased 17% to $133.1 million, or 19.3% of net revenues. The international segment continued to generate greater expense leverage. Through the first 9 months of the year, currencies negatively impacted revenues by $49.1 million. Based on current economic trends, we anticipate a potential further impact of up to approximately $25 million for the remainder of the year. Despite an improved currency translation outlook from where we began the year, the impact from currency varies by market, and our global teams continue to manage the ongoing economic impact on retailers, and consumers from currency devaluations in several markets around the world. ","Entertainment and licensing segment revenues increased 8% behind revenue growth in consumer product licensing and digital gaming. Segment operating profit decreased $2.2 million or 13% to $14.1 million or 25.1% of net revenues. Higher revenues and lower program production amortization were partially offset by investments in building our consumer products team globally and higher expenses at Backflip Studios in support of new gaming launches. Boulder Media revenue and expenses are being recorded in this segment, and were not material in the quarter. ","Overall operating profit increased 19% and operating profit margin gained 100 basis points versus last year. Double digit revenue growth drove improved expense leverage for the quarter as well as year to date. For the full year, we anticipate operating margin in line with, or up slightly from last year. ","Cost of sales in the third quarter declined slightly as a percentage of sales and continued to benefit from growth in partner brands. This growth in partner brand revenue also led to an increase in royalties, which at 8% of revenues is up 30 basis points year over year. We now expect royalties for the full year to be in the range of our year to date level of 8.1% of revenues and last year's level of 8.5%.","Program production cost amortization declined in the quarter, and is running lower in 2016 than last year as we've delivered and are amortizing fewer television programs. Content Development and storytelling remain core to our strategic investments, and we\u2019ve spent $36 million in cash on television and film production over the first 9 months of the year. In addition, during the third quarter we acquired Boulder Media to enhance our animation and storytelling expertise. ","SG&A as a percentage of sales was up slightly versus last year. The increase reflected higher spending on digital programs including Magic The Gathering and Backflip. ","Compensation expense increased during the quarter, and we anticipate will increase further in the fourth quarter as we true up 2 years of successful performance on long term plans versus measures we set several years ago.","Turning to our results below operating profit, other income was $8.5 million versus $5.1 million last year. The improvement resulted from a small foreign currency translation gain this year versus a loss last year. And to a lesser extent, higher interest income and growth in earnings from our share of the Discovery Family Channel. ","On a reported basis, the third quarter of 2015 included a $6.8 million gain from the sale of 2 manufacturing facilities. Absent the gain, other expense was $1.7 million last year. The underlying tax rate was 26.1%, down from 27.2% last year and down slightly from 26.4% for the full year 2015. Diluted earnings per share was $2.03 compared to EPS of $1.64 last year. ","Our balance sheet remains strong. Strong cash generation enabled us not only to invest in growing Hasbro, but also to return cash to our shareholders. During the third quarter we returned $112.4 million to shareholders, $64 million in dividends, and $48.4 million in share repurchases. We've spent $106 million in share repurchases through the first three quarters of 2016. This is in line with our full year target of our purchasing $100 million to $150 million, which as always is subject to market conditions.","Receivables at quarter end increased 5% versus the 14% revenue growth, and DSOs decreased 7 days to 78 days. Our accounts receivable remain in good condition and collections continue to be strong.","Inventories increased 36% versus last year. The overall quality of this inventory is good, and our inventory availability has improved from this point last year. More than $100 million of the year over year increase is in Disney Princess and Disney's Frozen, Yo-Kai Watch and Trolls, which are all new lines for Hasbro, and for Pie Face, which is a much bigger business this year than last. We\u2019re also supporting multiple films in the fourth quarter, including Rogue One. The later on-shelf date and our better inventory availability for this line resulted in Hasbro having more inventory on our books at quarter end last year. At year end, we believe we will have the appropriate inventory to support our lines as well as new initiatives occurring early in 2017, including Disney's live action Beauty and the Beast film. ","Finally, our retail inventories have grown in support of these successful new initiatives, and growing Hasbro brands. In closing we have the right brand, the right assets, and the right teams to deliver a successful year and we remain committed to taking the right strategic steps to position Hasbro for 2017 and beyond.","Brian and I are now happy to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Stephanie Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your questions. ","Stephanie Wissink","Thanks. Good morning everyone, and congratulations on a very, very well done quarter. So 2 questions. One, just a clarification, Deb on the inventory. I appreciate the $100 million of incremental brands that you didn't have last year, but even excluding that, inventory balance was still up into the teens. So can you maybe explain a little bit of where that inventory is basketed and where we should look for that inventory to progress here over the next kind of 90 to 120 days? And then just secondly, your operating profit in the US or in the North American segment was very, very strong. I'm wondering if that's something that we should look for going forward to continue to be strong, or if there was something unique in the quarter that allowed you to really stretch up into the mid-20s. Thank you. ","Deb Thomas","Why don\u2019t I take the inventory question and then maybe Brian can talk about operating profit in the US. But from an inventory standpoint, our inventory is up. If you recall at the end of the third quarter last year, we were chasing some product and we had only begun to start introducing the -- or building to introduce Pie Face a little bit later in the year. So about half of the increase in our inventory is in, it sits in our international segments where believe it or not, at the end of the quarter, we had an increase because of FX, just the way the rates landed at the end of the quarter versus throughout the whole period. So the remainder of the inventory, the $100 million of increase really was due to new lines. The additional piece is due to being in a better position for some of the things that are doing very well this year, like Nerf and Play-Doh. ","In addition we have Star Wars inventory which was, for Rogue One launch, happened at September 30th which was -- Force Friday was September 4th a year ago. So overall this just contributed to having a bit more inventory in place at the end of the quarter, but at a lower percentage increase than I think what we saw at the end of the second quarter. And as we look to year end, we will be in a good position. We do expect inventory to be up, but not by as much at the end of the year as we have some great new launches coming in the first quarter of 2017, including Disney's live action Beauty and the Beast, which happened early in the quarter. So we do expect to see inventories up, but at a lower rate. ","Brian Goldner ","On the US business, Steph, we continue to see the team making great progress. They've continued to partner with retailers. We\u2019re seeing a range of brands and growth across our portfolio, growth in gaming and certainly significant growth in girls. In the boys business, year to date continues to perform well obviously in the quarter. Star Wars is down, but year to date, Star Wars is up significantly, so again that's an opportunity as we think about the full year. So the team continues to do a very strong job in marketing and looking at expenses, and working with retailers to ensure they have great inventory that's delivered more just in time and managing a strong P&L. ","Stephanie Wissink","Thank you. Best of luck for the holiday. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please go ahead with your questions. ","Drew Crum","Okay, thanks. Good morning everyone. So Deb or Brian, I think you've mentioned that you expect partner brands to comprise 30% of revenue for the year, and you noted that Disney Princess and Frozen was outperforming your original expectations. What else is driving that increase? Are there other partner brands that are driving that mix shift or is there a shortfall in one of your franchise brands? That's my first question. Second question is on POS. I think you mentioned that it was up modestly in the third quarter, but you were seeing an uptick at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Are you suggesting that you're seeing an acceleration, and any comment on POS trends for Rogue One albeit we know it\u2019s early in the fourth quarter, but just any comment there. Thank you.","Brian Goldner","So you're right, Drew. We are in fact seeing really strong POS trends entering the fourth quarter, particularly in the US. We saw a little bit of softness in POS in the late summer, July, August period. And then in September given the shift in Star Wars as well as the impact from Jurassic, that impacted our US POS. Internationally, we're seeing very strong POS, up double digits, in Europe, up in Latin America, up year to date in Asia-Pacific. And then in the quarter in Asia Pacific, particularly in Australia, recently we've seen some retail issues with a retailer where there was just less inventory taken, and a little bit less of a sell-through and therefore impacted that HAPM number, the Asia-Pacific number because of Australia. So overall we feel very good about the POS trends year to date, and the POS trends going into fourth quarter, with a little bit of a note in the third quarter due to some of those timing shifts and some of the brands that have come down significantly versus year ago. ","As we think about Disney Princess, it\u2019s performing incredibly strongly and it's ahead of our original plan for the year. Our global teams in partnership with Disney are doing an excellent job. And in fact, we're seeing great growth from areas like our Royal Shimmer Fashion Dolls. That\u2019s the all 11 princesses, not even including Anna and Elsa. For the holidays, we have a big presence coming for the Royal Dreams Fashion Doll Castle, so we even give girls great places to play with their dolls. Deb mentioned some of the entertainment, but also note that in 2017 in the first quarter, we'll have the broadcast premiere of Frozen. We\u2019ll have a holiday special next year from Frozen. We also have Elena of Avalor, which is off to a very strong start as a television initiative, and then we're also very excited about the launch of Moana. So all of those elements leading to a very strong princess business, and we've made great strides in making great progress there toward our long term objective of growing that business far beyond where it had been in the past.","Drew Crum","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning, and thank you. Thanks for all the POS color. I think some people were curious why it wasn\u2019t in the deck, but if you wanted to commented on that, but that's not really a question I have. If you could comment on your POS ex Star Wars and Princess, that would be helpful.","Brian Goldner","Yes. The POS for our business, as I said Star Wars POS internationally in the quarter was very strong. Princess POS is strong, but it's a new initiative. So we have underlying strong POS from a number of categories. Our games business was up in a significant manner. Several girls\u2019 brands beyond Princess and Frozen were up.","In fact the girls business would have been up in the third quarter absent Princess and Frozen. So our boys business because of Nerf -- Nerf business is up significantly. Transformers business in the quarter was up. We're really seeing how the addition of fan-oriented content that started this season on Machinima, combined with our core boys entertainment, combined with our preschool boys entertainment, is really driving that brand, and going to take it to the next level and set it up really well for 2017 when we go into our first year of 3 anticipated movies over the next 3 years. So we've got a lot of strength in our portfolio beyond Disney Princess and Frozen and Star Wars.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Helpful, thank you. And then can you just -- you had this shift in Force Friday, and I think it's just, it causes a little bit of modeling confusion. I was just wondering if you could help us understand like for like POS for the Force Friday weeks.","Brian Goldner","Yes. So as I said, POS internationally wasn't as impacted by the shift. The shift is really around a lot of the US, the way the US retailers really went after Force Friday a year ago and this year it was September the 30th. So that was our week 36 last year, which was in our third quarter, and this year it's our week 40 which is in our fourth quarter. So as Deb noted, it means that the inventory for that initiative was on our books at the end of the third quarter wasn't yet really out at retail as significantly it was a year ago. So therefore you didn't have that rate of sell-through in POS. And so you saw that reflected in our third quarter POS, particularly in the US business. Internationally, you didn't see quite the same impact. So overall, I would say a couple of things. First, Star Wars year to date sales, revenues are up significantly through the third quarter. So as we look at the full year, we look at international POS, and the POS we're seeing coming into the fourth quarter now that we have inventory, we again reiterate our belief that 2015 levels could equal 2016 levels for the Star Wars brand. ","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, and the reason why I ask is mainly that there\u2019s some expectations in the media community for Star Wars box office to be down year over year in a double digit. So despite that, you\u2019re still confident in Star Wars being flat year over year.","Brian Goldner","Look, as I said, we're up significantly year to date. I looked at a lot of data coming into this conversation, and I will tell you that the POS we're seeing around the world is incredibly strong region for region. We saw a bit of a decline in this quarter due to the timing shift between the 2 merchandising dates, but as we come into the fourth quarter, whether it's our preschool Star Wars initiative or our product in support of Rogue One, we are seeing great takeaway. We also see the movie as having wonderful play patterns. Obviously you've seen some of the trailers and you could imagine all the character play and vehicle play that will come and role play that will come as a result of the movie. And as we\u2019ve said, we look at the business year on year, versus quarter for quarter, and that's been consistent throughout the year. So we're incredibly excited about this movie, and then obviously as we get into 2017, we\u2019ll have home entertainment window for this movie and then we go into another trilogy movie in 2017. So again we have very strong expectations for Star Wars, and that will happen over time as well. ","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, great. And then just Deb some housekeeping, just can you -- FX impact on the fourth quarter, how should we think about that?","Deb Thomas ","We have about $50 million of FX for the year, year to date through the end of the third quarter, and we said we could have up to about $25 million more for the rest of the year, and really which is not very different from what we said at the end of the second quarter. And really what we're seeing is it's primarily with the UK pound and seeing what happens with the pound over the last few months of the year. ","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jamie Katz with Morningstar. Please proceed with your questions. ","Jaime Katz","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I think you mentioned that retail inventories were also up as well as in-house inventories dues to new initiatives. And I'm curious what you guys might be doing differently this year versus last year to facilitate those brick and mortar sales. ","Brian Goldner","Well, if you look a year ago, I think we forget quickly that a year ago in the third quarter we talked a lot about chasing inventory and that we're trying to catch up given the September 4th launch. So this year we've done a better job across the company and particularly in our US business to ensure we had inventories of great initiatives that we're selling at a high rate. So our retail inventories are up, but up around the brands that are selling quite well, and so we're in support of those. Our percent in stocks have improved year on year. That\u2019s something that we care about. We want to make our shelf spaces productive as possible in partnership with our retailers, but equally importantly we are seeing significant increases in online sales. ","And those online sales are several fold higher than our overall sales, and we're also seeing online sales increases across every one of our categories, and this is US data. Whether it's boys, girls, pre-school or games, we're seeing significant online sales increases. So where we are able to provide our product lines and our brands directly to the consumer via our retail partners online, we are seeing great takeaway and our brands are really resonating. So that also for us is a great bellwether for how consumers are responding to our products and brands. ","Jaime Katz","And then can you guys talk about general trends you're seeing in Europe? I think performance had been pretty lumpy there prior to this year, but the last few quarters have done pretty well. Is there any general trend that you guys are seeing that is making that happen, or a particular segment category that is resonating better with those consumers? Thanks. ","Brian Goldner","We're really seeing overall our European business, it comes first down to great leadership across companies and our countries. Our team is leading quite well. This past quarter we were in the UK with our Northern European team and down in Spain with Southern European team and Russian teams getting to meet a lot of our management teams. They are doing a fantastic job in executing our brand blueprint to a greater extent. We're going to market as one voice, meaning consumer products licensing hand in hand with our toys and games business. We're doing a better job in placing our content around the continent and getting our content played with major broadcasters. We have around the world, so this includes Europe as well as other global players, more than 50 SVOD platforms that are now playing our content. So again, I think that we are just executing the brand blueprint. I said in 2015 I thought it was the first year you could really see the brand blueprint come to life and the European team, along with teams around the world, are really executing the blueprint for the second year in a highly evident way. ","Jaime Katz","Thank you so much. Nice quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arpine Kocharyan with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. ","Arpine Kocharyan","Hi, thank you very much for taking my question. Brian, you gave some helpful color on POS earlier. You mentioned Q4 so far is up. Could you perhaps give some more color the actual trajectory, how much it is up because that period will include Star Wars and we know there was a merchandising date shift of course in Q3? And then in terms of Disney Princess, do you have any color at all on POS in the US like for like for that brand in Q3? In other words, I know you didn't make the dolls last year, but in terms of industry wide, where that brand is trending year over year in Q3 and heading into Q4. And then I have an operating margin question. ","Brian Goldner","Sure. So if you divide up Disney Princess into two pieces, the princess business is up like for like year on year. If you look at the mix, it's a bit more mixed toward lower priced product and that has to do with the fact that there are some lower price SKUs from prior product inventory that are still selling through in the third quarter. So overall, we're seeing growth in our business and we're seeing like for like stronger takeaway for our products, but we're also seeing a stronger takeaway into the third quarter for lower priced products that will be eliminated over the next quarter or two. We're seeing great takeaway in the fashion dolls offering all 11 fashion dolls. We're seeing great early takeaway from Elena of Avalor, so again overall Princess and Frozen performing well.","And Frozen, what's great is that the brand is performing for us at quite a strong level and Frozen has even more of an international footprint than the Princess business on a percentage basis. So more countries around the world are really focusing in on Frozen with great results globally, and you see that indicated in some of our POS data. Frozen is tending to be slightly more internationally oriented on percentage terms. Obviously we're benefiting from a great campaign that's begun this fall called Dream Big Princess in partnership with the Disney Company. And of course we're very much looking forward to all of the new entertainment coming next year. The broadcast debut of Frozen, the Frozen Holiday Special, first quarter seeing a Beauty and the Beast live action movie, Elena of Avalor on television and of course Moana coming in the next few weeks. ","Arpine Kocharyan","Thank you. Very helpful. And then I had a quick follow up on full year guidance for operating margins. Seems like in-line is slightly up. Could you just talk about what that implies for Q4? Seems like that would imply Q4 would be a little bit softer than a year to date.","Deb Thomas","What we really do think of in terms of the full year when we think about our business. We mentioned some of the things that we expected would be impacting us in the fourth quarter. Our results are running better than we had planned. Certainly we planned our business a few years back, so we've got some compensation expense that's in addition, and we continue investing for the future of the business. That impacts the year pretty ratably as we spend for things like our new Backflip game launches and our Magic The Gathering digital next platform, our online platform for Magic as well. So we'll see some things continuing in to the fourth quarter from what we've seen to date. ","Arpine Kocharyan","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Swartz with SunTrust. Please proceed with your questions. ","Michael Swartz","Hey, good morning everyone. Just wanted to touch on the boys business, and parse through some of the moving parts of the different properties there, Brian. I think in the past you said Jurassic Park was about $100 million headwind to this year. I think in a past conference call, you also said Transformers was kind of down, or off 20%. Can you can clarify that, and then maybe just give us a view of what some of the others are doing. Star Wars is up, but Marvel, how should we think about that this year?","Brian Goldner","Yes. So if you look at boys business in the quarter, the biggest decline both for boys and for our company in the quarter was Jurassic. That\u2019s the impact that it had. In the quarter, Marvel is up a bit in the boy\u2019s business. Our action figure business is performing at quite a high level. We had -- it was a strong contributor to the quarter. We had a great partnership on a superhero spectacular retail program with Disney and with Marvel. Our Marvel Legends business is performing quite well. Spider-Man is also performing quite strongly, which is a great lead into next year's movie. And so that's what we're seeing. We also have got a lot of fan-oriented product. It's one of the brands that\u2019s responding the most to our fan orientation and fanning the flames of our fans and providing product to them that they really like and offering that online, and you'll see some products for fans around Doctor Strange. ","As you go forward, Nerf is growing dramatically for both quarter as well as year to date. Star Wars as I said year to date is up significantly, down in the quarter. Transformers is up. As I noted, Transformers is up pretty substantially in the quarter, and it has to do with the fact that we continue to improve the blueprint and add element to the blueprint this quarter with the Machinima content running the Combiner Wars, and that product performing at quite a strong level. So Transformers business is doing well. We also add to that, the Backflip Studios Transformers Earth Wars, which is all around Combiner Wars. So again, executing that blueprint. We even had fan created product in the quarter, which is a combiner called Victorion created by fans. We\u2019re allowing fan to curate along with the content that we're streaming. So 3 types of content, and it's a strong lead in to our 2017 plans for Transformers. ","In addition, I forgot to mention, but in Marvel, we have very strong plans leading to next year in 2017 obviously with Guardians of the Galaxy, with the Spider-Man movie, and a Thor movie. So we're in a good position on the Marvel boys business overall. And then of course a new initiative that's working to particularly well in early days internationally is Yo-Kai Watch. We've just started the launch in international markets, and we're seeing some great takeaway there. So overall that\u2019s kind of our boys\u2019 line up. And as I said, on Star Wars to repeat, we do expect that Star Wars could equal Star Wars levels of 2015 across the company.","Michael Swartz","That's very helpful and then just to maybe continue on the Transformers commentary, just kind of the blueprint that you've been laying, I mean the old rule of thumb was, in the year after a movie, that property would fall about 50%. Is there a new kind of way to look at that going forward with the next iteration in Transformers coming next year?","Brian Goldner","I think we're really entering a new era, and it's really an objective that we have across the company as we expand our blueprint and go to the next iteration of our blueprint for our company. You're going to see in 2017 2 Hasbro films, so certainly Transformers. You\u2019re also going to see a My Little Pony animated feature in the fall. The opportunity in Transformers is to take the storytelling into movies for multiple years, and you'll see that in \u201817, \u201818, and \u201819, with different kinds of stories being told. So not every movie will be the same, but every movie continues to add to the character and story of the property. When we first started, our objective was always to build the brand enterprise value through the blueprint. ","And so this is the next logical step. I took a step back as we came into the third quarter call just to give a perspective on our franchise brands and brands like Transformers. So I looked at franchise brands as we were sitting here at the end of the third quarter in 2013, and take it today, year to date versus year to date \u201813 versus \u201816, our franchise brands are up 33%. And that's the view we take to our business, is that longer view of building brands over time, adding elements to our blueprint, adding capabilities, and taking our brands over time to the next level. So that's indicative of the way that we think about franchise brands. So Transformers steps up. My Little Pony steps up for next year and then in the next couple of years, you'll also see the Littlest Pet Shop stepping up to more content in a number of ways. ","Michael Swartz","Okay, great. And then shifting over to Deb. Just in terms of amortization for the year, the outlook there for both I guess the intangible piece as well as the production cost piece.","Deb Thomas","The intangible is consistent with what we put out at the beginning of the year. And as far as program production amortization, we do expect -- and it's purely because of timing. We haven't delivered as many programs as we had planned to this year. So I think we had been saying it\u2019ll be about 1% of revenue. We now expect it'll be a bit less than that for the full year. However we still expect to spend on a cash spend basis about $60 million full year. ","Michael Swartz","Okay, that's great. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup. Pleas proceed with your questions.","Greg Badishkanian","Thank you. Just as we think about 2017 entertainment, there seems to be a lot of entertainment next year. How are you thinking about that overall expanding category sales as it has done in the past versus cannibalizing sales because maybe some of the entertainment gets lost? And also just how you feel about your entertainment in 2017 and then putting into perspective what you have in 2016. ","Brian Goldner ","Yes. So overall in 2017, we are incredibly excited about the lineup. I think over time what we've seen is that entertainment is stretching the retail calendar, both online and at brick and mortar globally. With more entertainment initiatives occurring, but spreading the calendar to be now from the first quarter through the fourth quarter, versus the older thinking of just looking at summer movies. And that\u2019s quite good for our business and good for the way we think about executing our blueprint. In the first quarter, we have new initiatives coming from Disney and Beauty and the Beast live action. There\u2019s a Wolverine movie coming that helps to continue to support the X-Men business. ","And then Guardians of the Galaxy, a Transformers movie both coming in the summer, but spaced. A Spider-Man movie coming, which is very exciting. That's a great brand for us and we're looking forward to really executing that across multiple platforms. My Little Pony comes in fall in October and then you have Thor of course, then you have Episode Eight, sorry, Star Wars Episode Eight in December. So a great spread of entertainment and then combine that with our television efforts across multiple platforms and then the Walt Disney Company with its television efforts across Spider-Man, Avengers and Guardians. We have a very robust lineup for 2017 that we're very excited about both from Hasbro having two animated films and multiple TV series as well as our partners. And I think we are well positioned coming into 2017.","Greg Badishkanian","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please proceed with your questions.","Eric Handler","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Deb, a follow up question for you on the operating margin outlook for the year and some questions or some statements you made about compensation expense being higher, the Magic The Gathering digital platform. So as we look at some of the additional line items that make up the expense lines, are we going to need to see then a big increase as a percentage of revenue, the SG&A line relative to where it was last year in the fourth quarter, same thing with gross margin or maybe product development?","Deb Thomas","Again we've talked earlier in the year and really haven't changed our thought process around product development or gross margin as far as being able to sustain the levels that we experienced again on a full year. So we do try to stress, we think about the business on a full year basis. Royalties, we did say we expected to be up a bit given the performance of our partner brands, the strong performance over our expectations. So we'll see that line item go up and we continue to just invest in product development to the levels that that we had talked about earlier in the year. As far as advertising, we do have consistent advertising expectations for the full year. So I think it's just a matter of the additional expense that we see kind of over and above what you would normally see in the quarter. And that's what we tried to explain this quarter as well. ","Eric Handler","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your questions.","Tim Conder","Thank you. Brian or Deb, whoever wants to take this, just want to get a little more color on the strength you're seeing in Brazil. And then China also, a little bit more color there. And then if we take that, can you give us any color how China in particular, your mix of brick and mortar versus online and then after we hit those geographic areas, the other part would go back to inventories. Where do you see turns stabilizing here and when? And as we see the online portion grow, how is that going to factor in on a go forward basis there?","Brian Goldner","If you look at the emerging market business overall, it grew 16% in the quarter. We saw a very strong growth in Russia. We saw strong growth in Brazil. Although the market was a little more flattish in Brazil, and we saw strong growth in China. The impact in Asia- Pacific POS as I noted was really an Australian issue with a retailer that we're working through, but our market share in Australia has also grown despite that short-term issue. In China, we're seeing very strong double digit growth. The teams are really executing around the blueprint. If you go to stores in China, what you see is our brands coming to life between consumer products as well as our toys and games, our entertainment on the air there, as well obviously our movies are incredibly important. And Transformers, as you know, is one of the most well-known brands in China and beloved. And it's an area for us of a significant opportunity for long-term growth between that and several of our other brands that we've launched across franchise and partner brands. ","In Brazil, we've seen great growth. In fact, in Brazil we enjoy the position of number one doll line right now with Baby Alive. It's a category where the baby doll business particularly is particularly strong. We've seen overall global growth for Baby Alive, but Brazil is particularly a baby doll market. And if you think about turns of inventory, clearly underlying turns of inventory in our business is growing. When you add new initiatives, you need to provide inventory to satisfy the demand for those new initiatives and not cannibalize those to the rest of your business, because these are additive opportunities, and we're seeing great acceleration in POS for those new initiatives, be it Disney Princess or Frozen, and then the next several weeks, we'll see Trolls movie hit theaters around the world, and of course we\u2019re lining up for the Trolls business across a multitude of categories and segments, and very excited about that. ","Yo-Kai Watch as I noted was some additional inventory. That is already paying dividends in that -- the takeaway particularly in some international markets where we have great TV placement is doing quite well. So our turns of inventory and our management of inventory continues to improve. We continue to get leverage in our business over time, and make improvements in operating margins over time as a company, and that's our objective over time, is to grow operating profit faster than revenues, and we've done that in the quarter, and we intend to continue to do that. ","Tim Conder","Okay, and then any comments on your expectations for Furby and how that's going to ramp?","Brian Goldner","Furby is in the early days, but early days are good. It\u2019s a very sophisticated product in that it provides content through Bluetooth. It's a closed environment, so we've taken care of all the security and safety measures that are noted. It's not a 2 way device. It\u2019s a one way device that brings out new content to the fan and to the user. And early days are quite good. Takeaway is good and both retail and online sales are strong. ","Tim Conder","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Trevor Young with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Trevor Young","Hi, Thanks for taking my question. I believe you said partner brands should approach 30% of revenue versus about 28% last year. Even with your revised royalty guidance, it would imply that 4Q royalty would be down year-over-year, despite potentially supporting more movie franchises in 4Q. Could you maybe help me understand some of the moving pieces there? ","Deb Thomas","It's really about product mix so depending on how you model our franchise and our own brands versus partner brands, that's really all about the mix.","Brian Goldner","Yeah, if you look in the quarter, royalties are running 8% up against 7.7% last year. All Deb had noted was that we could be 8.1 or a bit for the full year up against a year ago number of 8.5. So again, I think we're in that range. We\u2019re ranging it for you, and again, it does have to do a lot with product mix and certainly we've seen growth of our business in other areas, but trying to give you a broad sense of what we think.","Trevor Young","Okay, great. And just kind of following on that then, as partner brands increase as a percentage of revenue, should we see continued slight benefit to gross margin? I know you said sticking with your guidance of roughly in line with last year. ","Brian Goldner","Yeah. So again, we're not suggesting that partners\u2019 brands are going to continue to grow over time beyond the range that they're in. I think they're up a bit versus what we'd said earlier. We thought they might come in around 25% over time. And over time I would believe around 25%, 27% is about right. They\u2019re a bit heavier in this year given the number of new initiatives we're launching for the first time, particularly Princess and Frozen. And obviously that has an impact in the early days on operating margin given that we are building our economy of scale and expertise and investment in that area and that we do believe over time the operating margin for Princess approaches the run rate operating margin for our partner brands. We\u2019ve made great progress there. We\u2019re ahead of where we thought we'd be this time in the year, but we still have a long way to go toward the opportunity to grow that business over time. ","Trevor Young","Great. Thanks so much. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO. Please proceed with your questions. ","Gerrick Johnson","Good morning. You did mention performance of Challenger brands. Perhaps a word there. Then related to that, I also understand you may be throwing off some of these brands. Can you talk about that strategy? Thank you. ","Brian Goldner","Sure. In fact I think we mentioned that several of our Challenger brands were up in the quarter. Baby Alive was up. Easy-Bake was up in the quarter. FurReal Friends was up in the quarter and those brands were all up as well year to date. So our teams who are working on our Challenger brands are doing quite a good job in identifying and creating lighthouse identities. As we normally would say, we don't really comment on M&A overall. We continue to look at our brand portfolio. We own about 1,500 brand names and we look at brands that have the greatest global potential enterprise value. And over time, we may identify brands as we have that are licensed out to other parties. For example Tonka is licensed out to another party and we receive royalty income, but we're not receiving revenues. So over time, the team may look at different strategic optionality for some of those brands. ","Gerrick Johnson","Okay, thank you. And also Beyblade I guess launched in Canada, could be here next year. Do you have any early reads on performance of Beyblade there at this point?","Brian Goldner","It's incredibly early days, but we have been in the Beyblade business before and so I wouldn't want to comment. Not because there's any qualification that I need to provide there. Just again, very early days and that's a brand that as you know has great potential for us, but it will really impact 2017 and beyond. ","Gerrick Johnson","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Brian Goldner","Thanks. ","Operator","At this time I\u2019ll turn the floor back to Debbie Hancock for closing remarks.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Debbie Hancock, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter earnings release was issued earlier this morning and is available on our website. Additionally, also available on our website, our presentation slides containing information covered in today's earnings release and call. The press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP financial measures included in today's call. Please note that during today's call, whenever we discuss earnings per share or EPS, we are referring to earnings per diluted share. ","This morning, Brian Goldner, Hasbro's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Deb Thomas, Hasbro's CFO, will review our first quarter financial results and discuss important factors impacting our performance. Following their statements, David Hargreaves, Hasbro's Chief Operating Officer, will join Brian and Deb to field your questions.","Before we begin, please note that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management's expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters. These forward-looking statements may include comments concerning our product and entertainment plans, anticipated product performance, business opportunities, plans and strategies, costs, financial goals, targets and expectations for our future financial performance, including expectations for revenues and earnings per share in 2012, as well as achieving our objectives.","There are many factors that could cause actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements.

You should review such factors together with any forward-looking statements made on today's call. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.","Now I would like to introduce Brian Goldner. Brian?","Brian D. Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. At our Investor Day in November 2011, as well as our Toy Fair meeting following Q4 earnings in February, we communicated our plan for 2012, which called for a greater percentage of our business to come later in the year as we better aligned our shipments with the timing of consumer demand on a global basis. Our first quarter results are consistent with the execution of this plan, and we continue to believe that we are on track to deliver revenues and earnings per share growth absent the impact of foreign exchange for the full year 2012. We experienced point-of-sale growth versus the first quarter 2011 in both the U.S. and major international markets. And according to NPD, through the first quarter 2012, we gained share in the U.S. and Europe.","Let me share some of the highlights of the first quarter. The momentum in our International business has continued, and we posted growth in every major geographic region during the quarter. We grew shipments in the Boys and Games product categories, and we are experiencing positive point-of-sale trends in the major markets where we receive data. In the U.S. and Canada, we are making progress toward our plan to return the business to historical operating profit margin levels versus 2011 results. We reduced our headcount and right sized the business during the first quarter.","We are also working with our retailers to better align the timing of our shipments with the timing of consumer demand that comes later in the year. Finally, we are aggressively increasing our media spend this year versus 2011 as we shift more dollars towards selling innovative Hasbro product lines to consumers. So far, we're seeing good results. Point-of-sale was up in the quarter 6%, and our retail inventories are down 20%.","From a product category standpoint company-wide, our Boys and Preschool category shipments grew in the quarter. In the Boys category, demand was driven by entertainment properties from Marvel and Star Wars as well as KRE-O, which we did not have revenue for last year. An encouraging sign is that Beyblade has continued to be strong in many markets, with strong point-of-sale growth in several countries including the U.S., Canada and Germany and net revenues in terms of shipments flat with last year.","As 2012 was a non-movie year, it's not surprising that Transformers was down in the Boys category. However, although early in the year, the brand is flat with last year on an overall brand revenue standpoint with new initiatives including Transformers Rescue Bots and Bot Shots contributing to the Preschool and Games categories. Additionally, licensing revenue for Transformers grew year-over-year. Point-of-sale trends for Transformers were up in many countries, including the U.S., Canada, U.K., France, Germany and Mexico. We're also seeing good early success with Transformers Prime as television is now airing in more than 160 countries.","The Boys category will benefit from the launch of 4 major motion pictures in the coming months to global audiences. In partnership with Universal, Battleship is off to a great early start. The film recently launched in more than 50 international territories, and while we're still awaiting final numbers, we are very pleased that in just 12 days, the film has grossed more than $100 million in international box office revenue.","Marvel has 2 tremendous films this year: The Avengers from Marvel opens May 4, and The Amazing Spider-Man from Marvel and Sony opens July 3. Both brands are being supported with television animation, and we have strong lines for both properties. Finally, in partnership with Paramount, we're excited for the return of G.I. Joe to the big screen in G.I. Joe: Retaliation, coming to theaters on June 29.","In Preschool, Sesame Street contributed to the year-over-year gains as did Playskool Heroes, with Transformers Rescue Bots leading Playskool Heroes' growth. While the Girls and Games categories were down in the quarter, My Little Pony posted positive shipments for Hasbro and positive point-of-sale growth in several countries, including the U.S., U.K., France and Spain. My Little Pony television programming is currently airing in these countries, as well as in more than 160 countries worldwide. We also launched Dizzy Dancers, which is part of our FurReal Friends line in the first quarter, and this is off to a good start in early markets like the U.S. and Australia. ","We have many innovative new initiatives coming for Girls this fall, including Baby Butterscotch and FurReal Friends and Baby Wanna Walk from Baby Alive, as well as great new look for Littlest Pet Shop inspired by television programming in the U.S. and Canada this fall and rolling out to additional markets beginning spring of '13.","We're also very excited about the return of Furby to our line-up this fall. We are not yet sharing specific details of the new Furby, but we are pleased with the reception Furby has received thus far by our retail partners and we look forward to unveiling Furby to consumers.","In the Games category, we continue to view 2012 as a year for stabilizing Games, with the intent of growing the category in 2013 and beyond. At the end of the first quarter, our retail inventories in Games are down significantly in the U.S. from last year, as we restage the business and reinvent our Games initiatives beginning in the second half of 2012. Despite this trend, several Games brands grew in the quarter including continued strong performance from Magic: The Gathering and growth in Duel Masters and Battleship. As we outlined at Toy Fair, we have developed new initiatives which focus on the game-ification of play, and these are off to a good start, including Star Wars Fighter Pods and Transformers Bot Shots.","Later this year, we have innovative new games being introduced, including a completely reimagined Lazer Tag, a new way to play Twister with Twister Dance and an all-new Monopoly, MONOPOLY Millionaires. This year, we also have an entirely new game brand, Kaijudo from Wizards of the Coast. Kaijudo is supported by all-new television programming, which begins airing on The Hub in May, as well as an online battle game in May and a trading card game, which launches in limited edition release in June. ","We're also very excited to establish a multi-year partnership with Zynga, under which Hasbro will develop and distribute wide-ranging product lines based on Zynga's games brands and a number of toy and game categories. The first products under this agreement will be available fall 2012.","Finally, our television initiatives are trending positively. The Hub ratings are up 32% in the first quarter versus last year in total day kids 2 to 11. As we look at the overall schedule on The Hub, Hasbro-branded television shows accounted for 6 of the top 10 series in the quarter, with Transformers Rescue Bots and My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic ranking #1 and #2 for kids 2 to 11.","Outside the U.S., our shows are now airing in more than 160 countries worldwide and are performing quite well. 2012 is the first year in which we have programming and merchandise globally, and early sales trends support our long-stated premise that television programming drives merchandise sales.","Through a multi-year agreement with Netflix that we sighed this month, we have dramatically expanded our audience by 24 million homes. Netflix will be airing 10 Hasbro Studios shows in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including Transformers Prime and My Little Pony. These shows are part of the Just for Kids section of Netflix, which is performing well. Our approach to television programming has been an all-screen strategy from the start, and this agreement dramatically expands the visibility and distribution of our shows.","In closing, the first quarter is in line with our expectation and what we outlined for you on a number of occasions. We are on track for delivering our full year plan, which is centered around the execution of our global brand blueprint through a focus on innovation, new inventions, immersive experiences and our International business all while planning a return in the U.S. business to historical levels of operating profit margin versus 2011 results. ","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deborah Thomas","Thank you, and good morning. As Brian said, beginning in November of last year, we outlined for you our plan that calls for 2012 to develop later in the year more closely aligned with the timing of consumer demand in the U.S. and Canada and more reflective of the trends historically evident in our International segment. As you may recall, our plan outlined approximately 2% to 4% more of our full year revenues to occur in the second half 2012 than we historically reported. This shift impacted both our revenues in the first quarter and our profit. ","Consistent with this plan, first quarter worldwide net revenues were $648.9 million, down 3% versus $672 million last year. Foreign exchange had a negative $8.5 million impact on net revenues for the quarter. Operating profit for the quarter was $15.7 million versus $48.9 million in 2011. This reflected not only the lower revenues in the quarter but also $11.1 million in severance costs. We also had an extra week of certain fixed expenses, as the first quarter 2012 was a 14-week period versus a 13-week period in 2011. The extra week of expense equated to approximately $6 million. As a result, we reported a net loss of $2.6 million or $0.02 per share in the quarter. Excluding the severance costs, net earnings were $5.1 million or $0.04 per share. ","Looking at our first quarter 2012 results by segment, the U.S. and Canada segment net revenues were $329 million, down 16% versus $391.2 million last year. We are executing our plan to return the segment to historical operating profit margin levels and better align our shipment timing with the timing of consumer demand.","We've taken steps to right size the organization and implement a higher level of spending in consumer-facing marketing and advertising. As a result, in the first quarter, we incurred severance costs in the segment and increased our advertising spend. We're also working with our retailers to ensure the right level of product is available later in the year, more closely aligned with consumer demand. As we expected, these actions resulted in lower revenues and lower profit for our U.S. and Canada segment. However, we also saw positive results at retail, with a 20% reduction in retail inventory at our top 4 accounts as well as a 6% increase in point-of-sale in the quarter.","Consistent with the shift in revenue timing, net revenues growth in the Preschool category was offset by declines in the Boys, Girls and Games product categories. The U.S. and Canada segment reported an operating profit of $14.4 million or 4.4% of revenues for the first quarter 2012 versus an operating profit of $41 million or 10.5% of revenues in 2011. The decline in operating profit margin is primarily the result of lower revenues in the quarter, as well as steps the U.S. and Canada team is taking to position this segment for profitable growth. These steps include not only severance costs but advertising spend 0.75% higher as a percentage of net revenues than a year ago at this time as well as a mix of product sales versus the first quarter 2011. In addition, we had an extra week of certain expenses during the quarter. However, our underlying expenses are down in the quarter as the team positions the business to return to historical operating profit levels.","First quarter 2012 International segment net revenues increased 14% to $289.7 million compared to $254.3 million last year. As for the negative foreign exchange impact of $8.2 million, net revenues in the International segment grew 17%. The results in this segment reflect continued growth in all major geographic regions as well as growth in the Boys and Games product categories, which more than offset flat revenues in the Preschool category and a decline in the Girls category.","The International segment reported an operating loss of $5.1 million compared to an operating loss of $1.7 million last year. This segment's results reflect continued investments in emerging markets, including the expansion of our sales and marketing office in Russia, which we shared with you in November. Additionally, this segment was impacted by severance costs as our first quarter restructuring actions were not limited to the U.S. and Canada segment. Excluding severance and one-time items, the International segment's operating loss as a percentage of revenues was slightly less than last year.","The Entertainment and Licensing segment first quarter revenues increased 19% to $29.3 million from $24.6 million last year. Revenue growth in the Entertainment and Licensing segment reflects the sale of television programming globally, as well as movie and licensing revenue from Transformers. The Entertainment and Licensing segment reported an operating profit of $7.7 million compared to $5.4 million in 2011. Higher revenues and better expense leverage drove the 42% increase in operating profit in the quarter.","For the company overall, cost of sales for the quarter was $257 million or 39.6% of revenues compared to $267.2 million or 39.8% of revenues last year. This included $2.8 million of severance costs in the first quarter of 2012. Our full year target for cost of sales remains in the 42% of revenues range. ","From an expense standpoint, royalties were 8.1% of revenues compared to 6.4% of revenues in 2011 and reflect strong sales of entertainment properties, including Beyblade, Marvel, Star Wars and Transformers. For the full year 2012, we continue to anticipate royalties to be in the 7% to 8% of revenues range.","SD&A increased as a percentage of revenues to 30.8% in 2012 versus 27.7% in 2011 due to the lower revenue level in the quarter as well as $5.9 million of severance costs. We continue to target SD&A to be below 20% of revenues for the full year 2012. Our advertising-to-revenue ratio in the first quarter was up versus 2011. For the full year, we're planning for ad spending to be up, and the target for the company's overall advertising and revenue ratio remains in the 10% to 11% range.","Moving below operating profit, interest expense totaled $23.1 million versus $21.4 million in 2011. The $1.7 million increase is primarily due to higher short-term borrowings as well as the impact of the extra week. Other income was $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus an expense of $4.7 million in 2011. The year-over-year improvement was primarily the result of higher interest income and investment gains, as well as foreign currency gains in 2012 versus losses in the first quarter of 2011. Our 50% share of The Hub is included on this line in the P&L. For the first quarter 2012, our share of the earnings in The Hub was a loss of $1.8 million compared to a loss of $2 million in 2011. Our underlying tax rate for the first quarter 2012 was 26% compared to an underlying tax rate of 28% in the first quarter 2011. We expect our full year tax rate to be in line with the first quarter's 26% rate.","For the quarter, average diluted shares were  129.6 million compared to 141 million last year. It should be noted that due to the fact we reported a loss in the first quarter, basic and diluted shares are the same. If we had reported net earnings for the quarter, our average diluted shares would have been 131.6 million.","Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At quarter end, cash totaled $883.8 million compared to $927.4 million a year ago and $641.7 million at year end 2011. Operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $404.3 million and includes $78.3 million in television programming costs over the period. Almost all of our quarter end cash balance is held outside of the U.S.","During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 140,000 shares of common stock at a total cost of $5 million and at an average price of $35.80 per share. At quarter end, $222.3 million remained available under our current share repurchase authorization. We will continue to repurchase shares opportunistically in the open market using the current authorization as appropriate. However, as we stated in February, we do not currently anticipate repurchasing shares at the same level as we did in 2011 and 2010. We paid $38.6 million in cash dividends to shareholders during the quarter. Our next dividend payment is on May 15 and reflects the 20% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in February.","We currently anticipate full year 2012 dividend payments to be approximately $178 million compared to $154 million for the full year 2011.","The quality of our receivables portfolio remains good, and receivables at quarter end were $456.6 million versus $559 million last year and $1 billion at year end. DSOs were 63 days, down 12 days versus last year. This improvement was primarily the result of a greater level of shipments occurring early in the quarter, which were collected by quarter end, and the extra week in the quarter compared to a year ago, allowing a greater level of collections to be made. We continue to reduce our inventory levels, and at quarter end, inventories were $397 million compared to $401.3 million a year ago and $334 million at year end.","Depreciation and capital expenditures for the quarter were $19.3 million and $23 million, respectively.","We have begun 2012 as we expected, and as we outlined for you, our significant investments over the past few years are now in place and we have restructured both our U.S. and Canada segment and our Games team. Coupled with the strong product initiatives we have for the year, we continue to believe, absent the impact of foreign exchange, we will again grow revenues and earnings per share for the year. Brian, David and I are now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays Capital.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You guys did provide us with a lot of detail in the prepared remarks. You did say that retail inventories in the Games business was down year-over-year. Last quarter as well, you provided some useful color. Wondering if you could just give us some more detail around the inventories perhaps around some of your other business lines?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. I think, Felicia, we're feeling very good about inventories both at Hasbro and at our retailers. If you look at the retailers, we're down nearly 40%, 39.9% or something in terms of gains. And overall, we're down 20%. We're down -- in addition to Games, we're down in Nerf, where we're a little bit long at the end of the year, but we're up in a lot of the new lines like Beyblade, we we're in short supply at the beginning of last year. We're up in Beyblade. We're up in My Little Pony, which is a brand that's doing very well for us at the moment. And the brands that has been experiencing some decline, like Littlest Pet Shop, we're down in Littlest Pet Shop, for example. So overall, as you look at our inventories, we're feeling good. We're longer where we've got momentum and the product's selling well and is driving up POS, and the brands that are moving a little bit less well at the moment, we're significantly down in those brands.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful. And did you see -- do you think you saw any impact from Easter on either at point-of-sale levels or inventory levels or overall?","Brian D. Goldner","Our point-of-sale in the first quarter was up in the U.S., as we said, by 6%. And if you look Easter versus Easter, we're up as well in single digits.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On Games and Puzzles, are you continuing to see a bifurcation of performance? In other words, how did the mega brands do compared to the rest of the business? I know you highlighted some aspects that were strong, but just in general.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. Again, I think we have major innovations. We're seeing those brands doing very well. Obviously, Battleship is up year-over-year. Magic: The Gathering is performing exceedingly well, up probably nearly 40% in the quarter. We're seeing things like Monopoly, with the Electronic Banking, perform very well. So again, a range of where there are innovations, a range of games that are performing well. In fact, as we look at it, a few categories of games like children's games and preschool games were actually up in terms of POS in the quarter. So I think what we're seeing is, as we're applying more innovation, as we're beginning the process of reinventing and reimagining that business, and we have a number of new initiatives that are first launching now like the Fighter Pods as well as Bot Shots now, and then in the second half of year, whether it's Lazer Tag or a number of other new initiatives that are coming, we feel very good about our plan for Games and our guidance that we've provided, again, stabilizing the business in '12, growing it for '13.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, you didn't mention the zAPPed GAME OF LIFE. Is that -- how is that doing?","Brian D. Goldner","It's been off to a good start. Again, it's a -- spring is always about creating the marketing and impression around the brand. We start to see the volumes going. But you're going to see a number of brands that marry iPads or iPhones or that hybridization of games where you have the -- both digital and analog together, and they're off to a very good start.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And Deb, the gross margins. Just wondering, what drove the year-over-year improvement on a year-over-year decline in revenues?","Deborah Thomas","The improvement in gross margin really related to the product mix. In addition to that, we had some factory under absorption last year that we didn't have this year. And that was just -- really, it was about product mix and the pricing that we took early in the year.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then final question also for you, Deb. The share repurchase, it just is -- we haven't seen a level this low since fourth quarter of 2010. Just wondering how we should think about that going forward? And is that mainly due to cash being mostly offshore or other issues?","Deborah Thomas","Well, that's correct, Felicia. I mean, most of the cash is offshore, and we've been trying to highlight it. As a matter of fact, the predominant amount of our cash at the end of this quarter, again, remains offshore. And we continue to expect to opportunistically repurchase in the market under our open authorization, however, at lower levels than 2011 and 2010.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Carroll with UBS.","Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a quick question. I mean, if you would have talk about some of the entertainment properties, is there any color in terms of what shipped domestically during Q1? Outside of Star Wars, obviously.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. In fact, Rob, if you look across the entertainment brands, Star Wars was up significantly in the quarter, as you indicate. But so was Marvel, and we are seeing great early success from Avengers. We feel very good about the Marvel brand overall, that was up significantly in the quarter. G.I. Joe was up in the quarter. Beyblade was flat in the quarter. Transformers as a brand was flat in the quarter. Battleship was up significantly in the quarter. And then a kind of an entertainment brand of a difference sort, Sesame Street was up in the quarter. But so was My Little Pony, up in the quarter behind television. And we also, if you go underneath, Transformers and the Prime, Transformers Prime, the TV related product line where we have TV shows airing around the world, 160-plus [ph] countries, that too was off to a very strong start. So the premise around -- our premise around both television-supported initiatives as well as movies initiatives are working, albeit early days. And I would just remind you in terms of -- as you think about quarter-on-quarter revenues, remember that next quarter, the second quarter, you're going to see that motion picture revenue versus a year ago and things like Transformers be much stronger. So again, it's that mix of Transformers overtime that will change what we're seeing. But underneath Transformers, a little more color, is that we're beating the trend on the year after for movie-related or Boys' action-related product lines. And then the Transformers Prime, Bot Shots and some of our other initiatives, like KRE-O, the new brand KRE-O, are making up that difference, and that's how we get back to virtually flat.","Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then on Beyblade specifically, I mean, during Q1 of 2011, were you guys still supply constrained on manufacturing?","Brian D. Goldner","We were. We were -- particularly, as we were chasing product in the U.S. In U.S., we're seeing very strong point-of-sale albeit not as strong shipments versus a year ago, only in that we're working -- had been working through some of the early inventories. But the point of sale is very, very strong and similarly catching up on year-ago inventory in international markets.","Operator","Our next question is from James Hardiman of Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Couple of questions. First on the retail, you talked about 20% decline in inventories at retail overall. How much of that was a function of the shifted timing of your shipments later into the year? And how much was that -- how much of that was retail proactively scaling back on their inventories? And as we work our way through the year, do you get any of that back?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, in fact, if you look back to what we had outlined for you, in fact, what we're saying is that 2% to 4% of our annualized revenue is one could expect to see in the back half of the year versus the first half of the year versus historical trends. So in fact, we do expect that we will get that back more in line with consumer demand. It's been a partnership between us and the retailers to ensure we're dropping retail inventories at the right places. Meanwhile, we're bringing in lot of new initiatives, so whether it's Dizzy Dancers or Transformers Bot Shots or Fighter Pods and Star Wars. So you're seeing a lot of new initiatives get up and underway, as well as rolling out KRE-O around the world in Transformers and Battleship KRE-O in 10 markets. So it's really that combination. I would say that it is all about the inventory management. It's the reason why the inventories are down. And obviously, our POS has been up, so we're also selling through inventory.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","And so as I think about that inventory over the remainder of the year, it sounds like maybe you get some of that back. But how should I think about, when we exit from 2012, what do you think based on the cadence that you're hearing from retailers, what do you think you'll finish the year on that front?","David D. R. Hargreaves","So I think we're going to make it both at the end of 2011 and at the end of 2010. Within the U.S., our retailer inventories were too high. So I think within our guidance this year, that we expect to grow revenues again. We actually are expecting a bit in the U.S. our POS grows by more than our shipments into the trade and we actually will finish the year with less retailer inventory than we've had in either the last 2 years.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Great. And then shifting gears here to the Games business. I've got to ask, this Draw Something game basically seems like iOS version of your Pictionary game. And this is ultimately the second time this has kind of happened to you guys. I guess, first question, can you talk about patent protection in some of your Games business? Creating a digital version of your game, does that basically get around any patents or exclusivity you have there? And I guess, just secondly, talk a bit about your ability to win on digital platforms versus competitors that take what seems to be some of your intellectual property and just puts it on those digital platforms?","Brian D. Goldner","If you look at our licensing revenues and digital year-over-year, they're running about a year ago, a little bit down versus a year ago. But that's just as we transition from console gaming to some of the online and mobile gaming, but again very strong revenues overall continue in our digital gaming. Obviously, we have some protections around trademarks, but there's play patterns and copyrights that you can't protect. And so one of the strategies we've had proactively over the last couple of years since '07 as we signed the deal with EA and then, more recently, with Activision, has been to ensure that our games are out there. And so we have, I think over the period, over 75 Games brands EA has launched and titles that they've launched for Hasbro in the digital arena and with good operating profit margins for us as a partner in all of that. As we go forward, clearly, we've reached out to some of these partners, and our long-term deal now with Zynga enables us to take advantage of some of their development. And certainly, anything that Zynga has would be something that we'll develop. And we're going to develop it in a way that really as additive, not just exploitive of the online property. So you'll see this fall our new launches, which we haven't outlined yet. The new launches for this fall literally add to the play in a way that you haven't been able to play before online. And then in doing so, in our analog game, it enhances the online play, and then the online play in turn would enhance the analog play. So you'll see that we're going to marry up our brands in a number of ways. You have fully digital versions, hybridized versions, versions on the iPad and versions on mobile, but also brand new ways to think about what we might call, broadly speaking, board gaming and off-the-board gaming as we go forward.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Excellent. And then just one last clarification here. Help me understand the extra week. You talked about it being $6 million in fixed expenses. Was there any impact on the top line? And ultimately, what was the bottom line impact of that extra week?","Deborah Thomas","Well, the extra week really, because of the time of the year, when it comes, we talked about it being in the early part of the year. So it really didn't add anything significant in terms of revenue. However, by having an extra week of fixed expenses in the company, it impacted us by about $6 million in the quarter.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","And that's ultimately the net impact, $6 million to the bottom line as well?","Brian D. Goldner","That's right.","Deborah Thomas","Right.","Operator","Our next question is from Margaret Whitfield with Sterne Agee.","Margaret B. Whitfield - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I was curious, since I saw some Avengers products on shelves early, how much that line contributed to the quarter? Also with Beyblade starting out relatively good in terms of consumer demand, what's your current thought of where you might end the year for Beyblade? Will it still be down significantly?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, thus far, Margaret, Beyblade is basically flat. Obviously, we've guided everyone to not expect that as we go forward. But it's very heartening to see the kinds of POS gains we're seeing in the U.S. and several countries around the world. We had mentioned to you, we were going try to buck historical trends by adding new innovations to Beyblade, which we are adding and will both be expressed in toys as well as expressed in the animation and the series itself, which is new for the brand versus the last time it was launched. Let's see, on Avengers, it did contribute to the quarter. And I don't think we give like quarterly numbers. But it did contribute to the quarter, we began shipping Avengers. But overall, we feel very strongly the Avengers is going to perform very well in the marketplace. What's heartening about the Marvel business for us is not only is it growing in the U.S., but it's growing more quickly internationally as we work with Marvel globally to really build this business. And so we're seeing great uptake on Avengers and anticipation and excitement around Spider-Man that follows. And we also have a lot of classic product. And the Marvel business will also be supported by a number of animated shows, both here in the U.S. and outside the U.S. around the world. So again, the Marvel business for us, we had always seen as a significant contributor, plus side contributor, and it's bearing out.","Margaret B. Whitfield - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And Sesame Street did not increase overseas, but it did in the U.S. of course. It wasn't in the line a year ago. What's going on with Sesame Street in terms of your international markets?","Brian D. Goldner","It just -- it takes a bit longer. A lot of preschool products are language-dependent so you have to take the time in order to translate those products into multiple different languages. So that takes a few more quarters, and then we want to coordinate that with the television episodes that are airing around the world. So I think you'll just see that happen, it's just -- again, it's a matter of timing.","Margaret B. Whitfield - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Can I conclude from the inventory at retail that your carryover inventory is virtually gone at this point?","David D. R. Hargreaves","I mean, the retailers are heading into the second quarter. And clearly, they've got inventory to sell. I think areas where we were long will certainly work that down, and it's at an adequate level. And we've got a lot of inventory -- or not a lot, but sufficient inventory of the new initiatives like The Avengers and Battleship, which are coming very shortly, and supply in terms of Beyblade now were fairly short a year ago. So I think we feel good about the overall quality of the inventory.","Margaret B. Whitfield - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And for Deb, could you comment on the outlook for program production cost amortization for the year? Because you were flat year-over-year in Q1.","Deborah Thomas","Yes, we were. And for the full year, 50 -- I think we're looking at about $70 million in program production amortization.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, $60 million or $70 million, Margaret.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","How do you think the inventory reduction overall at retail for the industry will impact the manufacturers both from a sales perspective or maybe needing to have more inventory on hand as we get to the holiday?","Brian D. Goldner","Well , I think what's interesting is that, in fact, and what we've done in the U.S. as part of employing the strategy has been to up the advertising and to work through good products in the springtime, driving POS or the product lines that were good albeit not shipped in necessarily in the quarter, driving down that inventory and beginning to ship a lot of new initiatives in a lot of these brands. And you'll see more of that as we get into the second half and across the brand portfolio, whether it's Nerf or Pet Shop or Pony or in our Games business, a raft of new initiatives there widely supported by retailers not only here in the U.S. but globally. So I think it's been part of our expressed strategy. It's something we outlined for you last fall and, again, in February. And I would say we are absolutely executing the plan we intended to execute in 2012. David, I don't know if you want to add anything.","David D. R. Hargreaves","No, I think as we all know, most toy sell 50% in the last quarter of the year. And in international markets, in markets around the world, we tend to ship close to 40% in the last quarter of the year. In the U.S., working with the retailers, we tried to level or lower that a bit, and we've been shipping a lot more during the early part of the year and earning maybe 24% during the fourth quarter of the year. I think as we and retailers work together, we say that go forward, we need the shipping patterns to look -- need to look more like the international level. They had issues associated with shipping too much in -- early in the year. And to be honest, if you're going to give retailers flow allowances or warehouse allowances, then you're spending money against the retailer, which will be better spending against your consumer and your advertising. So I think with -- working with the retailers in the U.S., we're saying no, we won't be shipping it later in the year, more in line with consumer demand.","Brian D. Goldner","It also allows us to be more responsive as we start to see product lines accelerate. We're able to ship more of those inventories, and we're already seeing that in the first quarter where we're able to -- where we'd look at new product lines that have begun quite strongly in certain regions or territories. Star Wars Fighter Pods, Avengers, Transformers Bot Shot, where we're able to fill that inventory because we haven't already put inventory into play.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Good. And just in terms of sales of your movie-related products. Last year was, obviously, a tough comparison year. Do you have any change in terms of your view on how some of those products are selling at retail at this point?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. We -- as I was looking at the numbers, what we're really seeing, as we said, is Transformers overall as a brand is relatively flat year-on-year. And that has to do with new Games initiatives and our Preschool initiative with our Rescue Bot line. Overall, if you look at the Boys business, it's tracking better than one would expect on a year-over-year decline in following a movie year. So typically, we would see about a 50% decline, and we're tracking more strongly than that in the first quarter, recognized that we had the benefit of a DVD out in the fourth quarter, lots of excitement around the Transformers brand as people see that and still shipping Transformers-related movie product and selling it through in the first quarter. So right now, we are down around 30% versus historical level of 50%.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Good. And just finally, on games, how much do you think of the decline and kind of softness that you've been seeing the last year or so? Is it due to just the category being a little bit softer which we've seen or is it just a function of your -- getting your kind of your product, new product, as well as marketing and improving that to capitalize on it.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. I think it's been -- really, it's a shift in thought process and a shift in strategy. There was a day many years ago, actually -- and now, as we think about it, not that many years ago, that you could make a new game, \"game brand\" and you have a game SKU and a TV commercial and you'd be off to the races. And what we've really recognize now is you need a raft of innovations, you need to really think about that brand across multiple platforms and you need to focus on fewer brands and -- much more intensely. And so in doing so, like Magic: The Gathering is a perfect example and very emblematic of what we've done, which is to develop the online Magic: The Gathering online game, a digital game that marries up with the analog game to go back out to lapsed users, the team's done a very effective job of getting lapsed users as well as new users into the analog, meaning paper-based trading card game around the world but also marrying that with any number of iterations of digital game play. That's -- to me, that's a great example of what you're going to see from us in developing that ecosystem both in our own brands as well as our partnered brands alongside Zynga, alongside of EA, alongside of Activision.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Handler of MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","So first on Battleship. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that gross revenue participations from the film are not included in your guidance. Now that we're seeing a strong start to the film internationally, I wondered if you might be able to give some color on what those contributions could be in 2012? And then secondly, with regard to your buybacks, given your positive tones toward the back half of the year and given the prices where you bought stock back before, why not be a little bit more aggressive down here in the low 30s?","Brian D. Goldner","So on the first point, Battleship now, we've gotten some final numbers in this -- early this morning from the weekend. So after just 12 days, we've done nearly $130 million, $129.6 million at the global box office, very strong starts around the world, #1 in a number of markets around the world, in Asia, in Europe, in Russia. So again, really bearing out our strategy. In terms of our participation, as we get participation, which we are a first-dollar gross participant on this film, that would appear as revenue in the Entertainment and Licensing segment of the business. Although, I'm not going to guide you as to what that could be. But again, it's an improvement versus our prior deals that we had made as we get or established in...","David D. R. Hargreaves","And we certainly planned for that in our plan. So the guidance we gave, we certainly assumed that we would be getting some revenues from Battleship participation.","Brian D. Goldner","Right. And in terms of the buybacks, I think it's a matter of us looking at our cash throughout the year, utilization of cash versus short and long-term debt and making good decisions about how to return excess cash to shareholders, recognizing that a lot of our cash is now held offshore. So again, we've guided around remembering last year that we were buying back shares more aggressively based on our week.","Operator","Our next question is from Sean McGowan of Needham & Company.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions here. Could you be more specific about where you're seeing the bulk of the weakness in Girls' toys? And you've mentioned a couple of lines that were up, but could you get us to the 18% decline somehow?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. I think the biggest element there has been -- as the U.S. business is down in the first quarter, clearly, that's impacted the Girls business in particular and a couple of brands. Pet Shop has been down. It's down more in the U.S. than internationally. And FurReal Friends year-over-year in the first quarter is certainly down as we transition out of some product lines and into the early days of Dizzy Dancers. And those 2 things have an impact in the quarter, given that it's a low revenues quarter overall. And then, as we've said, Littlest Pet Shop is now planned for the new animation as well as a whole new line in the fall. FurReal Friends, in addition to Dizzy Dancers, which is off to a strong start, has number of new brand. And then Baby Alive, that had modest growth in the quarter, has a lot of new initiatives in the second half of the year.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And could you comment on what you're seeing in -- within Games at point-of-sale relative to some of the other category? I mean, you mentioned that overall it was up 6%, but how is it trending in Games?","Brian D. Goldner","Games is -- Games was down in POS 5.8% around in the first quarter, but recognize that's far above the decline in inventories and in sell-in. So we're selling down and selling through those inventories. A number of Games brands certainly performed well in the quarter. We have strong sell-through in Transformers Bot Shots and Fighter Pods, as well as Monopoly and Battleship. And there's a few other brands I probably haven't mentioned, but certainly, in that mix, we're also selling through inventories of the Games.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. The program -- just to follow up on Margaret's question of program amortization cost being flat with last year. Is this the kind of relationship of first quarter to full year that we should be expecting from here on out? Because it just seems a little low relative to the full year, or actually, more than a little low.","Deborah Thomas","I think it's really just kind of the timing. If you look at and think about when we've talked before about looking at the trend of the amortization along the lines of our revenue in the quarter, that's probably why it's looking so low right now, so the amortization timing tends to follow basically the revenue trends.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, I just thought that with all the program sales that happened kind of late last year -- or the second half, anyway, of last year that, that line would be at least up.","Deborah Thomas","Right. And we do have a lot of those shows that are going to start to air a little bit later in the year.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, a related question, then. And so how will entertainment revenue then trend vis-a-vis program sales? You book a deal then I know you've recognized the revenue over some time periods, so how's that going to trend the balance of this year? Will we continue to see increases in that line?","Brian D. Goldner","You would see the entertainment line trend up as we get paid for our TV shows. The TV shows have to be delivered and, therefore, they have to be translated into multiple languages and we have to -- we have different windows of airing around the world for those shows. But as we start to put those shows on the air, we get paid for the episodes. And that's what you're beginning to see, but again, it's early days. But the early indications, if you look at the impact from television, the early indications in the U.S. throughout Latin America, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, I mean, every market really where Transformers Prime is now running, we're seeing strong point-of-sale trends.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And 2 other quick questions. So in terms of royalties or whatever you would get on that box office participation on Battleship, has some of that already been booked at the time -- was some of that booked last year when the production got to a certain level? Or has any of that been booked?","Deborah Thomas","We do booked some when we start principal photography on the movie. So we did recognize that last year, maybe even late in '10. However, the box office revenue, when it begins to be reported to us, will be recognized through to Licensing. And as David mentioned, that was included -- there was an amount of that included in our plan when we gave our guidance for the year.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Right. So that's kind of thinking at the end of the quarter, they tell you what you earned, and if you find out what it is, will you open the mail and look at the check, right?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, yes, obviously, we can do some math and we can look at how the box office has performed with our participation.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, so a lag on timing. And then finally, could you clarify what your goal is when you say that returning U.S. and Canada to historical levels of margins, what's your target timing on that? Is it run rate by the end of this year, or is it for the full year or is it full year 2013?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. Operating profit margin is to get more normalized, and I think I would look back to years like 2010 as a good guidepost, and we would like to get there or close to that by the end of this year. So that would be for the full year 2012, the U.S. and Canada segment. Operating profit margin would be similar to 2010's level, not '11's. And to -- as we say, versus '11, we would be therefore up, and that to us is back to more historical levels and operating profit margin. And then at go forward, we would drive off of that number.","Operator","Our next question is from Gerrick Johnson of BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","A question on the balance sheet. Other current assets were up 62%. This is a 3\/4 trend of big growth. What's in that line that's causing that to grow?","Deborah Thomas","Well, year-on-year, it's actually just the VAT receivable. So it's a timing issue on year-over-year.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I'm sorry, it\u2019s a what receivable?","Deborah Thomas","Tax receivable. Internationally, it's value-added tax. That's what's really causing it. It's just a timing issue.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And Brian, I think you mentioned Bot Shots and Fighter Pods in Games, is that accurate or should be in Boys?","Brian D. Goldner","No. Fighter Pods and Bot Shots are not considered board games, but they're in the broader definition of games, just as BOP IT! is in Games or Lazer Tag is in Games.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And speaking of Games, how about just the board game performance on its own? I was going to ask excluding trading card games because you call those had a strong performance. But now, I guess I'll exclude trading card games and Bot Shots and Fighter Pods. How about the board game -- the core board game business?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, let me look. Board games, the board game business was certainly down in the quarter, not down as much as inventories were down in the quarter. As we said, inventories were down 40% in the quarter. We're seeing some positive areas within board games as I mentioned. For example, Monopoly and some places where we have electronic banking and some of the early innovations that were out there either from fall or in springtime. And we would expect to see more of that in the second half of the year and -- as well, we will be launching the line of Zynga-based games, and that will be happening in the second half of 2012 as well. So that's where we are.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great. And one last one, if I can. Your marketing that you plan for this year, is there any shift in the way you're using those marketing dollars versus traditional?","Brian D. Goldner","It is -- actually, let me follow up with one more point. The biggest decline within the Games business is actually the puzzle business, and we have a plan for how to handle puzzle. So that, as a percent, that's really the biggest drag on Games in the first quarter. Okay, and then -- sorry, what was the question?","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes. I was asking about marketing, the increase in marketing spend this year. Is there going to be any sort of shift in the way you use those marketing dollars this year away from how we traditionally TV advertise things?","Brian D. Goldner","I think you'll see it's kind of an all-platform strategy. The team has done a very good job in looking at how consumers make decisions about purchases, particularly in mature markets and certainly particularly in the U.S., recognizing the importance of digital platforms. You're going to certainly see an array of new digital marketing elements. Television is still important, and you'll see us focus on TV when we believe there's the highest propensity to drive consumer demand around Hasbro's strong brands and innovations. So it's really -- it's a kind of an all-mediums approach to marketing.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Kelter of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask within Boys about Nerf brand that was flat overall in '11, including down in the U.S. after a multiyear positive run. What are the current trends look like for Nerf and how confident are you that you can get that growing again versus being maybe a third drag in Boys along with Transformers and Beyblade this year?","Brian D. Goldner","It's going to be -- if you look at Nerf, the biggest decline in Nerf year-over-year is really in the U.S. business. So that had to do, as David mentioned, with the fact that we did have too much inventory on that brand than we've been selling through. The sell-through on that brand has been very good in this first quarter, and we do have some new initiatives around the glow-in-the-dark products in the springtime, as well as a lot of darts promotions. And so we've seen sell-through and lots of promotion around that brand. So again, that's really been the biggest element there in terms of the drag on the business.","David D. R. Hargreaves","Yes, and I think in our international markets, where sales tend to come later as we said, Nerf is still very much a growing business.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. And then the other thing, Michael, to know is we had a complete reinvention of the core dart business, which we did not have last fall. If you remember last fall, with Vortex, we added a new form factor in the disk caters [ph]. But this fall, we have new dart-related business, Nerf Elite line, which is brand new to the business and will allow for there to be a number of SKUs in the favorite -- fan-favorite dart business that are brand new and much higher performance.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then I also wanted to ask, from what I understand, action figures or the category hasn't been doing all that great for a little while now. I'm curious to understand, since it's an important category for you, due to the extent that you have visibility, what the trends look like? What do you think is going on there? Our play patterns changing for children, and this is something that to keep an eye on or do you think it's maybe just a fleeting kind of a dynamic because the properties haven't been enough to stimulate people to purchase? What do you think?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, I think we've certainly, over the last year, expanded the number and types of play patterns and the different kinds of innovations, whether it's Preschool, Transformers with Rescue Bots and our new play pattern that's easier to transform for littler hands. In Bot Shots, which is a brand new play pattern in Transformers, which is doing very well early this year as we launched it, that's a new play pattern, although its action figures and it's merchandised in the Boys isle. Fighter Pods within Star Wars, which is a whole new play pattern. So you're going to see from us a raft of new innovations in a short while, coming out, I believe, May 1, will start with -- and we told you about BONKAZONKS. And BONKAZONKS is all around the Marvel brands and a fun -- really a fun, new way to play action figures collect. So it's both the collectability of action figures, as well as a fun new battling kind of a play pattern. So when I talk about the game-ification of play, this is what we're thinking about, that so many of our brands have the opportunity to provide these new innovative ways to play, and so we're out really doing that proactively and we've been doing this for some time. Hence, we're launching these new initiatives now. The last area, I would say, is that as we see the growth of KRE-O around the world, we're really reemphasizing the innovation strategy there. There are things that we understand about that business being the Boys action business that we can really bring to KRE-O as we roll out, and that's why we're seeing such good early success.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And Preschool, which is up only 2% despite adding Sesame Street to the mix. And Fisher-Price wasn't doing that well of late either. What do you think is going on from a consumer perspective in that category? Why are sales not necessarily all that robust in Preschool right now?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, if you look, our POS and Preschool was actually very strong in the quarter. So I think it's a matter of looking at Preschool again a bit differently. Our Play-Doh business is part of our Preschool business, and while it was only up a bit in revenues, the POS as we start to ship new play sets and new innovations as -- was quite strong in the quarter. If you look within Playskool Heroes, that whole category is really performing well, with Transformers Rescue Bots, the Star Wars Jedi Force and the Marvel Super Hero Squad, which is also on The Hub, and those have all strong performance. So I think it's different kinds of play patterns that are certainly working, and certainly Sesame Street is a major new contributor for us. So I just think it's early days, early in the year, and certainly our lowest revenue quarter year -- revenue quarter within the year. And so clearly, positive signs for us are the POS around our new initiatives.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And lastly, I just wanted to circle back on inventory because the number this quarter was roughly in line with last year. But if you recall, you guys weren't all that happy with the number last year and you spent all of 2011 trying to work it down, and you had. And you did a great job with that. And now that inventory number and dollars is back pretty much exactly where you started beginning of '11, how should we think about that?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, remember that our business outside the U.S. grew by 14% -- or 17% ex FX. So inventory -- pools of inventory are following sales. We have more territories, more new Hasbro marketing and sales teams and marketing and sales personnel selling Hasbro brands around the world than we ever have. And so as we build our capabilities and build brand blueprint, meaning TV on the air around our brands, motion pictures coming from our partners and from Hasbro, you are going to see a demand for more inventory because those markets need to feed consumer demand in those geographies. So that's a major driver of that. And then the U.S., clearly we have a lot of new initiatives. What we wanted to do is clear out the retailer shelves and clear out retail inventories so that we'd make room for our new initiatives that could benefit from the additional advertising and to guide you guys to say that, in fact, we are going to follow more of consumer demand and do that early enough so that you could be along there with us and on the same page as we go through this process.","Operator","Our next question is from Tim Conder of Wells Fargo.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of things. Most questions have been answered here. But Brian, there's been a little confusion out in the market as far as the definition of Games being stable this year, your goal. Can you clarify that, are you talking flat year-over-year revenues or are you talking stabilization in the rate of decline?","Brian D. Goldner","Okay. I guess, the way I would view it, I would view stable meaning we would be very pleased if we improve the rate of decline, is one way to look at it. But I would just look at it in simple terms, Tim, to be plus-or-minus a few percentage points in terms of revenue for the full year. And just a very simple way to look at it is if we were down a few percentage points in revenue this year, and our rate of decline was better than prior year's or it'd be up a bit if everything broke right for us. That would be -- to me, that's the range we're talking about. So both has those 2 components. It's stabilizing the rate of decline, and it's also looking at just overall revenues being plus-or-minus a few percent.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great, great. And on the Zynga relationship, you talk about and you've mentioned this since day one of announcing the relationship that on the back half of the year, you're going be shipping product to -- off of the Zynga properties. I think also, you'd mentioned that there is the ability under the agreement for Zynga to do online games to be developed off of Hasbro's IP. Any timetable for where we could potentially see some of that being developed here?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, we certainly will have a number of brands of Zynga's activated across a number of different iterations for this fall. So that's on track, and there'll be a number of ways to play Zynga games in an analog space, as well as adding to the digital play in a really unique way, and I can't wait to tell you guys or for you guys to see what we're talking about there. But certainly an added enhancement, building on what I talked about as that ecosystem, one enhances the other and the other feeds the next in a virtuous circle. So that's certainly a part of our plan. If you look at the -- our opportunities in digital gaming as we go forward, certainly, we have great partnership with Electronic Arts that was signed in 2007. That deal goes through the end of 2013 on a number of Games brands. There's an opportunity to renew that under certain conditions for another 4 years, and we've talked to you guys about that. But there are Games brands that are available to us right now to go after and to look at and there's new ways to think about Zynga's brands that would benefit the analog space, and we're doing both of those things right now. And clearly, also Activision is working with us as we're also working in joint ventures with NetDragon and Jagex on sort of MMOG. So there's an array of ways that we're bringing to life our Games business across a number of platforms.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then one related to the Girls business, and I apologize if I missed this. But I don't think you commented on how Girls' POS specifically was trending in the quarter?","Brian D. Goldner","Just hang on. I'm looking. Girls' POS was down in the quarter, and it was down less than shipments.","Operator","Our final question is from the line of John Taylor of Arcadia Investment Advisors.","John Taylor","So I got a couple of questions. First, on The Hub. I wonder if you could give us any sense, quantify for us what kind of lift you're seeing in the markets. I think you mentioned Sony, for instance. So is there any way to do a before and after, and kind of give us a sense for that? That's the first question for The Hub. And the second one is given all the timing issues related to amortization and stuff that folks were asking about before, I'm wondering what the first quarter episodes -- broadcasts versus episodes broadcast last year might have been like and kind of maybe what your outlook for the full year is versus full year of 2011? So 2 questions on Hub, and then I got another question.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. So John, if you look around the world, in fact, My Little Pony's on the air now in more than 160 countries, as is Transformers Prime. So we're actually seeing strong lifts in POS in early shipments around the world. Our POS and My Little Pony, for example, even in the U.S. was up over 50% in the quarter. Transformers was up very strongly around -- behind Prime in the quarter in the U.S. As we go around the world, we're seeing that My Little Pony in Latin America is up well more than 50%, whether it's Peru, Chile, Brazil, Mexico, Ecuador. So again, great point-of-sale gains. And it's really, our long stated premise but not -- it's not lost on everyone that television, particularly television outside the U.S. has historically driven merchandise sales and that's what we're seeing. On Transformers, the programming continues to drive and help us to drive our retail POS, whether it's Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Europe. The U.K, has seen significant growth in Transformers Prime in POS year-to-date, recognizing again it's still early days, but certainly a strong performance. As you look at The Hub, our growth on The Hub in the first quarter was up 32% in Kids total day, in our ratings. And Kids total day against kids 2 to 11 and it also grew with kids 6 to 11 and also grew with 18 to 49-year-olds. This is the second best quarter we've had since our start. And so again, it bodes well for the trends that Margaret and her team are putting together. Lots of new excitement as we bring on new series, and we get to our second and third seasons on some of our shows, as well as adding new shows like Kaijudo. So overall, very positive trend within television.","John Taylor","Yes. I was wondering on the episodes side though, as you take the Hasbro programming global, kind of what your episode comparison looked like maybe first quarter and your outlook for the year.","Brian D. Goldner","Well, I'm trying to figure out how to answer to that.","John Taylor","I mean, 160 countries is -- that's a good headliner. But you just kind of wonder how many episodes are under each one of those and...","Brian D. Goldner","Okay. So what we've sold thus far is really we've sold in Season 1 or Season 1 and 2 depending on the brands. Overall, we have green lit [ph], which doesn't mean they're all being -- had been produced. But we have green lit [ph] over 750 half hours of programming around all of our brand shows. Our brand shows are 6 of the top 10 rated shows on The Hub and outperforming, working with great partners around the world, whether it's Disney or Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network or Carousel in Russia, our shows are performing very well. And as we're trying to give you some early indication of POS, certainly contributing to our POS as well as contributing to revenues because both Pony was up in the quarter versus a year ago, and that wasn't just in U.S. but actually vast growth outside the U.S. And Transformers being flat, certainly Transformers Prime has contributed to helping us get back that gap that is what we've talked about a lot, that we didn't have -- in 2010, because we're waiting on the launch of The Hub, we didn't have an animated series throughout 2010. We do have that animated series in 2012, so we would expect the decline in Transformers to be less than a traditional 50% drop-off in a non-movie year. So I'm not sure how else to answer that but I'm trying to give you some color around it.","John Taylor","Yes. Just kind of getting at the broadcast episodes around the world, kind of how many half-hour segments have actually been shown? That kind of comparison as a unit revenue driver and cost driver kind of...","Brian D. Goldner","No. So most of the series began airing in roughly in the fourth quarter of 2011. So it's just been early days. So I would say you're in the Season 1 primarily. I would doubt that anywhere around the world has seen Season 2, although it's been produced. And we're also translating episodes as we speak. So I would say primarily, you're talking about Season 1 shows, and that is the first season of Transformers Prime, which was 26 episodes; the first season of My Little Pony, which I remember as being 26 episodes; Pound Puppies; Chuck & Friends in Preschool; and then some of our game show formats being translated and aired in countries around the world.","John Taylor","Okay, great. And then Deb, on the DSO coming down so much and the shift in timing of shipments and so on, how -- do you think that was related to the price increase? And I recall, you had one in February 1 or something, that people buy early?","Deborah Thomas","And they have been some of it, but it was so -- it was really the January and February compared to the March timing. So it really was a shift in the quarter, but it was February as much as March -- I mean, as much as January rather.  So -- and that extra week helped as well, particularly internationally, where you get March -- the very last day of March being a big collection day.","John Taylor","Okay, great. And then on the whole first half versus second half shift to 2% to 4%. So Brian, can we assume that huge piece of that is related to the gained shift closer to fourth quarter? Or are there -- is there shift towards more seasonal, the sort of higher price point holiday start shipping later? I mean, is there any way to talk about that in baskets?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. I think that the way to think about it is, in the first and second quarters, it's been about -- particularly, in the first quarter, been a reduction of historical inventories. And also as David outlined, typically, the U.S. might do 25% of its revenue in the first quarter, whereas the total company might do 15% to 17% of its revenue in the first quarter. We're going to follow more of that pattern over the first and second quarter, just in terms of matching consumer demand and consumer takeaways so as to allow us to get visibility to those lines that are really performing, given that we've made so many strong strides and improvement in our supply chain. We're able to do that, more just-in-time inventory. And therefore, able to follow really the consumer takeaway patterns. So it's kind of an across-the-board approach. It's advertising when the consumer has a high propensity to buy. There are certainly mitigating factors within that, especially in 2012 as we have strong entertainment properties coming out in second quarter. But recognize we have strong comps to go up against versus a year ago in Transformers in particular. And so I think that as we view the year, we look at it as being -- the best way to view it is that if you take 2% to 4% of historical level annualized inventory and were to ship that, that's what we'd sort of describe to you guys back in November and again in February, I think some of you have understood that more than others.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

Brian?","Brian D. Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As early as November of last year, we communicated with you several key objectives for 2012, including growing revenues and earnings per share for the full year absent the impact of foreign exchange, returning the U.S. and Canada segment to historical operating profit margins, executing globally by leveraging our investments in new and emerging markets, stabilizing our Games business and positioning it for growth in 2013 and beyond and growing our Girls business.  Nine months into the year, we are delivering on these objectives, and we believe we are well positioned to achieve them for the full year 2012 in a challenging environment.","Now as we enter the holiday season, it's all about new Hasbro and partner initiatives across brands, categories and geographies, including reimagined and completely new brands. Furby is one of the most exciting new initiatives for the holiday season and is off to a great start. The team did a tremendous job reimagining this brand for today's consumers by integrating innovative new technologies with a great all-new personality that develops depending on how you interact with your Furby. For more interactive fun, you can download the free app to virtually feed Furby and access a FURBISH to English dictionary. Furby is available in English-speaking markets this holiday season and will ship globally in 2013.","Backed by 2 tremendously successful films, we have seen good momentum with our Marvel products throughout 2012. Similar to how we are building Hasbro brand franchises, we partnered with Marvel to expand into new categories, including Games and Preschool and to execute across markets globally. We have the innovative new items for the holiday for both Marvel's The Avengers and The Amazing Spider-Man. In addition to Furby and our Marvel line, we believe we have the strongest holiday line in a number of years, including great new products from brands like FurReal Friends, Baby Alive, My Little Pony, Littlest Pet Shop, One Direction, Nerf, Koosh, Beyblade, Transformers, PLAYSKOOL and Play-Doh. You can see many of these initiatives on Page 5 of the presentation.","As with toys, our Games line for the holiday 2012 is the strongest it has been in years. The Hasbro brands and innovative platforms created by our new games team come together for the first time this holiday season. We completely reimagined Twister as Twister Dance, and it's off to a strong start. An entirely new Lazer Tag is delivering live laser combat integrated with your iPhone and iPod. Within our Monopoly brand, the Monopoly Millionaire game is all-new and the first to $1 million wins.","This summer, we launched Kaijudo: Rise of the Duel Masters, an all-new brand from Wizards of the Coast. Kaijudo features an online battle game, trading card game, an online trading card game and a television series airing in the U.S. on The Hub TV Network. We have also established new partnerships in the gaming space, which are coming to retail this fourth quarter, along with Rovio Entertainment and Lucasfilm, we recently announced a line of games and toys based on ANGRY BIRDS STAR WARS. Also, our new line of Zynga games, including Words With Friends, CityVille and Draw Something, is available for the holidays.","Leading up to the holiday and as we execute 2012, we have reemphasized building a consumer-centric organization and executional plan. This starts by having the right brands with innovation based on great consumer insights, ensuring the right inventories at retail when the consumer is shopping and partnering with our retailers to develop integrated marketing campaigns. This is our model for future years.","In the U.S. and Canada segment, we set the objective to return to historical levels of operating profit margins for the full year 2012. Year-to-date, we are on track, posting an operating profit margin of 15.2% versus 13.7% last year and reaching 19.9% in the third quarter. To drive demand in the fourth quarter, we are increasing our U.S. media support by 30% to 40% across TV, digital and social media.","Internationally, our business is more global than ever. Our investments in emerging markets are delivering growth in many new countries, including Brazil, Peru, Chile, Colombia, Turkey and Russia. Overall, our growth internationally, absent foreign exchange, was more modest this quarter as mature economies in Spain and France are facing challenging economic environments.","For the quarter, we again grew revenues in Latin America, which increased 9% as reported. European revenues were flat absent the negative impact of foreign exchange, while Asia Pacific declined due primarily to Australia. Many international markets face difficult comparisons against very strong Transformers and Beyblade shipments last year. Throughout 2012, our category performance has been impacted by the later shipment pattern in the U.S. Beginning in the third quarter, our new initiatives are starting to have a positive impact.","As we highlighted all year, the Boys category has challenging comparisons with last year. Despite very strong performance from Marvel, including Marvel The Avengers and The Amazing Spider-Man, the comparisons with Transformers and Beyblade are difficult. Also, we have expanded the reach of many of our traditionally boys-only brands to outside the Boys category. We now have strong Marvel, Star Wars and Transformers initiatives in both the Preschool and Games categories.","For the third quarter, the Girls category posted very strong growth, increasing 17% as Furby, My Little Pony, Easy-Bake and One Direction all contributed to growth year-over-year. Within key brands, Baby Wanna Walk from Baby Alive, as well as Baby Butterscotch and BOUNCY, MY HAPPY TO SEE ME PUP, both from FurReal Friends, are off to a good start. All year, we have remained positive toward our goal of growing the Girls category given the strength of our line for the holiday. The third quarter reinforced this optimism.","Also in line with the objective we set at the beginning of the year, our Games category is stabilizing, posting flat revenues in the third quarter, and the team is positioning us for growth in 2013 and beyond. In addition to continued strong performance from Magic: The Gathering, we had several successful game launches this year within Boys Action Gaming, as well as with Battleship. On shelves for the holiday, Lazer Tag and Twister contributed to the category in the third quarter. We also began shipping ahead of the fourth quarter launch for both our ANGRY BIRDS STAR WARS and Hasbro's Zynga games.","For the Preschool category, the brand expansion I spoke to is evident in the growth of our PLAYSKOOL HEROES line. Also within Preschool, we launched all-new Koosh blasters and PLAYSKOOL ROCKTIVITY while delivering growth in Play-Doh. In comparison to last year, the third quarter 2011 had significant shipments for the initial launch of our Sesame Street line.","Looking across categories, as we execute our branded play blueprint, content for both television and films is helping us build Hasbro's global brand franchises. Television is driving brands, including Transformers Prime and Rescue Bots, as well as My Little Pony. Hasbro Studios shows are airing in more than 170 countries worldwide and on a number of home entertainment and digital distribution platforms around the world.","In the U.S., The Hub continues to make significant gains in distribution and ratings. As of the third quarter, The Hub's distribution had increased significantly and is now in more than 70 million households, making it one of the fastest-growing networks year-to-date among all cable TV networks in terms of distribution games. Ratings also continued to grow and in the third quarter was the best in the network's history, posting a 62% increase year-over-year and a 28% increase versus the second quarter 2012 in kids 2 to 11, representing the strongest growth among all kids' cable TV networks.","As we look to 2013, the global entertainment slate we're developing per product is deep and broad, with several major films and continued global television support for Hasbro brand and our partners' brands. First, G.I. JOE: RETALIATION is expected in March 2013 in 3D with our partners at Paramount. In May, Iron Man 3 in 3D from Marvel Studios is scheduled for release, as well as STAR TREK from Paramount. Twentieth Century Fox is planning to release The Wolverine in July, and Marvel Studios has scheduled Thor: The Dark World in 3D for November. Lucasfilm is also releasing in 3D Star Wars in Episode II and Episode III in September and October, respectively. Additionally, from Hasbro and Universal, Ouija is scheduled for release next year.","As we continue developing Hasbro brands globally in 2013 and beyond, we have a number of television programs slated for next year, including Transformers Prime and Rescue Bots, Kaijudo, My Little Pony and Littlest Pet Shop. Marvel has new programming for Ultimate Spider-Man, Hulk and the Agents of SMASH and Marvel's Avengers Assemble, premiering in 2013. And Lucasfilm continues a successful Clone Wars series. Working with our partners at Nelvana and d-rights, Beyblade has all-new animation planned tied to new brand innovation and new entertainment to help ensure Beyblade remains a vital and evergreen part of our Boys portfolio.","In closing, our focus this fourth quarter is on delivering on our objectives for 2012. It all comes down to connecting with consumers and ensuring they give more Hasbro toys and games this holiday season than last year. And we believe we have the brands and the marketing support to achieve that goal in the fourth quarter.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deborah M. Thomas","Thank you, and good morning. As you'll recall, beginning last November, we said our plan for this year was that it would come later, and as Brian outlined, we are on track with our plan for 2012. In many markets, the economic environment is challenging, but we are entering the all-important fourth quarter with innovative products, leading brands and a higher level of consumer marketing programs that are just beginning to be executed.","In the third quarter, net revenues increased 1% in constant dollars. Including a negative $47.4 million impact from foreign exchange, third quarter worldwide net revenues as reported were $1.35 billion versus $1.38 billion last year. Operating profit for the quarter was $249.6 million or 18.6% of revenues compared to operating profit of $248.1 million or 18% of revenues in the third quarter 2011.","Net earnings for the third quarter 2012 were $164.9 million or $1.24 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings of $171 million or $1.27 per diluted share last year. Absent foreign exchange translation, net earnings were essentially flat year-over-year, and EPS was up $0.01 to $1.28 per share versus last year.","Cash grew year-over-year to $696.7 million on $143.6 million of operating cash flow year-to-date and $538.6 million in operating cash flow over the past 12 months. We remain in a strong cash position to fund our business and continue returning cash to our shareholders.","Looking at the third quarter 2012 results by segment. The U.S. and Canada segment is on track with our plan to return to historical levels of operating profit. Net revenues in this segment in this quarter were $774.5 million, up 1% versus $764.6 million in 2011. We continue to partner with our retailers to align our shipments with consumer demand. As a result, current retail inventories in the U.S. were down, decreasing approximately 22% from last year despite new shipments for the holiday season. With our new holiday items now shipping, the growth in Games category grew in the quarter and were partially offset by a decline in the Boys category and a decline in the Preschool category, which faced tough comparisons against last year's initial Sesame Street launch.","As I mentioned, the U.S. and Canada segment is on track to return to historical operating profit margins for the year. In the quarter, operating profit increased 20% to $154.2 million and an operating profit margin of 19.9%. This compares to last year's third quarter operating profit of $128.8 million or 16.8% of revenues. The improvement in operating profit was a result of higher gross margins due to product mix and lower overall expenses, partially offset by higher advertising spend.","Third quarter 2012 International segment net revenues grew 1% absent a negative foreign exchange impact of $47.1 million. The International segment revenue as reported was $524.1 million, down 7% versus $563.3 million last year. Latin America again posted growth in the quarter, increasing 9% year-over-year.  Absent foreign exchange, Europe was essentially flat year-over-year, and Asia Pacific declined in the quarter. Our global footprint is bigger today than it was a few years ago. Growth in emerging markets helps provide support to offset the challenges facing some mature markets.","From a product category standpoint, in the International segment, the Games and Preschool categories were flat, while the Boys and Girls categories declined. Operating profit in the International segment decreased $15.2 million to $85.5 million or 16.3% of revenues. Excluding foreign exchange translation, operating profit decreased by $8.1 million, primarily due to lower expense levels in the third quarter 2011 due to the timing of when certain expenses were incurred last year. This should normalize on a full year basis.","The Entertainment and Licensing segment net revenues decreased 7% to $43.1 million compared to $46.3 million in 2011. The segment continues to benefit from increasing sales of television content in all formats, including global television distribution, digital distribution and home entertainment. This was offset by year-over-year declines in movie-related revenue, including lower revenues from licensed product associated with the third Transformers motion picture and a onetime movie payment of $5 million received in the third quarter last year. For the third quarter 2012, the Entertainment and Licensing segment reported an operating profit of $10.7 million versus $15.3 million in 2011. The decline in operating profit reflects the profit impact of the onetime payment received in 2011.","For the company overall, cost of sales for the quarter was $586.5 million or 43.6% of revenues versus $599.5 million, which was also 43.6% of revenues last year. From an expense standpoint, total operating expenses declined to $509 million or 37.8% of revenues versus $528.2 million or 38.4% last year. Program production amortization in the quarter totaled $12.8 million versus $7.8 million last year. Year-to-date in 2012, our expense totaled $26 million.","We continue to experience lower-than-expected program production amortization due to our current expectations of ultimate revenues in the current mix of programming. For the full year 2012, we now expect program production amortization to be in the $40 million to $50 million range. As we continue to gain production efficiencies, we anticipate spending less on programming from a cash standpoint and now expect cash spend to be in the $50 million to $60 million range for the current year.","Third quarter 2012 royalties were 6.6% of revenues compared to 7.9% of revenues in 2011. This reflects strong global growth in Marvel this year but was more than offset by lower sales of other royalty-bearing entertainment properties. For the full year 2012, we anticipate royalties to be in the 7% to 8% of revenue range. Our advertising-to-revenue ratio in the third quarter was 10% versus 9.5% in 2011, consistent with our stated plan to increase our investment in advertising in 2012. For the full year, we continue to anticipate advertising in the 10% to 11% range.","SD&A of $210.9 million decreased $9.3 million year-over-year, primarily due to foreign exchange. As a percentage of revenues, SD&A was 15.7% versus 16% in 2011. We continue to target SD&A to be approximately 20% of revenues for the full year 2012.","Moving below operating profit. Other expense was $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2012 versus $4.1 million in 2011. Our 50% share of The Hub is included on this line in the P&L. For the third quarter 2012, our share of the earnings in The Hub was a loss of $1.8 million compared to a loss of $1.5 million a year ago. We continue to expect The Hub's impact for the full year 2012 to be in line with 2011 levels.","Our underlying tax rate in 2012 was 26.6% compared to an underlying tax rate of 25.1% through the third quarter last year. We expect our full year tax rate to be in line with the third quarter's 26.6% rate versus the 2011 full year underlying rate of 26.2%.","Turning to the balance sheet. At quarter end, cash totaled $696.7 million compared to $187 million a year ago and $779.9 million at the end of the second quarter. For the trailing 12 months, operating cash flow of $538.6 million includes $61.6 million in television programming costs over the period. We continue to return cash to shareholders through our quarterly dividend program, and in the third quarter, we paid $46.9 million in cash dividends to our shareholders. Over the past 12 months, our dividend payout has been approximately 50% of net earnings during that period.","After repurchasing approximately $5 million worth of shares in the third quarter, $212.2 million remained available at quarter end under our current share repurchase authorization. As we discussed earlier in the year, our repurchases have been more modest in 2012, especially during the periods with lower cash generation for our business. We continue to repurchase shares opportunistically in the open market.","The quality of our receivables portfolio is good, and receivables at quarter end were $1.2 billion versus $1.26 billion last year and $651.4 million at the end of the second quarter. DSOs were down 2 days versus last year to 80 days. DSO improvement this year is the result of the timing of shipments and improved collections.","Inventory levels at quarter end were down $55.4 million or 11% year-over-year to $463.4 million compared to $518.9 million a year ago and $416.9 million at the end of the second quarter. Declines in the U.S. and Canada segment inventories were partially offset by higher international inventory, supporting our expanded international operations. Depreciation and capital expenditures for the quarter were $31.4 million and $24.8 million, respectively.","With 3 quarters behind us, we've made progress toward reaching our objectives for the year. But as Brian stated, the fourth quarter is where it all comes together. We know we have great products, strong marketing campaigns and a focus on quality execution. As a result, we continue to believe we can grow revenue and earnings per share absent the impact of foreign exchange for the full year 2012, including a modest increase in operating profit margins. Our objective remains to grow operating profit faster than revenues in future years.","Brian, David and I are now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Mike Swartz of SunTrust.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on the -- I guess, on the Games business. Could you maybe provide us some more color just around your commentary on stabilization this year and then reverting to growth in 2013 and beyond? I guess, what do your plans call for as far as category growth?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, if you look at the Games business for the full year 2012, we do expect to stabilize the business. We're focused on a number of new initiatives in the Games category, our own brands as well as some partner brands. Our expectation really stems from the fact that some of our new initiatives are off to a great start. So as we look year-on-year at new initiatives and POS growth for those new initiatives, they're up strongly, double digits. Also, the continued success of Magic: The Gathering as a brand, Hasbro's own brands and then we're beginning to launch ANGRY BIRDS STAR WARS, beginning to launch the Zynga brands, the continuation of our Boys Action Gaming as a category, which has been successful throughout the year, Monopoly and Lazer Tag, as well as Twister, some of our own brands come into the season as well. So overall, our expectation is that we would stabilize the Games business this year and position us for growth in 2013 and beyond.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Great. And I guess, maybe just looked at another way, I mean, if POS in the Games category, just kind of category-wide, continues to decline next year, I mean, would you still expect to be able to grow?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, I think if you look overall, our inventory in the Games business at retail is down 39% and yet POS on legacy games is down far less than that. And so we feel that we're well positioned with the new games initiatives, especially given the early traction we're seeing for those, particularly as we move into the U.S. business, where it's been particularly pronounced as an issue. The momentum we also have in our Magic: The Gathering business, the new launch of the Kaijudo brand, which is a brand-new brand from the Wizards of the Coast folks, all points us in a very positive direction in the Games business overall.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Margaret Whitfield with Sterne Agee.","Margaret B. Whitfield - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if I could get more color on the declines -- the level of declines you're seeing for Beyblades and Transformers and especially, what is the outlook for Beyblades. And what kind of point-of-sale activity are you seeing for those 2 brands?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, Margaret, Beyblade has held up very well year-to-date. If you take total year, year-to-date, our POS has held up relatively well. Obviously, it's done better in the U.S. from a POS standpoint than some of our European markets where the comps were particularly challenging. But overall, Beyblade is beating the trends, the averages one would expect in the Boys Action category following a phenomenal year. Part of that has to do with the amount of new innovation that we've put into the Beyblade business, the BEYWHEELZ category that's also supported in animation. Something that we learned from the first time around in Beyblade was to reinvent the brand as we move forward, and you'll see additional reinvention next year, 2013, and new animation and a whole new segment of product. So again, beating the trends in Beyblade, and we feel very good about that brand going forward. That's a great brand. It sits alongside of great Marvel brands that have performed quite well this year. Obviously, Transformers is performing kind of on par with one -- what one would expect, as we start to get momentum. We're seeing good momentum in the TV-supported product lines around the world, and the fact that Transformers is on the air in television in 170 countries around the world bodes well for us. So overall, we're just up against some big comps. If you take Beyblade and Transformers collectively together, the numbers that we reported to you but taken together, we did $961 million in those 2 brands a year ago. And so in the Boys business, we've made a lot of progress. Marvel is certainly contributing significantly to that progress, but those are big comps. And particularly in certain categories, particularly in the international market, in Europe in particular, where the Beyblade business performed exceedingly well in the third quarter last year.","Margaret B. Whitfield - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So do you think the Boys category overall can grow this year given those difficult comps?","Brian D. Goldner","No, I think that what we've said is we believe we're going to grow overall this year. We're going to grow revenues and EPS absent FX. That's been our guidance, we believe that. I think the comps are challenging, but we're also seeing great momentum in our Preschool business and our Girls business. If you look at Preschool, our POS is up double digits. Our Girls business, our POS in the third quarter was up single digits. There is some timing issues related to last year's third quarter where we launched Sesame Street. But if you look across a lot of our categories, we have a lot of great new innovation. We do have a lot of great new innovation in the Boys business, including in Nerf and several of our boys action brands. But it's a challenging comp. I'm not going to commit to growth this year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Brian, you touched on point of sales a little bit. Just more granularly, just wondering overall, what point of sales look like domestically, internationally and then just in the quarter that is. And then, in Games, I just wasn't clear. I thought you -- point of sales in Games, did you say it was -- can you just repeat what you said that was in the quarter?","Brian D. Goldner","Sure, yes. Overall, our point of sale is down a bit, really driven by the Games decline in POS. What I said was our POS decline in Games was far less than our inventory decline thus far. Then I said our new Games initiatives that as we compare new initiatives this year to year ago is up double digits. So we're getting a lot of new innovation in our Games business is what we have all strived for as we put the Gaming Center of Excellence together a year ago. Then, what we're seeing, obviously, our Boys POS is down a bit and our Girls POS is up and Preschool is up even more strongly than Girls.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then just on the Games business, you said in the release you shipped the Zynga's -- particularly the ANGRY BIRDS -- the Star Wars ANGRY BIRDS a little bit early. Just wondering, did that have an impact on your Games business? So in other words, excluding the Zynga, would have you seen Games grow in the -- or flat Games in the quarter?","Brian D. Goldner","We shipped a bit of -- we're just sort of highlighting the fact that November 9, we're launching ANGRY BIRDS STAR WARS, and we shipped a bit of inventory in the quarter. We did for several of our new initiatives. That's not special, related to the fourth quarter activity. I'm not going to start to slice and dice by every product category. I think, overall, everyone should be heartened to the idea that games was flat in the quarter. We've said all along that we believe we would stabilize games this year. That's consistent with our broad guidance we've provided. I feel very good about the number of new initiatives we have in the Games category this fourth quarter. I think the team has done a phenomenal job, both in Hasbro-owned brands, as well as in some great partner brands. We also shipped Zynga brands in the quarter. We have some launches going on around Words With Friends, and you'll see CityVille and FarmVille as well. So lots of new games product out there, and you'll start to see a lot of the displays come into retail and great retailer support for our new games initiatives across the board. So overall, I would say, we're well positioned for the fourth quarter.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, as you -- you gave us a nice presentation. You gave some color there in terms of how you were thinking about the rest of the year. In terms of revenues, just wanted to double check, are you still guiding to a 2- to 4-point revenue shift? Because if that is the case, that implies a mid-teens revenue growth in the fourth quarter, so I just wanted to check that.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. I think what I would ask you to look at is if you look at the year, obviously, we do continue to expect our year to come later with fourth quarter being bigger than third in terms of revenues and EPS. If you look at the U.S. and Canada segment, it continues to be on track for greater revenue percentages in the second half. I would get you to look at a 2% to 4% growth range versus last year's revenue split, which was 63% in the second half. And we had that in our 10-K in the second quarter, which is -- I would compare it to year-ago revenue, so low end of the range of 2% to 4% growth versus last year's revenue.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Final question, if you could just elaborate. You touched on a little bit in the prepared remarks, I think Deb did, you've been reducing your program production spend over the past several quarters. Deb said it was due to efficiencies. Can you just elaborate more on that?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, actually, what we're saying is the amortization has come down because the ultimate revenue expectation has gone up is one big driver of that. So as we look at our ultimate revenue expectation for our programming, because of the performance we've had on television, because of our digital distribution performance and the revenues now we expect to get from that programming across merchandising, as well as program sales, the amortization comes down.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. But you've also been reducing your program production cash spend.","Brian D. Goldner","Okay, yes, and the cash spend really has to do with when you have successful TV series. In fact, Hasbro Studios TV shows outperformed other TV shows on The Hub by 74% in ratings. We're 4 of the top 10 shows on the network right now. So as you look at great performance of TV shows, you're able to produce fewer episodes and subsequent series than you needed to produce in the earlier series. If you're -- you know kids love watching the episodes over and over again, but you have to add an element of newness. But you don't need to spend to produce the entire new series again. You can add 13 episodes or 26 episodes to a pool of 52 already produced episodes. So therefore, you're able to, with successful TV series, produce fewer in out-years.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. You're obviously not thinking about the parents who have to watch with the kids.","Brian D. Goldner","Well, but I think it's also important to note so that there's no concern. Overall, the Hasbro Studios has greenlit over 800 half hours of programming, and we still have several hundred half hours of programming that we're currently producing for the network for new shows. So it's not that we're not producing, we're just both producing more efficiently and also looking at where there are successful TV series, we obviously then spend less per new series because we're able to produce fewer shows.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Sean McGowan of Needham & Company.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I also have a couple of questions. Wanted to know to what extent we should be expecting some of the expenses that were lower in the third quarter than perhaps the relationships might suggest. How much of that has shifted to the fourth quarter? I mean, you mentioned advertising, but should we expect to see some other expenses?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, actually, advertising, I'd just remind you. I think we've talked about this prior. Advertising is actually rate-sheeted. So that's how we're able to know it's 10% to 11% for the full year. So we rate-sheet that throughout the year and so therefore, it would not spike in the fourth quarter. That's how we calculate that, Sean.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But obviously, like the SG&A...","Brian D. Goldner","We've been working on reducing expenses programmatically around the world, and so you'll see continued reduction in certain expenses. Deb, I don't know if there's other areas to...","Deborah M. Thomas","Right. And one of the things I think you may be referring to, Sean, if we could talk about -- in our prepared remarks, about lower expenses in the third quarter of 2011. That had to do with some duty issues outside of the U.S., and then we expect those to normalize over the course of the year.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. A couple of other questions. I'm a little confused about what you mean, Brian, when you say new initiatives in Games are up double digits versus last year. I mean, if they're new initiatives, what are you comparing that against last year?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, so obviously over the last 4 weeks, we have sales data. We look at our new games sales a year ago. Obviously, we have several new initiatives this year and far more this year than year ago but also, we're looking at the quality performance of those new games initiatives. And I'm just -- early indicator as we look at getting into the holiday season, how games are performing versus year ago.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So you mean stuff that's new this year compared to stuff that was new last year?","Brian D. Goldner","Correct, exactly, yes. So we're just, again, trying to get a sense because obviously throughout the year, Games POS has been down not nearly as much as our overall inventories that were down nearly 40%. So as we look at new initiatives, what do we see on the horizon? And what we're seeing is a greater impact from new games initiatives and across an array of new games.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And to circle back to a question that's been touched on before, but I just want to be clear. So when you say Games stabilized in 2012, do you mean ending the year flattish, kind of the way it was in the fourth quarter or flat for the year so that the increase in the fourth quarter would offset the decreases so far this year?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. We're always talking about the full year numbers. We're really looking at it on an annual basis, making great progress in games, and stabilization was a full year concept. The idea is being stable, and the reason I've been using that term is it's plus or minus a couple percentage points.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Well, I knew that's what you meant in February. I just wanted to know if that was still what we meant today.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, exactly. We mean the same thing today that we meant then and last November.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Indeed. And then last question, do you think that the degree to which you -- the shipments in Furby, what would seem quite strong in the third quarter is -- do you expect to get significant reorders on Furby in the fourth quarter?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, we have also seen great sales of Furby thus far, and Furby will go out to English-speaking countries this year and then rolls out around the world in several different languages and across many different countries next year. So it's certainly some shipments in the third quarter that we've seen in Furby, but also some good sell-through early days because, obviously, with a lot of the layaway programs, Furby is on the wish list of a lot of kids and also retailers, and so we are seeing great early momentum in Furby.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Eric Handler of MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Digging just a little bit more on the Boys side, can you talk a little bit about Nerf? Has that product did -- was last year sort of a -- actually 2 years ago, I believe, was the peak. What's going on with that segment? And how do you look for that to sort of regain its growth trend?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, overall, we entered the year, particularly in the U.S. with too much Nerf inventory, which we talked about earlier in the year. The new line of product is the Nerf Elite line, which is off to a great start and over time, would become more of the line. We also have more new innovation that comes to the floor between the Firevision, as well as the Nerf Elite. That begins to roll out around the world. So we feel very good about our Nerf business longer term. And certainly, last year, I believe we reported $414 million in revenue. We then entered the U.S., the new year with too much inventory. And so we'll work through that inventory. But overall, we feel good about our Nerf business.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Debbie, wonder if you could reconcile the difference in terms of operating profit performance between the U.S. and Canadian business and international. I think you mentioned that you had some lower expenses in the comp for international. But is there anything else you can share there?","Deborah M. Thomas","Really, it was lower expenses in the comp a year ago in the International segment versus this year. So it's the timing of certain expenses, as well as the impact of foreign exchange in the International segment as well. I think we had about $8 million worth of a negative impact from foreign exchange that hurt operating profit in the International segment this year versus a year ago.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe, Brian, I can ask the revenue question for 4Q a little bit differently. I think in your prepared remarks, you suggested that you're expecting revenues to be greater than the third quarter. Is that against the reported number of $1.345 billion? Or is that against the number excluding foreign currency?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, I would look at the as-reported number. And again, just to make sure we're all clear, as we look at -- we're looking at a 2% to 4% increase on Hasbro Inc.'s revenues coming in the second half. And I would use the comparative now, as we get closer to the year, we can see it's a year ago is the best comparator.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then last question, can you comment on how you're tracking the guidance around the $150 million of incremental revenue from The Hub?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, we're right on track. In fact, we're probably a bit ahead.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Kelter of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just, I guess, first off, taking a step back. I mean, your organic revenue growth has averaged about 2% a year over the last 5 years now, and that's below the standing guidance of 5% a year. And my question is, is there a reason you expect your revenue growth to accelerate to meet that guidance in the future despite what we're seeing in industry trends? Or might you revisit that part of your guidance to reflect lower growth at some point?","Brian D. Goldner","Actually, Michael, the industry trend, if you look at Euromonitor, has projections for the industry growth across all regions from 2011 to 2015 to be 4% on an annual growth rate. So our expectation of 5% over the medium term is completely in line with external reporting and forecasting. They are also forecasting good growth on the action figure business, consistent with the industry, as well as in the Games business. We certainly are also seeing great expected growth in the Girls category and in Preschool. So overall, we feel that we've had to address certain key issues within our business, which we've taken on, the Games business and the U.S. business. Over time, obviously, we feel that we can grow consistent with the industry projections and probably pick up some market share in certain key geographies. So as we look forward, we feel good about the innovation of our product line. We've had some issues that we've had to address, and I think you see we're turning the corner and we're on the path to delivering on our objectives we set for 2012 and then achieving our medium-term objectives.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And action figures, which you brought up, that's actually one I was curious about because I think we all kind of understand why the games data is what it is and the consumer behavior changes being what they might be. But action figures as a category, down double digits this year, and it's an important category for you. What are your thoughts as to what's going on because the magnitude of those declines are surprising?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, if you look over time, actually, if you look over about a 10-year period, the action figure business is actually one of the most inelastic, meaning kind of consistent demand categories, and then it's driven up or down depending on the new entertainment initiatives or innovation in that category. So clearly, we are in a year after a major movie year, but overall, we feel that between the television efforts of not only Hasbro brands but a lot of our partners' brands, as well as the new movie efforts that come there, as well as lots of innovations that we see on the horizon, frankly, as well as expanding the definition of boys action to new categories, including Preschool, where PLAYSKOOL HEROES is performing exceedingly well across a number of brands, between Transformers and Star Wars and Marvel and our Games, Boys Action Gaming, which is performing quite well, I think it's about the way we look at the consumer-centric adoption of boys action play versus necessarily more of the traditional measurement stick of how boys action is measured. And so overall, I would say we're expanding into these new categories of play and getting great response from the kids who are playing with our toys.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then 2 quick clarification questions, the first one, ad spending. You guys are guiding to 10% to 11% for sales for the year. Given the 30%, 40% increase in the U.S. for the fourth quarter that you alluded to, might that line item be above 11% -- the 10%, 11% range for the fourth quarter?","Brian D. Goldner","No. Our forecast is that it would be between the 10% and 11% range. And the reason for that, as I mentioned, is that the way we accrue or account for advertising, it gets rate-sheeted throughout the year. So we already know what we're forecasting to spend. And it's 30% to 40% more in terms of dollars versus a year ago, and that has to do with reorienting our business to the consumer into retailer to be in the market when consumers are out there. We talked in prior quarters about how we were disappointed in the amount of marketing spend we were able to put against the consumer in the most important time periods of the year, and so we have rectified those issues and then some. I think the team has done a great job of not only looking at traditional media but also digital and social media, and you'll see our brands showing up in all those places, everywhere consumers are interacting with brands.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And my other clarification question was the other end of that. If more money is going to advertising and less from trade, as you've talked about, how much did the reduction in trade dollars aid your revenue growth in the current quarter?","Brian D. Goldner","No, I don't think it did. I don't think it had any impact. It's not trade spend at retail. What we've been talking about is flow allowances or warehousing allowances where inventory is going into warehouses or into retailers in advance of the demand.","Deborah M. Thomas","Typically, in the first half of the year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jaime Katz of Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","My first question is on the Preschool category and whether it was down partially from timing or if you guys are seeing any share shifts in the category. And then, I know that your nearest competitor has done a pretty decent push on the TV media aspect for their Preschool category. Are you guys doing anything like that? And can you maybe talk a little bit more about the media push that you guys are doing and how you're allocating those dollars?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, in fact, if you look both year-to-date, as well as in Q3, our PLAYSKOOL business is up as is our Play-Doh business, as is our PLAYSKOOL HEROES business. What we're looking at, to your point, is timing. It has a lot -- it has to do a lot with timing of Sesame Street's launch a year ago versus this year and what we were doing in the third quarter a year ago to set ourselves up. Remember, that was the first quarter where we had the new Sesame Street license, and so we were out at retail really developing that brand and putting it out at retail for the first time for Hasbro. And so as we look at trends between the POS trend year-to-date, which is up, as well as in the quarter, as well as the actual sales across a number of initiatives and new initiatives like PLAYSKOOL HEROES, as well as our new Koosh brand for preschoolers, we feel very good about our prospects in the Preschool business.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And then, the media part of it, are you guys -- can you talk about how you're spending those dollars?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. So overall, our media spend is up in the U.S. and for the fourth quarter. And a lot of those media dollars will certainly go toward the Preschool category, so we're spending a healthy amount of media. We won't break out media by category. But as we've talked, overall, for the fourth quarter in the U.S., media spend will be up 30% to 40% versus a year ago. And certainly, given the momentum we have in a lot of our Preschool categories, we would expect to spend more there.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Conder of Wells Fargo.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of clarifications to begin with. Number one, Transformers and Beyblade, I think you said that Beyblade was performing better than expectations as far as, if you want to call it the year-over-year burn down, and Transformers was in line with expectations. Just to make sure that we got that correct. And then also, on the channel inventories and action figures, can you talk to us as to where those are collectively and then, your POS, how that's trending as we're seeing it here, especially in the third -- as the third quarter wrapped up?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. Beyblade, overall, is tracking above the typical burn-down rate, if you will, using your terminology, year after a phenomenal year. And Transformers is sort of on trend one -- with what one would expect. We think that as Transformers Prime, the TV series, kicks in around the world, we should perform well in Transformers as we move forward and feel good about the new innovations in the brand there. David, you want to talk about...","David D. R. Hargreaves","Yes, I think we said overall, the inventories were down about 22% at retail, which was 15.9% in Games or about 16% in Games and 39% or 40% in Games & Puzzles -- sorry, 15% and 16% in toy and about 38%, 39% in Games & Puzzles. So if you dig into the toy number a bit more, you're finding that the retail inventory on Boys is probably down about 30%, which is consistent with the fact that we had really big numbers on Transformers and Beyblade last year. And then, it's actually up in Girls, which is, again, where we've got a lot of momentum this year as we're shipping sort of things like Furby and One Direction and the new Furby and Pony items.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, just any comment how the POS in the action figures sort of wrapped up the quarter?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, overall, the boys action figure POS is -- was down for the quarter but not down as much as inventory. And overall, again, it belies the fact to how well Marvel is really performing. We feel great about the Marvel business. We're just up against some big comps there. The other thing that was true, if you remember in 2011, as we all talked about it, we shipped a lot early on in Transformers, and the business didn't perform as well as what we probably wanted later in the year. So proportionately, more revenues went in earlier in the year. Conversely, this year, we have an opportunity because we have great performing movies in the Marvel movies and the great opportunity with the DVDs out in this fourth quarter and the holiday to ship revenues.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, one last question. As it relates to the North American improvement in operating profits for the year, I think you talked about it was better mix but also lower cost. Was there anything in the fourth quarter in particular last year as it related to North American division that you'll be lapping and that will help or something else incremental, again, that you've done and put in place in the North American segment that'll help in the fourth quarter?","Brian D. Goldner","In reorganizing our business late last year or early this year, we certainly are running the business differently than we have in years past, and we've talked about getting the U.S. business back to historical levels of operating profit. So the cost structure, the way we go to market and our approach should enable us to create sustainable higher levels of operating profit margin than year ago.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of James Hardiman of Longbow Research.","Phil Anderson - Longbow Research LLC","This is actually Phil Anderson standing in for James. Just looking at the SD&A line, you guys are still guiding 20% for the year. Given what you've reported in the 3 quarters so far, that maybe looks a little bit high. Just wondering if there's anything sort of one-off in fourth quarter that would cause that number to be up and if you could kind of just explain your updated thinking around the SD&A number.","Deborah M. Thomas","Sure, Phil. Thanks for the question. Just to remind you, last year in the fourth quarter, we had an adjustment of about $30 million that hit, in large part, the SD&A line related to compensation adjustments. So as we sit and plan for this year, we would expect the compensation levels to be at 100% until we knew otherwise.","Phil Anderson - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, fair enough. And then, finally, just with all these new games you guys are introducing, it certainly sounds like those are off to a good start here. Just wondering, is there any risk that the growth of those new games comes with you having such a large market share in that game segment sort of some cannibalization occurring there as those brands grow?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, actually, what we've seen is both year-to-date and in the third quarter, our digital gaming revenues have grown. We have more digital games being created on top of new games initiatives. So we've talked about in prior years that where we have innovation in our basic game business and digital games they come -- that we don't see cannibalization. We actually see growth, the opportunity for people to try new games in all kinds of different formats and play those games differently in different formats. We think that a game like Words With Friends that on the face of it seems could be similar to other games is great because for the first time, we're adding elements to that game that's never existed before, the ability to play multiplayer, meaning 4 player. If you've ever played Words With Friends on your smartphone, you can only play with one other person. So we're adding this whole new benefit of being able to play with 4 people, which would also be added to the online gaming experience. So we're really building a great ecosystem of online great game play, plus off-line in many cases. And then another case is just great fun off-the-board gaming experiences like Twister with Twister Dance, which is off to a great start or Lazer Tag that uses your iPhone or iPod to create augmented reality as you play a much more enhanced Lazer Tag game. So we don't really see cannibalization as an issue. We've talked about the fact that some of our traditional, call it, one SKU Games business will continue -- the tail of the business to continue to decline over time, but that we have a lot of new gaming initiatives that are really innovative that are connected to digital that should enable us to stabilize the business's share and grow over time.","Operator","Our next question is from Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You spoke about your movie lineup for next year. Just wondering, how does that compare with this year's lineup with Avengers and Spider-Man? And do you think there'll be any fatigue impact on Iron Man or Thor toy sales, just given you had Iron Man and then you had both of those over the last 2 years?","Brian D. Goldner","I think looking at the Boys business and as we look forward, the great part about 2013 is a number of known brands. And why I say that is both from an audience standpoint, as well as from a retailer standpoint globally, known brands are extremely helpful because retailers know exactly how to plan those and they know where the added excitement comes from new stories being told around those brands, new innovations that are coming from Hasbro and our partners around several of those brands. So we're very excited about the number of Marvel movies that come into theaters next year. Equally, having 2 Star Wars movies next year where people really understand what Star Wars is all about and the fact that they come during more of the height of seasonality in September and October should be quite good for us, and we kick off the year with G.I. Joe. So overall, lots of known brands that are very beneficial with new stories for both global audiences, as well as global retailers.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Do you think it will be equal to this year or less?","Brian D. Goldner","No, I'm not going to guide anywhere right now. I just would tell you that between the motion picture support and the number of new TV series that we have coming from Marvel Studios and Hulk support, Avengers support, Spider-Man support, as well as our own brands and Transformers and Kaijudo and as we look at all that in the Boys Action business, we feel very good about both the TV efforts, as well as the movie efforts and the innovation in the category.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, as you talked to your retail customers over the last few months, has anything changed in terms of how they're approaching holiday this year in terms of whether -- their buying patterns or their expectations for overall toy sales in the fourth quarter?","David D. R. Hargreaves","Well, clearly, their buying patterns are later, and we recognized that last November when we first sort of said that our year was going to come later and we were going to work with our retailers to deliver more in line with consumer demand, particularly in the U.S. So we sort of foresaw that, and it's certainly happening. I think in terms of as we look at their expectations for retail, I think they're looking forward to a good year. Certainly, consumer demand has held up pretty well, and I think in September, retail sales did a little bit better than people were expecting. So I think they're sort of cautiously optimistic and their deference to buying later affected our inventory at retail. Being down sort of 22% at this time sort of confirms that.","Operator","Our last question is from the line of Gerrick Johnson of BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Deb, we kind of blew past the gross margin discussion. Can we talk about perhaps moving components, moving parts there, price, cost savings and input costs, et cetera?","Deborah M. Thomas","Sure, Gerrick. Well, as we talked about earlier this year, we did implement a price increase, mid-single digits globally on carryover products, so that's held. And as we've also talked about, we price -- we lock in our prices about 12 to 18 months in advance. So while commodities have continued to move around a bit in the quarter going up and then coming down and going up again, most recently, we're pretty much insulated from that because of when we lock in our costs with our vendors, and our pricing has held. From a gross margin standpoint, our gross margin, if you go back historically in the third quarter, is typically our lower quarter from a gross margin standpoint. But there was really nothing unusual. As a matter of fact, it was 56.4% in both years, and to the tenth of a percent difference was only because currency rates were so high last year, and we had some favorability in NPV. But it really wasn't meaningful. And overall for the full year, we continue to expect our gross margin to be at the 58-point-something percent range.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And board -- Games, I was hoping you could perhaps break out performance within Games, Wizards of the Coast, perhaps, board games and then the boys action segment, which I guess would be incremental. But how did board games specifically perform year-over-year in shipments, as well as Wizards of the Coast year-over-year?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, we have to look by brand. I think, overall, in the quarter, a brand like the new Monopoly coming out and getting off to a really good start, the Monopoly Millionaires, Battleship as kind of a classic board game was up significantly. Certainly, you're right, action battling is -- that whole category has been up for us. We've talked about the fact that the tail of the board game business, the one-off single-SKU games will continue to come down over some time and will be replaced by new innovations like Twister, new innovations in Monopoly and Lazer Tag. Certainly, Battleship is performing as action battling and then some new initiatives that come in the fourth quarter. So really, reinventing what it means to be a board game and also adding to that the Wizards of the Coast business, which has performed very well throughout the year, that's both Magic: The Gathering and Duel Masters. And then, the launch of Kaijudo, we're very positive on. It's early days, and we'll roll that out around the world.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. I think I'll sneak in one more. In the Boys segment, it appears that role play is doing really well, much better than action figures. Brian, what do you think explains why we go in and we look at Avengers and we see the shields and the hammers gone but the action figures kind of still kind of there?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, I think that clearly, we're probably just replenishing the action figure business better than the shields in the role play business, and so we probably should get on that. We, for the holiday season, feel like we have performance that's coming in both places. And certainly, the role play business for many, many years back to the LIGHTSABER business has always been a classic play pattern within Boys Action. I think we've really struck a nerve with boys in the shields and the Hulk Hands and so many areas, including the Web Shooter. And we have a lot of new innovation in role play, as well as action figures for the holidays.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

We grew revenues 4% to a record $5.2 billion and captured the number one position across the G11 markets for the full year 2017 according to NPD and SIM.","Consumer takeaway increased approximately 7% for the year and we grew point of sale in all major regions and all brand portfolio categories. We continued investing in innovation to industry-leading levels delivering growth in Franchise Brands, Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brands, while building capabilities across the brand blueprint.","We delivered revenue and profit growth in the entertainment and licensing segment led by strength in consumer products. We had two successful franchise brand theatrical events, which drove incremental revenue in both Transformers and My Little Pony.","We added to our storytelling and content capabilities through an expansive five-year agreement with Paramount, invested in our animation studio, Boulder Media and enhanced our digital first orientation. We maintained a high level of profitability, reporting a 15.6% operating profit margin. We invested in growing our business, while returning $427 million in cash to shareholders. Today we announced our board increased the dividend 11% to $0.63 per share, the 14th increase in 15 years.","Importantly we remain steadfast in our principles to operate with excellence. In 2017, Hasbro ranked number one on the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list by CR Magazine. We were recognized as the World\u2019s Most Ethical Company for the sixth consecutive year, and we ranked third on Newsweek's Green Rankings. The global Hasbro\u2019s team's accomplishments in 2017 were meaningful and we are excited about our opportunities in 2018 and beyond. ","Before I discuss the year more closely, let us review the fourth quarter, including where our actual results fell short of the expectations we set in October. Hasbro Franchise Brands sit at the center of our strategy, and in the fourth quarter Franchise Brands revenues grew 11%. Transformers, Magic: The Gathering, NERF, My Little Pony and Monopoly revenues increased.","For the quarter, point of sale increased in all categories other than Partner Brands. However, after 10 months of strong consumer takeaway the industry and our business slowed in November and December. We have identified three significant factors. First, we did not ship or sell-through as much as we expected in support of the late fourth-quarter release of Star Wars, the Last Jedi. As a result, Hasbro Star Wars revenues declined and performed below expectations in the quarter and for the year.","Historically the brand would deliver a revenue surge in film years and shrink the following year. Instead we are seeing a pattern like other properties, which have films every year, such as Marvel, where Star Wars should maintain a large, more sustainable year in and year out revenue level. Recognizing this and working with Disney, we can better plan our business with improved visibility, sustainability and profitability over the long-term.","As the film has gained a wider audience point of sale in early 2018 has significantly improved and is up year-to-date, including strong growth in online sales. We are working closely with Disney consumer products and interactive media to continue to drive innovative brand experiences over the coming years and in the near term to leverage the upcoming home entertainment window for the Last Jedi and to ensure that retailers position to take new inventory in support of the May release of Solo, a Star Wars story.","Going forward, merchandise on shelf space will be closer to movie promotional activity and premier dates. Importantly, Star Wars remains a tremendous property and opportunity, one in which Hasbro is deeply committed. In 2017, Star Wars ranked as the number one global property in the toy and game industry according to NPD, and we look forward to driving this success for years to come.","Second, revenues declined 8% in Europe during the fourth quarter. Star Wars contributed to our European decline, but as we had discussed throughout 2017 the region was also affected by a weakening UK economy as Brexit negatively impacted consumer and retailer confidence. This impact was more severe than expected late in the year.","During the weeks leading up to the holidays retailers became increasingly risk-averse as online grew dramatically and UK retailers focused on minimizing inventory and maintaining margins. Several UK retailers are cutting staff in stores, and profitability was impacted as we partnered with them to work through in-store inventory.","For the year, NPD estimates the UK toy and game market declined 3% and we estimate the EU5 markets declined slightly. Across the European region, e-commerce is growing rapidly, representing an even bigger piece of the market during the holiday, and disrupting traditional retailers\u2019 business models. We have invested in a global omni-channel strategy to make Hasbro brands available everywhere consumers shop. We are working through inventory carryover in Europe, and anticipate we will face headwinds, while we address these changing market dynamics during the year, particularly in the first half.","Third, our outlook for the fourth quarter reflected a higher level of uncertainty due to the September Toys\u201cR\u201dUs bankruptcy. This uncertainty materialized and our business with Toys\u201cR\u201dUs was impacted in the quarter about as we expected. We continue to partner with Toys\u201cR\u201dUs to support their turnaround, while managing our risk and inventory. We estimate less than half the stores in their announced closures directly affect our initial plans, but we also expect Toys\u201cR\u201dUs to streamline inventory at remaining stores.","Much of this impact will be felt in the first two quarters of the year. We anticipate during 2018 that we will right size our business with Toys\u201cR\u201dUs, while leveraging our omni-channel model to ensure product is available throughout our retailer network to meet consumer demand. The development of our omni-channel product and channel strategy is aligned with where retailers are expanding, notably in emerging markets in Asia and Russia, and also in growing channels in developed economies.","Despite the slower end to the year, our brand blueprint strategy is working. Franchise Brands grew 10% in 2017, behind growth in Transformers, NERF, Monopoly, and My Little Pony. Each brand activates the blueprint differently but the result is consistent; deeper consumer engagement, innovative brand and product experiences and increasingly expansive opportunities for our portfolio.","NERF posted its fifth consecutive year of double-digit growth and was the number one toy and game property in the US according to NPD. We are delivering innovation that is [break frame] and performance in our products that is unparalleled. As we say, it is NERF or nothing. ","Transformers and My Little Pony both leveraged multiple content platforms, including theatrical releases, animation on broadcast and streaming sites, and digital content to drive growth. Transformers revenue grew strong double-digits and storytelling delivered strong engagement based on compelling insights around the blueprint for both brands. We will talk more about storytelling and its continued importance in brand building at Toy Fair next week.","Monopoly had a strong year, including a successful Token Madness promotion and product, as well as Monopoly Gamer, which introduced beloved Nintendo characters to the Monopoly game. Magic, The Gathering finished the year strong as revenue grew in the fourth quarter, but full-year revenue declined slightly. Our investments and activities for long-term growth are taking hold, including a successful closed beta for our new digital initiatives, Magic, The Gathering Arena.","As gaming platforms and audiences continue to expand globally we have increased our focus on gaming. In 2017, Hasbro gaming revenues increased 10%. Our tremendous heritage of gaming expertise is a strategic differentiator, which uniquely positions us to capitalize on the dynamic opportunity in gaming across demographics and platforms.","Our new innovative social games captured the fun in gaming. Kids, adults and families are playing games, while many gaming brands contributed to growth. For the year, Dungeons & Dragons was particularly successful. We also grew digital gaming revenues and we launched new gaming experiences such as DROPMIX. ","Emerging Brands revenues grew 2% as Baby Alive continued to perform at a high level. FurReal Friends also had a great year, including Tyler the tiger, which was a top toy over the holiday period. While several partner brands grew in 2017, overall partner brand revenues declined 10%. Beyblade delivered a strong first year and both Marvel and Sesame Street posted higher revenues.","Trolls full year revenue was down, but came close to 2016\u2019s movie year sales, which began during Q4 last year. The softness in partner brand category came primarily from Star Wars as we discussed, and to a lesser extent Disney Frozen as it is one-year further removed from the movie year.","Disney Princess revenues declined slightly, while full-year point of sale increased substantially, driven by the introduction of new properties. Looking forward, both in 2018 and beyond, we are positioned to leverage our industry leading investment in innovation and drive new brand experiences across our brand portfolio.","We are excited about where Hasbro is today, the progress we are making in our brands and our organization is unlocking future opportunities for our stakeholders. Across Hasbro the brands where we have invested to execute the full brand blueprint are the ones that are producing extraordinary results and building value for our shareholders. As we look ahead, the Hasbro team is delivering on the promise of what our differentiated story-led and digital first strategy offers to consumers, audiences and customers, and we look forward to sharing more with you on February 16 at our investor event at Toy Fair.","I will now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deb Thomas","Thank you, Brian and good morning everyone. 2017 was a record year for Hasbro. The investments we have made over the last 10 years continued to bear fruit. Overall Hasbro revenues grew 4%. Our franchise brands utilizing the full blueprint grew 10%. Hasbro Gaming grew 10%. Many emerging brands benefited from innovation and the category grew 2%.","Several of our partners brands grew but the category declined 10%. Much of this decline directly impacted our fourth quarter, which had revenues lower than we had expected. As Brian discussed, after 10 months of very strong performance in both sales to our customers and sell-through to consumers, the months of November and December slowed significantly for the industry and for us, and we did not achieve the objectives we had set for the fourth quarter. Despite this, our operating profit margin for the full year was 15.6% and strong capital management continued to positively contribute to fourth-quarter earnings as it had throughout the year.","In the fourth quarter, our finance organization assessed the global tax environment, which provided opportunities to utilize tax assets and re-evaluate our current and historical tax reserves. This exercise contributed to an increase in underlying earnings per share for both the quarter and the year. Similar to other US multinationals, we recorded a provisional charge related to US tax reform in the fourth quarter. As these new laws are clarified and additional guidance is provided in 2018, this amount is likely to be further adjusted. However, we anticipate a sustainable benefit to our effective tax rate in the future, and our access to global cash that will enable us to further invest in our business for long-term growth.","Our cash position ended the year stronger than ever and our directors have voted an 11% increase to our quarterly dividend. In the US and Canada segment, revenues grew 5% for the year. Franchise Brands, Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brands increased, while partner brands declined. Point of sale increased in the high single digits for the year with only partner brands declining slightly. Retail inventory is overall in good shape. However, we are working through carryover inventory in select brands to begin 2018.","Operating profit in the US and Canada segment declined 2% and operating profit margin was 19%. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the mix in revenue, increased advertising and higher bad debt expense related to the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs bankruptcy filing in the third quarter of 2017. International segment revenues increased 2%, including a favorable $75.3 million impact from foreign exchange.","Within the international segment Franchise Brands and Hasbro Gaming revenue growth offset a decline in partner brand and Emerging Brands revenue. Revenues increased in Latin America and Asia-Pacific, while Europe declined 2%. Point of sale increased in all three regions although Europe slowed late in the year. Operating profit in the international segment declined 22% to $228.7 million or 10.2% of net revenues. The decline in operating profit was driven by higher sales allowances and unfavorable product mix, as well as higher advertising. In addition, as we indicated earlier in the year, lower gains on FX hedges negatively impacted gross margins.","Entertainment and licensing segment revenues increased 8%. Consumer products, digital gaming, and Boulder Media contributed to the revenue growth. The segment\u2019s operating profit increased to $96.4 million or 33.8% of revenues as we gained leverage in our consumer products and digital gaming businesses.","Overall, Hasbro operating profit margin was essentially flat, declining 10 basis points to 15.6% versus our reported operating profit margin last year. Despite lower-than-expected revenues, our team is focused on prudent cost management and delivered good operating profit margin for the year. Cost of sales increased to 39% of revenues. The 100 basis points increase resulted from higher sales analysis and higher levels of closeout sales, incremental tooling expense as well as less favorable hedges.","Growth in higher margin revenues partially offset this impact. Royalty expense decreased 40 basis points to 7.8% of revenue from lower partner brand product sales. Our investment in product development remained significant but did not change materially in dollars or as a percent of revenue.","Innovative brand experiences remained core to our strategy and we continue investing at rates higher than our major competitors. Program production amortization was essentially flat year-over-year. Amortization of our investment in the MY LITTLE PONY movie began in the fourth quarter, offset by lower amortization of television programming.","SG&A at 21.6% of revenue, increased slightly from 21.5% in 2016, excluding the $32.9 million goodwill impairment charge. The increase includes third quarter bad debt expense associated with Toys \"R\" Us, higher depreciation, as well as an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. We received some benefit from lower stock compensation and bonus expense and we closely managed discretionary expenses.","Turning to our results for low operating profit. Other income was $74.1 million versus $1.8 million last year. This included higher interest income as we generated better returns on higher levels of invested cash. We also realized a $19.9 million gain due to a change in the value of a long term liability due to lower corporate tax rates associated with U.S. tax reform.","In addition, in 2016 we recorded foreign currency losses of $32.9 million. In 2017, this was a gain of $1.3 million. Our underlying tax rate absent the impact of tax reform was 19.9%. The reduction from our previously guided rate reflects the favorable impact of tax planning and the revaluation of current reserves.","This benefit to our underlying tax rate is sustainable into the future. Our effective tax rate for the year absent the impact of U.S. tax reform was 9.5%. This includes discrete items such as the benefit from our adoption of the new accounting standard governing stock compensation and the fourth quarter reassessment of historical tax reserves and audit settlements.","We anticipate U.S. tax reform will lower our overall underlying tax rate and we'll discuss this further at our Investor event at Toy Fair. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a net charge of $296.5 million related to U.S. tax reform.","This net amount, included a provisional charge of $316.4 million recognizing income tax expense and the gain of $19.9 million I referenced earlier in other income. The tax charge includes an estimate for the one-time repatriation tax liability and adjustments to the company's deferred tax assets and liability to reflect a lower corporate tax rate that takes the segment 2018.","As I said earlier, this number could change as there is clarification to the new law. Adjusted earnings per share absent the impact of the U.S. tax reform was $5.46. On a reported basis, including the $2.33 per share impact resulting from U.S. tax reform, net earnings were $3.12 per share.","Our year-end balance sheet is strong and we generated $724.4 million in operating cash flow, ending the year with $1.58 billion in cash. We paid out $277 million in dividends and we purchased a 150 million worth of common stock.","In 2018, the board has increased the quarterly dividend of 11% and we have a $178 million remaining in our current share repurchase authorization. We have a long standing commitment to deploy capital for the best long term return.","This includes investing in our business; rewarding our employees for their contributions to our success; and returning excess cash to shareholders. We will continue to review our capital strategies as we gain better visibility to the ultimate impact of tax reform.","Receivables increased 7% and day sales outstanding increased six days to 79 days, including two days related to the timing of collecting Toys \"R\" Us receivables. The remaining increase was related to the timing of collections and foreign exchange.","Absent the impact of foreign exchange translation, receivables increased in line with constant currency revenue growth. Inventories increased 12%; absent foreign exchange inventories were up 5% with half of this increase due to new markets we entered during 2017.","Our overall inventory at Hasbro was in good condition and associated with growing brands. With respect to retail inventory, our commercial teams in most markets collaborated to sell-through and clear inventory heading into 2018. We continue to work through higher than desired retail inventory levels primarily in Europe as we begin the year.","The teams addressed significant issues in 2017, including the Toys \"R\" Us bankruptcy; a shifting retail landscape; the implementation of tax reform; and a slower than expected holiday season.","While the last two months of the year are below our expectations, our strength through most of the year combined with our strong financial discipline, delivered a very good year. We continue to execute our strategy with excellence and we are excited about our product lines; innovation; and offerings in 2018 and beyond.","We look forward to sharing these with you at our Toy Fair Investor then on February 16th","We will now open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.","Stephanie Wissink","Hi, good morning everyone. And thanks for taking our question. Deb, we want to focus on the inventory cleanup and then just have you give us some perspective on the cadence of the first task; I know there is some comparison effects that are unique this year.","So, if you could talk about those two inputs on both the inventory cleanup in Europe at the retail level and then the comparisons for particularly STAR WARS, and any other FX that we should be considering in the first half on both the sales and earnings.","Deb Thomas","Sure. Good morning, Steph. As far as inventory goes, we spend as we said in our prepared remarks a good part of the end of the year cleaning up the inventory that was REIT at retail and making sure that our retailers had sufficient allowances to go ahead and clean that inventory out as we come into the early part of the year.","That being said, we do have some pockets of heavy inventory out there at retail that we expect will get cleaned up in the early part of the year. With respect to our inventory, our inventory is in growing brands that's really where the increases that and we had a pretty significant impact of FX just because of the translation rates.","When you back that out, the majority of the increase is in new markets that we entered into this share, such as India and into South Africa.","So, our new markets inventory is growing for that as far as our inventory it's only growing brands and it's in great shape, and we do think the early part of the year will be cleaning up some pockets of high levels of inventory but beyond that we're not worried about the impact of it on the full year in any means.","Brian Goldner","Yes. And in terms of STAR WARS, what we saw was that Force Friday was very effective in 2016 after not having a film for a decade. Didn\u2019t have the same impact in 2017. I think we were too far out from the sale and we did see that initial fan response and particularly around our Black series product and other fan oriented products.","Go-forward, we're partnering with this need to merchandise our films closer to the movie dates and take advantage of the film marketing. So, for example, for Han Solo movie, the toys will be available in April for the May movie. We also saw an outsize impact on STAR WARS in our international markets particularly in Europe.","The international revenues as a percentage declined more than overall revenues. I think as we go forward, what we see is STAR WARS has a large brand that contributes to the company with greater visibility to an extraordinary annual entertainment slate. And the way I'd look at it would be if you took the five years leading up to the 2015 movies and then thought about the way we perform last year absent excess inventory.","The next five years would be move valuable to us as well as to the Disney Company. So, we see STAR WARS as a major contributor go-forward, albeit at a more normalized level.","Stephanie Wissink","Thanks, Brian. And do you want to follow Deb on the tax rate. I think you're suggesting that the 19.9% or roughly 20% is kind of sustainable rate going forward. Is that how you'd like us to model starting in 2018?","Deb Thomas","I think, beginning in 2018, we do see all the benefits that we got that let us from our previous guidance to that rate as being sustainable. And that's what I wanted to convey we've done some significant tax planning and done a lot of work to make sure many of these attributes that contributed to a tax benefit before U.S. tax reform were sustainable.","So, I'd like to make sure people take that away because the things that we did are sustainable go-forward. That being said, we do think that U.S. tax reform in addition to giving us greater access to our international cash, is going to help provide further benefit to our tax rate.","We actually think our tax rate go forward in 2018, will be between 15% to 17% and we'll talk more about this at Toy Fair but we do believe we have a sustainable lower rate go-forward.","Stephanie Wissink","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is in the line of Michael Ng of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Michael Ng","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on why consumer demand slowed in November and December. I'm just trying to understand whether you're seeing any impact from the shift toward e-commerce or if there's anything changing in terms of the consumer perception of Toys in general. Thanks.","Brian Goldner","Yes, thanks. Well, actually what we saw is just differentiated performance between different product categories. Our franchise brands remain incredibly strong through the holidays growing double-digits. In fact, we saw a significant growth in TRANSFORMERS, one of our strongest growth brands in the fourth quarter and for the full year.","NERF grew and several of our franchise brands grew. We also saw a great consumer demand and great growth in MAGIC: THE GATHERING and from MY LITTLE PONY. So, what we're seeing is where we're activating the full brand blueprint, we're seeing that growth in the consumer takeaway where we're really engaged with that consumer on a significant basis.","We also saw in our gaming category, we saw growth in we're at not for one or two brands like PIE FACE from a year ago. Our games business overall performed incredibly well. We did see a difference in consumer demand in the partner brands and particularly across the number of different partner brands.","We did have some great performance from partner brands like MARVEL and SESAME STREET and several others. But recalled it a year ago TROLLS launched in Q4. So, all of the revenue for 2016 was in Q4 patrols. And we said that TROLLS for example had had a very good year around the same revenue as 2016 but on a full year basis.","So, therefore Q4 versus Q4 year-on-year would be down considerably and it was. So, between that, the impact of brands that were dissipating like YOKAI WATCH from a year ago that had a outside impact in the international. And then of course STAR WARS, we do see some differentiated demand between different product categories.","So overall, we are seeing very strong consumer take away across several of our product categories and in fact our emerging brands POS was quite strong, gaming was strong, franchise brands were all strong in Q4 and for the full year. The one area that was down in Q4 was partner brands and POS.","Michael Ng","Okay. And just a quick follow-up. Could you just remind us what your key capital priorities are and you mentioned tax reform being one of those things that will give you more access international cash. What do you expect to do with that cash?","Deb Thomas","I think, as we evaluate tax reform and we're the clarification for the laws come out, we'll see the amount that ultimately will bring back and we're constantly looking at what are our requirements for cash combined with and we talked about this a bit earlier that we're actually earning interest income on the smart investments we're making with our cash.","So, we will look at cash requirements and continue to do first and foremost what we say we always do, invest for the long-term growth of our business for our shareholders and then absent that we will return cash to our shareholders. Excess cash to our shareholders.","Michael Ng","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, thanks. Good morning.","Brian Goldner","Good morning.","Felicia Hendrix","So Brian, in your prepared remarks you highlighted a number of challenges in the first half including resale carry over in Europe, U.K. and then also right sizing your business with Toys \"R\" Us. So, I'm just trying to kind of peel back the layers there. What would be the impact on the year of those things, also inclusive of evolving more towards omni-channel and could this quote on quote right sizing drive a full year revenue decline in '18 or are you expecting revenue growth?","Brian Goldner","Yes. We feel very good about full year 2018 prospects. We're very excited about the initiatives that we have lined up for 2018. We come in into the year with great franchise brand growth, a very strong games business and great performance for MAGIC: THE GATHERING and in the fourth quarter and just slightly below a year ago and full year revenues.","We have MAGIC: Arena that had a very successful closed beta and we will launch Arena in 2018 and we'll talk more about that at Toy Fair. We have a number of product categories that are working for us. We're going to work through the inventory that remains in Europe, but I feel very strongly that Europe can grow again. Of course, because it has grown over the last several years and I think that they're addressing those issues in real time.","In terms of Toys \"R\" Us, we've always said we had an expanding retail channel network. We go to more doors today than even before and more new channels including value and drug and grocery. And some of our biggest new retailers have really grown in places like Russia. We have very strong success in China, and we'll talk more about the kinds of initiatives that we have going on there.","So overall, we feel very good about 2018 but we do have some headwinds early in the year as we right size the Toys \"R\" Us business and we deal with some pockets of inventory in Europe.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Just and beside before I go to my follow-up. What's your online exposure now versus what was it for '17 versus what you think it could be in '18?","Brian Goldner","It continues to increase at a fairly fast rate. In fact, POS and online is growing at about three times the rate of our brick and mortar business. But many of our quote and quote brick and mortar customers and now omni-channel customers were performing quite strongly like Wal-Mart who's performing quite strongly in an omni-channel environment.","So, overall we're seeing a very strong double-digit growth but we're also seeing overall POS growth for our business. I'd say you'll continue to see online grow. We're seeing it in more highly penetrated in Asia, and in Europe, and I think that potents that kind of percentages we should see over the next couple of years.","25% to 30% of our business should certainly be online.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And then, just on STAR WARS, I'm just trying to really understand the change because the path during movies now have been kind of released the same time of the year. And it just seems like there was more of a challenge this year and you're changing your strategy a bit in terms of merchandizing and timing.","So, if I may use the term as is there STAR WARS the key, I mean I'm just not understanding what's different.","Brian Goldner","Yes. No, I don\u2019t. And really I don\u2019t see it as at all as STAR WARS fatigue. I think the entertainment has been quite good. I think it was about the timing of merchandizing versus when you started to see the sale through. So, or you have a -- we had Force Friday that was quite early in 2015 because there had not been a movie out there for 10 years.","Clearly, there was a lot of pent-up demand across the board, a lot of marketing that happened very early on and a lot of both paid and earned media that happened around that brand during the 2015 period. 2016, with Rogue One, the merchandise was much closer to the movie launch. We went back to more of a Force Friday approach with a longer window before the movie launched.","The movie marketing kicked in and we began to really see our sell-through accelerate. But remember, the movie was mid-December and by then we were tracking below the kinds of POS numbers we had seen in prior movies.","So, what's really heartening is as people are now have enjoyed the movie and more people are enjoying the movie and as we head toward the home entertainment window, and those home entertainment windows are increasingly important in our business again, which is great.","We're seeing very strong POS growth year-to-date in 2018. We'll head toward in our approaching the home entertainment window for Last Jedi and then of course we'll move in April to merchandise the Solo movie which of course comes in May. So, again I feel that there's great vitality in STAR WARS and just to put a point on it, we had great results the underlying business and we've seen great takeaway for the underlying business.","The size of the business is still very large and we know was the number one toy game property for the full year of last year, internationally or globally. And we continue to believe it will be that kind of business for us with great visibility to entertainment and great sustainability and frankly some better profitability for us as we go forward, as we partner and go forward and therefore we could have a more valuable brand over the next five years and we've had over the period that led up to the 2015 movie, those same five years.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. So, the punch line just seems that people are now or consumers are now buying the product much closer to the release than they were in the past, just given the kind of cadence of where we are in this plaza.","Brian Goldner","Well, I think it's really more about we'd entered in unprecedented era of entertainment. There are so much great entertainment that is out there. So, just think about as one example. You had Force Friday that launched early earlier and then you had a great storm movie. They came in between the launch of the Force Friday merchandise and the STAR WARS movie.","So, you just have a lot of entertainment coming, so narrowing those windows so you're really able to take advantage of this specific marketing and these big marketing campaigns around the brands enables you to do quite a strong job in merchandising those films. And you see for the year that MARVEL was up for the year and MARVEL was up quite considerably in the fourth quarter for us.","It was a great performer for us. We saw a great growth in Thor contributed; Guardians of the Galaxy contributed; Spider-Man was spectacular for us particularly in the fourth quarter. So, I think what we have to do is look at what this kind of entertainment with people enjoying so much content and entertainment.","We put the merchandising closer to when the marketing for those properties really takes hold and we start to see that great sell-through that we've come to expect.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Makes sense, thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your questions.","Tim Conder","Thank you. Just a couple of follow-ups, clarifications. Deb, on the tax rate, the 15% to 17%, is that all in or is that just federal. And then, Brian or Deb, whoever wants to take this, just to clarify that percent of your business that was online in 2017, and then just in general broadly, do you anticipate the follow-up on Felicia's question, revenue growth in '18.","Deb Thomas","So, with respect to the tax rate, it's I would say it's -- they will still be discreet items as there are like settlements of audits and things like that. I'm happy to say whatever stock comps benefit there is under the new tax flow will be baked in to our rates.","However, with that I would have to caveat there still probably going to be more clarification to the tax law out there. I think somethings were not perhaps as clear as they could be and as the law maker's work on clarifying that. That could have an impact on the rate.","So, we will quantify that and talk about that as we see it happening along with everyone else.","Brian Goldner","And overall, for online sales, I'd say it was in the very high teens on average. But there are regions where it's much higher than that like Asia and several markets in Europe. And we continue to see the acceleration of online. And as I said, 2018, we feel very good about our initiatives about the performance of our brands, the way the brand blueprint in our gaming businesses has grown and our emerging brands.","So, we feel good that we can grow in 2018 and beyond as we have grown over the last number of years.","Tim Conder","Okay. Well, thank you. And Brian, on STAR WARS, you mentioned that if I understood you right and correct me if I'm wrong here, that it was weaker internationally. How do we kind of balance that versus the movie had broader distribution and promotion by Disney versus the property being weaker internationally?","Brian Goldner","Yes. Look, I view it through the lens of the fact that we saw challenges in Europe and we saw challenges particularly in the U.K. that's a major market for properties like STAR WARS. So, I would say that clearly both the paid marketing and earned marketing, the fans in the U.S. really helped to deliver a strong box office here, it also delivered a very strong box office, globally.","But in terms of the retail takeaway and sell-in, was lower in particularly outsized impact in places like Europe and in our international market, just represent more of the line share, the decline in percentage terms. And that's what we've seen.","Tim Conder","Okay, Brian.","Brian Goldner","So, right. It's a great global property. But by contrast, just to give you an example; TRANSFORMERS international business was incredibly strong; the U.S. business was strong; the brand overall was strong. And so, our proportion of international business for brand like TRANSFORMERS or frankly they successfully had in MY LITTLE PONY this year with our film and our all-screen strategy along with consumer products and gaming.","That formula of the brand blueprint is delivering a bigger global footprint for the company, the way we're executing our games business and including MAGIC: THE GATHERING is a bigger global footprint and we're getting a higher proportion of our sales internationally than in the U.S. for those brands versus a brand like STAR WARS it's still at the end of the year in 2017 more domestically oriented.","Tim Conder","Okay. Well, helpful, thank you. And then lastly, you alluded to a little bit about Toys \"R\" Us, let's take the draconian that they end up having the liquidity in North America. It sounds like you're continuing to push very hard to spread that distribution among other customer bases which has been ongoing.","But just maybe anything on a contingency plan, anything which you can additional can share?","Brian Goldner","Yes. Since we spoke in October, the one other element to the Toys \"R\" Us business that was out there but for everyone's benefit, was their CVA which is similar to the bankruptcy they executed in the U.S., the CVA they executed in Europe and in the U.K. business.","And so, we are seeing the store closings in the U.K. as well that did. That's what I talked about in my prepared remarks as I talked about retailers pairing stores and personnel and certainly coming down. Our team has built a plan for the right sizing of the Toys \"R\" Us business.","We have continued to grow the number of doors and continued to grow our revenues outside of Toys \"R\" Us. We continue to be supportive of them but most importantly we continue to manage our risk and inventory as they streamline the amount of inventory they can take. And we are prepared for any eventuality.","Obviously, the more time we have the better it is but our teams have responded to challenges before. You've seen how they've responded and maintained operating profit even in a challenging quarter and a challenging finish to the year like 2017. We understand we're working in a dynamic market.","Tim Conder","Okay. Thank you, and Deb, both appreciated.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.","Drew Crum","Okay, thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Brian Goldner","Good morning.","Deb Thomas","Hi, Drew.","Drew Crum","Talk about directionally how you see gross margin in 2018 and some of the puts and takes influencing that line. And then separately, Brian, can you talk about your expectations for BEYBLADE in '18. And then relative to past products like well year two which you are in and you typically see a spike or a peak with the brand to this.","I want to know how you're thinking about that because win factor on '18 fail.","Brian Goldner","Yes. I'll take BEYBLADE first and then Deb will do gross margin. On BEYBLADE, we had a very good year last year. It was kind of comparable in pattern two years prior that first year you're absolutely right through. This business very well. That BEYBLADE is performing quite a high level, obviously different by certain countries.","But BEYBLADE is off to a very good start and we would expect it to be a contributor to this year's business. I won't specifically size it for you but suffice it to say you're right it's our second year in most countries around the world.","Deb Thomas","Sure. And with respect to gross margin. So, we were down a 100 basis points. And we said at the beginning of the year, we expected our gross margin to be down because we had lower gains on hedges coming in. so, that was a piece of it, that was about a quarter of the impact.","We also had because of underperformance on some other brands that we've talked about, add some trolling impact to that as well. As we look forward, we're very positive on gross margin. We see no reason why we will get back to the levels that we had a year ago. And we'll talk more about the puts and takes on that at Toy Fair.","But those were some of the bigger impacts on the full year.","Drew Crum","Okay. And then maybe one last one, Brian. This with respect to STAR WARS, were there minimum guaranteed shortfalls on the property or is there that something that as a potential risk as you think about the brand and the licensing arrangement?","Brian Goldner","Yes. I know that no minimum guarantee shortfalls. We continue to earn out that contract in a very strong manner. When I talk about that ongoing business, I'm talking about a business, it's quite sizeable. I'm talking about a business which's a major contributor to us and to the industry.","And I do think it's a brand over time, over the next five years that could be more valuable having more revenue over a five year period than the five years that would even include the 2015 movie year.","It's more about having that visibility and line-of-sight to great entertainment that's coming in the future and the ability to plan and seeing less of that surge and strength that we used to see between film years and non-movie years.","Drew Crum","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please proceed with your questions.","Eric Handler","Yes. Good morning, and thanks for the question. Two things for you. First, I wonder if you could dig a little bit into NERF. You said this was the fifth consecutive year of double-digit growth. Where is that growth coming from, is it new markets, or the existing markets still growing at a similar level as the new markets and how big is the opportunity to keep NERF growing at a double-digit rate?","And then secondly, just wonder if you could do a clarification as we think about ship-in for 1Q or 2Q with The Avengers kicking off the summer movie season at the beginning of May. Will that be a 1Q ship-in and then same thing with Solo, you said that ships that those products are going to be on shelves on April.","Does that mean you get a 1Q shipping for Solo Toys as well?","Brian Goldner","Yes. So, only comment on that first step. I would expect both of those properties to have more of an impact in the second quarter, far more. Because of again this the way we're windowing and merchandising around those films. And so, I would not count those ship-ins in any considerable way in Q1.","Obviously, we're very excited about Black Panther. There obviously it's been ship-ins in the first quarter for Black Panther. We're very excited about the score that it's received, then the global excitement around that brand is palpable. And we're very excited to add that to the already powerful line-up from MARVEL that's coming for 2018.","As I said before, I thought the line-up from MARVEL was among the strongest we'd ever seen and therefore really impacts the fact that I think our line-up for the years among the strongest we've ever seen. And I've also although you didn\u2019t ask specifically about this, as we get through the year, I've had a chance to see the Bumblebee movie and where that's coming out.","So, as we even go into the end of the year, we got strength-to-strength and Bumblebee is a delightful movie that I'm very excited to share with people as well. And so, throughout the year we have a great line-up in schedule. For NERF, it's really come down to great industry leading innovation insights driving user generated content.","It's really the full blueprint execution. It was the number one property in the U.S. we're seeing strength across all the different categories; our Rival business, very strong; Elite was strong, NITRO was a very strong launch internationally and a very good launch in the U.S. But yet, still plenty of running room for a lot of those new initiatives.","Our core business on NERF is very strong. And we take nothing for granted in continuing to innovate, you're going to see new categories of innovation as we go forward. We're seeing growth both in developed economies and emerging markets. We continue to build out the footprint of Rival, our basic NERF businesses are very global.","And it's among the favorite products and brands around the world in any number of countries around the world. And so, again we're very excited about what we've done there. But it's about industry leading innovation and again it goes back to the focus on our brand blueprint and how our franchise brands have that superior profitability.","We continue to still invest and deliver that outsize profitability relative to the company average. And we see NERF is able to grow for many years to come.","Eric Handler","Great, thanks. But just one quick follow-up. So, you mentioned Bumblebee. Bumblebee coming out in late December, I think the 22nd. That's going to be sort of sandwiching between the Spider-Man animated movie which I imagine should be very kid-friendly and then you got Aquaman. We'll have to see how that performs.","But and I would think you probably have some competition from STAR WARS home video toys around the holiday as well. Does that make things very challenging for Bumblebee?","Brian Goldner","No. look, if you look at TRANSFORMERS, I think that we go from strength-to-strength. This year, TRANSFORMERS in the fourth quarter was in dollar terms, our biggest growing brand. And overall for the year grew very strong double-digits. It's because we are perpetually engaged with our audience by demographic and psychographic.","We have a preschool RESCUE BOTS show, we have our Cyberverse focused on our core kid six-to-nine year-old. We continue to run more adult oriented content on Machinima for that fan. Fan business is growing in a very significant manner. And then of course we have our movies. It was a movie year but our products were about the movie but also about all these other dimensions of TRANSFORMERS.","So, this is a brand that's working everywhere globally, it's a brand that's exceedingly strong and getting stronger in China. We'll talk more at Toy Fair about the major global initiatives and in gaming and how this brand comes to life. So, when we talk about our Bumblebee movie, it's really the focal point of an entire blueprint activation that will take place around that time of year.","And we will bring to bear all of the different strengths and power inside the blueprint to bring Bumblebee and TRANSFORMERS to life at that time. So, we know that there is an amazing array of entertainment with the beneficiaries of a lot of that that's in the world today and we think our brand like Bumblebee and TRANSFORMERS holds its own.","Eric Handler","Thank you, very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Swartz with SunTrust Robinson. Please proceed with your questions.","Michael Swartz","Hey, good morning everyone.","Brian Goldner","Good morning.","Deb Thomas","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Swartz","I just wanted to touch on advertising spend during the quarter came in a little higher than I would have expected given the revenue decline. So, maybe talk a little bit about what drove the year-over-year growth there. Was it timing, was it something kind of a nuance to the fourth quarter?","Deb Thomas","No. Actually, we talked about partnering with our retailers to make sure some of the inventory that maybe with a little bit slow moving in November and December really was moving. And it was probably more of that than anything else. We really wanted to make sure we headed into 2018 with the best momentum behind our product as possible.","So, that's really kind of what you were seeing in the fourth quarter.","Michael Swartz","Got it. Would imagine over time in '18 that advertising gets back to more of a normalized level on a full year basis.","Deb Thomas","On a full year basis, I would. Yes.","Michael Swartz","Okay. And that was my next question, is just and Brian you've talked about aligning the merchandising of some of these theatrical properties with the release window a little tightened or maybe leverage some of the studios marketing. Is that something that you think you can get some incremental leverage maybe even above and beyond historical levels going forward?","Brian Goldner","Well look, I think as we -- this has number of levers that exists inside of the marketing elements for the around the blueprint in the company. You have the traditional advertising, you have an increasing array of digital opportunities for digital marketing and advertising including inspiring user generated content.","Then we have all kinds of forms of content from all the way as short as gets to short form to stream content or bespoke episodic content. So, it's really we look at all that as marketing and advertising. So, traditional advertising does change and probably does overtime come down a bit but it's being augmented by and rounded and replaced by some of these other categories of marketing where we're able to talk about story and character and branding brand engagement where our audiences and consumers are globally.","So, overtime again I think you're seeing the benefit of the investments we made in our own brands including our games business and our emerging brands and that we will continue to get leverage in advertising and marketing and storytelling. ","Michael Swartz","All right, great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Arpine Kocharyan","Hi, thank you. A lot of my questions are answered but maybe I can be a bit more specific. In terms of first half revenue growth puts and takes and thank you for all the color in the prepared remarks as well as the Q&A. Given some pockets of inventory as well as sort of Toys \"R\" Us situation, do you feel growth in the first half could be tough to come by for the industry and for Hasbro or do you feel that you can fare better given not all of those closures perhaps directly impact you? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Yes. Look, I'm not going to comment by quarter on our revenues. I'd say that I think our prospects for growth in 2018 are very strong as a company for the full year 2018. And by quarter, we're going to work through first quarter, second quarter, particularly in some of the pockets of inventory Deb has talked about in Europe.","With Toys \"R\" Us, says like said we have a plan on how we manage our risk in inventory and support them but also have a growing array of destinations for great product, innovative product, this product that's selling. And we have great levers and ways to engage our audiences and consumers in those brand stories and characters, including our partner's brands.","So, not going to really give any specific guidance by quarter, suffice it to say I gave you some sense of where some of the shipment should occur more in the second quarter than the first quarter on some of the entertainment brands.","Arpine Kocharyan","All right, that makes sense. And then going back to the capital allocation question, Brian, you're sitting on north of $1.5 billion of cash that is now obviously more tax efficiently brought back to U.S. than historically when you've been able to do this, you've seen an uptick in buyback. In terms of returns, do buybacks still make sense or there is a better use of your capital that could yield higher return?","Brian Goldner","Look, our focus first and foremost has been investing in our business and we think those investments are really coming to the floor; you're seeing it in our results. Obviously, building our brand blueprint capabilities, we added Backflip, our mobile gaming business that continues to perform in a stronger way each and every year.","We got Boulder Media, our animation studio allowing us to create incredible content at a much more nominal price point you saw or you will see from us efforts there. We've also selectively acquired brands overtime like Micronauts that we're now activating writing script around and working with our partners at Paramount as part of our inaugural effort on our new five-year deal with them to bring those brands to life and story and to bring those out around the world.","So, that's where we're going to really focus and focus our attention first and foremost. In terms of buybacks, Deb will outline for you on what we are thinking. We have historically been buying back about $150 million worth of shares. I imagine that's about where we would be for 2018 and that helps to take in the overhang on our stock from stock compensation.","And then we remain open to other ideas about how to deploy our capital for the strongest return to our shareholders. Are very happy to see that our ROIC has continued to increase over the last three years. And absent the impact of the tax reform, our ROIC hit a new high in 2017, up 2% versus 2016. So, that's how I would look at things.","Arpine Kocharyan","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Linda Weiser with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your questions.","Linda Weiser","Hi. I was wondering if you could just give a little more color on the growth margin performance in the quarter because it was actually quite good given that you mentioned that you had to make sure that the retailers have what they needed to work through the product. Your gross margin was only down 50 basis points versus last quarter it was down a 160 basis points.","So, is that all just mix or is there some other factor that accounts for the growth margin in the quarter?","Deb Thomas","No. We did have a positive contribution from product mix in the quarter, that between that and if you actually look at the performance of our business overall and this is one of the things that we've talked about with respect to those long term investments and how we see the ability for operating profit to expand.","We really had a good contribution from our entertainment and licensing business. So, that is a very high margin business. So, when you see the pieces all mixed together, it really comes down to that mix and that's one of the reasons again why we've invested in that business because overall we see that as a great opportunity not just to extend gross margin but our overall operating profit margin as a company.","Linda Weiser","Thanks, that's helpful. And then, can you comment on just in terms of how you think about the franchise brands because we've seen some struggles by LITTLEST PET SHOP and MY LITTLE PONY did better this year but will that be sustainable?","Will the movie benefits be sustainable going forward? And how do you think about moving things out of the franchise brands and maybe moving some emerging brands into there like BABY ALIVE has been doing quite well. How do you think about your portfolio in that way?","Brian Goldner","Well, I think first thing I would tell you is you are very insightful about the way we think about our business and we'll probably share some things with you at Toy Fair around how we think about our brands and the portfolio brands that we go forward with.","I've always said that not every brand would grow every year but we certainly are thinking about our brands and how to reinvent, reignite and re-imagine each brand every year. Every brand has to be regularly re-imagined and that's why you're seeing the success overtime of our franchise brands.","In fact, achieving 49% of our revenues this past year up 3% point versus the prior year. And up considerably versus when we started this 10 years ago. We continue to believe that our franchise brands and our gaming business and the way we approach them are strategic differentiators for the company.","Will every one of our games grow every year? Now, we've seen PIE FACE go backwards this past year. But yet, overall our games business has grown and our franchise brands had grown and our emerging brands have grown offset by some emerging brands that haven't grown.","But I think we run them the broadest portfolio and the strongest portfolio brands with the most compelling strategy in our industry and the greatest teams in any industry. So, that's how I would view it. And so, as we go forward, we'll talk more about the story telling from MY LITTLE PONY and our plans we obviously have great plans in store over the next number of years to continue MY LITTLE PONY's March in growth and to engage consumers across all elements of the blueprint.","One of the things I was very heartened about, Deb just mentioned, is that performance in consumer products and the performance globally across other consumer products category, including Apparel and other consumer products and that's quite good for the brand as well.","Linda Weiser","Great. Thank you, very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO. Please proceed with your questions.","Gerrick Johnson","Hey good morning.","Brian Goldner","Good morning.","Deb Thomas","Good morning, Gerrick.","Gerrick Johnson","So, I was curious -- good morning guys. What select brands do you have the access carry over inventory and also wondering if there are any payments from Paramount that might have been in the quarter and then the whole retail shift to just in time?","How do you feel that you guys navigated that transition? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Yes. So, in the retail shift in just in time is something that we've been navigating throughout time and we feel that we have the capability to continue to navigate in that way reducing the weeks of supply for online and omni-channel. We've been de-levering on overall basis to address that and also building the skill set to do that which is also within the brand blueprint in the way we go to retail channels.","So, we feel good about that. Obviously, we've talked about some of the brands that underperformed in Q4. Those are the brands where there are pockets of inventory. And if we talk about on the corollary area inventory growth which is up a bit, it's all around brands and areas of the world where we're growing.","So, our inventories around TRANSFORMERS and MY LITTLE PONY and other brands of ours that have been growing around games that have been growing and then by region if you just took our inventory ups in effects, the inventory growth is half of the inventory growth is just because we've opened a market in India and in South America, South Africa.","So, again our inventories are absolutely placed where we are seeing growth in our business.","Deb Thomas","And with respect to payments from Paramount, we may have gotten some in the normal course of business but nothing material to call out.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Susan Anderson with B. Riley. Please go ahead with your question.","Susan Anderson","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just a follow-up on the inventory and the gross margin. I think, you guys had said that you gave some extra retailer dollars in the fourth quarter. How much of that pressure of kind of cleaning up that inventory came in the fourth quarter and then I guess how much more is left to come in first to maybe second quarter this year?","Deb Thomas","Well, in the fourth quarter we did make sure that our retailers had sufficient allowances to take any mark down they thought they needed to take declare inventory in the quarter and as far as we look at it we are adequately provided a year end for what we think the impact is going to be go-forward.","So, we don't anticipate having any significant impact in 2018 from excess inventory other than it just maybe a little slow to take inventory in the early part of the year, as we retailers we work with them to clean that up.","Susan Anderson","Great, that's helpful. And then, I guess just a follow-up on that previous question on the pockets of inventory. Assuming STAR WARS particularly in Europe maybe one of those, I guess it sounds like replenishments just wanted strong in fourth quarter. Did those pickup in first quarter as you guys saw POS pickup or how should we think about the flow of that inventory?","Brian Goldner","Yes. I think the way you should think about it and this is what I was talking about with the expanded window of Force Friday II. We had a merchandise on shelf relatively early in 2017 in the early fall for the movie which was consistent with what had been done in Force Friday 1 of 2015.","So, we have an inventory that was in the market, we saw a great initial uptick from the fans around particularly around our fan oriented product through the month of September and then into October and then in November December as that you would see that pivot we just saw the rates of sale and take away below what we had expected.","And so, the inventory existed at that time in anticipation of a higher sell-in and sell-through of product for brands like STAR WARS. And so, that's the inventory that we clean up. So, in terms of where we go forward, we'll sell through that inventory. Year-to-date, we're seeing very strong POS as more people now had seen the movie.","We're approaching a home entertainment window that includes electronic sell-through, we're seeing how home entertainment windows, electronic sell-through windows are having greater impact on our business than they have in many years because people are enjoying watching content and entertainment at home.","And we'll also help to see the story with younger consumers as we've seen historically as they watch it at home versus in the theaters. And it should enable us to partner with Disney to move through the inventory and then to merchandise the Han Solo films and product in the April timeframe for the May movie.","Susan Anderson","Thanks, that's helpful. And just last one on digital gaming. Can you maybe just talk about a little bit more of the growth there and how big you think digital gaming could be as a percent of the gaming revenues and as we look out into the future?","Brian Goldner","We take on digital gaming in a number of ways. So, we do a third party digital gaming arrangements; it's royalty income. So, it's not recognized as revenue as more as royalty income at a very high operating margin and we have very strong relationships there.","Many of our brands are performing quite strongly there across a number of dimensions including MONOPOLY on the switch for this past holiday. Then we have Backflip Studios; our own mobile gaming company that's shown significant improvement year-on-year and are contributing brands and brand efforts like TRANSFORMERS: EARTH WARS which performed quite well as well as their DragonVale brand and a few others in that area.","And then, we also have gaming arrangements in China with Tencent; TRANSFORMERS are very successful; PC online game; and then of course we've talked about for MAGIC, building an array of digital games and then the teams really made a lot of progress there.","We'll talk more about Arena and MAGIC at the gathering at Toy fair. So, you have a digital component there and then an increasing array of digital play as we see more global digital gamers. So, a very big opportunity for our company. In fact, gaming overall is one of our big strategic differentiators.","It's an area of focus for us and it's an area of growth. And I expect that 2018 will continue to demonstrate that progress.","Susan Anderson","Great, sounds good. Thanks, so much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys, this is actually Fred Whiteman on for Greg. If we look at the U.K. business, obviously that was weak but you'd signaled that would be the case earlier in the year. I think you'd also called out Brazil scenario to monitor. How did that market come in versus your expectations in the quarter?","Brian Goldner","Yes. Brazil is about where we thought it would be; it was down. What we really saw on Brazil, I would view is much more of a short term issue. We saw a competitive product being deeply discounted and it put pressure on the market in an environment where you had a political environment that was a bit less stable and consumer confidence that was a bit shaky temporarily.","We're already seeing the opportunity in Brazil for 2018. The teams feel good about our market position. We just had Toy Fair as down there and the response to our product line was quite strong. And retailers are better positioned as we go forward and some of that very low price products that was being cleared through the market from others, should dissipate.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. And then, if we look at the other income contribution in '17 versus last year, it was up pretty significantly. Some of that's due to interest income but could you sort of walk through some of the non-recurring items that we should be keeping in mind when we're modeling '18?","Deb Thomas","Absolutely. So, we and we'll put a chart up on this Toy Fair too, just to kind of help you how we're thinking about it. But from '16 to '17 we had a big FX loss. In the fourth quarter of '16 and we had a small gain in '17 and we would expect on a normalized basis to while we can't properly thoroughly predict foreign exchange impact.","We would expect that to be more recurring. However, we also had a large gain under re-measurement of the liability. That was about, it was $19.9 million and that specifically related to the new tax rates under the U.S. tax law. So, that would be non-recurring. However, we continue to earn a high rate of interest on our better investing of cash that we have.","We also continue to have consistent performance with our share of the Discovery Family channel and it's the same as we've talked about all year, so we saw a repeat in the fourth quarter about that. So those are the types of recurring things and then the nonrecurring would be the large FX which we can't predict and also the tax re-measurement that was in non-up.","Unidentified Analyst","Perfect, thanks.","Operator","Our final question is from the line of Jim Chartier with Monness Crespi Hardt. Please proceed with your questions.","Jim Chartier","Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. I just wanted to talk about the industry growth and how you guys are thinking about industry street demand. You had a slow down over the last 18 months following pretty strong mid single-digit growth for two or three years and flattish or down POS for the industry in fourth quarter.","So, how are you thinking about the industry going forward and is the fourth quarter slowdown impacting the way that retailers are thinking about the category?","Brian Goldner","Look, we still believe that there will be a low-to-mid single-digit growth in our business in developed economies. We'll probably see low single-digit growth in most developed economies around the world. We see stronger growth in many markets in the world like Russia and China and we're participating in that.","We would expect double-digit growth absent FX over time in emerging markets. Obviously, this past year we had 5% emerging market growth, absent FX again due to some of the we see are short term issues in places like Brazil.","And we feel good that the industry will continue to grow with great innovation and we've grown overtime our market share and also grown in excess of industry growth and we'll continue to want to make that progress.","We think that executing the blueprint strategy in our games business, we will talk more about it at Toy Fair; both of those can help lead our growth.","Jim Chartier","Great, thanks. And best of luck.","Deb Thomas","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. At this time I will turn the floor back to Debbie Hancock for closing remarks.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, Rob.

There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements.","These factors include those set forth in our annual report on form 10-K, our most recent 10-Q, in today's press release and in our other public disclosures. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.","I would now like to introduce Brian Goldner. Brian?","Brian Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. 2019 was the pivotal year for Hasbro. We achieved our plan to profitably grow revenues, performing well in a dynamic retail and global trade environment. Hasbro revenues grew 5% absent FX and adjusted operating profit increased 12%. We ended the year with good momentum in many markets and across brands which has carried forward to the start of 2020.","We executed throughout the year as a more agile, modern and digitally driven company after re-designing our go-to-market strategy and commercial organization in 2018. The global teams delivered double-digit revenue and point-of-sale growth in pure play e-com.","Our channel strategy drove growth for the year including double-digit gains in the value channel, the fan channel and grocery and drug. We advanced our retail strategy and execution for online and omni-channel partners ending with retail inventory of good quality and levels as well as product design specifically for these growing channels.","We navigated the challenges and disruptions that arose in the global trade environment, implementing programs to meet revenue and margin goals during the important holiday season.","We delivered compelling gaming experiences, led by the work of our teams at Wizards of the Coast, our positive results to date have us on plan to double Wizards of the Coast revenues over five years from 2018 to 2023.","MAGIC: THE GATHERING revenues increased more than 30% in the year behind double-digit growth in table top play and a strong first year for MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena.","DUNGEONS & DRAGONS revenues grew for the sixth straight year and we are meaningfully investing in both brands to drive engaging storytelling while developing new digital games with high margin profitable growth longer-term. We look forward to sharing our 2020 new gaming plans for MAGIC and D&D on February 21st.","MONOPOLY had double-digit revenue growth and grew in each region with new themes and relevant entertainment tie-ins. We advanced our consumer products licensing business growing revenues double-digits and expanding operating profit margin. We broadened our license brand portfolio and expanded our reach with original live events that drive consumer engagement.","The team is actively working to leverage eOne\u2019s brands across global, multi category licensing efforts and are already making great progress. We will share more about our plans at our upcoming Investor Meeting.","We leverage and created compelling entertainment to drive creativity across brands. Partner brand portfolio revenues grew 24% for the full year and 50% in the fourth quarter. Disney's Frozen 2 and Descendants 3, Marvel's Avengers and Spider-Man franchises and Star Wars contributed to the gains for the year.","We added POWER RANGERS to our Hasbro-owned portfolio, executing the brand across our blueprint in consumer products, entertainment and digital gaming. 2020 will be our first full year globally and we will offer new expressions across product, gaming, story and experience.","Transformers had its second highest non-movie year in its history, fuelled by the growth of fan oriented product and Bumblebee Home Entertainment. And on December 30th we closed the acquisition of eOne adding great global brands to our portfolio and tremendous expertise and capabilities across film, TV and music.","In addition to eOne's profitable business, we are poised to bring more Hasbro IP to audiences, fans and consumers globally while further developing Hasbro and eOne\u2019s cross platform storytelling.","I'm encouraged by the early days of our teams working together, and later this month, we will share more about our new stronger Hasbro. For the full year, the Global Hasbro team delivered on our plan, reinventing our approach to commercial markets.","Each major region grew revenues, Absent FX. The entertainment licensing and digital segment increased 22% to $435 million or 9% of revenues behind growth in digital gaming, entertainment and consumer products.","The U.S. ended the year with strong fourth quarter performance including high-single digit revenue growth. Amid disruption from tariff uncertainty the U.S. team worked closely with our retailers to preserve orders at risk, ahead of the list for the tariff implementation, which ultimately did not go into effect.","Point-of-sale was positive for the quarter, as well as for the full year, absent Toys\"R\"Us. We increased our investment in supply chain and logistics during the year to ensure revenue continuity, and to meet the increasing just-in-time inventory requirements of our retailers, which will remain a priority of our commercial and supply chain efforts going forward.","Our teams, both Hasbro and our third-party providers executed at a high level in the fourth quarter to meet the changing needs of our evolving retailer base. We view these improvements as sustainable in 2020.","In Europe, we executed our goal to stabilize revenues and improve profit. Full year revenues grew 4% absent FX and operating profit increased more than 3 times with room for future improvement.","We enhanced our digital and online selling capabilities across the region to succeed in an environment where retailers carry less inventory, and new channels are expanding. Amazon is our largest and fastest growing customer in the region. While the European region is not without its challenges, including continued retail disruption in several countries, which contributed to a softer toy and game market.","We grew revenue in Germany, Russia and Iberia, as well as a modest increase in the U.K. despite a down market. Point-of-sale declines moderated for the region during the fourth quarter, but POF was down Absent Toys\"R\"Us for the full year.","Several brand launches occurred later here, or will happen in 2020, such as NERF Ultra and new PLAY-DOH offerings. Latin America revenues were up slightly Absent FX behind gains in Mexico, which offset disruptive unrest in several countries in the region.","Asia Pacific revenue increased 7% Absent FX led by growth in Japan, China, India and Korea where the fan economy is an important growth driver. Our brand successes were led by innovation, new platforms and compelling stories.","In addition to those I've already highlighted, PLAY-DOH revenues were up, driven by our popular kitchen creation play items and the rollout of five new compounds in the U.S. which will be distributed and marketed globally in 2020.","Hasbro's robust product line across price points for Disney's Frozen 2 had a tremendous holiday and momentum continues into the year with the new home entertainment window beginning today. In partnership with The Walt Disney Company, the team created a highly innovative line to capture the imagination of our consumers with strength across price points.","According to NPD, Hasbro's fourth quarter 2019 sales across the G5 markets were the highest in the brand's history in the product categories where we have rights. Star Wars benefited from the year end theatrical release of Star Wars, The Rise of Skywalker and the Mandalorian airing on Disney Plus.","The Mandalorian Black Series figure was one of the top sellers in the fourth quarter and Hasbro leveraged the global phenomenon of the child, affectionately called Baby Yoda to drive pre-order sales across several new products which shipped this year. Through new story and characters, young fans are increasingly engaging with Star Wars in major markets around the world.","Finally, Hasbro's product for the Marvel franchises including the Avengers and Spider-Man had an outstanding year behind an extremely robust entertainment slate. BEYBLADE leveraged new product, entertainment and digital integration for another year of revenue growth with good momentum to start the year.","For NERF, a very successful fortnight line and a promising start with NERF Ultra in the U.S. helped us gain share globally in the blaster\u2019s category in 2019 according to NPD. Performance improved throughout the year, and the revenue in POS declines were modest in the fourth quarter. We will launch Ultra globally, and have additional break frame product launching this year. We believe in the growth opportunity for this brand across product and experiences.","Our total games category grew 6% for the year, fuelled by growth in MAGIC: THE GATHERING and MONOPOLY. Higher revenues from DUNGEONS & DRAGONS and several classic game titles did not offset declines in our Hasbro gaming portfolio, including the contribution of new game launches and difficult comparisons to the prior year PIE FACE and SPEAK OUT sales.","The team acted nimbly, reorienting marketing and retail campaigns mid-year to gain incremental space at retail for the holiday, and we'll continue to drive our original product and impactful marketing across the business.","In closing, on the strength and diversity of our portfolio, we setup plan to profitably grow last year and we delivered on that plan, including revenue and operating profit gains for the full year in the fourth quarter.","As we look to 2020, we are excited about the brand and entertainment opportunities the team is executing, to deliver continued revenue and profit improvement. In early 2018, we set a target that said if certain things broke right Hasbro's 2020 business without eOne, to look much like 2017 in terms of revenue and operating profit margin. We've made tremendous progress and expect to continue to deliver profitable growth, but there are a few key factors, which have changed over the period for Hasbro's business pre eOne.","These include an approximate negative $160 million impact from foreign exchange, a decline in U.S. retail inventories alone of close to $200 million when you include the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs exit and the toy and game industry that has not yet returned to growth. What will stand out in the market this year are excellent brands across gaming, toys and consumer products with innovative product lines, and an increasing array of compelling stories.","With 2019\u2019s good performance, and investments in future growth drivers as a backdrop, over the past year, we took major steps to create the Hasbro of the future. We have built profitable revenue streams across consumer products, including toys and games, in-gaming led by our efforts at Wizards of the Coast and in entertainment, which we bolstered with the acquisition of eOne and are making great progress to achieve the synergies we outlined around our combination.","On February 21st, we\u2019ll speak in more detail about the opportunity for Hasbro, executing at evolve Blueprint strategy. As we focus unlocking the value of from the eOne acquisition and de-levering over the coming years, we remain committed to investing in our business for growth and maintaining our dividend. The board has declared our next quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share to be paid in May.","I would like to now turn the call over to Deb to speak to the financial performance and strength of Hasbro. Deb?","Deb Thomas","Thank you, Brian and good morning everyone. 2019 was a good and important year for Hasbro. We delivered on our goal of profitable growth. We managed through a challenging trade environment, and we undertook financed and at the beginning of fiscal 2020 closed the eOne acquisition.","Our teams worked extremely hard to ensure we executed at a high level this holiday, to drive fourth quarter and full year revenue and profit growth, while also diversifying our supply chain and completing a major acquisition.","2019 revenues excluding foreign exchange increased 5%. Operating profit margin adjusted for eOne acquisition related expenses increased to 14.2% and full year adjusted EPS was $4.08 per share.","We generated $653.1 million in operating cash flow during the year, and returned $398 million to shareholders. In support of the eOne acquisition during the fourth quarter, we raised $3.3 billion in net proceeds from our equity and debt offerings, which is included in our year-end cash balance of $4.6 billion.","Excluding these financing activities, our year-end cash balance is in line with 2018. During our first fiscal quarter of 2020 with the deal close, we borrowed 1 billion of a term loan to round out our eOne financing and paid $3.8 billion for eOne\u2019s shares as well as approximately $830 million to redeem their outstanding notes and revolving credit facility.","We are so pleased that eOne is now part of our team. Overall, Hasbro's revenue grew at actual and constant rates and on and as reported an adjusted basis, operating profit increased. Looking at our segments, U.S. and Canada segment revenue grew 3% for the year, with growth in partner and emerging brands.","Underlying profit was essentially flat as we absorbed higher royalty costs in support of strong partner brand growth, higher intangible amortization associated with Power Rangers and higher shipping and warehousing costs from carrying more domestic inventory and managing an increasingly just in time retail network.","Retail inventories were up slightly in the U.S. at year-end behind growth and partner and emerging brand inventories. International segment revenues grew 4% Absent an unfavorable FX impact.","Partner brand revenue grew and Absent FX emerging brands were up. Following significant reductions in 2018 retail inventory levels, they remain in good shape internationally. Operating profit for the segment more than doubled as retail inventories were at much improved levels. Allowances declined, operating costs came down and revenues grew.","Entertainment licensing and digital segment revenues increased 22% with growth in digital gaming, led by MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena and revenues from the Bumblebee film and in consumer products licensing.","Adjusted operating profit and profit margin declined as we invest in digital gaming initiatives, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena and future MAGIC in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS digital games.","In addition, we recorded lower streaming television revenues and had higher program amortization associated with the Bumblebee film. Despite the near-term margin impact of investments, the segment margin of 22.9% remains meaningfully accretive to our corporate average.","Overall cost of sales as a percentage of revenue improved 200 basis points for the year. We had forecasted and delivered improvement based on lower retail inventory in Europe, which drove a meaningful decline in allowances and close outs.","In addition, we benefited from favorable product mix from higher entertainment, licensing and digital revenues, higher entertainment driven toy and game revenues, such as FROZEN 2, MARVEL and STAR WARS and a greater mix of MAGIC: THE GATHERING. This was partially offset by higher cost to bring inventory into the U.S.","As we discussed last quarter, royalty expense grew to 8.8% of revenues for the year on higher partner brand revenues, including strong FROZEN 2 and STAR WARS shipments in the fourth quarter.","Advertising declined $26 million for the year including a decrease of $46 million in the fourth quarter, which was in part due to higher entertainment back revenues, which require lower advertising investments.","When viewed together, our royalty and advertising expenses in 2019 increased to 30 basis points from prior year. We are also driving greater efficiency in our advertising reaching more consumers through lower cost, more effective platforms including, social media.","Program production amortization increased as expected coming in at 1.8% of full year revenues, reflecting the revenue timing and amortization of Transformers Bumblebee. SG&A declined to 21.6% revenues excluding eOne transaction expenses.","The benefit of our cost saving initiatives and favorable foreign exchange were partly offset by higher investments in digital gaming, increased compensation expense and additional warehousing cost. Our team did a good job prioritizing and managing expenses in the fourth quarter.","Below operating profit, interest expense reflected $10.7 million from bonds issued to fund the eOne acquisition. Reflecting this financing for 2020, we estimate interest expense to be approximately $210 million. 2019 other income includes $111 million settlement charge associated with the termination of our U.S. pension plan earlier in the year. There are also several items associated with the eOne acquisition.","These include a full year gain of $114 million associated with hedging the British pound purchase price. In the fourth quarter, this equalled a gain of $140 million pre-tax. The fourth quarter and full year also included $20.6 million a financing transaction fees primarily associated with the bridge facility. With the financing complete, the bridge facility has been terminated.","Excluding these eOne acquisition related items, adjusted other income totaled $60.4 billion for 2019 and $23.3 million for the fourth quarter, which includes approximately $6 million of interest income associated with higher cash balances ahead of the closing.","Our underlying tax rate, absent discrete events, was 17% compared to an underlying 18.3% last year. Based on our customers reaction depending tariff, we had forecasted the tax rate to be at the high end of our previously guided range. However, the teams worked with retailers during the quarter to preserve direct import orders from China and ultimately List 4B tariffs were not implemented.","As a result, the buying practices were closer to historic levels than expected and direct import orders declined only 3 percentage points of the total. That trend, along with sales exceeding expectations in certain foreign jurisdictions changed our mix of income and resulted in a more favorable tax rate. The 12.4% GAAP effective tax rate includes the favorable tax impact of the pension termination as well as certain items associated with the eOne transaction.","Moving to the balance sheet. Given the fourth quarter entertainment releases in the later timing of direct import orders due to tariff uncertainty, our shipments and collections came later in the year. As a result, receivables increased 19% and days sales outstanding increased 12 days to 90 days.","The impact of FX on the receivables balance was less than $1 million. Receivables are of good quality and by the end of January, we collected nearly $550 million of the year in balance.","Our teams navigated the past 12 months extremely well, as we executed major brand campaigns, met the needs of a changing retail landscape, dealt with the disruptive trade environment and completed a major acquisition.","Our combined organization is becoming one. We're about six weeks into our work together with eOne and we look forward to sharing more with you regarding our view to 2020 and beyond at Toy Fair.","In closing, I'd like to comment on the coronavirus. Our thoughts are with those impacted by the outbreak. There is disruption to our supply chain and commercial operations in China as travel is limited and employees and factory workers have been delayed in returning to work.","The impact to our business to date is small, but it's challenging to quantify the potential magnitude at this time, as it will depend on how long it takes to contain the outbreak. If it takes a significant period of time to control, there could be a larger impact on our business. We are rescheduling any China based direct import shipments and production missed during the past week, and we're monitoring the situation closely to determine how quickly our manufacturing partners can resume full production levels and catch up on the missed out activity.","This is a lower revenue in factory production period for us, and we're working to protect the flow of goods. We have a cross-functional team working to identify and mitigate the impact to Hasbro. We've identified priority items with launch dates in the coming weeks and months as part of our contingency plans, and we'll work to recapture any lost productivity in the near term to meet demand throughout the year.","Now, Brian and I, are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Stephanie Wissink with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Ashley Helgans","Hi, good morning. This is Ashley Helgans on for Steph. Thanks for taking our questions. So Digital Gaming put up impressive growth. Can you speak to the key measures you're seeing that give you confidence in growth sustainability, and what can we expect in 2020 in terms of new digital games or features?","Brian Goldner","Sure. Well, good morning. And we did see very strong growth for MAGIC: THE GATHERING and the increased growth for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. And for MAGIC, it really was growth in two fronts. First, our tabletop game grew substantially and that brings a lot of new players and unique players into the game, so we saw growth in unique players. And we also saw growth for all the events. And our revenue for tabletop was up. And of course, in the fourth quarter, it was down as we had described because of the release cadence and the release timing.","We've seen a lot of engagement across an array of new offerings there. For MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena we saw great growth for the brand. That aspect of the brand throughout the year. MAGIC Arena was ranked as a top e-sports brand number seven, it was also one of the top 10 reviewed games for Metacritic. We've seen over 1.8 billion games played thus far. 72% growth in new players for the year, and on average MAGIC players -- Arena players continue to spend about 8 hours a week. We're also seeing incredible streaming metrics 43% growth in viewer hours year-to-year. We're seeing over 70,000 streamers since the open beta, and it continues to be a top 20 game on Twitch week-to-week.","In January, just a few weeks ago, we began the launch of MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena on the Epic Game Store. So that gives us access to 100 million PC gamers and we're just ramping up the marketing to bring in more MAGIC players as we go forward. We're very excited about some other new initiatives that will continue to drive our partnership with Tencent. We'll also talk more about our migration to mobile. And Chris will outline our 2020 plans on the 21st.","In addition, for D&D, we did see our sixth straight year of growth. We are seeing about 150 million hours of content viewed on Twitch and YouTube which is up nearly 50% year-on-year. In the first half of 2020, we're seeing a lot of new initiatives coming for the brand. But again, I'm going to let Chris walk us through at our Analyst Day, our plans for digital gaming which are again substantial for D&D that begins in 2020.","Ashley Helgans","Thanks for all the color, and congrats on the quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","Hi. Thank you very much. So this might be too early to ask, but I'm going to try. Now that we have taken a closer look at eOne books, do you have thoughts around sort of puts and takes for the synergy guide you've given out the initial 130 million when you announced the acquisition. Even if you cannot give exact numbers, how do you feel about that number now versus when acquisition was announced, or anything broadly about the portfolio of brands you're looking at today in this retail environment? Thank you.","Deb Thomas","Good morning Arpin\u00e9. Thanks for the question. Today we're only six weeks into operating with eOne and we're still in the process of finalizing our combined budgets. But I can say that, nothing has changed what we estimated from synergy impacts, so far for what we've seen. We'll give more color on what the two businesses look like together in on the 21st as best we can. You know as I said, we're only six weeks through. But Brian, do you want to talk about our brands together?","Brian Goldner","Sure. It's great now to have Hasbro and eOne come together as a company. Together we'll focus in three major areas that we'll continue to talk about. Certainly, entertainment and storytelling, and they're profitable entertainment business and driving more Hasbro IP across storytelling platforms, our gaming business and then consumer products including toys and games. We continue to see the top growth drivers of the toy and game industry all being associated with both storytelling as well as engagement across gaming and storytelling. So we also see of course that streaming is going to play an increasingly important role. We can talk more about that.","So immediately we add PEPPA PIG, PJ MASKS and RICKY ZOOM to our portfolio. The team's done a great job there, and we expect additional growth. We're also beginning to partner together between eOne and Hasbro teams to reimagine brands like MY LITTLE PONY. As you know in 2019, it was our ninth season, final season for the current MY LITTLE PONY TV series and now the teams taking up the mantle on MY LITTLE PONY in earnest for our plans in 2021 and beyond that would include our animated feature film as well as new television for that brand; such great opportunities as the teams [indiscernible], and we won't talk about all those initiatives today but certainly over the next several weeks and months you will see more Hasbro IP come to the market via incredible talent and expertise at eOne.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.","Drew Crum","Thanks. Good morning guys. Brian, you made a couple of comments about NERF. Can you talk about how it performed relative to your expectation during the year? Is it still the company's largest brand and how are you thinking about the brand in 2020? Should we assume growth for NERF this year? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","NERF made substantial progress in 2019. In fact, in the U.S. where we had all of our new innovation including NERF Ultra as well as the Fortnite line in the marketplace, we really saw very good momentum for the brand. In fact we were up in POS online, where consumers have direct access to their favourite blasters. We grew market share in the blasters category as we describe for the global business, and overall, our sales for the brand were only down very low single digits in the fourth quarter, so we expect that momentum to pick up as we now get the access to new innovation that will go out globally. We have several new innovative launches coming in 2020 as well. The brand is still our top brand for the company and we also saw that the brand enjoyed some of our top sellers over the holidays online included both Fortnite as well as our Ultra one product.","So again, very enthusiastic about the brand, [Indiscernible] believes fully in long term growth prospects for the brand, and believe that 2020 is a pivotal year as we bring more innovation and we bring the momentum we've seen in the U.S. And actually in a few other territories around the world, NERF has continued to perform well, and we'll bring that all to bear in 2020.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning. So Brian, I just wanted to get back to your comments about 2020 compared to 2017. I'm interpreting your comments that given the headwinds it may take a further year to get to the 2017 metrics. So just wanted to see if you could comment on that. And then my follow up is on some of the POS details that you gave in your prepared remarks for the fourth quarter. I think you gave some of the business lines but not all. So I was wondering if you could give us overall POS and then just review them by revenue line. And I'm also wondering how RICKY ZOOM has been doing since launch? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","Sure. You know, first and foremost, we talked about our plans for 2020 now include eOne and so of course we immediately add brands like PEPPA PIG, PJ MASKS and RICKY ZOOM so that the comparisons that we had had historically now are no longer relevant as we sort of step forward and beyond what was our expectation for 2020 to look somewhat like 2017. Having said that, in the underlying toy industry, we've noted a few of the headwinds. We do expect to continue to grow profitably that underlying Hasbro business in revenues and to continue to grow our operating margin over time as we continue to make progress around gaming and our consumer products business, entertainment licensing and digital.","And so I'd say that we're now moving ahead into 2020 as we operate as one company with Hasbro and eOne. As we look out over the time horizon, clearly, we believe the substantial growth opportunity over the next several years through 2022 as we've outlined for you as part of the acquisition.","The POS, we talked a bit about on the call clearly North America saw some growth globally for the full year. POS last was down literally low single digits, and then again, as we -- as we look at the business, we see some really substantial growth around for the full year around our toy business. We see obviously substantial growth around our partner business and brands. I'd also say, we wanted to look at year-to-date because we have seen some really good momentum year-to-date in the U.S. Our POS year-to-date is up 10% and in Europe our POS is up as well. So again, as we moderated those declines in the fourth quarter, we're seeing gains in Europe beginning for the first quarter 2020.","And again, it was a -- it was a late holiday. We saw that momentum build around the holidays and we saw very good performance from several of our brands recognizing that brands like MAGIC: THE GATHERING and Transformers faced year-on-year headwinds. Transformers from the fact that there had been a movie the prior year, and MAGIC, we talked about the release cadence how the fourth quarter of 2019 would be lower than the prior year given the release cadence of the brand over that period.","Felicia Hendrix","And RICKY ZOOM?","Brian Goldner","RICKY ZOOM\u2019s had a great start. It's seen hundreds of millions of streams coming off of Yoku in China as well rolling out around the world, and I think the team is going to talk about the second season of Ricky coming shortly, but I'll let them describe that to you or for you at Toy Fair.","Felicia Hendrix","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Jamie Katz with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Jaime Katz","Hi. Good morning. I think you guys commented a bit on supply chain expenses being a bit elevated. Can you let us know how that is expected to play out over the remainder of 2020 does that level out? And then, I don't think there were any comments on the Disney contract renewal, which I believe is up this year, so if you have any comments on that, that would be helpful? Thanks.","Deb Thomas","Sure. So from a supply chain standpoint we did mention that, with the changes to domestic versus direct import shipping and we're still saying, we saw some higher domestic shipping it's requiring more cost particularly in North America as we add additional warehouses. You don't see the impact on the full year as strong as we did on the third quarter, where we talked quite a bit about it. But that is a reality, it's a slightly higher cost. That being said, our ocean freight contracts are looking good go-forward and our airfreight contract, so are actually bringing product here if its coming to the U.S. is a bit less expensive. However, it's a matter of moving it through the supply chain when it gets here. But we do think that that mitigate out and of course, we look at that when we set our overall pricing for our product.","Brian Goldner","Now, in terms of Disney, we've had a very strong year together and very successful partnership that continues in 2019 and into 2020. Now first and foremost, partnership with Disney on Frozen 2 was amazing. We are -- Hasbro is the leading company on the Frozen property. Thus far we expect to continue to see strong results in 2020. The home entertainment window is going on now with that new innovative products from our teams. We're also driving our PRINCESS business, Mulan comes in March and we have Raya, the last Dragon that comes in the fall.","We're also seeing the great impact from Disney Plus, the fact that the library of Disney PRINCESS films are now available together, only gives us more opportunity to continue to work with Disney to bring to life those characters in product and we see a major of course expansion of Disney Plus across Europe in 2020, which benefits us. In the holidays, the castle was among the top sellers, they earned [ph] their Castle for Frozen.","For Marvel, we had a tremendous year around Avengers, as well as with Spiderman. We also focus on the fan economy with the Marvel 80th product, the 80th year product. So again, its a very strong partnership. And for Star Wars, we saw great results around Star Wars both from Triple Force Friday in support of the Rise of Skywalker, as well as for the Mandalorian. We're incredibly excited that the Mandalorian Season 2 will come to Disney Plus this fall.","We're also seeing and will have great support around the Clone Wars, which is the seventh season which comes to Disney Plus in the spring. And again, we continue to drive and support the brand. I'll give you all that as backdrop for how we work in such a substantial way with the Walt Disney Company. We continue engagement with them and while we take nothing for granted, we believe we will continue to be a partner of choice across these properties in to the future.","Jaime Katz","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tami Zakaria","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk about the puts and takes on the gross margin line that you saw in the fourth quarter? And then I have a follow-up.","Deb Thomas","Sure. So from a gross margins standpoint, we really did see the impact of the benefit of the high entertainment related property that we talked about the great movie from -- actually Brian just talked about the great movies that came in the fourth quarter from our partners at Disney. So those properties tend to carry a higher gross margin, because they've royalties to offset a bit further down the P&L or to go against them, I shouldn't say, offset that. So you see the impact of that in the fourth quarter.","You also see the impact of better performance on closeouts throughout the year, as well as pricing of our product overall. So you're saying all of the things mix into the fourth quarter and we are getting the benefit that we talked a little bit about -- bit earlier, within the gross margin line of some reduced costs from our supply chain and all the work that our team has done to actually bring product into the country.","Tami Zakaria","Got it. That's helpful. And then, your entertainment digital and licensing revenues were up and impressive 22% for the year. So, could you provide some color on the mix of this growth coming from Bumblebee versus MAGIC: THE GATHERING arena?","Brian Goldner","We saw across each of the discrete parts of the entertainment, licensing and digital business. Our consumer products licensing business is up. Our digital gaming business was up with a number of our digital games with partners performing incredibly well including YAHTZEE With Buddies! which is a top 50 game on the Apple app store. We had a new monopoly game launching from Marmalade Studios that launched in December and charted as number one as it launched.","Our POWER RANGERS digital games continue to performed well. And in first quarter 2020 we have a G.I. Joe game in support of the brand called G.I. Joe War and Cobra launches in Q1, as well as a SCRABBLE go game that were launch from Scopely in Q1. So digital gaming grew, our entertainment business grew, and our Wizards digital business all grew in 2019. Arena grew throughout the year. Arena grew in the fourth quarter offset by a bit of decline in legacy MAGIC: THE GATHERING online business, but overall Arena had a fantastic year and we expect continued progress as I outlined the expansion of the brand across multiple platforms for 2020.","Tami Zakaria","Got it. thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Handler","Yes. Thank you very much for the question. Two things. First, can you talk a little bit about for modeling purposes, the seasonality associated with eOne. I know, you're going to talk a little bit about this during the analyst meeting, but for modeling purposes now wondering if you could talk a little bit about this? And then also, you've eluded in the past about this sort of being a inflection for POWER RANGERS. I wonder if you could go into some details about POWER RANGERS and some of the products that you've got for this year?","Deb Thomas","Sure. So Eric, as I mentioned, we are actually just working on finalizing our combined budget with eOne and really looking at the seasonality. So much of their seasonality and their family brands business is very similar to our. Seasonality are historical seasonality. But in the television and film business its really dependent on actually very similar to us last year one of things Brian didn't mentioned in our entertainment and licensing is we had a big delivery of our streaming revenue last year which offset some of the benefits we're seeing on the revenue side and entertainment and licensing. But so much of that is dependent around delivery. So we'll give a bit more color on that as we move into the February 21st date.","Brian Goldner","And for POWER RANGERS it was a great year on Beast Morphers who was a strong year one recognized that the bulk of our business really didn't began until the second quarter in 2019. In 2020, we have the benefit of the full year. And as we look at our ratings on Nickelodeon, we are number one in our time slot for kids two to 11. Season 2 of Beast Morphers launches Q1 in North America and then rollout globally. We're very excited about the brand because we continue to execute in gaming, in consumer products, in toys and games and we'll also add an array of experiences, live experiences for the brand as we rollout globally. So we believe in the growth prospects of the brand. And the teams are very excited about executing across the blueprint.","Deb Thomas","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Tim Conder","Thank you. And just a couple of follow-ups here. One, Deb, little more color on the SD&A seem to be down substantially. And again, on an adjusted basis, if you could just give us a little more color there, the sustainability of that from the cost program that you have held or just a little bit more color on that from what happen in the quarter?","And then, as it relates to Star Wars and the Mandalorian, if we look into 2020, how would you that the trajectory of the core Star Wars is relative, obviously, Mandalorian, maybe you and all that's going well. But if you put those two together, the collective Star Wars, just maybe how that's working?","Deb Thomas","Sure. So Tim, you are right. You're seeing the benefit of our cost savings initiative coming through that SD&A line. But what somewhat offsetting that -- and you also get a little bit of benefit of FX. So, while, FX is negative on the top line. The impact -- translation impacts are bit positive on lines like SD&A. But within that, we're seeing the investment that we're making in our digital gaming business. So while a piece of that comes in the product development line, you're seeing the portion of that for what we've capitalized and we're depreciating is coming through the SD&A line.","So, as far as sustainability, we do believe our cost savings are sustainable. We might get a bit more in 2020. But its going to be difficult to pull out as we have eOne gather. So we'll try to highlight what we think the outline is going to look like in 2020 on the 21st. That's a lot of 20s. But we will continue also to make those investments in digital gaming, because as we've talked about, those are really driving revenue for the future. So while we're seeing some that expense coming through now, and we continue to see that as a great area of growth. Brian talked about MAGIC and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, and all of the other great things you're going to hear Chris talk about on the 21st. We continue to believe that's a really important line to invest in. The other thing that's offsetting some of those cost savings this year is a bit of compensation expense as well.","Brian Goldner","Yes. So for Star Wars, its great to see the level of brand engagement that's coming from the fan. But also its really impressive to see how kids are coming into the brand and their engagement that comes from both the Rise of Skywalker as well as for the Mandalorian, We are very excited to see the Mandalorian Season 2 coming later this fall. Disney Plus also has the Clone Wars that are on in the spring. There's also a live-action kids game show called Jedi Temple Challenge, which we think we'll continue to engage kids. And then of course, they have two major theme park launches for Galaxy's Edge, both at Disney World and Disneyland. We think all of that is -- all adds to the engagement around the Star Wars brand and we're seeing that in the results.","Certainly, we've seen great growth of our Black Series and the fan-oriented product, but we're also seeing engagement around Lightsabers and role play that are expressly designed and made for kids. We think the brand continues to perform very well in 2020. We're obviously excited about the home entertainment windows for Star Wars, of course, as well as for Frozen. And we believe that will just continue to add to engagement. I think that this is a property, as Disney's outlined, that will perform both in film, but also in television and continue to evolve as a property that will be in stream television via Disney Plus and engage fans and families in that way.","I think that as we sort of step back, we think that this streaming entertainment that also engages people in other attributes of brands including merchandising and consumer products is the next watchword for our industry and for the category. And it's perfectly timed with our efforts with the one that we develop our properties for television and for film.","Operator","Thank You. Our next question is from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Ng","Great. Thanks for the question. I just have one for Deb and one for Brian. Deb, could you just talk a little bit about how advertising expense in the quarter? It was the lowest level in 4Q that we've seen in several years. I know you've mentioned the few things; the high level of partner brands mix and some marketing efficiency, but could you just give a little bit more color there? And said differently, should we expect next year's advertising expense to return closer to 2018 levels if partner brands mix normalizes? And then, for Brian, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the engagement and revenue trends for MAGIC arena. How did that look in the quarter relative to earlier in the year for instance? Thank you.","Deb Thomas","Sure. So good morning, Mike. From an advertising standpoint, we did talk about. We had the unusual effect of these two major entertainment properties coming late in the fourth quarter both in Frozen 2 and in Star Wars. So, combined the advertising spend around that was a bit, while it was still high and we're very engaged and making sure, we're promoting products along with all the wonderful promotion that was done by the Walt Disney Company. We did see that we have lower advertising in the quarter in particular.","But when you look at that combined with royalties which is a reflection of the product that moved in the quarter, it was actually, we were up 30 basis points when you look at the two items combined. We are actually seeing savings so in our advertising line particularly as we move more and more to social media and we see where our consumer is actually consuming the media and advertising component. So, we expect our cost to be a bit lower in 2020 than they have been in the past. And we'll give a little bit more color around that as we move into the 21st and our Investor Day.","Brian Goldner","And for MAGIC: THE GATHERING as you know Mike, it operates on a number of levels and the brand was up more than 30% for the year and you can't underestimate the power of all of the storytelling that comes from the card releases and the fact that the tabletop game was up in such a substantial way with engagements around events and unique players all pointing to incredibly strong metrics.","Our digital MAGIC Arena business also grew several fold throughout the year. We saw strength in each and every quarter including growth in the fourth quarter. We were gearing up for and have now executed MAGIC Arena on the Epic Game Store which just occurred and we're really going to be ramping up all the marketing in partnership with Epic to bring MAGIC to more gamers than ever before. MAGIC Arena will move to mobile through in the year and 2020. I'm going to let Chris outline the plans there, but that's incredibly exciting as we gave give more people access to MAGIC Arena recognize.","It's been a PC based game thus far as well our partnership with Tencent, we expect that to ramp and to have an impact on the brand in 2020 as we look at new markets and new geographies around the world. In addition to that, for MAGIC, you will see a new game launch this year in MAGIC in the casual arena and I'll let Chris walk you through that. You'll also see great digital game development for D&D. And we'll see you on February 21st to outline that.","Michael Ng","Great. Thank you both.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.","Linda Bolton Weiser","Hi. Thank you. You had mentioned in your commentary that retail inventory in the U.S. was slightly up year-over-year at the end of the year. Does that cause you any concern going into the first quarter? Or is it that the POS trends are strong enough so that it's not a concern? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","Yes. Sure. The inventory levels in the U.S. are up just slightly. And so, yes, the POS trends we're seeing are in excess of the inventory level increase that we've seen. And we do feel good about the momentum in the brand. We're seeing great takeaway at retail. Lots of engagement around several of our properties. Lots of new initiatives coming for Q1. We've outlined just a few on the call today. But certainly the home entertainment windows coming for both Star Wars and for Frozen -- with Frozen home entertainment window beginning today is certainly incredibly helpful as we engage more kids, fans, and families in those brands. So it's very exciting. It's a great start to 2020.","Linda Bolton Weiser","Great. And then, can I just ask you about your e-commerce, maybe if you could just give us a little color on how your penetration in e-commerce has progressed. And remind us what percentage of your revenue it was in 2019 and how they compared to 2018? And how you think you rank versus competitors and penetration in e-commerce? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","Yes. Our e-commerce business was up substantially in 2019 far in excess of our underlying POS gains. And we've seen incredible growth in both pure play e-commerce, as well as with omni channel. We see our retailers gaining share in those areas. We've seen that for e-com players as well as omni-channel competitors. And our products on e-commerce performed incredibly well with top sellers have included products from Frozen from NERF, and are FurReal Cubby, which enabled FurReal to regain its status as the number one brand in that space. We see Hasbro Games, particularly classic games over the holidays performing very well.","And we have seen a several percentage point increase in our overall sales and e-commerce as a percent of total. And so I would expect that e-commerce sales as a percent of total now should be in the low 20s. We're just looking at some final numbers there. But again, we expect that to continue to progress year to date 2020. E-com sales continue to be several fold stronger than underlying retail sales and underlying retail sales are good. So again as we give consumers direct access to our products either through e-commerce, through omni channel, they are making the choice for several of Hasbro's brands and our innovative products.","Linda Bolton Weiser","Great. And then, just one final question. On eOne, I know it's early days, but I think there's some businesses there that some would regard as potentially non-strategic. Are there any pieces of the eOne that could be carved out and divested to help you delever your balance sheet a little bit more quickly?","Brian Goldner","Well, right now we're really focused on the -- with the teams on engagement and getting several of our initiatives and their initiatives off into the market. In addition to the pre-school and kids initiatives that they have in market today they are taking on board some of Hasbro IP, as well as they have some new original creations that will come out in the market over the next couple of years. We're very focused on the revenue synergies and also achieving and hopefully going beyond on our cost synergy side on the guidance that we've provided to you.","And that in due course we'll take up the question of whether there are opportunities for elements of the business that may not be core strategic. But our focus right now is great momentum as we come together as one team achieving that cost synergies and beginning to stand up the revenue synergies that you'll see impact our business over the next number of years.","Linda Bolton Weiser","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ray Stochel with Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed with your question.","Ray Stochel","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Are you seeing any changes or you have -- are you implementing any changes as a result of YouTube's children content policy changes, whether it's for unboxings, influencer marketing, how you think about the fan economy or the collectibles market?","Brian Goldner","We're engaged with YouTube to fully understand where those changes will come out. Obviously, we abide by all of the relevant rules not only for YouTube, but for CERO and other governing regulatory bodies and of course, we want to ensure the safety of kids as they view content on the Internet. And so, I'd say that's a an ongoing conversation and we'll probably give you more color over the next few months.","Ray Stochel","Got it. Thanks. And then in terms of the difference between launching some -- launching content on more traditional linear media and feature films. How do you think about measuring and planning for demand for big streaming launches? And then, how are you thinking about any upcoming streaming platform launches and how you might be able to participate?","Brian Goldner","Well, what's been fantastic is the success that the Walt Disney Company has seen with Disney Plus. We're very happy to see the success that they're having, the number of subscribers into the tens of millions. And the engagement with properties like Mandalorian. We believe that that's just the beginning of this next phase of engagement for fans and families around the world and it really portends great things as we look at our efforts with eOne to develop Hasbro IP for multiple platforms to drive storytelling and engagement of our brands. What we've seen across the industry is that the top growth drivers in the traditional toy and game industry are all associated with storytelling as well as engagement across platforms like gaming and other experiences. Just think about in the NERF business alone the impact from Fortnite. And as we've been able to develop innovative line for a Fortnite or as Mandalorian has really captured the imagination of fans, families, kids, just our opportunity there, even beyond the child and some of those products the fact that the Black Series products from the Mandalorian were selling so strongly over the holidays.","It all says that people really want to engage with great character and story. It's been our belief all along, that's how we've oriented our company and that's why we'll continue to lead. And also how we're able to engage people in an online and omnichannel e-commerce world, the opportunity to connect content with commerce is incredibly compelling.","Ray Stochel","Great. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bryan Goldberg with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.","Bryan Goldberg","Thanks. I've got two quick ones. I'm just curious based on your past experiences with Disney, how significant are the home entertainment window releases for intellectual property like a Frozen or Star Wars? In terms of stimulating partner brand sales, if you could walk us through a little more of what you could do to leverage these events, that would be very helpful.","And then my second question is related to your comments on the potential of the supply chain disruption that you are seeing from Coronavirus, you called out some priority item you had flagged as making contingency plans for. And I was just wondering if you would be able to update it as to what brands those items associated with? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","I'll take the first one and Deb can walk you through the second question. The answer to the second question. If I step back historically a bit, back in the days where DVDs were the way in which people saw home entertainment. We saw incredible impact from the launch of the DVDs as it came into the home. It engaged the family, engaged kids, who want to view content over and over again. We're really seeing the return of that kind of heyday of home entertainment enjoyment now through streaming services, and through electronic sell through windows, as well as for the DVD business.","So home entertainment is back to at its pinnacle of success, in engaging fans and families. The opportunity for kids to see content over and over again, for families to enjoy that content and to also share it with younger siblings, who may or may not have made the trip to the theatre, but certainly can watch the content along with family and friends at home. The fact that more people are watching content at homes through stream services also benefits us, and we're seeing that across our business.","So I expect that Home Entertainment will continue to increase in importance. That streaming services will continue to play an important role, and I think an increasingly important role over time as we now connect these great stories with people's desire to engage with brands across multiple platforms. And we're very excited about it. We're entering a next era of consumer and audience engagement.","Deb Thomas","Great. Thanks, Brian. And in the Coronavirus, you know as we look at it our thoughts are obviously with the people impacted by the outbreak, and includes our third-party manufacturers and also our employees in China. We've had, and we continue to have office in third party factory closures. And really the biggest unknown right now is how quickly the manufacturing factories can get their production ramp back up given the amount of travel if you think about it when people travel to visit families in Chinese New Year's -- Chinese New Year, they need to travel back. So travel is limited. We know places are still closed. Our employees are working from home. So we have protocols in place with that. So, as we think about how all the efforts, we've made to diversify our manufacturing into different locations still about two thirds of our product overall, our global sourcing is coming from China.","So we are looking at it very closely. Right now, the impact is small. The commercial impact is small, there's a bit in China as people couldn't shop during the holidays, but it's small. That being said, our first quarter is typically a lower revenue quarter for us. So the longer it -- it lasts, that the outbreak isn't contained, and people can't travel back and start production up again. There could be an impact on our first quarter, but for the full year, we remain optimistic that we'll be able to catch up over the full year and we'll continue to add color to the impact as we look through. There is no one particular brand that we would call out on that. We are prioritizing what needs to be done quickly, and moved here quickly as well.","Bryan Goldberg","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll turn the floor back to Debbie Hancock for closing remarks.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, Rob. And thank you everyone for joining the call today. The replay will be available on our website in approximately two hours. Management's prepared remarks will be posted on our website following this call. As we mentioned, we're hosting our annual Toy Fair investor event on Friday, February 21st, and we look forward to seeing many of you there. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

All this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. ","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Debbie Hancock, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you. And good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning are Brian Goldner, Hasbro's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Deb Thomas, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer.","Today, we will begin with Brian and Deb providing commentary on the company's performance, and then we will take your questions. Our earnings release was issued this morning and is available on our Investor website. Additionally, presentation slides containing information covered in today's earnings release and call are also available on our Investor website.","The press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP adjustments and non-GAAP financial measures. Our call today will discuss certain adjusted measures, which include these non-GAAP adjustments. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in the release and presentation. Please note that whenever we discuss earnings per share, or EPS, we are referring to earnings per diluted share.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management's expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters. There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. Some of those factors are set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K, our most recent 10-Q, in today\u2019s press release and in our other public disclosures. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.","I would now like to introduce Brian Goldner. Brian?","Brian Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. The global Hasbro team is effectively working through a disruptive year. Our third quarter results reflect last Toys\u201cR\u201dUs revenues in the US, Europe and Asia Pacific, but also showcase the progress we are making to add a broad array of new retailers to lower retail inventory in major markets and to drive a digital-first orientation around storytelling, innovation and growth across the Blueprint.","The US and Canada teams have advanced this strategy the furthest and we are making progress. In the quarter, we recaptured about one-third of the US and Canada Toys\u201cR\u201dUs revenues heading into the holiday and we had orders for more that didn\u2019t get shipped by quarter end. ","Operating profit in the US and Canada segment was also up in the quarter. While there are a number of factors affecting global markets, including an evolving retail landscape and challenging macroeconomic environments in markets like the UK and Europe, Russia and Brazil, our response to these factors is deliberate and measured to capitalize on our Brand Blueprint strategy with audiences and consumers.","Just over one year ago, Toys\u201cR\u201dUs filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and put into motion a process which ultimately resulted in the rapid closing of most of their stores, including all stores in the US, UK and Australia, and transitioning to new owners in select markets. In certain markets, this transition is ongoing. We continue to believe this is a near-term retail disruption that will last for the next few quarters. ","Our established and differentiated Brand Blueprint strategy has enabled us to transform and we\u2019ve invested in industry-leading brand building capabilities.","To best position our company for profitable future growth, we need to continuously drive new ways of competing. We\u2019re becoming a more agile, modern and digitally-driven play an entertainment company. At this pivotal point, it is critical we have the right teams in place with the right capabilities to lead us into the future. ","As we continue to transform, we took actions which impacted our global organization. We\u2019re focusing our teams on the most profitable, differentiated and strategic areas of our business, while aligning our resources and costs to drive profitable growth.","Hasbro is executing robust plans for this holiday season with a broad and growing array of retailers. Following Toys\u201cR\u201dUs liquidation in the US, the third quarter was the first quarter without the retailer and it is clearly visible in point-of-sale at brick retail, which was down globally for Hasbro brands in the low-teens for the quarter and increased slightly through the first nine months of the year.","Looking at the US data more closely, where the consumer had direct access to the brands and products they were seeking, Hasbro\u2019s online POS increased high single-digits in the third quarter and increased double-digits over the first nine months of the year. Hasbro has invested to establish a leading presence online. According to One Click Retail, through the first nine months of the year in North America, Hasbro is the market share leader on Amazon in the Toy & Game category.","In the US, Toys\u201cR\u201dUs liquidation and stores closings drove an incremental 2.5 million units sold through the first half of this year versus a year ago and impacted the third quarter\u2019s unit sales. However, The NPD Group data indicates that 83% of industry purchases made at Toys\u201cR\u201dUs during the liquidation in the US would be given away by the end of the third quarter.","In recent weeks, retailers are activating their share recapture plans for the holiday period. Many retailers set their shelves later in the quarter to begin their holiday efforts. But retailers are stepping up to capture the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs market share. Hasbro's channel strategy has enabled us to open a significant number of new doors at retail. But this also drives new requirements for our US supply chain.","We're working with a greater variety of retailers that have differentiated shipping requirements. Our growing retail footprint adds retailers shipping smaller quantities per truck to take product closer to the holidays and require more carton volume than previously, including more cartons of high demand toys and games later in the quarter.","In fact, Hasbro shipped more products domestically in September than ever before, and we were unable to meet all the demand within the quarter. As a result, approximately $50 million of US third quarter orders shipped in the first week of the fourth quarter.","By mid 2019 we'll add a Midwest warehouse to better meet demand, shorten delivery time and reduce trucking mileage to our retailers\u2019 distribution centers. We're also working closely with our retailers in new innovative ways including sharing warehouse space to dramatically reduce delivery times.","While our US retail footprint is growing, our retail inventory declined by 17% versus a year ago. And we have maintained our cost of business across retailers. We have story-led innovative brands and products to successfully support retailers and consumer demand for the 2018 holiday period. And importantly, we expect to return to growth in 2019 and future years.","Where the retail disruption has been mitigated and the retail transition moved more quickly, you can see the resilience of our business and our brands. For example, in Canada, where the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs transition has already happened, our revenues and point-of-sale were up for the third quarter. Europe and Asia Pacific are behind both Canada and the US in respect to retailers share recapture and Toys\u201cR\u201dUs ownership transition. ","In Europe, as previously discussed, we began 2018 with excess inventory at retail. We're making meaningful progress with retail inventories down over 20% and it will take through the end of the year to complete our efforts. A rapidly evolving retail landscape where consumers are shopping across borders and traditional retailers are struggling, added to the challenge of rightsizing our inventory.","Revenues from omni-channel and online retailers are growing but haven't yet offset the decline from Toys\u201cR\u201dUs and other retailers. As our retail and consumer landscape evolves, we are building innovation across brands, price points and channels. Global revenues for several Hasbro Franchise Brands grew in the third quarter, including MONOPOLY, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAY-DOH and BABY ALIVE. ","Emerging Brands revenues were up 2% behind new initiatives, LOST KITTIES, LOCK STARS and YELLIES, and the addition of POWER RANGERS licensing revenues.","Gaming remains a meaningful differentiated growth opportunity for Hasbro. We're leveraging our global portfolio of brands and expertise to target a broad and growing demographic of players across analog and digital platforms. In fact, in the US and Canada segment, gaming revenues were up double-digits in the quarter.","MONOPOLY original and the Cheaters Edition have driven growth, and a strong launch of MONOPOLY Fortnite in early October continue to reflect our fast and first-to-market approach. The NPD Group identified MONOPOLY Fortnite as the number one new item in the games supercategory for the week ending October 6 in US.","MAGIC: THE GATHERING grew in the quarter, led by Core Set sales and the strong story-led launch of Guilds of Ravnica. In addition, the team has taken important steps digitally as MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena moved to Open Beta on September 27th. There has been an incredible response from players. In the first four days alone, 70 million games of Arena were played. Retention, engagement and monetization are all above goals and streaming and viewership rates are beating our targets. The launch of Open Beta is just the start. The team continues investing to expand the game's markets, social and competitive features and platforms. ","Arena is the first and a host of the new gaming and marketing initiatives for MAGIC as this brand expands across digital and analog including tabletop console and mobile in 2019 and beyond. The team also delivered another quarter of revenue growth for DUNGEONS and DRAGONS and late in the third quarter drove a strong release for an all new TRANSFORMERS trading card game. ","In our Partner Brands, Hasbro's toy portfolio based on MARVEL franchise is having a tremendous year and delivered extremely positive results in the third quarter, behind strong sales of Avengers: Infinity War product as well as continued robust sales for Black Panther and Legends fan-focused merchandise. ","Product from Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse launches this month, ahead of the December animated film premiere from Sony Animation. We also have new products supporting Deadpool, Venom and ANT-MAN AND THE WASP. ","In addition, Hasbro's new product line for Marvel Rising supports MARVEL's newest animated franchise that launches exclusively at Target this month. BEYBLADE with its digital first strategy also contributed to growth in the quarter. Star Wars product revenues declined as Star Wars: The Last Jedi product was on shelf in September of last year. ","For the fourth quarter and holiday season, we have diverse and innovative brand initiatives rolling out globally. In partnership with Paramount, our TRANSFORMERS feature film Bumblebee will arrive in theaters December 21. Product was arriving on shelves to begin the fourth quarter and sales are off to a strong start. ","In the US and Canada segment, TRANSFORMERS revenues in the quarter increased double-digits. Retailers are enthusiastically behind this initiative, which promises to be our most all-family all-audience, dual-gender film ever. Feedback from early audience screenings has been outstanding. ","We have a significant number of innovative brand offerings arriving for this holiday season across Franchise and Partner Brands as well as Gaming. In fact, you will see Hasbro's strong representation as retailers unveil their holiday initiatives for consumers across converged retail, in stores, online and mobile and in all forms of marketing digitally, including content to commerce, shoppable social content, toy books and toy list. ","To fuel our future growth, we have tremendous innovation in entertainment for 2019. This includes all new initiatives in Franchise Brands such as product and story-led innovation for NERF, including NERF Overwatch and NERF Fortnite Lines. We are supporting a robust entertainment slate across many of the Walt Disney company brands, which touch, diverse demographics and we will drive innovative gaming experiences both digitally and face-to-face. ","We will share more details on our 2019 plans early next year. As the global audience and consumer landscape continues to rapidly evolve and the retail environment continues to seismically shift, we are positioning Hasbro to profitably grow in 2019 and beyond. ","I would now like to turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deborah Thomas","Thank you, Brian. And good morning everyone. As the year progresses, our global teams continue to manage through a dynamic and challenging environment. Retail disruption, which is not limited to the impact of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs has complicated our efforts to clear inventory in Europe and to address challenging operating environments in other global markets including the UK and Europe, Russia and Brazil.","Despite revenues lower than a year ago, our operating profit margin held up well this quarter. A combination of less favorable revenue mix, negative foreign exchange impact and steps to end 2018 team with clean retail inventory offset lower royalty, advertising and administrative costs. ","As Brian discussed, we continue to transform Hasbro. Based on organizational actions to ensure we have the right talent and capabilities to profitably grow going forward, we expect to record a charge a $50 million to $60 million in the fourth quarter of this year relating to severance. While this will result in $30 million to $40 million of annual savings by 2020, most importantly, it will ensure we are well positioned with the right talent for success in the evolving marketplace we see ahead of us. ","We remain focused on growing Hasbro over the long-term and continue investing in brands and entertainment to drive future performance. We\u2019ve also returned $422 million in cash to shareholders thus far this year through our dividend and share repurchases. ","Within our segments, the US and Canada segment revenues declined 7%. Toys\u201cR\u201dUs in the US is now fully liquidated. The Canadian business was sold in the early part of 2018 and is now operating under the new ownership team.","Hasbro Gaming revenues grew double-digits and Franchise Brands were up slightly. Partner Brand and Emerging Brand revenue declined in the quarter. Importantly, retail inventory is down significantly. With no US Toys\u201cR\u201dUs shoppers this quarter and retailer activation still rolling out, point-of-sale was down in the low-teens for the quarter yet remains positive year-to-date. Absent the impact of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs in both periods, point-of-sale was up in the quarter and year-to-date.","U.S. and Canada segment operating profit increased 4% and operating profit margin was 24.5%. Favorable product mix and lower royalty expense contributed to the improvement in operating margin. ","In the third quarter of last year, we recorded $18 million of bad debt expense associated with Toys\u201cR\u201dUs. Retail continues to change and last week Sears filed for bankruptcy. Sears represented less than 1% of overall Hasbro revenue last year and our bad debt exposure is immaterial as we have closely managed the account for some time. ","International segment revenues declined 24%, including a negative $30.3 million impact from foreign exchange. Revenue declined in each region during the quarter. Emerging Brand revenues increased, but the other brand portfolio categories declined. Europe revenue was down 29%, reflecting several factors tied to the evolving retail landscape. Lost Toys\u201cR\u201dUs revenues contributed to the decline. The UK stores are closed liquidating early in the year. France and Spain are undergoing ownership transitions. And while we aren't doing meaningful business with them now, we look forward to working with them go forward when the transitions are completed.","We are also aggressively working to lower retail inventories across the region. The team has made significant progress and will continue these efforts go forward. We believe we will work through this issue by the end of 2018.","Currency negatively impacted Europe revenues by $11.3 million. In Latin America, the political and economic environment continued to negatively impact our results, especially in Brazil. Currency devaluation had a negative $16.4 million impact on revenues, accounting for more than half of the quarter decline.","Point-of-sale increased slightly in the quarter and is up year-to-date behind strength in Mexico.","In Asia Pacific, Toys\u201cR\u201dUs impacted Australia as the retailer is no longer operating and the share recapture is ongoing. In Asia, Toys\u201cR\u201dUs is operating, but we have limited our shipments as the sale of the business has not yet been completed.","Asia is also facing a difficult comparison with the strong TRANSFORMERS business last year, but is poised to capitalize on the launch of Bumblebee in the fourth quarter and into 2019. Currency had a negative $2.5 million impact to Asia Pacific's revenue.","Across the International segment, macroeconomic factors and retailer health continue to impact our decisions around extending credit to certain retailers. While this has resulted in an improvement in our DSO, it has impacted our revenues in the near-term.","International operating segment profit declined to $66.3 million. Lower revenues combined with higher costs to clear inventory drove the decline in operating profit. Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues increased 45%. During the quarter, we signed a multi-year digital streaming agreement for Hasbro television programming. This happens every few years and we last signed such a deal was in 2015. ","Revenue from our share of the 2017 My Little Pony theatrical film also added to the quarterly revenue increase. In addition, the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard continued to contribute to higher revenues in the segment. This standard has impacted each quarter this year as revenue spread more evenly throughout the year. The segment's operating profit increased 99% on higher revenues, favorable mix and lower costs.","Overall Hasbro operating profit margin declined 10 basis points. Given year-to-date trends, we now anticipate full year operating profit margin will decline versus a year ago. ","As Brian discussed, we believe we can return to profitable growth in 2019 and we are taking the steps to ensure we can grow operating profit margin over time. ","Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased 100 basis points in the quarter. Favorable product mix from higher revenues in certain gaming brands such as MAGIC: THE GATHERING, as well as Entertainment and Licensing revenues was more than offset by lower Partner Brand revenues, cost associated with clearing out inventory and the impact of foreign exchange. ","As we discussed last quarter, the loss of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs combined with continued pressure of higher retail inventory primarily in Europe is having a short-term impact on our gross margin. ","Royalty expense declined in dollars and as a percentage on lower Partner Brand revenues. Intangible amortization increased as we began to amortize the POWER RANGERS acquisition. The increase was partially offset by other intangible assets which are now fully amortized. ","Due to the acquisition, we anticipate approximately $5 million in incremental amortization expense in the fourth quarter of this year and $21 million in 2019. Program production amortization increased as we're amortizing My Little Pony: The Movie production expense in addition to the delivery of digital content. Based on our current expectations, we will begin amortizing production costs associated with our funding of this year's Bumblebee film in the latter half of next year. ","Given the change in the expected timing of receipts on tax credits, we now expect full year content spend of approximately $145 million to $150 million. SG&A was down 13% and flat as a percentage of revenue year-over-year. The decline in dollars reflects lower incentive compensation expense, lower bad debt expense and a positive impact from foreign exchange translation. We continue to see higher shipping costs in the US from new trucking regulations and driver shortages. Below operating profit, other income decreased in the quarter. Several items contributed to this decline, including the loss on foreign exchange this year versus a gain in 2017 and pension expense now being recorded in this line item. As expected, our interest expense declined year-over-year as we executed favorable long-term borrowing in 2017 and are using our global cash more effectively thereby reducing our need for short-term borrowings. ","Our underlying tax rate absent discrete events was 17.6% compared to an underlying rate of 23.5% last year and 19.9% for the full year 2017. The lower rate reflects the benefit of US tax reform and a slight increase from our previous guidance due to geographic mix of income. ","During the third quarter, we recorded a $17.3 million tax benefit or $0.14 per share related to our interpretation of US tax reform guidance that was released during the quarter. We now believe our full year tax rate will be slightly above the high-end of our previous 15% to 17% range. ","For the third quarter, reported earnings per share was $2.06. Adjusted earnings per share excluding the $0.14 tax benefit was $1.93. Operating cash flow over the past 12 months totaled $697.3 million and we had $907 million in cash at the end of the third quarter. ","In mid-June, we closed on our acquisition of POWER RANGERS and other entertainment assets from Saban Properties. At closing, we paid approximately $155 million in cash and issued approximately 3.1 million shares of common stock to Saban. We have remaining cash payments of $100 million due in 2019. ","During the third quarter, we returned $159.5 million to shareholders, including $80 million in dividends and repurchasing $79.5 million in common stock. Year-to-date repurchases totaled $192.3 million. Our full year share repurchases are expected to partially offset the shares issued in connection with the POWER RANGERS acquisition. We expect to continue opportunistically repurchasing shares in the open market. ","Hasbro\u2019s balance sheet remains strong. Both our debt-to-EBITDA and EBITDA-to-interest ratios at 2.1 and 8.8 respectively remain within our targets. Receivables decreased 16% and day sales outstanding decreased to 81 days. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, receivables declined 13%. ","Hasbro-owned inventory decreased $18.2 million and we are well-positioned to support demand for our brands this holiday season. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, owned inventory increased 1%. ","As discussed earlier, retail inventories are down significantly in the US and internationally, notably in Europe. We are positioned for successful holiday period and to move beyond Toys\u201cR\u201dUs in 2019. In a rapidly changing retail environment, we are adding strategic new accounts to grow our business, while continuing to deliver innovation across the portfolio and introduce new ways to experience our brands, all positioning us to profitably grow in future years.","We\u2019re tackling the challenges head on and making timely and appropriate changes to our business. We remain focused on investing in our business for long-term growth and we\u2019re excited by the initiative, entertainment and innovation we see in 2019 and years to come.","We\u2019ll now open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. At this time we\u2019ll be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Ng ","Great. Thanks for the question. I have one for Brian and one for Deb. For Brian, you mentioned that you guys have captured about a third of the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs revenue going into the holiday. Do you expect to fully recapture all that Toys\u201cR\u201dUs revenue over time? And if so, does it happen in 2019 or 2020? Basically, how long do you think it\u2019ll take to capture the remaining two-thirds? And then for Deb, I just had a question on EBIT margins, EBIT margin is being down this year. Could you just put some bookends on the expected decline? Will it still be in the 15% range between 14% and 15% or worse? And do you expect operating margin expansion in 2019? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Thanks, Mike. Good morning. On the US business and Toys\u201cR\u201dUs share recaptured, the team has made tremendous progress and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been talking about making up the difference. And in fact, we\u2019ll continue to see in the fourth quarter this year additional progress as more retailers have begun to kick-in with their holiday plans and we\u2019re seeing more robust plans come. We\u2019ve added just over the last year -- as part of the 21,000 new doors of retail that we've opened in the US, we've added a 10,000 of the 21,000 just over the last year. So that continues to allow us to expand our channels, continue to work with our major retailers, you'll see them announcing and launching their plans over the next number of weeks, but also additional channels based on a really robust product development strategy. This enabled us to develop product at multiple price points. ","So as we go into 2019, we certainly believe we'll continue to make up to the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs difference. Our goal in holiday 2018 is not to necessarily make up the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs difference this year. In fact, what we're working on with our retailers is to ensure we get to a new higher level of commitment and capability with those retail relationships. And that we have strong sell-throughs through the holidays, setting us up for a new higher level of retail support in 2019. ","As we go into 2019, we're very enthusiastic about the lineup. We have strong new initiatives coming from franchise, partners and gaming. And we certainly believe we will return to growth. And as Deb mentioned, we believe this will be profitable growth as we continue to bring forward new initiatives across the franchise. I'm not going to comment specifically on making up Toys\u201cR\u201dUs but as I said, we're very committed to 2019 being a year of growth. And we'll going to -- we'll see that as we stabilize Europe, in 2019 we will return Hasbro to growth.","Deborah Thomas","As far as our operating profit margin, in July, when we talked about Q2, we still had the majority of the year for revenue and profit ahead of us. And we had a plan that would have delivered our operating profit margins that were kind of in line with last year. As we look forward, the US and Canada segments on track we talked quite a bit about that, Brian just elaborated on that, we feel pretty good about that. Europe is a little bit worse than we had thought. And it's brought our margin expectations down a bit. We do remain committed to clearing up the issues that we have there this year, clearing up the inventory, that's impacted our gross margin a bit too. We've had more close-outs than we thought we would have. Typically we would have gotten a higher margin on those as we sold them out throughout the year. And Toys\u201cR\u201dUs took some of those, but other retailers are and these are close-out retailers that are going through too. So it's not our traditional retailers. Those gross margins continue to have -- continue to carry the gross margins that we would expect. So just what we see based on mix, and the mix of the products we expect for the rest of the year, we would expect a lower operating profit margin than last year. We also highlighted some of the charges that we're going to be taking in the fourth quarter. We do expect to take $50 million to $60 million charge in the fourth quarter, relating in this case, specifically the severance. However, underlying, there's no -- nothing that will cause us to not believe that we can grow operating profit in the future. I think this is a year of transition for us and there's been more of a bit of a transition in Europe than we thought but it's working its way through. We're seeing good performance in the US. So we remain positive about -- very positive actually about the future.","Michael Ng","Great. And do you have any comments about '19 margins or whether it\u2019d be up or down or is it too early to tell at this point?","Deborah Thomas","No, I think our expectation is that they'll certainly be up from what we report for 2018. And if you look at the line items in our P&L even for this quarter, despite the disruption in revenue, we continue to control our costs and we continue to invest where we said we would from a production standpoint, royalty standpoint, product development, because as you know that\u2019s where we say we're investing for the future. So we continue to make those investments and keep our -- and are keeping our cost in line as well. So there is no reason why we wouldn't expect that to increase in the future. ","Michael Ng","Great. Thank you both. ","Brian Goldner","Thanks, Mike. ","Operator","Next question is coming from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please go ahead with your questions. ","Eric Handler","Yes, thank you very much. A couple of quick things for you, Deb. First, advertising came way down as a percentage of revenue on a year-over-year basis. And this year, you seem tracking several -- a bit lower than last year. How sustainable is that advertising as a percentage of revenue to get sort of into that like 9.3% area versus like the 9.6% area. Is that something that can continue on in the future or is that going to have to increase as more products come out? ","Brian Goldner","Well, let me talk a bit about that. What we're really seeing obviously in part that dollar decline you saw in the third quarter has a lot to do with our plans and expectations to support our fourth quarter initiatives as we saw where our retails -- retailers are expanding their efforts and we're getting into the holiday season. Having said that, we've been talking for some time about how using a digital orientation and social listening and scraping were getting better and better at targeting our media. We're able to get more economies in our developed economies like the US and other media savvy markets. We're still spending at market leading levels where we're trying to establish new brands and also build new brands around the world. But I do believe that you'd see that advertising would be in that 9% to 10% range and probably at the lower end of that range, both in 2018 and beyond. ","Eric Handler","Great. And then one other question for you. Entertainment, the entertainment and license business got a nice increase in revenue. One of the reasons was -- is that the Netflix deal from four years ago that is now fully renewed?","Deborah Thomas","As we look at it, we did renew a digital streaming deal that we had from I think \u201815 was last time we did. And we also are getting revenues in from our My Little Pony: The Movie. So you see that in our program production amortization, but we are getting revenues in there coming through that segment. ","Eric Handler","Great. Thank you very much. ","Operator","The next question is from the line of Arpine Kocharyan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Arpine Kocharyan","Hi, good morning. Thank you. You mentioned inventories were down significantly at retail. Is there a chance you could give us what that looks like ex-Toys\u201cR\u201dUs? Because Toys\u201cR\u201dUs is a specialty toy retailer. They were more able to take on inventory ahead of holiday season than for example a mass retailer that's a little bit time sensitive. How much is retail inventories actually down ex-Toys\u201cR\u201dUs? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thank you. ","Brian Goldner","So if you look at Europe, obviously Toys\u201cR\u201dUs had less of an impact in Europe and our European inventories are down -- retail inventories are down by more than 20%. In the US obviously our retail inventories are down 17% and we\u2019ve seen that by retailer across the board. So our retail inventories by our brands and across other retailers are down. Recognize, as you're moving more to omni-channel and online retailers, those retailers are taking fewer week supply and in part the changes we made in Europe and the update to eliminating excess inventory is that Europe is actually making very good progress working with new retailers and omni-channel and online retailers as we are in the US and both -- in both cases those retailers take less week supply. So our big partners, as well as that expanded retail channel footprint take less week supply. So these are real retail reductions across our business and then certainly Toys\u201cR\u201dUs has some impact.","Deborah Thomas","And Arpine I would just add to that too. I mean especially as you look at Europe our inventories are down significantly as well so. ","Arpine Kocharyan ","Okay, thank you. Then our checks have shown some surprising softness in NERF into Q3. Could you give us the sense whether it is just a function of sort of very tough comp since the brand did so well last year in Q3 I remember? Or is it that we are seeing some structural change in terms of retailer willingness to take on more bulkier items that are more fit for online, which could mean that Q4 could be a little bit better, because that\u2019s more just in time inventory management and online seems like it\u2019s doing -- it\u2019s still doing well?","Brian Goldner","Yes. The biggest impact in Q3 to NERF was the fact that a year ago Toys\u201cR\u201dUs supported the NERF Fest which originally began in US is now rolled out globally in 2018. And that represented significant linear feet of space and inventory a year ago. In addition, the liquidation in the second quarter certainly impacted unit sales that were up in Q2 and then down in Q3, particularly around some of the basic products. What we are seeing is strong growth of the Rival product, those are the round projectiles. ","We\u2019re seeing a launch -- launching seven new blasters in Q4. And so we\u2019re very excited about getting new innovation out to the market and clearly that\u2019s performing well. The brand also does perform as you indicated online quite well as people get access directly to the products they\u2019re looking for across the NERF range. So we feel good long-term in that NERF. We\u2019ve seen a few other competitors -- some people have noted competition in the category. But we\u2019re going to continue to add innovation this fall. We have LASER OPS, which is a whole new innovative way to play with great out of the box play. And then we have a lot of new innovations coming for first half of \u201819 including NERF Overwatch and NERF Fortnite. And then we\u2019ll have additional new innovation coming in NERF that we will share with you later in 2019. ","Arpine Kocharyan ","Thank you. And one more if I may. Brian, there is a lot of excitement both in the marketplace, as well as investor community about MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena, as you went into Open Beta recently. Could you share your expectations of what that could mean for Hasbro for \u201819 and in terms of both profitability and incremental revenue?","Brian Goldner","Yes. First of all, I think we should start by talking about MAGIC: THE GATHERING, because obviously it\u2019s all related and interrelated as it\u2019s a story-led brand. MAGIC is up year-over-year, it\u2019s driven by that Core Set launch from July. But also what we\u2019re really seeing is that a growth in total unique players of 14% year-over-year. We saw growth of new players of 17% year-over-year. So I think MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena is off to a good start, but really the fact is we\u2019re just in Open Beta. ","We\u2019re actively engaging with players as we continually refine the game and our work is not done. We\u2019re going to invest in game development. We\u2019re going to across new platforms with new features and we're very excited about what Arena portends for 2019 and beyond. ","We're not going to frame it other than to say we're continuing to expand in markets, in social and competitive features and platforms. I would encourage you to look at some of the positive reviews that have been out there in PC Gamer and Polygon and a few other publications. And also, I really encourage you to look at the viewership on Twitch. I think the game will officially launch in 2019, but already, you're seeing real excitement on Twitch. And of course, we're going to add new elements to MAGIC: THE GATHERING as competitive gaming has been part of our MAGIC's DNA since the first Pro Tour in 1996. And MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena provides this amazing digital platform that's as much fun to stream and watch as it is to play. And so, we'll share more with you shortly, but it's off to a very good start. And it's exceeding our expectations.","Arpine Kocharyan ","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Stephanie Wissink ","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Deb, I wanted to just come back to your comments on Europe and the partner brand inventory. I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of the Q4 versus Q3. I understand it's going to continue through the end of the year, but are we getting toward the tail-end of that cleanup? Should we expect the fourth quarter impact to be smaller or larger than what you've just experienced in Q3? And then Brian, a question for you just on NERF. I think that there's a point of focus, just understanding a bit around the distribution changes in that brand in addition to the sales cadence with Rival, Overwatch, Fortnite, do you expect to gain some new distribution into maybe non-toy or non-traditional toy channel or into other areas of your mass retailer footprints, and areas like entertainment and sporting goods? If you could talk a little bit about distribution expansion for NERF that would be helpful? Thank you.","Deborah Thomas","Good morning, Steph. I'll take the inventory question first. I think that as we look at our inventory, both at retail and at Hasbro, we have said we remain committed to deal with this issue in 2018. So, I can't specifically say whether the fourth quarter is going to be up or down from the impact on our gross margin from that. But we just absolutely remain committed to getting it done. And by the end of 2018, we do believe that will be behind us.","Brian Goldner","Alright. And then if you look at NERF, Steph, you're absolutely right that NERF is a brand that resonates everywhere. But certainly, we are adding significant new points of distribution. We have lots of new retailers as part of our expanded channel strategy, who have come on board, including an array of sporting good retailers, some of the fan-type retailers, electronics and gaming type retailers. As we get into NERF Overwatch, we're very excited because not only do we have great blasters, but we're really allowing people to role play and play blasters, very much bringing the game to life in real life, outside of the game and then later in NERF Fortnite. Again, very character-forward, based on the strong storytelling of those brands and we're very excited about that. Then we'll get into some new innovation for 2019. And we'll share that innovation closer to when we launch.","But overall, NERF's footprint continues to expand. And I do think it's important to note that it's just the disruption of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs we talked about a year ago in NERF Fest. And recognize that the Q3 for Hasbro -- Toys\u201cR\u201dUs was it's largest in Q3 last year for Hasbro. It was prior to any liquidation. It was when they were restructuring their business and we believed that they would continue. And then behind Q3, Q4 was the second highest quarter for Toys\u201cR\u201dUs last year. And so, it goes back to where the impact will be. But as we finish this year, we put the European excess inventory issues behind us as well as Toys\u201cR\u201dUs.","Stephanie Wissink ","Okay. Just one final question for us. I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. A $50 million tail-end of Q3 shift into Q4. Was there any other timing lags or shifts that you think would be worth calling out just in terms of order of magnitude as we should think about modeling Q4 versus Q3 on a total sales basis?","Brian Goldner","Yes. That was the impact. And again, the team had recognized already that we are going to such an expanded universe of retailers that we were already well underway in establishing a new Midwest warehouse. It's a very innovative approach. And it will also enable us to reduce the mileage to our retailers' distribution centers which obviously helps to mitigate some of the other cost increases we've seen. And we should save some monies there.","It gives us also an opportunity to try some innovative approaches with some of our retailers and sharing warehouses, where we can move very quickly to replenish, given several retailers are going to a lower week supply inventory. And so, we see this is again a step up in Hasbro capabilities. And many of these new capabilities we've brought on board in North America and in the US. We're marrying that to our European business. And that's what you're seeing us do in real time and rapidly so that Europe will follow quickly on the successes and the momentum we're seeing in the US as we go through this disruptive year, and again, put the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs business behind.","Stephanie Wissink ","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Felicia Hendrix ","Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Hey, Brian. Just stepping back for a second, I think you and Deb really have clearly laid out the various headwinds that you faced in the quarter and maybe some of those -- well, obviously, some of those were not expected when you talked to us in July. But if you kind of look at where you guys came in relative to the expectations that were out there, on a revenue basis at least, you actually came in better in Franchise Brands than Hasbro Gaming. And so, the real miss seemed to be significant declines in Partner Brands. So, I was just wondering if you could kind of layer that into your overall commentary because with that line being disproportionately affected by the issues you mentioned, I'm just wondering if we can understand what exactly happened there and then how both company and retail inventory levels are in that segment?","Brian Goldner","Yes. I think it's absolutely right on. In fact, if you go across the Partner Brands -- and let's focus on first year-on-year on Disney Princess and Frozen, last year, we had a number of entertainment initiatives that were supporting the brand, including Moana and Beauty and the Beast as well as some television led initiatives that didn't really repeat this year. In Star Wars, remember, last year, this was when Last Jedi product was setting. So, there was a sizable amount of inventory and merchandising that was going on around the brand.","And so, that wasn't repeated this time this year. So, that those two had major impacts to the business over that time. And then again, as we come off of the movie year, you saw some impact from Trolls and a few others. Now, offsetting that, we've seen very strong momentum on the MARVEL business. We're very excited not only about the performance of Avengers and Black Panther, but as we get into the fourth quarter, we'll support Spider-Man, the animated movie, which we're excited about. And then, of course, we'll have our own Bumblebee film, which I can't help but mention. The -- but I do agree that we were up against major entertainment initiatives from a year ago.","Deborah Thomas","And as we head into \u2026","Felicia Hendrix ","Well, I guess what I'm trying to get \u2026","Deborah Thomas","Sorry. As we head into 2019, we see that continued momentum around entertainment. In MARVEL, you've got Captain Marvel and Avengers. And then from Disney, we've got Aladdin and Toy Story. And there's another Spider-Man. There's Lion King and of course, Frozen 2, and then Star Wars: Episode IX comes at the end of next year. So, as you think about the mix I mentioned and some great entertainment, we've got good momentum in MARVEL. And we've seen good momentum in entertainment to carry our Partner Brands next year as well.","Felicia Hendrix ","Thank you for all that. It's really helpful. But I guess what I was trying to get to is there were some things that happened in the quarter which were likely not planned. I\u2019m just trying to kind of navigate through this kind of unknown territory, right. But at the end of the day, other than the kind of changes that you talked about in Partner Brands, you seem to have kind of come in -- it wasn't like anything that happened was so surprising. And so, you just laid out Partner Brands and why they were down. Just I mean that would have been some declines I would think normally that you would have had in the quarter. But was there anything kind of specific related to Toys\u201cR\u201dUs or inventories or anything that would have hit Partner Brands harder than the others?","Brian Goldner","No, I think that, again, year-on-year, we're up against these major initiatives. I think the notion of being a disruptive year is disruptive in a lot of ways. I guess the attention and focus on Toys\u201cR\u201dUs and moving to Toys\u201cR\u201dUs has people missing the fact that we're also up against some entertainment initiatives. I think it's important, to your point -- if you look at the US business, it's really leading the transformation of a company through this year. Both Franchise Brands and Gaming for us were up double -- Gaming was up double-digits. Franchise Brands were up. Our Emerging Brands are up overall. But Partner Brands are down but I think with good reason.","And then, of course, we are focused on cleaning up any remaining inventories around all of our brands. And there are some Partner Brand inventories we're also cleaning up alongside of other inventories, particularly in Europe where in Europe our entertainment-led brands from the company do particularly well across Europe. And we have a lot of entertainment initiatives for 2019, as Deb said. So, we have a real commitment here to finalize and conclude all these inventory issues by end of the year. So, we're really set up well for what is a very robust entertainment year across our Partner Brand portfolio.","Felicia Hendrix ","Yes. Okay. Thank you. And then just for Christmas, consensus estimates call for a flat revenue growth. That seems kind of optimistic at this point. Do you agree with that?","Brian Goldner","I think -- look, I think we're heading into a very strong holiday season. We have a lot of new initiatives set up. I think our goal is -- again, it will be the continued momentum in the North American business. We mentioned that the Canadian business was up in Q3 in both sales as well as sell-through revenues and sell-through. And that was because we had mitigated the retail situation because there\u2019s new ownership of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs.","So, what I think you're seeing is that our brands are really resonating with consumers, whether you see the online sales when you get out of the brick disruption, whether you see it in Canada and now Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Smith's has taken over that business. It's following rather quickly to what Canada looks like. So, as we go through these transitions, our underlying business is quite strong. Our brands are good. Consumers are very excited about what we're doing. It's just that, again, we've got to get through the disruption of the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs business. And as I mentioned, Toys\u201cR\u201dUs was largest for us in Q3 last year followed by Q4.","Felicia Hendrix ","And then last quarter, you said that you would expect to fully offset Toys\u201cR\u201dUs by the first quarter of '19. Is that still realistic? I know in your prepared remarks, you said it would take a few more quarters.","Brian Goldner","Well, the reason we mentioned that Toys\u201cR\u201dUs takes a few more quarters is there's been a delay in the resolution of the Asian business of Toys\u201cR\u201dUs. As you know, the two owners are still trying to resolve their differences. And obviously, Asia and Toys\u201cR\u201dUs is -- Toys\u201cR\u201dUs performs frankly best around the world and Asia. So, that's an area for us where we'd like to continue to move forward with new ownership.","And we're waiting for that resolution. And that's why we've left it out there that it may take a couple of quarters. But also remember that in Q1 last year, we did make some shipments to Toys\u201cR\u201dUs in the US and other markets that have subsequently liquidated because, again, at that time, Toys\u201cR\u201dUs had not announced their liquidation. So, we're just, again, framing for people. The fact is, we were in business with Toys\u201cR\u201dUs, albeit at a much lower level in Q1 of 2019. And the biggest quarters of impact versus year ago certainly are this quarter and next quarter. Next quarter is less than this quarter was a year ago. But again, just framing it out for folks.","Felicia Hendrix ","So, maybe US first quarter but then dealing with Asia, probably fully through by second quarter?","Deborah Thomas","Well, I think we and the management there would hope so.","Felicia Hendrix ","Okay. We don't know.","Deborah Thomas","It's taking a bit longer to get this actual ownership transition resolved than anybody anticipated. The only thing I would say about the quarter is just beyond Toys\u201cR\u201dUs is we are seeing the new retailers that are taking these orders are paying up this share. Some of them -- it's just the cadence is a bit different as how close they take it to when they want it. So, just from a cadence standpoint, we're looking at that. And we'll talk more about that at Toy Fair. But that's the only thing I would add beyond Toys\u201cR\u201dUs.","Felicia Hendrix ","Okay. Thank you. And then two just quick housekeeping. Deb, how should we think about the $30 million to $40 million in savings spread across 2019 and 2020? And then I was just wondering what tax rate we should use for 2019?","Deborah Thomas","Well, we haven't given any guidance for 2019 for the tax rate yet. But I would say we expect to be slightly -- and when I say slightly, I mean slightly above the 15% to 17% for this year. And right now until we actually get all our budgets rolled together, we'll talk more about that at Toy Fair. I think that's a fair estimate to use for '19 as well, absent anything more specific. But -- and I'm sorry, I completely lost the other part of the question because I was thinking about \u2026","Felicia Hendrix ","Oh! How we should spread the $30 million to $40 million in savings across '19 and '20?","Deborah Thomas","Oh! Sorry. Yes. I was thinking about the tax rate. And you got me thinking about '19 tax rates now, Felicia. Thank you.","Felicia Hendrix ","I'm just excited about that.","Deborah Thomas","Always my fun this early in the morning. But no, no. And again, I have to add -- because my head of tax would say absent anything else the US government comes out with to clarify tax reform more. But the $30 million to $40 million, we expect to achieve that full run rate by 2020, you will see some of it phasing-in in 2019. And some of it's just a bit about just timing. And we'll try to give some more guidance on the phasing of that when we get to Toy Fair as well.","Felicia Hendrix ","Okay. For now, would it be fair if we just spread it 25% in '19 and then the rest in 2020 or something like that?","Deborah Thomas","We'll give more guidance in our 10-K and at Toy Fair.","Felicia Hendrix ","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Badishkanian ","Great. Thanks. I am wondering if -- did you mention that ex-Toys\u201cR\u201dUs that POS was up globally? Did I hear that right?","Brian Goldner","Yes. So, if you take without Toys\u201cR\u201dUs, year-to-date POS was up globally. POS was also up including Toys\u201cR\u201dUs globally year-to-date. In the US, without Toys\u201cR\u201dUs -- because that's where really the biggest impact -- yes, POS was up in the quarter and in year-to-date. And in fact \u2026","Greg Badishkanian ","No. I'm just going to ask you to quantify it up how much in the US?","Brian Goldner","Yes. So, if you take, it was up in the single-digits in the quarter. And it was up across our Gaming Brands, Emerging Brands, Partner Brands. Again, it's without Toys\u201cR\u201dUs. And year-to-date, without Toys\u201cR\u201dUs, it's up mid to high single-digits across the board in every category.","Greg Badishkanian ","Alright. Good. And I know you gave some detail on the Partner Brands and entertainment impact. In terms of your company-owned Franchise Brands, was there any one or two brands that surprised you in terms of retail performance?","Brian Goldner","Well, we're seeing great performance as we've expanded our retail channel footprint and continue to drive innovation with brands like PLAY-DOH. Really we\u2019re seen that brand accelerate. It's one of our most global brands at very consumable price points. And the brand has performed very well. Really starting to build that momentum with a new array of product and new digital marketing orientation using social scraping and social listening. So, again, I think it's our new trend in the way we approach our brands and approach innovation. It was up sizably in the US but it was up all around the world. And so, as we expand our retail footprint, it's one of the brands that goes not only online with a quite sizable growth but also to a lot of new channels of retail as everyone can participate in PLAY-DOH's innovation, creativity, fun, and growth of the brand. ","And then in addition -- sorry. In addition, the Gaming business is doing quite well. MONOPOLY was up considerably behind both the original and the Cheaters Edition. MAGIC: THE GATHERING in our Franchise Brands has performed quite well. We've talked about that. And again, we're very excited also about a lot of our new initiatives, what we call our quick strike initiatives which have driven growth in the emerging brands segment of the business. But people are very excited about and we're seeing great response to brands like LOST KITTIES and YELLIES and others.","Greg Badishkanian ","Yes. Good. Alright. That's helpful color. Thanks for running that out. And then just finally, any thoughts on the last-minute kind of shopping patterns for the year? So, Toys\u201cR\u201dUs was usually the place to go to get gifts ahead of Christmas. What does that mean for this year? Where do you think the shoppers go for that last-minute gift purchase?","Brian Goldner","I'd say our team has done a fantastic job in working with all of our retailers. As we spoke to you last quarter, we were just in the midst of presenting those plans. And now, we're really seeing them come to fruition as we end the third quarter and enter the fourth quarter. Many of those retailers do merchandise toward the holidays later than a toy specialist who would have product on shelf beginning in July or August. And we're very excited about the expansion of retail space we're seeing at our major partners and retailers. You're going to see very exciting in-store experiences, expanded footprints, very exciting online efforts where we're bringing a lot of digital marketing forward. And so, I think that you're going to see, as I mentioned earlier, a linear footage for the toy industry that's quite sizable and very comparable to a year ago once we get into these last eight weeks of the year. And it's very exciting to see our brands come to life across our portfolio.","Greg Badishkanian ","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jamie Katz with Morningstar. Please proceed with your questions.","Jaime Katz ","Hi. Good morning. I'm curious about some of the forward-looking strategy that you guys talked about. You discussed modernizing the global organization. And I'm interested in hearing exactly sort of what that means and what the top priorities might be for that strategy. And that seems to be spurred also by these changing consumer behaviors that were mentioned in the slide deck that you guys offered. And I'm wondering if there's something secular that you guys have seen or are we just talking more of the shift to online purchasing and then the interest in more digital product offerings than in the past? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","Hey, you're really seeing a transformation of our business across every area, in design and development, the way we go about storytelling and ensuring that we have great stories on every screen, from short form and social media, all the way through bespoke content. The way we're marketing, it used to be that digital marketing was one area of expertise that was in one part of one group in the company. And now digital marketing is embedded across the company. Data analytics and the way that we look at replenishment and working on online algorithms to ensure that our brands are available to people as they search for products for gifting, social listening and social scraping as not only ways to understand what people are doing and how to respond with great product but also so that we understand immediate responses to marketing communications we're putting out and how do we amend those or change those communications to optimize that for the consumer.","We also really are forging new ground in content to commerce. This is where you're able to watch and stream content and make decisions. Literally, just click on the content with a chance to purchase product. We're seeing that really begin to work. And we've built great capabilities there. So, this is literally shoppable social content. I talked a bit about that. And we think this is the next new area where people will shop off their mobile phones. And then, of course, we\u2019ve built the expertise for the teams because again an online -- global online team that's focused on the trends within online shopping, the channel teams that are focused on how do we expand our footprint with a product development strategy that allows us to get to different price points and different feature sets for products and different play patterns. So, again, across the board, we're seeing great progress here.","And in Europe, we're marrying the strong progress that we've shown in North America. And that's all part of some of the changes we've made. The other thing is we have great leadership across our company. And our teams are quite strong with experts in so many new areas. And they want an opportunity to lead. And we want to give them an opportunity to lead at our company. And so, we've made changes organizationally to enable that to happen.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.","Drew Crum ","Okay. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Brian, can you talk about the product lineup and licensing program you had for Bumblebee relative to other TRANSFORMER films and how you'd expect the sales cadence to progress relative to prior TRANSFORMER film cycles?","Brian Goldner","Sure. First of all, Bumblebee just began setting on shelves first in the US just in early October. We're already seeing very strong results out of the gate, albeit early days. And our fans are responding quite positively to the product that they've gotten thus far. Our major retailers have identified the property as a top-level property because it not only has great toy and game lineups but consumer products. Our teams are supporting it with digital games as well. And Backflip is offering new effort -- new elements within its EARTH WARS mobile game. The cadence is that the film comes out at the end of December in many markets. And then it will be a bit later in January in some markets. And we're still waiting on getting our date in China which is typical until later you go, and you show the film in China. And then they'll make a decision on the date. But certainly, it will happen likely after the New Year.","And there are a few other territories where, for competitive reasons and for retail reasons, it's coming after the New Year. So, the brand\u2019s impact -- the movie\u2019s impact on the brand will certainly [Audio Gap] quarter and in the first quarter. And then, of course, the home entertainment windows for all of these brands, our Partner Brands, and certainly for Bumblebee are more pronounced than ever before as more people are watching entertainment at home. And we would expect that to come in the first half of next year, the home entertainment to come in the first half of next year. And this is all part of new storytelling around TRANSFORMERS and will continue with new television which is launched as well and also stream content for fans. And so, the brand has a robust lineup. And as we mentioned, in the US where we are a bit ahead on the strategy, TRANSFORMERS was up double-digits in the quarter.","Drew Crum ","Got it. Okay. And then just shifting gears or going back to MAGIC: The Arena, I know it's still very early days, but have you identified or are there any other game properties or IP in the portfolio that lend themselves to a PC, digital-based, free-to-play format? And if so, is that an area of investment for the company going forward?","Brian Goldner","Yes. This has been an area of investment for us because remember that for MAGIC: Arena, we want to continue to listen to our fans, the gamers who are playing. So, it's constantly iterating the game. Think of games as a service versus a game that you just launch for those listening that -- so, they understand that we'll constantly be iterating and investing in the game and expanding the game in multiple ways to allow them to play on multiple formats. So, it begins as PC game, but you're certainly going to see opportunities to play on every screen for MAGIC: THE GATHERING in a digital format.","And you'll also see esports as a major pillar of growth for MAGIC: THE GATHERING go forward. As I said, competitive gaming has been part of MAGIC's DNA since our first Pro Tour in the '90s. And we see that as an opportunity. In addition, other brands, DUNGEONS and DRAGONS and a few other brands also represent an opportunity in that immersive game playing arena. And we're very excited about the early results. And we'll certainly give you further updates as we head to our analyst meeting early next year.","Drew Crum ","Okay. Great. And then just one last one. Deb, the $50 million to $60 million of charge you expect to take in the fourth quarter, how much is that cash?","Deborah Thomas","That's all cash.","Drew Crum ","It's all cash. Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Susan Anderson with B. Riley FBR. Please proceed with your questions.","Susan Anderson ","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just a follow-up on all of the questions on Toys\u201cR\u201dUs. Just curious, do you think that -- you had thought that you would be able to recapture all of those Toys\u201cR\u201dUs sales over time. Has that changed at all? Is the industry not going to go back to the same levels that it was at or is it just recapturing at a slower rate than you expected? And then I guess as we look out to 2019, is there market share opportunity maybe from some smaller manufacturers that sold at Toys\u201cR\u201dUs that don't really have the same opportunity to distribute elsewhere?","Brian Goldner","Yes. No, I still and we still believe over time that we'll recapture the Toys\u201cR\u201dUs share. And in fact, there's nothing per se about this year that changes our belief about that. Obviously, in entering the second half of the year, you're up against big Toys\u201cR\u201dUs comparable numbers from a year ago. But again, as we move through the year, we're seeing other retailers step up. Our goal is to continue to partner with retailers globally. The one area that was a bit behind was just -- was in Europe because again we wanted to make sure that we made changes to the organization, to our approach to the market, our capabilities and also of course ensure that we exited all excess inventory by year end. And we're doing that. That's our plan. Then again, there are other retailers in the UK that have had some issues. And the team has worked to expand its strategy, the channel strategy to go after new online and omni-channel retailers. And again, that changes the way you send product to them and the weeks of inventory. But again, over time, we believe the demand for toys and games has been robust. The industry has continued to grow. What you're really seeing is the short-term disruption, as we've described.","Susan Anderson ","Great. And then the increased space allocation you're seeing from some of the big retailers, I guess does that change after holiday or do they plan on keeping a higher level of space dedicated to toys after holiday also?","Brian Goldner","Oh! I think that Deb mentioned this earlier. I think it's important to note that the cadence of quarters will change over time as our retail channel strategy and retail footprint continues to expand but with different channels of retail without a big toy specialist in the US. That just changes the cadence of when product may hit shelves. Our retailers are very excited about market share opportunity in the second half of this year. Recognize that at retail, Toys\u201cR\u201dUs represented about $3.5 billion opportunity at this holiday for share recapture.","And as we go forward, our goal, and we said before, is to not recapture all of those dollars this year but rather ensure that our partnerships with retailers enable them to see the success of being invested in the toy business and our business in particular and that as we go forward, having story-led brands that come out throughout the year in addition to other Franchise Brands and Gaming initiatives that come out throughout the year enables us to have great products to get behind and great initiatives to get behind throughout the year. That will become increasingly important, as we've said that story-led brands and entertainment-led brands become increasingly important. And that entertainment might just be social content or stream content or it may be bespoke episodic television or motion pictures. But increasingly to get a 12 month support from global retailers, the consumer insights tied to storytelling are critical.","Susan Anderson ","Great. And then just one last one. Maybe if you could talk about the changes you made at the corporate level. Where were these changes and how should we think about the impact on the business? Maybe if you could just provide a little bit more color on realigning the business that would be great?","Brian Goldner","Sure. The way I view the changes is that over the last decade, we've been reinventing and reimagining our go-to-market approach. We're constantly mining consumer insights, shopper insights, retailer insights. And our north star has always been the Brand Blueprint over the last decade. We on-boarded a lot of new capabilities across the company. Recognize that half of our employees to date are new to the company over just the last six years. And these new experts are increasingly leading across design and development, storytelling, marketing, data analytics, social listening, and other new areas like shoppable social content. So we felt -- given the current environment, we felt there was an opportunity to make a step change in our organization and to go faster. And yes, there are some cost savings. But this also allows us to continue to invest in our team, in our brands and our capabilities.","What I love about Hasbro employees is that they want to lead, and increasingly, they're being put in leadership positions that they both desire and deserve. This is all part of a comprehensive plan to return to growth in 2019 and beyond. And so, we had a strong commitment to diversity in our teams globally, a strong commitment to female leadership across the company. But that's really the context for the changes we've made to the organization. ","Susan Anderson ","Great. That's helpful. Thanks so much. Good luck next quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.","Tim Conder ","Thank you. I wanted to circle back on the company level inventories. Looks like good control progress there. One quick question. Did you all bring in or did you see any vendors that were on this side would have helped sales take any product deliveries in Q3 that would have potentially boosted your own inventories a little bit or boosted sale? Just trying to beat any unknown incremental tariffs. So, that's one question. And then related to future tariffs, we don't know what List 4 will be if it will even be implemented. But if it was 10% or whatever, how much would that impact you, as we would assume it would largely be just on business coming to the US?","Deborah Thomas","Well, from an inventory standpoint, we had some small markets and new markets actually that accounted for that. If you take the FX impact out, our inventories were down. However, markets like India were trying to beat some -- not beat some but get ahead of some additional costs there. So, we see some increases in some of those newer emerging markets for tariffs. ","But with respect to the US, we did not see any. And Brian, do you want to comment on the future tariffs or we continue to -- I'll do it. We continue to look at the list and what could potentially be on it. We have markets that have tariffs now. The biggest was Brazil. They've had them for a while. And it just kind of adds to the price that's on top of what the import costs are and that impacts the consumer. So, we continue to watch. We can't react immediately. But we continue to look at where we're manufacturing product. Right now, about 25% of our product is manufactured in the US, and we just continued of what\u2019s sold in the US. And we continue to look at moving our product to other markets. We've had a global supply chain project ongoing for a while now. But it's most important for us to have good quality, safe products, as we move them outside of markets that could be subject to tariffs.","Brian Goldner","And I think, Tim, it's important to note that this fall for the first time we'll have PLAY-DOH manufactured in the US. And Deb said that I think we're probably among the leader in committing to make product here in the US for our market at 25%. That's quite sizable for the size of our market. And again, we're looking at new markets all the time and have expanded into new countries. And today, about 70% of our products made in China for global market and it will probably be closer to 60% out of China over the next year or two.","Tim Conder ","Okay. No -- and very helpful. Thank you. Deb, any color on the dollar amount that the new licensing agreement contributed to Q3, the Entertainment segment?","Deborah Thomas","If you look at the increase, the increase really was made up of executing that agreement and the MY LITTLE PONY movie. We also had some revenue recognition shift, again that's a shift. Between the quarters, we've had that every year. But I won't specifically say what the amount was.","Tim Conder ","Oh! Okay. Well, yes. You said that before. That's why I wanted to get a little color on the specific amount but okay. And then lastly, you said globally or just in the EU, you thought you'd have the channel inventories cleaned up. And I guess more focused on LatAm and if you had any issues at all in China or not?","Brian Goldner","Yes, I'd really say that we've said throughout the year that our inventory issues, the bulk of our inventory issues really were in Europe. We entered the year with too much inventory as we exited last year on certain initiatives with too much inventory. But again, the issues for this company had been focused around Europe. And we've now accelerated and are ensuring we're executing a plan to conclude those inventory issues at the end of this year.","Tim Conder ","Okay. Thank you, both.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ray Stochel with Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Ray Stochel ","Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, for new retailers or additional shelf space being added after Toys\u201cR\u201dUs liquidations, do you have any sense as to what your incremental market share would be? And then can you say philosophically whether you think competitors are attacking this a little more aggressively but with maybe less of a long-term view than you guys had? And then one additional question on that profitable growth for 2019. Is that with or without or both adjusting severance in 4Q \u201818? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","Yes. We've developed expanded channel strategy. But that begins with changing our product development strategy. So, again, the goal in driving profitable growth is to make the right product at the right price point for different retailers who go to market for different prices. So, if you're working with a dollar store retailer, obviously, you need to make a product that you can sell, and they can sell profitably for that price point. And so, that's taken a couple of years for us to develop. And now, we're able to take those products and move them around the world to different kinds of retailers. And we have a long-term commitment to continue to expand our channels. We also have a very strong commitment to and great success and momentum in our fan business. And we're focused on the fan economy, both direct-to-the-consumer as we've done products like our Sail Barge through HasLab and continue to communicate directly with the fans of our great brands and then increasingly through our retailers who focus on fans. There are several retailers out there who have added Hasbro products to their lineup because again they have gamers and fans of comic book brands, MARVEL brands that come to their stores. And therefore, MARVEL, Star Wars, and other collector-oriented products are perfect for their stores. And so, we continue to look at ways to expand our connection to those audiences. I mentioned earlier to going to new channels of retail for sporting goods around our NERF business and again in games -- a growing array of retailers are committed to our games business. And we're also developing new exclusive ranges of products to ensure that retailers can get behind our properties and products and they can have a unique positioning with those brands.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.","Linda Bolton-Weiser ","Thanks. So, you alluded to some of the challenges in terms of supply chain in supplying a greater variety of types of retailers as you replace the lost TRU volume. Do you expect the actions you need to take along those lines to be completed this year or are you expecting to take some actions next year on a longer-term basis just to kind of adjust your supply chain situation in the US accordingly?","Brian Goldner","Yes. As we mentioned, we're adding a Midwest warehouse which will enable us to manage that part of our business more effectively. We think that that will really help us to achieve our objectives. Recall, in the third quarter it\u2019s probably our peak shipping period for product this year. And typically, Q3 is quite a high level. We just needed more doors of our -- if you think about warehouses and doors, we needed more doors. We have more differing kinds of retailers we're sending product to. They're not all full truckloads. Some of them are less than truckload full shipments. ","By putting a Midwest warehouse out there, we actually get cost savings because we're reducing the mileage to our retailers' distribution centers by more than 40% in doing that. And we believe that new warehouse footprint will really enable us to achieve our objectives in the US. And we'll continue to look at our global warehouse strategic plan as we go forward, as other markets adopt more of the capabilities we've seen work so well in North America. And that may have an impact on where we put warehouses.","Linda Bolton-Weiser ","Okay. And then can I just ask about next year? I know you don't want to go into too much about next year, but when we think about POWER RANGERS, it sounds like you're going to be recording that in Emerging Brands. It surprises me being that it could have a substantial revenue opportunity and you're going to treat it as an important franchise. So, can you just talk about when we could first see revenue? Would that be in April or very small revenue in the second quarter? Is there any way you can just talk about the POWER RANGERS expectations for what you're doing with that next year?","Brian Goldner","Sure. First, you're already starting to see some of the POWER RANGER licensing revenues come into the company. And we indicated that in our Entertainment and Licensing business. And then in terms of toys and games product sales, that really begins in Q2 next year. There's a sell-off period for the prior product which is first quarter. We feel like putting POWER RANGERS in the Emerging Brand category is a good place to start. But you're right. It certainly in our estimation is a Franchise Brand in the making. And we're hoping and we're certain that our great team that is working on that brand out of the West Coast is very focused on ensuring that brand becomes a Franchise Brand in the future.","Linda Bolton-Weiser ","And then just for Deb, on the cash flow guidance for the year, I think you had $600 million to $700 million projected previously for the year. Should we think of that as $500 million to $600 million of operating cash flow for the year?","Deborah Thomas","Well, I think on average, we did say $600 million to $700 million. I think that given the way the operations are going right now, we're probably closer to the lower end of that range. And maybe we'll be a bit below it, but we don't see it as a significant reduction to that range right now.","Linda Bolton-Weiser ","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Gerrick Johnson ","Hi. Good morning. I have three questions, but they're very quick. I just want to clarify. So, margins next year, the comparison is GAAP or is it adjusted?","Deborah Thomas","We will highlight that at Toy Fair. However, our expectation would be that they are adjusted margins. I mean that's typically what we talk about.","Gerrick Johnson ","Okay. Great. And the organizational changes, can you tell us exactly where they were, how many people, and what they did?","Brian Goldner","So, the organizational changes in total represented a mid single-digit percentage of our global workforce. The changes were global in nature, really about as I indicated earlier, ensuring that we're able to continue to evolve the organization. We saw an opportunity to step change the evolution, to move more quickly. We have some incredible leadership across all the disciplines that I noted. And certainly, as we continue to change the nature of our business, where we're selling product, how we're selling product, the changes to the organization are reflected in that.","Gerrick Johnson ","Okay. Thank you. And then just on MAGIC, I know you're not going to give us revenue forecast or targets. But perhaps you can tell us a little bit about how that will be monetized. Will it be free-to-play? Also, when exactly is it supposed to launch? And was it ever expected to launch in 2018? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Sure. So, that Open Beta effectively is open to everyone. So, it's just the Open Beta as opposed to being on the market really is more of a delineation of when we begin our major marketing in earnest. So, if you'd like to play the product, it's available in Open Beta. And anybody who is listening can certainly go play the product. And if you\u2019re not -- if you can't play the product, you can simply go on Twitch and watch the product being played and see the very favorable responses we're getting from gamers. So, the big pivot between Open Beta and the product on the market is just when we really begin marketing the product for the marketplace. ","In terms of when we're going to go, I think all these games -- we want to allow the team at Wizards to set the cadence. Obviously, we're taking all the feedback from our gamers. It's a free-to-play game. So, you can play the game for free. And then there are microtransactions that take place throughout the game play that are ways that we monetize the game play.","Gerrick Johnson ","Great. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Please note that whenever we discuss earnings per share or EPS, we are referring to earnings per diluted share.","Today's discussion will exclude from the third quarter 2015 a pretax gain of $9.9 million or $0.06 per share from the sale of manufacturing operations and from last year\u2019s third quarter a pretax charge of $11.6 million or $0.06 per diluted share related to the restructuring of the company\u2019s investment in its television joint venture.

Brian?","Brian Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The execution of our brand blueprint is delivering underlying growth across brands and geographies. As evidenced by our gains in market share and consumer takeaway this year, our teams are successfully creating the world's best play experiences for consumers around the world, despite the challenging currency environment.","Underlying revenues grew 9%, but the growth was offset by a negative $132 million impact from foreign exchange. The strength of consumer demand was evident across our segments. The U.S. and Canada segment increased 6% and the international segment grew 14%, both excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange.","The emerging markets continued to post double-digit growth absent FX. While the economic environments in these markets are challenging, we continue to believe in the growth opportunity in the strategically important countries over both the short and long-term.","Consumer demand for our brands has remained very strong throughout 2015, with many emerging and developed markets, including the U.S., U.K. and Germany posting double-digit point-of-sale gains this quarter.","This demand was evident across categories. In the U.S. and U.K. point-of-sale increased double digits in the Boys, Games, Girls and Preschool categories. In several countries point-of-sale also grew in all four categories. Retail inventories are well-positioned to support demand for the holiday season, with increases in inventory focused on new initiatives and growing brands.","We continued to see strong demand for Hasbro brands. Absent foreign exchange, Hasbro Franchise brands increased 4% in the third quarter, with NERF, PLAY-DOH and MONOPOLY posting the largest revenue increases.","Over the first nine months of the year, Franchise brands were up 8% absent FX. TRANSFORMERS was down given the difficult comparison and LITTLEST PET SHOP was flat, despite growth in the U.S. The other five Franchise brands each reported growth in constant currency in the nine months period.","NERF is having another outstanding year, with strong innovation driving the core, as well as new initiatives, including NERF Modulus and Rival both off to a strong start.","PLAY-DOH's creative play continues to appeal to global consumers. We celebrated the first ever World PLAY-DOH Day on September the 16th and we are supporting new fall initiatives, including Crazy Cuts and Cupcake celebration. The growth in these brands helped offset the decline in TRANSFORMERS.","Last year the brand benefited from the TRANSFORMERS: AGE OF EXTINCTION film. We continue to plan the future of TRANSFORMERS Franchise in all forms of entertainment, including movies, television and digital expressions.","TRANSFORMERS: Robots in Disguise is airing on Cartoon Network in the U.S. and many international markets and TRANSFORMERS: RESCUE BOTS is also airing on networks around the world.","Last quarter we spoke with you about the incredibly talented group of writers led by Akiva Goldsman, who were charged with plotting out the next 10 years and beyond of theatrical story telling around TRANSFORMERS. While Paramount has yet to formally announce our next film, we are excited about the vast potential of the work, which came out of the writers\u2019 room.","MY LITTLE PONY demand remained strong around the world, with positive point-of-sale trends for MY LITTLE PONY Friendship is Magic! products and a new PLAYSKOOL FRIENDS line for preschoolers.","The Equestria Girls: Friendship Games entertainment premiered last month on Discovery Family with good ratings that beat last year's Rainbow Rocks special in several key demographics.","MAGIC ORIGINS was released in the quarter and was the biggest summer set release in MAGIC: THE GATHERING\u2019s history. In addition in September, the global prerelease for the Battle of Zendikar set previewed at thousands of core Hobby Stores around the globe and was the best attended pre-release in MAGIC\u2019s 22-year history.","Adjusted for the negative impact of foreign exchange, MAGIC: THE GATHERING revenues have increased over the first nine months of the year versus last year. Demand and interest are at all-time highs and we continue to invest to unlock the full potential of the brand. In addition to our franchise brands, 2015 is an impressive year for our partner brands with multiple global box office successes this year already and one major film yet to come.","Force Friday was held on September, the 4th and marked the global retail launch of Star Wars: The Force Awakens product. Fans around the world turned out and Hasbro played a major role in this unprecedented event from the global unboxings of product to record-setting midnight madness events at retail.","The franchise is as vibrant as ever, spanning demographics and bringing in new consumers. Star Wars has the potential to become increasingly global, much as Marvel has become as part of the Walt Disney Company. Retailers and consumers have been very supportive of Hasbro Star Wars: The Force Awakens line and consumer takeaway is off to a strong start. Hasbro's Black Series action figures and multiple lightsabers are on the top of consumers buying lists.","During Force Friday week, according to NPD, action figures and role-play were 42% of the dollars spent in the U.S. Hasbro's Black Series figures were the top-selling Star Wars item for that week in the U.S. Total Hasbro Star Wars retail sales to date through September 26 have significantly outpaced the total Star Wars retail dollar growth in the U.S. and the U.K. Of note, these are the only two markets where we have early data.","The December 18th premiere of the film is still two months away and new Star Wars items from Hasbro will continue to hit retail shelves for the remainder of the year and throughout 2016. In addition to Star Wars, the Marvel brand is performing very well this year and in the quarter, we benefited from initial shipments of Playmation Marvel's Avengers.","Jurassic World also continued to contribute to year-over-year growth. The third quarter also marked the on shelf date for Disney's Descendents. Descendents premiered July 31st on Disney Channel in the U.S. and Canada and we will continue to roll out around the globe this fall. Point-of-sale has been strong for the launch.","During the quarter, we completed the sale of our East Longmeadow, Massachusetts and Waterford, Ireland manufacturing operations to Cartamundi. While this provided a small gain in the quarter, importantly it secured a valued manufacturing partner for our gaming efforts. Going forward, our team\u2019s expertise will be focused on building global gaming brands. We have a robust games program for the holiday, including a number of new initiatives. MONOPOLY Here & Now features all new properties voted on by fans this spring and Internet sensation Pie Face is launching globally and off to a strong start in all major markets.","We also have a number of entertainment led games, including games based on Minions, Marvel's Avengers, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and Disney's Frozen. Games category revenues absent foreign exchange were essentially flat in the quarter and increased 3% year-to-date. Consumer demand has been strong and point-of-sale trends are up double digits in several markets.","Our retail merchandising approach this holiday is more closely aligned with the timing of consumer demand. As a result, shipments have shifted later in the year. In 2015, we are operating in a challenging and competitive marketplace. Succeeding in today's environment requires not only great brands but a stronger and more complex than ever connection with the consumer.","Our global teams are navigating a year with unprecedented currency challenges, a dynamic demand environment and one of the most diverse brand portfolios in entertainment slates we've ever supported. As a result, this holiday season we're delivering tremendous innovation, engaging with consumers across mediums and telling compelling stories around the world.","Later this week, in partnership with Universal, is the theatrical premiere of JEM & the Holograms. Through this live action film and a trend-right licensing program focused on fashion and beauty, a whole new generation of fans will be introduced to JEM. We continue to incubate and develop new brands such as JEM in addition to the further development of our franchise and partner brands.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deb Thomas","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Over the first three quarters of the year, we drove growth in constant currency across brands and geographies, good profitability and strong cash generation, despite the challenging economic environment in a number of our international markets.","Year-to-date, foreign exchange has negatively impacted revenues by $266 million and operating profit by $62 million, and we expect it will continue to be a difficult comparison going forward.","In the third quarter alone, foreign exchange impacted revenues by a negative $132 million and operating profit by a negative $33 million. Approximately, 18% of the topline impact fell to net earnings in the quarter. Pricing and hedging programs helped offset some of this negative impact.","Even with this challenge, we\u2019ve generated $497 million in cash over the past 12 months and ended the quarter with $551 million of cash on the balance sheet. While underlying profitability has grown, we continued to strategically invest in growing our brands and improving the efficiency of Hasbro, while returning excess cash to shareholders. Through the first nine months of the year, we returned $241 million through our dividend and share repurchase program.","Looking at our segments for the third quarter, revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 5%. Growth in the Boys and Preschool categories more than offset a decline in the Games and Girls categories.","Growth in Franchise Brands NERF, PLAY-DOH, and LITTLEST PET SHOP along with shipments of STAR WARS, JURASSIC WORLD and DISNEY\u2019S DESCENDANTS more than offset declines in TRANSFORMERS, FURREAL FRIENDS and FURBY.","Consumer demand in the U.S. remained strong, with point-of-sale increasing double digits across all product categories. Given the departure of Target in the region, Canada point-of-sale was negative. Additionally, foreign exchange had a 1% negative impact on the segment revenue for the quarter.","Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 10% to 23.3% of revenues. Higher revenues more than offset higher expenses, including our continuing investment in MAGIC: THE GATHERING ONLINE.","International segment reported revenues declined 6%. Growth in the Boys and Preschool categories was more than offset by declines in the Games and Girls categories. Franchise Brands PLAY-DOH, NERF and MONOPOLY along with Partner Brands STAR","WARS, JURASSIC WORLD and DISNEY\u2019S DESCENDANTS, were positive contributors to the quarter.","These gains were more than offset by declines in a number of brands including TRANSFORMERS, FURBY, MY LITTLE PONY and LITTLEST PET SHOP.","Absent a negative $126.7 million impact of foreign exchange, International segment revenues grew 14% and the emerging markets grew approximately 12%.","$74.4 million of the foreign exchange impact was in Europe, $44 million in Latin America and $8 million in Asia Pacific. Absent FX, revenues in Europe grew 15%, Latin America increased 14% and Asia Pacific was up 9%.","Reported operating profit in the International segment declined 2% versus the 6% decline in revenues, but increased to 18.6% of revenues. Absent foreign exchange, operating profit increased 14%.","Finally, revenues in the Entertainment and Licensing segment were down 2% versus 2014. The decline in revenue was primarily driven by lower TRANSFORMERS revenues in the segment the year after the movie.","Operating profit increased to $16.2 million. Intangible amortization was lower as certain digital gaming rights were fully amortized in the second quarter of 2015. In addition, last year operating profit was negatively impacted by the acceleration of certain programming amortization costs.","Turning the overall expenses for Hasbro, as anticipated cost of sales in the third quarter was favorably impacted by product mix. In particular higher margin royalty bearing product revenues. In total, cost of sales declined to 39.4% of revenues versus 41% in 2014.","Pricing and favorable hedges have helped us offset the impact of currency in the first nine months of the year. Product mix also drove higher royalties, which grew to 7.7% of revenues for the quarter and for the first nine months of the year.","On a combined basis, cost of sales and royalties were slightly more favorable than last year, as the improvement in cost of sales was nearly entirely offset by higher royalties. As we stated last quarter, we expect this trend of lower cost of sales and higher royalty expense to continue for the remainder of the year.","Product development increased from last year to 4.4% of revenues, reflecting our investment in the Disney Princess and Frozen properties ahead of our 2016 launch. We continue to expect full year 2015 product development to be slightly above 5.5% of revenue. Advertising declined to 9.7% of revenues, reflecting the entertainment-backed mix of revenue in the quarter.","Intangible amortization declined $3.8 million. In the second quarter 2015, we recorded the final quarter of amortization associated with digital gaming rights we reacquired in 2005 and 2007. We anticipate full year amortization will be approximately $44 million.","SG&A increased 3% in the quarter to 17% of revenues. This increase continued to be the result of higher equity compensation, higher depreciation and continued investments in our business, including new systems and The Magic: The Gathering digital platform. These increases were partially offset by favorable foreign exchange.","We continue to believe that SG&A will be higher in 2015 versus last year. Through the first nine months, SG&A on an adjusted basis has total 22.5% of revenues versus 21.6% in 2014.","Turning to results below operating profit, on an adjusted basis, other expense for the quarter was $1.7 million, compared to $4.2 million in 2014. Increased profitability in our 40% share of the operating income from the Discovery Family Channel was the primary driver of the year-over-year improvement.","On a reported basis, $6.8 million of the gain from the sale of our manufacturing operations was recorded in this line during the third quarter, whereas an expense of $12.9 million was recorded last third quarter associated with the restructuring of the investment in our joint venture television network.","The third quarter underlying tax rate was 27.2% versus 27.8% in 2014. We expect our full-year underlying tax rate to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%, reflecting continued higher anticipated earnings in the U.S.","On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.58 versus $1.46 in 2014. We returned $83.5 million to shareholders in the quarter, $57.5 million in dividends and $26 million in share repurchases.","Receivable at quarter end were up 6% and DSOs were 85 days, up five days from last year. In addition to a DSO increase from greater revenue and markets with longer-terms, two days of the DSO increased were due to a delay in the timing of collections in our U.S. Direct Import business. Much of this has now been collected and we do not expect this to occur again in the fourth quarter. Our accounts receivable are of good quality, with 94% at the end of the quarter currently are not yet due for payments, compared to 96% a year ago.","Inventory decreased $52 million versus last year. Excluding the impact of the sale of our manufacturing operations and the impact of foreign exchange, inventories were up approximately $34 million. With the inventory on-hand at Hasbro and at retail, we are well-positioned to meet anticipated demand for the upcoming holiday season, while managing our inventory risk.","The first nine months of the year have set us up well for the holiday season. We have momentum in our brands, a robust entertainment slate and a number of new holiday initiatives to drive our business around the world.","We are also making the necessary investments to continue the execution of our strategy and to build the competencies we need as an organization to continue profitably growing our business over the long-term.","Brian and I are now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Taposh Bari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Taposh Bari","Hey, everybody. Good morning and congrats on a well-executed quarter.","Brian Goldner","Good morning.","Taposh Bari","Brian, good morning. I wanted to ask you, Brian, first about just review on the Toy industry as we head into holiday, seems like the data industry-wide is very healthy this year against the pretty benign consumer backdrop. So, hoping to get your view on what you think is driving that outside of the slate, obviously, that\u2019s being a big driver. How you think retailers are positioned on the category, are they increasing shelf space? And finally, what the role of e-commerce is playing and how that\u2019s evolving within your business?","Brian Goldner","Yeah. So, first of all, you are right, the trends that we see and the data that we have would indicate that the Toy industry year-to-date is up high-single digits, and we see that as boding well as we get into the holiday season and continues our trends.","Our POS across the board is particularly strong up double digits in most markets that we operate in, high-single digits in a few places and in the U.S. across categories is up significant double digits in every category of our business.","What we\u2019re really seeing from a retailer standpoint is that space at retail is increasing, our space is increasing, and they are very focused on the major brand initiatives that we have both franchise brands and partner brands for the holiday season.","And while we see significant pace of growth at brick retailers and omnichannel retailing and online we are seeing growth that's 2 to 3 times that rate in terms of growth. So a very significant growth rates in the online space and the omnichannel space and all retailers are participating in that growth to some degree.","And so I would say overall we continue to feel like the consumer is finding our products and our brands, and that that there's a lot of currency effects that are happening at this time, and obviously, different macroeconomic issues in some of the emerging markets, but if you strip out what\u2019s going on there and take out FX, we are growing double digits in the emerging markets both in the quarter and year-to-date.","So we continue to believe that those markets play a essential role in our growth and we are seeing again underlying profitability increase in those markets as well. So I'd say, overall, we feel that industry is seeing growth and that we are participating in that growth.","And finally, our market shares in 10 of our 11 markets have grown year-to-date with only one market being slightly on par with the industry growth, which is fairly robust so far year-to-date, that\u2019s Mexico. But everywhere else where we get market share data we are growing.","Taposh Bari","Good to see. And just a quick follow-up on the Girl segment, I guess, there are 2 -- it seems like there were 2 points of decline there, FURBY, which has been the case for a while now, MY LITTLE PONY. So can you just elaborate on those points, FURBY, how much longer are we going to see pressure out of that brand. And MY LITTLE PONY, if you can just elaborate on revenue decline there? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","Yeah. I\u2019ll give you a perspective on FURBY. It was a very big brand for us last year. In fact, Q3 last year sales in dollars was bigger than the first two quarters and represented about 37% of 2014\u2019s revenues. Fourth quarter of 2014 FURBY\u2019s revenues were 31% at the full year. So we\u2019re going to see those headwinds through the end of the year. So it was very significant dollars.","In Q3, we\u2019re happy to see that our gross POS is up double digits. In MY LITTLE PONY, the core MY LITTLE PONY business, the pony\u2019s part of the business, Friendship is MAGIC is up in the quarter and MY LITTLE PONY year-to-date is up a bit. It\u2019s really in the timing of EQUESTRIA GIRLS. The special went on the air in September 17th and the translation and placement of that special are happening throughout the fourth quarter in many markets around the world.","I think in many ways it sort of reinforces our belief that programming support that\u2019s over the full calendar year is essential as you look at content storytelling and that it's a little more challenging to put out a one-time per year special, although we do have lots of streaming short videos and other elements to support the EQUESTRIA GIRLS product line. It does impact our timing on that -- on that part of the business certainly.","Taposh Bari","Hey good luck this holiday.","Brian Goldner","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Sean McGowan with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your questions.","Sean McGowan","Thank you. I've a couple if I can. Can you quantify in greater detail how much of the negative impact of currency you were able to offset through the hedging and what's your outlook for that as a benefit going forward?","Deb Thomas","Good morning, Sean.","Sean McGowan","Good morning.","Deb Thomas","From a hedging standpoint, we did say we were able to -- you know between pricing and hedging of our product, able to offset some of the foreign exchange impact while -- which is why we only had about 18%, kind of, fall to the bottomline. We do remain well hedged for the rest of this year as we had talked about. We hedged to protect our pricing and we\u2019re hedged about the same level as we were at the end of last year. So we expect to continue to have solid hedges to allow us to keep our pricing where it is, where there is obviously good consumer demand for it out there in the marketplace.","Sean McGowan","Thank you. Curious about some something that kind of echoes what Mattel was talking about last week and that is that in a couple of properties and in your case perhaps more than a couple of properties, you are seeing very strong POS and yet the declines in shipments. So what do you think the retailers are thinking, are they putting off taking deliveries and do that increase the risk in the fourth quarter?","Brian Goldner","No, we\u2019re really seeing our -- several of our brands have grown in the quarter. A few of the brands are restaged to be a bit later in the year. Also I think you're just seeing the impact of foreign exchange on some of the shipments. And so for example, Games, if you take absent FX Games are flat in the quarter and up low single digits year-to-date that's not what\u2019s indicative of of the underlying or as reported results.","I think as we look brands like NERF were up significantly, PLAY-DOH in the quarter up significantly, MONOPOLY and several of our games up. So I think it's a matter of certain brands being staged starting the third and going into the fourth quarter and other brands being staged closer to the fourth quarter. Many of our games initiatives really come out into the fourth quarter, more consistent with the timing of consumption of the games. Several of our Girls initiatives happen a little bit later because of the price points like StarLily within FURREAL FRIENDS, which is a higher priced item and more consistent with being a holiday item.","And as we continue to make improvements in the supply chain and work with our retailers, I do think that we\u2019re able to deliver more just-in-time inventory against the greater growth in linear feet and it\u2019s probably our capability and partly their desire to have product that hits more closely aligned with the holiday season.","Sean McGowan","Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ve some quick ones to conclude. Was Magic up in the third quarter? And finally Deb can you give us a guidance on the full year expectation for program cost to amortization, is that still expected to be in line with last year\u2019s level?","Brian Goldner","Yeah. So, MAGIC, year-to-date was down a bit in the third quarter. And I think one of the things we will continue to talk about with our analyst community and our own constituencies is the fact that MAGIC is really focused around storytelling. And so what we are going to see as I look out over the near and medium-term future is some up-and-down quarters that are more about the storytelling that's being done in any particular time rather than some of the seasonality because as we know that MAGIC really doesn't abide by the same similar seasonality than rest of our business.","So, year-to-date up a bit, in the quarter down a bit but again, we've seen very robust takeaway during the quarter, lots of pre-release activity, lots of interest in the brand, total number of gamers and players up. And so I think it's just a matter of when the storytelling\u2019s hitting and then, of course as you remember, so much of that business is done outside our traditional channels of retail, more in the traditional Hobby Stores.","And the number of Hobby Stores that are carrying MAGIC: THE GATHERING has actually increased year-on-year as have our tournament. So, I just think it\u2019s a matter of starting to frame that conversation, more about the release schedule and the storytelling versus that expectation that we should see acceleration only based on seasonality.","Sean McGowan","Okay. Thanks.","Deb Thomas","And as far as the program production amortization, we continue to expect it to be around like 1-ish percent of revenue.","Sean McGowan","Okay. For the full year?","Deb Thomas","For the full year, yes.","Sean McGowan","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Brian Goldner","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steph Wissink, Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question.","Steph Wissink","Thank you. Congratulations on a good quarter. Our question really relates specifically to Star Wards brand. I\u2019m curious if you can just talk a little bit about the quarter. How that performed relative to your plan and any initial insights from the sales mix? And then just secondly, we are observing some rebalancing within the category post Force Friday. It seems like action figures are actually gaining a bit more space on the shelves. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s also how you had planned the business. You had guided maybe a bit of incremental surprise to the upside with respect to how the POS looked coming out of Force Friday. Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Steph, good morning. If you look at the Star Wars business, clearly, we performed quite well during Force Friday. We talked about the numbers of both action figures and role-play being 42% of the business. Up till September 28, where we have data and we only have data for two markets, early data which we work with NPD to get and that was in the U.S. and U.K. Our business is actually ahead of the retail sales increases we are seeing overall in Star Wars. And I would say, overall, Star Wars is at the high-end of our range of expectation for revenues this year. So, we had a range of expectations and Star Wars is performing at the high end of that range.","It's incredibly encouraging. We're seeing great rates of sale, but I would also add that contributing to our boys business and sometimes lost in the array of entertainment initiatives that are certainly supporting our business, Nerf is having an outstanding year and was up significant double digits in the quarter and year-to-date. And we are seeing great growth there both in the core Nerf business as well, a lot of our new initiatives like Modulus and Nerf Rival. So it's a great balance between some of our partner brands like Star Wars. Year-to-date, Marvel is really contributing, both year-to-date and in the quarter, Jurassic World is contributing. So again, it's strength to strength between our own franchise brand as well as our partner brands.","Steph Wissink","Thank you. Then just one follow-up, Brian, if you could talk a little bit about the Disney Princess business. You will receive that license early next year. How should we think about the flow of product into the channel over the course of the first 12 months of that license?","Brian Goldner","Well, there will be a transition period, certainly in the first quarter of next year as other product sells out and through. There is a period where that can occur and then we will be shipping in, so I imagine in the first quarter, we will have a transition period in working with our retailers to make that as streamline as possible and as efficient as possible. But I certainly believe there will be a transition period. And then beyond that, the innovation that we\u2019ve put into the product line, the partnership we have with the Walt Disney Company and our response from global retailers has been outstanding. So, I think longer term, the brand is well poised to perform exceedingly well and probably better than it has historically.","Steph Wissink","Thanks for the added color. Best of luck","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Eric Handler, MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Handler","Yes. Thanks a lot. So, with MAGIC: THE GATHERING it seems like there's been a lot of television advertising not just with Hearthstone but other card battling storyline type games other than the videogame side. Is that causing you to rethink and if you\u2019re marketing promotions or how you rollout the MAGIC product? And then secondly with TRANSFORMERS, tell me if I\u2019m wrong but it just seems from an observation standpoint, the shelf space for TRANSFORMERS has been shrinking or seeing for us fewer SKUs. I\u2019m just curious to think, get your opinion on how that products evolution will take place over the next couple of years and not at least in non-movie years?","Brian Goldner","Yeah. First, let's talk about TRANSFORMERS. Year-to-date TRANSFORMERS is actually bucking the trend of a typical boys action property the year following the movie. In fact, it's down by just over a third, which as you know is far better than one would expect in a non-movie year, and that's because the amount of entertainment.","We're also seeing in our preschool TRANSFORMERS, growth year to date in Preschool TRANSFORMERS are TRANSFORMERS rescue bots product line and being supported again by content. Our licensing year-to-date for TRANSFORMERS is up. So I think maybe we need to take a broader perspective on the performance of TRANSFORMERS and look more globally because it\u2019s performing quite well and in non-movie year, certainly it\u2019s down in the quarter and down more typical in the more typical range in the quarter.","Bu again, I think the teams done a great job, great innovation and expanded product line and again down below those trends one would expect. In terms of MAGIC: THE GATHERING, we\u2019ve launched a product that\u2019s app based product this year called MAGIC ORIGINS. It's a product that enables people to get into the brand and learn how to play magic. But remember while we are investing in magic online and certainly believe over time, our online business will be more robust.","The play pattern of MAGIC is all about face-to-face connections, and all about people getting together to play the brand in an analog space. And you're having visited lots of the gaming stores and hobby shops having spent some time over the summer. They are really nothing that replaces that experience of people getting together, coming together friends gathering together, getting off of their screens and playing face-to-face. We are running more tournaments and however, we have a more engaged gamer community. And we're seeing great responses to the pre-releases and releases for our card sets.","So long term, I think we're in a very good shape in MAGIC. And as I said bit earlier, I think quarter to quarter it's a bit hard to read because again it's not based on any kind of seasonality that's typical in our industry. It's more about the releases that are going on any period and our users and players playing. We\u2019ll continue to talk about as we go forward.","Eric Handler","Very helpful. Thanks. Thanks a lot Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Lee Giardano with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead with your question.","Lee Giardano","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So excluding Star Wars, I hope you can talk about any early reads on potential hot toys must have as holiday product lineup? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","Wow, that's a big question. So, if I look where we are in the third quarter, what was we are seeing is a great double-digit growth in POS. Let\u2019s just use the U.S. for example, double-digit growth in our Boys category, in our Girls category, in our Preschool business, in our games business and our franchise brands.","So we're really seeing in a way a great product offerings that are being well received by consumers, thus far albeit, we are now into the fourth quarter. So the NERF brand performing very well in the quarter and year-to-date. Obviously, JURASSIC WORLD is being a very strong contributor. MY LITTLE PONY has several new initiatives both core MY LITTLE PONY as well as EQUESTRIA.","LITTLEST PET SHOP has performed very well in certain markets and we've been clearing out old inventory to perform better in other markets as we go forward. We\u2019ve got in FURREAL FRIENDS, a great holiday product, a StarLily. So that\u2019s been quite good. And then our PLAY-DOH brand has performed exceedingly well throughout the year and we have a number of new initiatives coming into the holiday, PLAY-DOH\u2019s up and up double-digits as well, both in the quarter and year-to-date. So I would say that you\u2019re seeing great strength in our brands and our business across a number of brands and a number of new product initiatives.","Lee Giardano","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Jaime Katz","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m curious about the effectiveness of your advertising. It looks like last couple of quarters, it\u2019s been down a little bit. And I\u2019m wondering if some of the content creation has been able to substitute in the spend. And how you guys think about that going forward?","Brian Goldner","If you recall, we\u2019ve talked a lot about how we sort of view our own content creation, our advertising and then, of course, royalties paid as all points, if you were marketing because we have big partners out there who are creating great content as well. We\u2019re also seeing an overall trend toward more digital marketing. We\u2019re certainly spending more in digital, particularly in developed economies and we\u2019re quickly increasing our digital marketing where available in more of the emerging market.","On average, digital marketing cost less out of pocket and is more targeted. But again, I think that overall I would still use and guide you toward roughly 10%, 8S ratio in advertising over time. But certainly in a major entertainment year we have the opportunity to focus on our own entertainment and content, as well as our partners entertainment, which helps to deliver our sales for the year.","Jaime Katz","Okay. And then for girls, can you talk a little bit about your product pipeline as we lap the FURBY sales or you think there might be some bright spots in the period ahead?","Brian Goldner","Sure. If you look at the brands, our new BABY ALIVE offerings are performing quite well out of the gate. Our FURREAL FRIENDS StarLily coming into the holiday should be quite successful. And we feel very good about it and the early reads are quite good. In MY LITTLE PONY, several new initiatives coming both in the core MY LITTLE PONY as well as EQUESTRIA GIRLS. PLAY-DOH DOHVINCI has performed well year-to-date -- is up year-to-date and coming into the holiday season we see that as a great news segment for the brand. And then you'll see several new items in NERF REBELLE coming into holiday as well.","Then we should also talk about DISNEY DESCENDANTS. DESCENDANTS is off to a great start. The DCOM movie launched end of July and it's rolling out around the world and to different markets but where we have launched DESCENDANTS, it\u2019s performing exceedingly well. So again, another addition to our girl\u2019s portfolio and lineup. It\u2019s really unique and differentiated and great storytelling.","And as you may have read, they've announced another DESCENDANTS television movie coming 2017. So I think as we look forward into 2016 and \u201817, lots of great new girls product, both from our own franchise brands as well as great partners. And we talked earlier about, of course, the introduction of Disney Princess and Frozen coming into 2016.","Jaime Katz","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.","Drew Crum","Okay. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So Deb, I think on the last call, you talked about investments being more prominent because they were used in the second half versus the first half. Is this in reference to capital spending or is this something that we should see flow through the income statement in the fourth quarter because I look at your OpEx in the third quarter, it\u2019s less than 2%, whereas in the first half was up 4%. So just want to get some clarification around that?","Deb Thomas","Good morning, Drew. I think you\u2019re seeing it really in both places. If you look at our CapEx, it\u2019s turning a bit higher than it has in the past. And in there you can see the investment we\u2019re making in system. But there is also a piece that\u2019s flowing through our P&L.","We have a bit flowing through product development but the largest piece is through the SG&A line. And really as we talk about our investment in MAGIC: THE GATHERING online, it\u2019s putting in the systems and the programming associated. We\u2019re getting that done. As well as some of the investments we're making to drive the long-term efficiencies in our business and streamlining some of our processes as we go forward. So you are seeing a bit of it in CapEx, which you are also seeing running primarily through the SG&A line.","Drew Crum","Got it. Okay. And then, just, lot of press coverage on YO-KAI WATCH and your relationship there? When did you guys begin shipping that product? And Brian, just in terms of expectations, how does this compare to BEYBLADE, just a Franchise that could do BEYBLADE like numbers when you initially launched back in 2011? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","So, I think, the place to look for YO-KAI WATCH is to what\u2019s occurred in Japan. It\u2019s been a very successful brand for some period of time in Japan. The TV episodes have just begun airing and we\u2019ll begin shipping in the next little while, I think most of the impact occurs or more of the impact that would occur in the first quarter of 2016, but that probably a little bit happening in the fourth quarter this year.","But as you recall, when we first launched BEYBLADE, it takes a number of months to inculcate play pattern to get be awareness up around the brand and we take a long view of property like YO-KAI WATCH. It\u2019s been very successful, it really is very unique and differentiated in the marketplace and it\u2019s something that we are very looking forward too. I don\u2019t want to try to size it for you. But, I would tell you that, certainly, has been very successful multiple years in Japan.","Drew Crum","Okay. Just one, last one, appreciating the lack of seasonality with MAGIC, can you just remind us what\u2019s the card cadence looks like for the fourth quarter over the next couple of quarters?","Brian Goldner","Well, we continue to have new releases coming in the fourth quarter and obviously, into 2016. I don\u2019t want to try to again size the card releases that\u2019s part of the fun for the fans and gamers is to hear from the brand as to what the card releases look like.","But, I think, that the way to view the brand is on an annual basis versus quarter-by-quarter, because of the way the storytelling is done and the way the card releases are set and the tournaments that are associated with the brand.","And overtime we believe that MAGIC Online will play greater roles as our investments start to take hold and certainly as we look out to 2017 and beyond, we expect to have a more robust systems that are enable more concurrent play online and to run even more robust online tournaments post or in 2017 and beyond.","So we'll continue to build on the Analog business, number of releases coming and again as you know this year we have gone to a different kind of release schedule and you\u2019ll continue to see the team evolve creatively into 2016.","Drew Crum","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with you questions.","Tim Conder","Thank you. Brian, given your comments on Star Wars and it\u2019s kind of tracking at the high-end of your retail expectations? You had said before that you see the sales balances between 2015 and \u201916? I guess, maybe an update on that and then, did that statement just for clarification purposes? Did that statement include only The Force Awakens or also factor in Rogue One?","Brian Goldner","It\u2019s -- Rogue One is for holiday next year 2016.","Tim Conder","Right.","Brian Goldner","So we are really -- I am really talking about the overall Star Wars business that includes both Rebels, as well as The Force Awakens product this year and into next year. We don't really have an update relative to the split between 2015 and \u201916. What we are just seeing is that the brand is performing both in shipments and sell-through at the high-end of our range and we will have to wait and see as to that rate of sale as we get in through.","We certainly believe that 2016 Q1 and Q2 as we go through and lots of young people get to see the movie. Remember we are still two months out from the movie. So that's going to have a major impact, then we get into the first quarter where lots of people now having enjoyed the movie and putting it in context with the other movies that have been out there. And then at some point to be announced there will be home entertainment window as well that will continue to spur the brand along.","And so not ready to update any broad guidance around the split between \u201815 and \u201916. Just wanted to report that we've seen very robust sales that our part of the business is tracking ahead in terms of retail sales versus Star Wars overall, and that overall shipments and retail sell-through at the high end of our range.","Tim Conder","Okay. You had also commented on how your just in time ability has improved even with broaden distribution. Can you, any type of quantification of how much revenue that maybe shifted from third to fourth quarter? The competitor gave some commentary on that from what they thought from their business on Thursday. Any quantification you can throw out here?","Brian Goldner","No. I don\u2019t think that trying to quantify that at this point would be prudent. I do think that you're seeing a lot of new initiatives coming into the fourth quarter as you would expect. I think what\u2019s heartening to see is that both in Q3 as well as year-to-date, our categories of brands and products are selling very well and our POS has remained strong throughout the year and continues to be strong.","I'd also tell you that in many instances our POS has strengthened in the third quarter versus the year-to-date numbers. So again we\u2019re seeing momentum build and again I\u2019m not going to size Q3 versus Q4.","Tim Conder","Okay. And into somewhat profitability-related questions here. How do you see, this is a follow-on to the prior question related to the Princess business. How do you see that profitability ramping in \u201816 and \u201817. And then also are you seeing any benefits to expect this year from lower transportation costs and then other input cost benefits in \u201816, given the typical delay that you have with the vendors and contract pricing?","Brian Goldner","If you look I listed some product input cost. The single biggest cost input to our cost of goods is labor. And we continue to see labor inflation rates in the double-digit range. We have seen a slight decrease in the cost of certain types of resins over the period since the end of 2014. But they tend to be more nominal and they run in arrears to whatever the petroleum or gasoline costs prices are out there as you know. But I'd say overall, we haven't seen any significant surcharges in shipping and getting a bit of pickup there. But I wouldn't say there is anything nominal.","Deb Thomas","Yeah. We do tend to lock in our contracts on a one-year basis. So kind of what you\u2019re seeing now is we\u2019ve locked in our -- certainly our shipping contracts probably back in the springtime. So whatever benefits you\u2019re seeing, you\u2019re seeing them in that as well. But with respect to Princess, so that\u2019s a great question. So if you think back and then you followed us for a while but for those who haven\u2019t, if you think kind of that to one we took on the MARVEL license, which is just a great partner brand of ours. You do tend to see as revenues begin to ramp, profitability also ramps. We\u2019ve invested a lot in product development.","Brian mentioned we have wonderful innovative product coming next year. And you\u2019ll see that over time as we experience more revenue with the license and people become acquainted better with our product line, we will see profitability ramp much like we saw with the MARVEL line.","Tim Conder","Okay. And one last on FURBY, just can you remind us how big that was in \u201814?","Brian Goldner","I don\u2019t think we ever told you to begin with. So I don\u2019t I can remind you.","Tim Conder","Okay.","Brian Goldner","But what I would say to you, it was a significant brand for us both in 2013. It continued to be a very big brand for us in 2014. I tried to size for you the percent of revenue that we experienced in each of the quarters. And I said that FURBY in the third quarter was 37% last year in 2014, 37% of the dollars were done in the third quarter and 31% of the dollars were done in the fourth quarter. So clearly, the headwind will continue through the remainder of this year.","Tim Conder","Okay. Thank you both.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your questions.","Gerrick Johnson","Hey. Good morning. I was hoping\u2026","Brian Goldner","Good morning.","Gerrick Johnson","\u2026you could help us with the breakdown of Star Wars shipments between domestic and international either dollars or local currency or whatever you can provide?","Brian Goldner","The Star Wars brand is off to a very good start everywhere. I\u2019m not going to right now give you the specific breakdowns, domestic to international. But we believe over time the brand becomes increasingly global. I talked a little bit about that earlier and we've seen that over time with our Marvel business.","But as we continue to develop the brand and as the brand becomes even more familiar to new consumers in the international markets, in emerging markets, we believe it gets even more global in scope. But so far it's off to a very good start around the world.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. And you said it was tracking towards the high end of your plan. Can you tell us what your plan was for shipments between the third and the fourth quarter?","Brian Goldner","We are not going to talk about shipments between third and fourth quarter, but it is tracking at the high end of the plan. And I guess I\u2019d give you some broad -- I will give you some broad guidance between international, domestic, it's about 50-50, so that there is uptick in both international as well as domestic market.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. Okay. That\u2019s what I was shooting for because there is just so much uncertainty. It\u2019s just helpful to get those kinds of breakouts. Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Yeah. But I think what happens over time, you see it in our TRANSFORMERS business, you\u2019ve seen it in the Marvel business over time, it gets even more developed in international markets and maybe you get to introduce the brand at the emerging markets in places where it doesn't have as long history or is not as well known. So, I think over time, pertains good things. And I just don't feel at this moment, I would talk about the cadence of shipments between third and fourth quarter.","But I\u2019ve tried to give you some sense in real-time that the brand is performing very well, that our part of the brand is ahead of overall retail for the brand and our products are on the top of many retailers, our toy lists as well as consumers wanting to buy list for the holiday and it\u2019s at the high-end of our range, both in terms shipments as well as retail sales relative to our expectations.","Gerrick Johnson","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time for closing comments, I will turn the floor back to Ms. Debbie Han.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, Rob and thank you, everyone for joining the call today.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Debbie Hancock, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter earnings release was issued this morning and is available on our website. Additionally, presentation slides containing information covered in today's earnings release and call are also available on our site. The press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP financial measures included in today's call. Please note that whenever we discuss earnings per share, or EPS, we are referring to earnings per diluted share. This morning, Brian Goldner, Hasbro's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Deb Thomas, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results and discuss important factors impacting our performance. Following their prepared remarks, Brian and Deb will be happy to take your questions.","Before we begin, please note that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management's expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters. These forward-looking statements may include comments concerning our product and entertainment plans; anticipated product performance; business opportunities, plans and strategies; costs and cost savings initiatives; financial goals and expectations for our future financial performance.","There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. Some of those factors are set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K, our most recent 10-Q, in today's press release and in our other public disclosures. You should review such factors together with any forward-looking statements made on today's call. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.","With that said, now I would like to introduce Brian Goldner. Brian?","Brian D. Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the third quarter, we grew revenues, operating profit and earnings per share. Year-to-date, revenues are flat, but we've grown our operating profit and earnings per share, excluding charges. We are entering the critical fourth quarter with innovative products, a full array of immersive brand experiences and comprehensive marketing programs with our retail partners and for our consumers globally.","We have developed the capabilities and are executing our branded play blueprint to create shareholder value and to deliver growth and shareholder returns over the long term. Our focus on innovation is driving our brands. Many of our new initiatives are performing well. Nerf Rebelle, My Little Pony Equestria Girls, TELEPODS, Furby and Big Hugs Elmo are all off to a great start. In total, our franchise brands grew 19% in the third quarter, with gains in My Little Pony, Magic: The Gathering, Nerf, Transformers and Play-Doh.","Geographically, our emerging markets continue to post double-digit revenue growth, increasing 22% in the quarter, with very strong gains in many countries, including Russia, Brazil and China. Over the past several years, we've made significant investments in our global infrastructure. And Hasbro is delivering above-average growth in the emerging markets. In addition, revenues grew in several developed markets, including France, Spain, Italy, Germany and Mexico. In total, Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific all posted revenue gains in the third quarter.","Our U.S. and Canada segment revenues were down in the quarter, given the continued difficult comparisons with 2012 revenues for the Boys category, which included 2 very strong Marvel Entertainment initiatives, the Avengers and The Amazing Spider-Man, and higher sales of Beyblade. Consistent with this trend, year-to-date POS was down overall in the U.S., driven by challenging Boys comparisons. But POS grew in the Girls, Games and Preschool categories. Our top line revenue performance in the quarter were achieved against a backdrop of uncertainty among consumers and retailers in developed economies, which we expect to continue into the fourth quarter. Retailers remain focused on tighter inventory management.","Over the past 2 years, we've made significant improvements in our execution and inventory management in the U.S. And Hasbro inventory at our top 4 U.S. retailers declined in the quarter. This improved discipline, coupled with strong alignment with our retailers, is helping us to better manage our business in the important holiday season. The U.S. team has done great work in developing and implementing a new strategic direction for our U.S. business. Backed by the innovation in our brands across categories and the entertainment coming in future years, we believe the U.S. is poised for future growth.","On a category basis overall for Hasbro, the Boys category declined in the quarter, given the difficult comparisons I mentioned earlier. However, new innovations in key franchise and partners' brands delivered growth in both Transformers and Star Wars products in the quarter.","Moving to Girls. Our brand initiatives continue to drive positive momentum in the third quarter, delivering Girls category revenue growth of 29%. The global rollout of Furby, continued growth in My Little Pony and the successful launch of My Little Pony Equestria Girls, Nerf Rebelle and growth in Easy-Bake, all contributed to the category's fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Built from in-depth global consumer insights, immersive content and innovation, we are successfully expanding our Girls brands globally.","My Little Pony Equestria Girls was developed from the core values and insights behind the global success of My Little Pony. We launched this entertainment in theaters in the U.S. And it is now available across all screens globally, with strong viewership. My Little Pony Equestria Girls products launched in major markets in August and have been selling extremely well, with additional markets still to launch.","Also extending a growth streak, the Games category posted its fourth straight quarter of revenue growth and increased 6% in the quarter. Magic: The Gathering again delivered strong gains year-over-year. And several other gaming initiatives, including Jenga, Elefun & Friends and the launch of the all-new TELEPODS gaming platform, featuring Angry Birds Star Wars, positively contributed to the third quarter's 6% increase. Additionally, Monopoly and Monopoly Empire continued to sell well. Monopoly revenues were flat in the quarter but have grown year-to-date.","The third quarter was also the first quarter of contribution from Backflip Studios, in which we acquired a 70% ownership position in July of this year. Backflip provided a small contribution to the Games category revenues in the quarter and was slightly dilutive to Hasbro's overall earnings for the third quarter. The studio has a number of new game launches slated for the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014. Given the anticipated timing of revenues and the associated product development costs, we anticipate Backflip to be neutral to our financials for the full year 2013.","Within Preschool, revenues declined slightly in the quarter but grew across the brand initiatives where we are focusing our greatest efforts. Play-Doh revenues were up in the quarter, as were Transformers Rescue Bots within the Playskool Heroes line. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, Big Hugs Elmo is off to a strong start. And we're very pleased with the early consumer reaction to this highly interactive and engaging Elmo. This great play experience has Big Hugs Elmo on nearly every hot toy list for the holidays.","Growth in these brands partially offset lower revenues in other Preschool initiatives, where we are creating new business models to develop and profitably grow our brands. For example, we made the decision to license the Tonka brand to a partner, who can develop the products and positively support the brand over the long term. Our Tonka revenue is now higher-margin royalty revenue, but on a year-over-year basis is lower dollars.","I spoke earlier about the difficult entertainment comparisons within Boys. As we look ahead, the next several years have unprecedented levels of entertainment from Hasbro and our partners' brands, both in film and in television. In 2014, Transformers: Age of Extinction is slated for release on June 27. Marvel has several films planned for 2014, including Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and an all-new franchise, Guardians of the Galaxy. In addition, Lucasfilm is unveiling all-new Star Wars Rebels television programming in 2014. In 2015, Star Wars: Episode VII is scheduled for release, as is Marvel's The Avengers: Age of Ultron. From Hasbro, we continue to believe Stretch Armstrong is a tremendous property, and we are developing the brand for television and film in future years. Additionally, the third G.I. Joe film is being developed with Paramount and Director John Chu.","In Television, our global programming through Hasbro Studios, in combination with our partners' global television efforts, is reaching viewers around the world and establishing great characters and stories for brand development. Since inception, Hasbro Studios has green-lit more than 900 half-hours of original production behind Hasbro brands, including My Little Pony, Transformers and Littlest Pet Shop. As evidenced by the success of My Little Pony Equestria Girls in theaters, on television, via home entertainment and streaming platforms, activating our content across all screens is a critical component to our content strategy. Our goal is to maximize the engagement between our branded entertainment initiatives and our audience wherever they are consuming content. In the U.S., the Hub Network continues to deliver year-to-year growth, most recently posting its eighth consecutive quarter of ratings growth in Total Day, while remaining the most co-viewed children's cable network in percentage terms.","In closing, we continue to execute our branded play strategy across our brand blueprint globally. We are doing so with a heightened focus on our greatest opportunities, while leveraging the global resources in which we have invested to drive profitable growth across toys and games, licensing, digital gaming and immersive entertainment. We have finished 3 quarters of the year, and the critical fourth quarter is just getting started. We have tremendous new innovation and brands in the marketplace this holiday season, supported by integrated retail and promotional campaigns globally. Our teams are focused on superior execution and consumer engagement to deliver a successful holiday season in what continues to be a challenging economic environment in many developed economies.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deborah M. Thomas","Good morning, everyone. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we continued to drive our business globally across the brand blueprint while improving profitability, maintaining a strong balance sheet and strategically deploying cash both into our business and returning it to shareholders.","In the third quarter, revenues grew 2%, led by continued strong growth in our emerging markets and overall growth in the International segment. Excluding charges, operating profit increased 4% in the quarter and year-to-date. Our balance sheet is strong, and we continue to generate healthy cash flow. And we have taken and continue to take cost out of our business as our cost savings initiative and savings targets remain on track to deliver $100 million in savings by 2015.","In the quarter, we recorded additional charges of $4.1 million, or $0.03 per share, associated with our cost savings initiatives. Pretax restructuring charges in the quarter were $3 million and partial pension settlement charges were $1.1 million. Our expectation for gross savings in 2013 continues to be $45 million to $48 million, with associated expected net savings of $13 million to $15 million for the full year prior to pension charges. The following review excludes pension and restructuring charges. A full breakdown of these charges by segment and by line item on the income statement was included in today's earnings release and slide presentation.","Looking at our segment results for the quarter. The U.S. and Canada segment revenues and operating profit both declined 5%. Revenues in the Girls category increased and the Games category was flat, partially offsetting declines in the Boys and Preschool category revenues in the segment. As Brian discussed, the Boys category was the biggest factor driving year-over-year revenue declines. Additionally, inventory levels at our top 4 retailers were also down in the U.S., as retail partners continue to focus on tightly managing inventory.","The U.S. and Canada segment reported a 5% decline in operating profit but a slight increase in operating profit margin to 20% versus 19.9% last year. On a year-to-date basis, revenues in the segment are down 3% but operating profit has increased 6% to 16.6% of revenues from 15.4% in 2012. The margin improvement is primarily due to the favorable mix of revenues, including continued growth in Magic: The Gathering, which we are also investing in for the long-term growth of the business.","In the International segment, revenues increased 11% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a favorable $5 million, or 1%, impact on the quarter. Emerging markets continued to post double-digit growth, increasing 22% in the quarter and all 3 International regions were up, with Europe growing 9%, Latin America increasing 14% and Asia-Pacific up 17%.","Internationally, the Girls, Games and Preschool categories posted year-over-year revenue growth. International segment operating profit margin increased to 18.1% compared to 16.3% in 2012. As we discussed last quarter, overheads in this segment are generally incurred ratably throughout the year, and we gain leverage in the expense on the higher revenue base later in the year. This expense leverage is the primary driver of the year-over-year gains.","The Entertainment and Licensing segment net revenues also grew in the quarter, increasing 13% behind growth in the entertainment revenues, as well as the addition of Backflip to the segment this quarter. Operating profit in the Entertainment and Licensing segment declined, primarily from the addition of Backflip expenses to the segment. Additionally, program production amortization increased in the third quarter of 2013 versus last year, given the mix of programs delivered in the quarter.","Looking at our overall expenses. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue declined in the quarter, benefiting primarily from product mix and, to a lesser extent, lower cost and improve efficiencies at our manufacturing facilities. Additionally, royalties declined on lower revenue from entertainment-based properties. While we've begun to achieve some of our cost savings, we do have other factors which impacted our expense levels. Product development grew year-over-year in dollars and as a percentage of revenues.","First, the addition of Backflip added to product development expenses in the quarter. Second, as we shared with you in September, we're making incremental investments in our Magic: The Gathering brand. Finally, we wrote off early film development expenses associated with films which have not yet moved to production. As Brian mentioned, we continue to develop several film properties.","Intangible amortization also increased slightly in the quarter due to Backflip. In the third quarter, there was an incremental $1.6 million of expense. And based on our preliminary valuation, we anticipate this amortization to be $6 million to $7 million in the fourth quarter. We are in the final stages of the valuation process, but we anticipate amortizing approximately $35 million to $40 million over a 4-year time period based on the related revenues. Finally, SD&A increased in the quarter, consistent with the factors we outlined previously, including higher compensation expense, higher depreciation and investments we're making in our Magic: The Gathering brand.","Turning to our quarterly results below operating profit for the third quarter. Total nonoperating expense decreased slightly from 2012. For the third quarter 2013, our 50% share in the Hub Network was a loss of $91,000 compared to a loss of $1.8 million a year ago. As we stated last quarter, we expect the contribution from the Hub Network in 2013 to be similar to 2012. And the Hub Network has a plan to achieve pretax profitability in 2014.","In the quarter, we recorded a favorable tax adjustment of $23.6 million, or $0.18 per share, related to the settlement of a tax exam. Excluding this adjustment, our underlying tax rate for the third quarter 2013 was 26.5% compared to an underlying tax rate of 26.6% in the third quarter of 2012 and 27% for the full year 2012. We expect our underlying tax rate for the full year 2013 to be approximately 26.5% to 27%. For the quarter, average diluted shares were 131.8 million shares, compared to 132.5 million shares last year. Diluted earnings per share, absent charges in the favorable tax adjustment, were $1.31 versus $1.24 in 2012.","Hasbro also continues to generate strong cash flow. Operating cash flow was $47.3 million in the quarter and $438.5 million for the trailing 12 months. This includes $165 million in prepaid royalties to Disney over the trailing 12-month period. At quarter end, cash totaled $588.7 million versus $696.7 million in 2012. During the third quarter, we paid $112 million for our investment in Backflip Studios.","We remain committed to strategically investing in our business and returning excess cash to our shareholders through our dividend and buyback programs. Our next quarterly dividend payment of $0.40 per share is scheduled for November 15. During the third quarter 2013, we repurchased approximately 644,000 shares of common stock at a total cost of $30 million and an average price of $46.62 per share. At quarter end, the company had repurchased a total of 1.93 million shares of common stock year-to-date. In August, our Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase an additional $500 million of our common stock. $542 million remained available in the current share repurchase authorizations at quarter end.","Receivables at quarter end increased 2% in line with the growth in revenues, and DSOs were flat with last year at 80 days. Inventories declined $16.3 million versus last year, driven by declines in the U.S. and Canada segment. This was partially offset by inventory increases in emerging markets, supporting the growing business in those regions. As we mentioned earlier, our inventory at U.S. retail is down in the quarter. And overall at retail and at Hasbro, inventory is of good quality.","With the critical fourth quarter under way, Hasbro is well positioned with innovative brand initiatives, compelling global marketing campaigns, disciplined execution and a strong financial position. Brian and I would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Stephanie Wissink of Piper Jaffray.","Stephanie S. Wissink - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Deb, a question for you. Just step back and talk a little bit about the margin structure of the business as we look out into 2014, given that you have a heavier slate of partner brands. Could you just help us understand the dynamics between the gross and operating margins?","Deborah M. Thomas","Certainly. As we stated in the past, Steph, we get a higher gross margin, which we define as just net sales plus cost of sales as we look at it, when we're in a heavily entertainment-driven year. With that, we also have a slightly higher royalty expense. All that being said, we said earlier this year, we expect to have margins this year similar to last year and the gross margin standpoint. So net with the higher royalty expense next year and a higher gross margin next year, we expect to have operating profit margins in similar ranges.","Brian D. Goldner","In addition, Stephanie, if you look at the long term over '14, '15, beyond, obviously as we grow our Entertainment and Licensing business, that's categories at our company that have high gross margins and high operating profit margin. And of course, as we continue to grow our International business, and particularly our emerging market business, where we've made investments, as we drive more revenues in those areas, we're able to spread the cost over far more revenue and driving up the operating profit over time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jaime Katz of Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Can you guys talk a little bit more about the Games category and how you feel you've been making progress and where you sort of think that could go over the next year or 2?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, we are adding a lot of new initiatives to Games. We're very happy with several of the new initiatives that have launched in the second and third quarter this year and continue to launch in the fourth quarter. As you know, Games are back-half and certainly fourth-quarter oriented. The early launch of TELEPODS in that platform is quite strong and we feel very good about the continued focus on Monopoly. We have great, new innovation across a number of consumer categories, including our Girls, Games business. We've also done and made some great strides in innovating around price points and ensuring that we have classic games out at great price points that allow for very strong consumption around the holiday periods as well. And of course, we're also getting great growth from Magic: The Gathering and continue to invest in the online component. We've talked about marrying up the digital and analog experiences across brands. You're seeing that in Magic, you're seeing that in TELEPODS and you're also seeing it across brands as classic as Monopoly and others, where you're getting both the online, smartphone, mobile opportunities to game, as well as playing face-to-face on a board game or off the board games. So I think our team is really focused on looking at innovation across all the different play spaces. And we feel very good about our long-term prospects in the game business.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then can you just comment on Latin America? I know your competitor was a little bit -- had a little bit slower growth than you guys had there. Was there something in particular that you saw was really moving down there or resonating with consumers?","Brian D. Goldner","Our team down there is doing a tremendous job, both across South America, as well as in Mexico. We're seeing good gains in POS, where we have the data. We're seeing good gains in our own proprietary data around sell-in and sell-through. Our brands are resonating down there, lots of innovative promotion. We also have our programming on the air throughout the region in several markets, My Little Pony, Transformers Rescue Bots and Transformers Prime. So we are delivering the full blueprint to those regions and the results are speaking for themselves.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. On the POS, Brian, you're alluding to it here. But any additional color that you can give in the International markets? I know, again, the data is not the best, like you have in Western Europe and North America, but any additional colors by geography? And then, Brian or Deb, whoever wants to comment on it, your channel inventories are down in the U.S., you said, and especially at your big 4 retailers. Can you give us a little bit of direction of how much your POS was down and are your channel inventories a little bit more or less in line with that?","Brian D. Goldner","Okay. So let me start with some of the markets around the world. We're seeing very strong growth, as you know, 22% growth in emerging markets. That includes very strong growth at that trend or above in places like Russia, as well as in China and Brazil. We're seeing very good growth in France, in Germany, Iberia, Norway, Italy, a number of European territories, as well as in Turkey. So we're getting very good growth in a number of places. And obviously, our brands are taking hold in the third and the fourth quarter as we get into the holidays. As we look at POS really, Tim, it's a focus on the decline in Boys. We're seeing increases in Games, Girls and Preschool year-to-date. And again, I think that where we have that data, we're particularly focused on giving you data from the U.S., where we have that data. Our inventories in the U.S. are down mid-teens overall in the U.S. Inventory has grown in concert with growth that you're seeing in revenues. So our inventories have lined up very well around the world, more inventory in Latin America and Asia-Pacific to support the growth in those businesses, more inventory in Russia and Brazil and China versus year ago, again, to support the growth in those businesses. And the U.S. business, appropriately, inventories are down. We have a really good quality of inventory, with lots of our new initiatives shipping late in the third quarter and into this fourth quarter.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So Brian, you said inventories in the U.S. are down 15% collectively?","Brian D. Goldner","Just mid-teens.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And your comment on your POS there?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. The comment on the POS is if you look at year-to-date Games, Girls and Preschool, POS is up. Boys is down, and that's really what's driving our overall POS decline.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mike Swartz of SunTrust.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to touch on gross margin. That came in much better than I think many had anticipated. And I just kind of wanted to walk through that. What were the major drivers? Could you maybe give us some more qualitative commentary around that?","Deborah M. Thomas","Well, certainly. As we mentioned, we have our -- we had planned to have gross margins similar to last year. We talked about at the end of 2012, we expected to be able to maintain gross margins certainly at the level that they were at. So what you're seeing is actually a balance of pricing that was taken on carryover goods offsetting any increase in costs that we've incurred on those carryover goods, sufficient pricing on our new product, as well as getting the efficiencies of changing our U.S. business structure to give less incentive to retailers to take goods early and putting that more on the marketing and advertising line to our consumers. But you're also seeing efficiencies coming from our manufacturing business. So as we started our cost savings initiative, we said we'd start to realize some of the benefits this year, but we wouldn't realize 100% of our $100 million cost savings until 2015. But we're starting to see some of those manufacturing efficiencies come through in line. And you're starting to see some of the increased benefit of the growth in our Magic: The Gathering business, which is a higher-margin business as well.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Great. I guess, just of the -- to maybe put it in easy terms, in the 200 basis point expansion year-over-year, I mean, was half of it kind of mix and the rest was kind of efficiencies in pricing? Is that the way to look at it? Or is there any way you can...","Deborah M. Thomas","I would say, I mean, certainly less of it is pricing, more of it is mix. And to a lesser extent, you're starting to see the efficiencies come through.","Brian D. Goldner","As we continue to pare back the number of SKUs but focusing on the SKU that matter the most, the franchise brands being up very strong in the teens, more of our business coming from our top 10 and top 15 brands, albeit with lots of new innovation and lots of SKUs and R&D around those brands, it allows us to focus in but also to reduce SKUs overall by focusing less on those tertiary SKUs we used to and therefore, getting efficiencies in development as well as manufacturing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sean McGowan with Needham.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions related to product, if I can. In Preschool, I think with Elmo so strong, I was a little surprised to see that not doing better. And you did flag the Tonka outsourcing. Is there anything else that's declining in Preschool that would account for that?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. Actually, Sean, it's a good question. If you were to take out the Tonka decline or the transfer of Tonka from being our brand with revenues to royalty income, Preschool would have been up in the quarter.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Up. That's very helpful. Okay.","Brian D. Goldner","So I think that, that's a very simple way to look at it. And that's particularly focused, as you look at Preschool business, has continued to perform well globally. Obviously, Tonka is a little more oriented towards the U.S. historically and, therefore, has a bit more impact on the U.S. and Canada segment than our overall business.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And when did Funrise take over the bigger Tonka stuff? Is that just lately?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, it's a deal that was memorialized, I want to say, maybe around a year ago. But obviously, it takes several quarters to transition. And I think you're seeing this quarter really the first major impact as you get into the holidays between royalty income versus revenue.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And how much was Magic up in the quarter year-over-year? You've been talking -- well, the last several quarters, you've talked about it being up over 20% or 25%.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. It's up 30%.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Over 30%, okay. And what's driving -- can you be more specific on what's driving that Entertainment and Licensing revenue in the quarter?","Brian D. Goldner","You're getting -- you continue to get, obviously, licensing income. You're getting payments for entertainment as we place those shows around the world. We have a bit of a contribution from Backflip in that category this quarter for the first time. Obviously, the cost of Backflip is a bit dilutive to the operating return, which you see is why in part the operating profit in that category declined in the quarter. But overall, we are -- long-term trend there is to grow Entertainment and Licensing through all the different income streams that we have there, which include licensing income, digital gaming income, Backflip and then television, and as well as our film participation.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And remind us -- a couple of housekeeping kind of things. Remind us, is that Backflip going to stay in the E&L category and for the foreseeable future? I mean, it's games, but...","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, it will. It will be counted in Entertainment and Licensing.","Deborah M. Thomas","It will be in the Entertainment and Licensing segment. But you're correct, Sean, that the revenue will be in the Games category.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Right, okay. And then just to clarify, you did say that Transformers and Star Wars revenue were up in the quarter?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. Transformers was up very nicely in the quarter, obviously very focused on our business around television support. And the initiatives around TV have really done what we said they would do, which is to drive our business. And we also have a great Generations product that serves our collector audience. But we are seeing the impact of TV and TV support globally content streamed for not only Transformers but also for, of course, My Little Pony and My Little Pony Equestria Girls. So again, really working for us. And then in Star Wars, that has mostly to do with some really innovative products the team put together that -- particularly something like the Black Series, which I don't know if you've seen or are familiar with, but really serving our collector fan base. And they've responded very strongly to those products.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Brian, a couple of questions on Magic: The Gathering. Can you remind us what the retail strategy is here? Give us an update. We're starting to see more product at the majors. And remind us again what the seasonal nature of Magic is. I think you mentioned earlier that Games are very heavy in the fourth quarter. Is the same true for Magic?","Brian D. Goldner","No. So let's start with the quarter. Magic is much more release-driven, so it's much more like immersive games in other categories. If the team has introduced a new release, meaning a new array of cards around a new theme and additional characters or spells, that really is what drives the brand. The brand tends to be more flat by quarter. Obviously, based on the success of a new release, the team is just launching a release called Theros, and obviously off to a very good start relative to Ravnica, which was a year ago. And that's the kind of thing that drives that business much more so than seasonality. As the brand expands, you will see more of the brand at mass retail, but still the vast preponderance of the brand is still where we don't count POS and we don't have NPD data because, again, the hobby shop -- census of hobby shops and hobby shop playing has increased as well during this period. So effectively, we're still roughly 80% of the business, not counted within any of our data, albeit on an expanding pie.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay, very helpful. And, Brian, just want to go back to -- Tim asked a question on point-of-sale. And I think you suggested that Games, Girls and Preschool were up year-to-date; Boys, down year-to-date. Is the same true in the quarter? And are you willing to quantify what that was in the quarter?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. So Girls and Preschool were up in the quarter. Games was flat, actually up very slightly in the quarter. And Girls and Preschool were up. Boys was down consistent with year-to-date. And again, I think what we're seeing is that's for Games, particularly non-Magic games, we know that they're more fourth-quarter loaded. And we can see the early takeaway for our new Games initiatives. We also had a new launch of Monopoly that happened a bit earlier, with Monopoly Empire happening earlier on. So again, I think for Games in terms of POS, it's a matter of that typical timing where you have new initiatives shipping in and POS that's in arrears. But overall, what we're seeing is very heartening in our Games, Girls and Preschool business.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. One last question. Deb, can you remind us what was paid in the third quarter in terms of royalties and what remains in 2013 as far as what you're paying to Disney?","Deborah M. Thomas","Well, we've paid all that we're going to pay so far this year. And let me just pull that number out, Drew, and let you know what that one is.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Is the $25 million payment to the Hub, does that flow in the fourth quarter? Or has that already been paid?","Deborah M. Thomas","That payment is scheduled in November.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay.","Deborah M. Thomas","So over the trailing 12 months, we've paid $165 million to Disney. But that does include some of the payments that were scheduled for the -- under the older contract existing for the release of Iron Man and Wolverine.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When you talk to your retail customers across the globe, are there other differences in terms of how they're approaching the holiday so far in terms of the U.S. versus International?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, I think the approach the retailers are taking the holiday has everything to do with consumer perceptions of the market, consumer incomes, disposable income, economic growth. And of course, the introduction of a lot of our new brands and new initiatives to markets also has a bearing. So I would say consumer sentiment is somewhat in line with our results in that obviously in emerging markets, the emergence of the middle class, people enjoying brands, people enjoying brands now across multiple platforms and the fact that Hasbro is delivering our brand across all our different platforms consistent with the blueprint strategy is really working for us. And then by region, we're seeing enthusiasm in Latin America, in major areas of Europe, particularly in Russia and Turkey and Eastern Europe, as well as in Asia-Pacific. The 2 toughest areas around the world, I would say, from a consumer sentiment standpoint, continue to be Australia and the U.S. And we have worked through that with great, new innovative product. That's why we're seeing great growth in several of our categories and great consumer takeaway and enthusiasm for several of our categories. But we have also recognized that we are operating in a more challenging environment and particularly in those 2 areas.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So do you think inventory levels being down mid-teens is being appropriately positioned into the holiday in the U.S.? Or do you think that you're a little bit on the lower side? And if you are, is your -- would you like to go into next year with a much lower inventory level, which will help your gross margins? You need to discount less, promotions less than in first half of 2014 and it helps your sell-in as well?","Brian D. Goldner","If you look at the U.S. business, this has really been a long-term strategy that we've activated. And I won't go back through every detail. But we all know that we've -- and the team has adopted a great new strategy that was about more just-in-time inventory, reducing overall inventory levels, following those brands that were selling the best, working with our retail partners to get more promotion and more impact at retail for the brands that matter the most. And we're seeing that being born out in inventory levels declining on average over time. We feel very strongly that we have the right inventory now going into the market in the third and fourth quarter. We have a lot of new initiatives that have begun to ship that we've highlighted but also some additional new games that come into the fourth quarter. So we feel very good that we have the opportunity to have a great holiday season, recognizing that the backdrop is a more challenging consumer environment. But Hasbro will get more than its fair share of the holiday season because we have the innovation, the content and the strategy that is resonating with consumers.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Ivan Holman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Ivan sitting in for Michael. I was hoping that given solid results in Girls internationally, you could give us a little bit of color on the order of magnitude that came from Furby.","Brian D. Goldner","Well, Furby is one of the drivers of the increase in our business year-on-year as is My Little Pony, the Pony business itself, call it, the core Pony business. The introduction of My Little Pony Equestria Girls is obviously contributing to our business. Easy-Bake has seen very strong gains year-on-year with the new Easy-Bake Oven, as well as the black and silver Easy-Bake Oven for everyone. So we're seeing great growth and strength across our Girls business across a number of known and new initiatives. And certainly, that's all been helpful. The other major launch there has been, of course, in the Nerf Rebelle line has been very, very positive and off to a very strong start. So, that all -- those all contributed to the quarter's result.","Ivan Holman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And with regards to Wizards, it seems that the growth continues at a strong clip, 30% plus. But can you give us a little bit of color around visibility going into 2014? What are the drivers here that specifically could help maintain that momentum into the year?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, a couple of things that we've done throughout this year, and we've talked about it, we continue to invest, to build the capability of Magic Online. And that's really about allowing for more simultaneous play experiences. As you know, we allow -- give players the opportunity to play a great distance from one another and play in that virtual online space. We want to be able to host more gaming sessions. And that's what the team is working on, to expand the ability to host more simultaneous gaming sessions. That allows for people who have been more latent or lapsed users to get back into the brand. And then, of course, the team is also working on the analog business globally, which allows for lots of play sessions face-to-face in people's hometowns around the world, at hobby shops, tournaments that allow people to play more competitively. So there's an array of really hands-on, as well as virtual experiences, that we're developing for that brand. In many ways, Magic was the early indication for us how we're going to execute our Games business going forward and allowing people to play Magic in any form or format they want anytime and anywhere. And we're really delivering that. So I think as you go into '14, the ability to expand the simultaneous gaming sessions plus the continuation of great gaming releases and other elements within the blueprint are all beneficial to that brand over time. And we've seen that brand more than double in size over the last few years. And we feel the team still has great growth in its sights.","Ivan Holman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then maybe, Deb, one quick question on the cost side of things. It looks like SG&A is still running in a high-single-digit type of number despite all the cost cutting and the layoffs earlier in the year. We understand that the targets are $100 million, which, I guess, in 2015, may be closer to $50 million on a net basis. But given these investments, is there maybe potential for a year where SG&A would be flat or down? Or should we continue to expect it to grow at this pace?","Deborah M. Thomas","Well, as we said, we always expected to have some level of inflation within those numbers. And what you're seeing we tried to point out in September that you're getting -- you're seeing compensation expense increase in that line item, as well as depreciation. You've got the acquisition of Backflip, so those expenses are going to go in as a dollar amount now. And our cost savings are also spread throughout the P&L in cost of sales, product development, in advertising area, as well as SD&A. So while we expect to and are still on target to hit our $100 million of cost savings by 2015, they're not all going to come in that line item and you do just have some offsetting expenses in that line item as well.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Greg Hessler of Bank of America.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Question was on the balance sheet. I think you guys, you have a note that's maturing in early 2014. On the last earnings call, you indicated that you were looking at your plans for that. Do have any updated plans for that? Just given the interest rate environment, do you think you'll come to market sooner rather than later to refinance that?","Deborah M. Thomas","Well, our expectation, we said on our last earnings call and at our Investor Day, and I'll say again, and you're right, given the current environment, our expectation is that we'll refinance all -- most, if not all of that. So we are getting closer to that date as we speak.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And as you think about refinancing that, are you looking at shorter-term debt or longer-term? How should we be thinking about the tenor of that refinancing?","Deborah M. Thomas","Well, I think it's really a mix as we look at our long-term capital deployment plans, what best fits into that plan.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Brian, just to understand a little bit more about the successes that you're seeing internationally. I know that there's not POS data for a lot of the International regions. But for the ones that you do have it in, can you give us some color there?","Brian D. Goldner","So we've seen, again, great POS gains where we have it, in the 3 categories where we've seen growth. And I've indicated, obviously, the Boys business, POS has been down. Boys' POS is really not down as far internationally as it had been domestically. And again, the 2 biggest brands driving the Boys comps lower year-on-year have been 2 initiatives within Marvel and Beyblade. Beyblade has had more of an impact and does have more of an impact year-over-year on the International markets. Marvel has had more of an impact year-over-year in the North American business, U.S. and Canada segment, just owing to its historical strengths and the fact that the International markets had some additional strength in Marvel more recently. And again, we are seeing very good growth within Boys in things like Transformers and in Star Wars, and then across Girls, Games and Preschool.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just to kind of move to the next question. You had said in an earlier question -- I mean, you gave us -- you've given us several times the data, and you just gave it again, the point of sales in Girls, Games and Preschool. And you said that, I think, in -- you were seeing early takeaways from Games even though the POS is in arrears to the ship-in. Is that the same as Girls and Preschool?","Brian D. Goldner","Exactly, same. You have new initiatives. And a good example, Equestria Girls is shipping into the -- in time for the fourth quarter. Obviously, you're not capturing all the current POS data. We're not reporting that because it's outside of the quarter. But obviously, it was early days in the third quarter but more significant in the fourth quarter for the ship-in versus the POS, as one example of many of those new initiatives. But we're trying to give you some indication that the early days of those shipping -- of those products shipping in, the takeaways is very good.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, and actually, that was a great segue because my next question was on Equestria Girls, believe it or not. And you said that it seems the retail takeaway there, the early retail takeaway is positive. Can you talk a little bit about maybe what your My Little Pony shelf space looks like and if you think you're kind of winning some share from other competing areas?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, I think as you look overall at retail, what we're really seeing is that our retail shelf space is expanding behind several categories for the company, both in in-aisle as well as out of aisle and promotional space. So for Girls in Furby, Nerf Rebelle, My Little Pony, in Preschool with Play-Doh and Transformers Rescue Bots, obviously across Sesame Street and across Games, I think our shelf space has expanded very commensurate with the new initiatives that we partnered with retailers to present to consumers. That's true globally in combination with licensed products for several of those brands, where we have great content and licensees providing products in several categories. And they're doing that around the world as well. And as you would imagine, Boys year-on-year is down.","Operator","Our final question is coming from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","First, on program production amortization, you've talked about it briefly. But can you give us a more detailed explanation on why it's going up? And is there something -- is this something we should expect going forward?","Deborah M. Thomas","Gerrick, no, it really has to do with what were the programs that were delivered in the quarter. As we said in the past when we deliver certain types of programming, it makes the amortization a bit higher. And we just happen to deliver more, in particular, game shows this quarter. And that's what was really driving it. Overall, we still expect our full year program production amortization to be kind of in line with the cash that we spend on a full year basis, that like $50 million to $60 million.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And one more question. On the brand outsource or out-licensing program, Tonka and Tinkertoy and stuff like that, can you just tell us what brands are outsourced or licensed now that weren't last year? Because it does have a lot of impact on all different metrics, like sales, gross margin, inventory, et cetera.","Brian D. Goldner","I think that both Lincoln Logs and Tinkertoys were outsourced last year, as well as this year. The one new brand that's outsourced as of this year, and particularly hits in the third and fourth quarter of this year as compared to a year ago, is Tonka. So I don't think that there's a -- is an exhaustive list. I think go-forward, we may have 1 or 2 other brands that we've identified, but they've not yet impacted our revenues. But it's not an exhaustive list but a focused, strategic list, where we think we have the right partners.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great. And maybe one more. Magic, one concern out there is the natural cycle of toys, what goes back, comes down. But Magic is played by a different person, a different player, slightly older. Are there differences in how that cyclicality is in toys and games for an older player as compared to a younger one? Do you have studies on that? How long do you think we could see a growth trend in Magic perpetuating itself?","Brian D. Goldner","Look, I think our team at Wizards of the Coast has done a very good job of continuing to bring great, new innovation, characters and, frankly, great storytelling to that brand. And they've done that across multiple different platforms. I think they're spending a lot of time listening to the player, listening to that audience. You're right, it is not a brand that's really in the toy space. It's a brand that is played by an older audience. And I think the team has really reflected that in their thought process of why we've invested in our online capabilities for more simultaneous play sessions globally. And the effort that we're making around the world to bring Magic: The Gathering face-to-face games to consumers in many areas is really just beginning. And so I think that it's more about the storytelling, the game play, the richness of the immersive content, which is emblematic of our overall blueprint strategy. And they've led the charge for the last couple of years. And you now see the rest of the Games business catching up to what they began.","Operator","I would now like to turn the floor back over to Debbie Hancock for closing comments.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you to everyone for joining the call today.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Debbie Hancock, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Debbie Hancock - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning are Brian Goldner, Hasbro's President and Chief executive officer; and Deb Thomas, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer. Today, we will begin with Brian and Deb providing commentary on the company's performance and then we will take your questions.","Our first quarter earnings release was issued this morning and is available on our website. Additionally, presentation slides containing information covered in today's earnings release and call are also available on our site. The press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that whenever we discuss earnings per share or EPS, we are referring to earnings per diluted share.","Today's discussion of net earnings and EPS will exclude from last year's first quarter results a favorable tax adjustment of $13.5 million or $0.10 per share as it does not speak to the underlying performance of Hasbro. We have included a reconciliation to reported amounts in the earnings release and presentation accompanying this call.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management's expectations, goals, objectives, and similar matters. These forward-looking statements may include comments concerning our product and entertainment plans, anticipated product performance, business opportunities, plans and strategies, the potential impact of foreign exchange translation, costs, our financial goals, and expectations for our future financial performance.","There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. Some of those factors are set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our most recent 10-Q, and today's press release and in our other public disclosures. You should review such factors together with any forward-looking statements made on today's call. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.","I would now like to introduce Brian Goldner. Brian?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The momentum with which we exited 2014 has carried forward into 2015, delivering a strong first quarter and a good start to the year.","First quarter revenues grew 5%, operating profit increased 25%, and our adjusted net earnings were up 43%. Our focus on Hasbro Franchise Brands continued to drive our performance as each of these seven brands increased year-over-year and delivered in total 20% revenue growth.","We also drove strong underlying demand across geographic regions. The U.S. and Canada segment grew revenues 2%. And absent the negative $61 million impact of foreign exchange, the International segment grew 20%, including revenue gains in each geographic region. Additionally, as reported, emerging market revenues increased 3%, but absent the negative impact of foreign exchange, they increased approximately 25%","Our focus on creating the world's best play experiences is building strong demand for Hasbro brands and our partner brands around the world. Point-of-sale was positive in every major market we track, including the U.S., Canada, UK, Germany and Australia. For the first quarter, Boys category revenues grew 10%, Games increased 7%, and Preschool gained 22%. The Girls category revenues declined 16%. As we outlined previously, this decline was primarily the result of challenging comparisons in FURBY, which will remain difficult throughout the year.","Each of our Franchise Brands grew, as did several entertainment-led brands, including MARVEL in support of the first quarter on-shelf date for The Avengers: Age of Ultron product and initial shipments of JURASSIC WORLD. While we are pleased with these favorable trends and strong momentum in our business, there are several additional factors unique to the first quarter. These elements combined with the fact that the first quarter is our smallest revenue quarter of the year had a very positive impact on our results. At 8% of our total quarterly revenues, our Entertainment and Licensing segment represented a greater-than-normal percentage of our total revenue mix.","First quarter licensing revenue is in part the payment of royalties based on fourth quarter holiday sales. Also within the Entertainment and Licensing segment were higher programming revenues associated with a multi-year digital streaming deal for Hasbro Studios programs. This revenue is recorded when we deliver the programming and reflects several seasons of shows. You may recall in 2012 we discussed with you a similar benefit.","The growth in our Entertainment and Licensing segment was combined with a strong quarter for Franchise Brands, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING, leading to a very favorable revenue mix in respect to profitability. MAGIC: THE GATHERING continues to engage its fans around the world. In the first quarter, it benefited from the earlier release date of the third release in the Khans block versus the third release of the Theros block, which occurred in the second quarter of last year. Additionally, favorable foreign exchange product cost hedges aided our profitability for the quarter. Each of these factors helped offset the negative impact of foreign exchange to our earnings, which will continue to be a challenge throughout 2015.","As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, there are several additional factors to consider. First, the benefit from Easter was almost entirely in the first quarter of this year, whereas in 2014, it was two weeks later in the month of April. Additionally, 2014 had two very significant motion pictures in the summer months: Transformers: Age of Extinction and The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Both of these films benefited from shipments in the first half of the year.","In 2015, there's a tremendous film slate we are supporting, headlined by The Avengers: Age of Ultron in theaters May 1 and Star Wars: The Force Awakens on December 18. These release dates are spread across a greater period of time versus last year's concentrated timing of summer releases. There are also several other notable films this year, including Jurassic World on June 12, Ant-Man on July 17, and our own Jem and the Holograms on October 23.","Our first quarter performance reinforces that our strategy and our approach to brand building is working. For the full year, our teams are delivering innovative brands and executing against a robust entertainment slate, while facing a difficult foreign exchange environment. As we continue to invest around our brand blueprint, beginning with consumer insights to develop the right innovation and storytelling to engage the consumer across all forms and formats, the Hasbro team is delivering truly differentiated and compelling play experiences for consumers around the world.","I'd like to now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter was a good quarter highlighted by the strength of our business across brands and geographies. The momentum in our Franchise Brands, coupled with the growth in our Entertainment and Licensing segment, delivered both revenue and profitability improvements for the quarter.","While foreign exchange had a significant impact on revenues, the favorable revenue mix and our efforts to hedge our exposure limited its impact on profitability. This momentum in our business and our improved profitability enabled us to generate $315 million of operating cash flow. Our balance sheet is healthy and we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash. We continued to invest in our business to strengthen our brands and improve the productivity of our global teams. We also remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter, we returned approximately $79 million through our dividend and buyback programs.","Looking at our segments for the first quarter, revenue in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 2%. Growth in the Boys, Games and Preschool categories more than offset a decline in the Girls category. This growth was driven by higher revenues in our Franchise Brands as well as growth in MARVEL in support of The Avengers: Age of Ultron and initial shipments of JURASSIC WORLD. Point-of-sale is off to a positive start in 2015, including strong growth in Franchise Brands. Our retail inventory continues to be of both good quality and good levels. Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 16%, reflecting the favorable impact of higher Franchise Brand revenues.","In the International segment, revenues were flat with last year. Europe was down 6%, but was offset by 8% growth in Latin America and 17% in Asia Pacific. Emerging market revenues increased 3%. The Boys and Preschool category revenues grew, but were offset by a decline in the Games and Girls categories. As in the U.S. and Canada segments, strong growth in Hasbro Franchise Brands was further supported by growth in MARVEL products.","Absent the impact of foreign exchange, International segment revenues grew 20% and emerging markets grew approximately 25%. 80% or $50 million of the foreign exchange impact to revenues was in Europe. Absent FX, Europe grew 19% and Latin America and Asia Pacific each grew 23%. Operating profit in the International segment declined $511,000, reflecting the negative impact of foreign exchange. Absent this impact, operating profit increased to $5.5 million compared with $2.4 million a year ago.","Finally, revenues grew 74% in the Entertainment and Licensing segment. This strong performance was the result of growth in lifestyle licensing revenues for Hasbro Franchise Brands, notably MY LITTLE PONY and TRANSFORMERS as well as the contribution of a multi-year digital streaming deal for Hasbro Studios programming. These increased revenues drove a $10.4 million increase in the Entertainment and Licensing segment operating profit.","Looking at Hasbro overall, in February, I shared with you our outlook for cost and expenses for the full year 2015 using our underlying historical results as a basis for comparison. We've included the slide from Toy Fair in the presentation accompanying today's call, which is available on our website. Keeping in mind that the first quarter is our smallest revenue quarter of the year and small changes have a bigger impact on the quarter than they would on an annual basis, our first quarter results keep us on track to achieve the previously-stated targets.","Overall in the first quarter, strong revenue growth in higher margin brands and segments, namely, Franchise Brands including MAGIC: THE GATHERING and the Entertainment and Licensing segment more than offset the negative impact of foreign currency translation. This favorable mix resulted in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreasing to 34.7% versus 38.1% in 2014. For the full year, we continue to target cost of sales as a percentage of revenue approximately in line with 2014's level of 39.7%.","With the growth in entertainment-backed revenues, in particular, MARVEL and JURASSIC WORLD, royalty expense increased to 8.3% of revenues. Given the lower level of revenues in the first quarter, this percentage is higher than our full-year outlook for royalties, which, given the strong entertainment slate in 2015, remains in line with last year's rate of 7.2%.","Product development increased in the quarter to 7.3% of revenues as we're investing in the development of the Disney Princess and Frozen properties, which will come to market in 2016 as well as incremental investments in our brands, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING. Our full-year expectation is that product development will be in the range of 5% to 5.5% of revenues.","Advertising in the first quarter remained at similar dollar levels year-over-year, but declined slightly as a percent of revenue to 9.5%. For the full year, we anticipate advertising at approximately 10% of revenues, which is the low-end of our traditional advertising range and reflects our continued investment in brand building, coupled with the efficiencies we're gaining from our global and increasingly digital advertising model.","Intangible amortization declined in the quarter and is anticipated to be approximately $44 million for 2015. Program production cost amortization increased, reflecting the higher revenues and associated amortization from the multi-year digital streaming deal for Hasbro Studios programming. Our full-year expectation is this expense as a percentage of revenues remains in line with recent years.","SG&A increased 7% in the quarter to 29.3% of revenues. Higher equity compensation and depreciation associated with systems contributed to the increase as we continued investment in our business, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING. These increases were partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. In total, for the year, we believe these trends will continue and that SG&A will be higher versus 2014's level of 20.8%","Turning to results below operating profit, other income for the quarter was $4.7 million compared to $5 million in 2014. Profitability improvements in our 40% share of the operating income from the Discovery Family Channel were partially offset by higher losses from foreign exchange.","The first quarter underlying tax rate was 27% versus 26.1% in 2014. We expect our full-year underlying tax rate to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%, reflecting continued higher anticipated earnings in the U.S. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.21 versus the adjusted earnings per share of $0.14 in 2014.","We returned $78.7 million to shareholders in the quarter, $53.5 million in dividends, and $25.2 million in share repurchases. Our next quarterly dividend is our first at the new rate of $0.46 per share and is payable on May 15 to shareholders of record on May 1. Additionally, at quarter-end, $539 million remained available on our current share repurchase authorizations.","Receivables at quarter-end were up 2% and DSOs were 71 days, down two days versus last year. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, receivables increased approximately 18% versus the 14% growth in revenues. Inventory declined $50.2 million compared to last year and is of good quality. Adjusting for a negative foreign exchange impact, inventory increased 1%. Excluding FX, inventory increased in the International segment, which was mostly offset by lower inventory in the U.S. and Canada segment.","In closing, the first quarter was a good start to 2015 and keeps us on track with our full-year expectations. Foreign exchange will continue to be a challenge throughout the year, but we are taking steps to minimize some of this impact through pricing and product cost hedges. Over the next several quarters, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the positive momentum in our brands, the innovation we're delivering and a robust entertainment slate.","Brian and I are now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your questions.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and congrats to you guys on a great quarter.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Steph.","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Steph.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Wanted to just ask one question with respect to your global positioning as we head into the back part of this year. Can you talk a little bit about your distribution in some of the emerging markets and some of, maybe, the mature markets that have been a little bit more sluggish? Is it your anticipation as some of the content-backed properties come through that you'll start to see those markets accelerate into the back part of the year?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we've seen year-to-date that our POS is quite strong in many of our markets around the world, including where we have our own data for emerging markets. So good performance thus far for our brands. Around the world, in the first quarter, double-digit POS growth for every market that we track with only one exception where France was up mid-single-digit. But across the world, we're seeing very strong double-digit growth in POS. Similarly, in emerging markets, we continue to see good progress, obviously affected by forex in terms of absolute top line revenue growth. Absent forex, 25% revenue growth in emerging markets in the first quarter.","We've seen both in our brands growth as well as Entertainment and Licensing that the storytelling within our brands and television, in particular, has helped to power brands like MY LITTLE PONY and TRANSFORMERS. Certainly, this is a very robust movie year for us, an entertainment-led year. We see that entertainment slate coming throughout the year. It's a little more spread out than in years prior with Star Wars coming later in the year. But clearly, over time, we are seeing the expansion of entertainment-led brands, particularly in our partnership with The Walt Disney Company being more globally-led with greater strength in distribution, more screens available \u2013 movie screens available for movie goers to enjoy those films, certainly more global box office, and therefore, we would surmise greater toy sales over time.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","That's great. Thank you. And, Deb, just a clarification question on the digital distribution agreement or the streaming distribution agreement that you signed. Can you just remind us how that's accounted for? You have this upfront Q1 events. And then do you receive a series of payments over the course of the coming quarters based on the consumption patterns? Just explain how that may work so we can know how to model that out.","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Well, we had a similar arrangement probably three years ago that we talked about. And what happens is we recognize the revenue when we deliver the series. So as we had this payment come in, in the first quarter and delivered most of the series that are under the agreement, we recognized most of the revenue in that period. And you also see the amortization expense going along with that. That's why we highlighted \u2013 we have a few more higher line items in the quarter than we would expect for the full year.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. Great job, you guys. Best of luck.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Steph.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Taposh Bari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning. Deb, a question for you on cost of sales and the outlook that you're providing. It seems like a repeat of what you said at Toy Fair. Yet it looks like what's changed is your signing of this streaming deal. So I guess, the question is was that already embedded in your commentary that you provided back in January?","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. And then as we think about...","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","(22:44) Taposh.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes.","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would just point that we really did benefit from our product mix in the quarter. So it was a larger mix of our Franchise Brands helped us including MAGIC: THE GATHERING as well as the digital streaming deal that we signed. And our Entertainment and Licensing segment overall is up particularly the licensing part of the business.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, Taposh, our highest margin business is Entertainment and Licensing. Within that, obviously, the licensing part of our business is the strongest operating margin. And it goes back to the idea that in our strategy, there's tremendous power. As we drive our brands with story, we're able to sign licensees who are benefiting from that storytelling globally, and we certainly benefit from having their consumer products out in the market. And we get paid for that.","Certainly for holiday sales in the first quarter, but throughout the year as we have new episodes out, television episodes and movies over time, that certainly benefits our margin. And that's what we've talked about. Over time, longer term, we would expect that to be a lever for growth and operating margin.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And I know that within the Entertainment and Licensing segment a lot of focus has been on TRANSFORMERS and MY LITTLE PONY, but a brand that seems to be on the rise within your portfolio is PLAY-DOH. There's some recent reports that have surfaced about Play-Doh movies. Wondering if you can comment on that? And as a follow-up, if you can help us better understand the size of that brand and its potential within your portfolio over time?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","PLAY-DOH was up strong double-digits this past quarter in revenues. It was up double-digits in POS. We're seeing great strength. That's true in the U.S. as well as around the world. It's becoming increasingly one of our most powerful global brands. A few years ago, we had anointed it as a Franchise Brand and elevated it from a challenger brand status and continued to put great innovation.","The team has done a very good job there. We do have a movie deal that's being consummated and some great creative stewards on that movie as an idea. We think it's a very fun format for a movie and for storytelling. We've seen some early indications of that through a television series we've been running in China. And again, the characters that we're developing around the Doh Dohs as well as other characters that could appear in a Play-Doh movie make it quite fun and certainly something for the future years that we would take advantage of.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. All the best.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mike Swartz with SunTrust Robinson. Please proceed with your question.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Just a point of clarification. Brian, I think you said that global \u2013 was that global POS was up double-digits, or in every market that you track it was up double-digits?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We track it by market. So we have the syndicated data, NPD data we have for a number of markets. And the markets we have syndicated data for \u2013 U.S. was up double-digits; Canada double-digits; Mexico, Australia, UK, Germany and Spain all double-digit growth; France was mid-single-digits. Our Franchise Brand POS in the first quarter were up \u2013 it was very strong growth. And again, indicative of the sales that we had. But our POS is ahead of our sell-in in Franchise Brands as it is in sales in many markets around the world. That's why we have syndicated data. We also have our own data in emerging markets. Our teams track that pretty carefully and we're seeing good growth there as well.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And would that have been up double-digits excluding, I guess, the Easter shift on a normalized basis?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We believe it probably would although we do think Easter had a very good impact. Easter this year occurred in, what we call, week 14. Last year it was week 16, which fell into the second quarter. Easter to Easter, if you took the three weeks around Easter, Easter to Easter was up a bit year-on-year. But we've seen very strong POS growth throughout the quarter and continuing into the second quarter. So we feel very good about the early initiatives we have for the year. Again, these are early days.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Right. Thanks. And just thinking about the competitive environment as we move through the year, one of your big competitors was talking about putting more money into trade spending as we get to the holidays and I think they're really targeting some share losses in the dolls category. So how do you think about that playing out throughout the year?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We have a very key levers in our business that we've established around where our spending goes. Increasingly in our marketing, we're using digital marketing and lots of very contemporary forms of marketing to our audience. We work with our trade very effectively. We've seen obviously growth in our business at the trade. We have plans in place as well. It doesn't involve just increases, but certainly, where we are gaining share, which is in many different categories and certainly around the world. We are getting gains in linear footage, and therefore, opportunities for both in-aisle as well as out-of-aisle placement. And that just comes along with the growth in sales.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Great. Thanks a lot for the color.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Eric Handler with MKM. Please proceed with your question.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Couple questions on the entertainment side. The upside that you saw in the quarter was that from the Netflix deal that was announced back in April? And I'm just trying to true up what \u2013 that was \u2013 that's eight months since that time, so was this sort of the payment for that deal that was upcoming? Or was there some other SVOD deal that got signed?","And secondly, are there future deliveries of product that is part of this deal, or was this purely a library type of contract? And then last, when you look at the incremental margins on your entertainment business and understanding that this is a relatively small part of the business, but it looks like the incremental margin for the incremental revenue got to about 44%. When you think about licensing is typically 70%, 80% type of margin business, the SVOD deals are again very high similar type margin because a lot of the costs have already been amortized. What were some of the costs that went against that that I may not be thinking about?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. If you look at Entertainment and Licensing segment, there are several elements within our Entertainment and Licensing business. Certainly, lifestyle licensing was up in the quarter. And that has to do with the fact that we get paid typically in arrears by a single quarter. So we account for the sales of our consumer products licensees and then we are able to take in those revenues as we get paid and recognize those revenues. So that was up in the quarter. That was obviously \u2013 contributes to the mix and contributes to the operating margin in that segment.","Certainly, we have a number of streaming deals that are happening. We have our content on any number of platforms, SVOD platforms, including Netflix, but not exclusively to Netflix. And, yes, there are payments that happen within the quarter. What happens is as we deliver the episodes, we get paid for the episodes that we're delivering. And we also have other deals in place. So some of this is library programming. And then as we go on time, we talked about the development of and launching of new brands and new brands would be launched both in linear television and over time on different SVOD platforms.","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We also mentioned, Eric, that we had \u2013 we referred back to our full-year estimates on amortization. A lot of this revenue was included in our estimates when we set up our alternates for amortizing the products. So what you continue to see is the amortization that had already been built into our revenue estimates for the full year.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Derrick Johnson (sic) [Gerrick Johnson] with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning. I was hoping you could discuss the net EPS impact on results from foreign exchange and also if you could quantify the impact in basis points on gross margin from FX, and finally the absolute dollar amount that you benefited from hedging on FX. Thank you.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So the answer to the first question is the FX impact on EPS in the quarter was $0.10. So otherwise, we would have been at $0.30 \u2013 $0.31 in the quarter. Deb, you want to talk about the other piece?","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Well, we continue to have \u2013 we had a slightly larger impact from foreign exchange obviously because of the magnitude in the quarter. You've got a fairly small revenue quarter compared to the rest of the year. So a bit higher foreign exchange impact than we would normally expect to see. And as we said, we've hedged a fair amount of our product purchases, probably about the same level as we'd hedged last year, obviously, at declining rates through this year. So what you're seeing is the benefit of favorable foreign exchange product cost hedges in the first quarter and larger than average impact.","As a matter of fact, the impact on our revenue from foreign exchange was about 9% of our total reported revenues. And if you recall, we said at Toy Fair that at rates existing at that point in time, had those rates continued through the year, our 2014 full-year revenue would have been about $250 million less. Well, in fact, the dollar's continued to strengthen. So if you looked at that impact at current rates, our revenues would have been about $310 million less.","And as the euro continues to move toward parity, if the euro actually hits parity that would probably put another $60 million to $65 million negative impact on those revenues. So for the full year, we continue to see the impact of foreign exchange will be a headwind. Because of the size of the quarter, it was slightly larger than it would typically be, but we do continue to think it would still be around that 10% to 15% impact to revenue will impact earnings per share.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Gerrick, we're obviously taking a number of steps to mitigate that impact. We've taken mid-single-digit price increases both in the U.S. and around the world and in markets where we've seen particularly high forex impact, we've gone back to take additional price increases where necessary to try to again mitigate in the short term those FX impacts.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you. And shifting gears a little bit, not much mention of LITTLE PONY in the quarter. I guess, it was up because it's a franchise brand, but can you discuss how it performed geographically between North America and international?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. MY LITTLE PONY continues to perform quite well for us globally. It certainly benefits from revenues in several different categories. It goes back to the idea of being a franchise brand, and having licensed product as well as our own toy and game product. We are gearing up for the fifth season of MY LITTLE PONY is just breaking now and will break throughout the year.","So brand-new product lineup around the fifth season that comes in second, third, and fourth quarters. But MY LITTLE PONY performed well, its POS was in the PONY business, the core PONY business was quite good for the quarter, double-digit POS increase there. And again, it's a small first quarter. And we're gearing up for the rest of the year, but MY LITTLE PONY continued to grow in the quarter.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. Thank you very much, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Research","Good morning. I guess my question is about Preschool. It seems like both you and your closest peer have turned the segment around in the last quarter or there's been something else that has been driving demand there. Can you talk a little bit about where you guys have seen strength and maybe how you think about continuing to connect with consumers in this segment for the rest of the year?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. In our Preschool segment, one of our biggest brands there is PLAY-DOH. It continues to perform incredibly well. It's one of our most global brands and a number one brand in a couple countries around the world for us. The brand was up double-digits in the quarter. The POS was up double-digits throughout the world. We continue to have all new innovations, and again, that team has done a great job of continuing to innovate that brand. This is absent even DOHVINCI, we're just talking about the core PLAY-DOH business.","The other part of the business that's performing quite well is a character-based business. That storytelling-led business is very strong. We saw good strength in TRANSFORMERS RESCUE BOTS. We got in both placement of the TV show as well as the toy sales in the quarter were quite good. We add to that initiatives around Jurassic World, which just begin to take hold now. So again, character-led business has been particularly strong and we've seen that for our business.","We have a number of new initiatives in our core PLAYSKOOL business. You saw at Toy Fair Play, Stow and Go. Early indications there good POS, albeit, early days, but POS growth there for some of the new initiatives in core Playskool. So I think it's about creating those innovations based on great consumer insights, about character-led business, and great creativity and enabling kids and moms to agree on developmental milestones and all the fun of our PLAY-DOH business, that great creativity that parents really love and kids enjoy as well.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Research","Okay. And then your advertising ratio for the year appears that it's going to be down. Are you guys finding more efficient channels to advertise in? Or is it just that the tilt to more digital is less expensive?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Advertising we've said ratably should be right around 10%. So very consistent with the year-ago numbers. But over a trend line, longer-term trend line, that's down a bit, but it won't be the same number as it was in the first quarter. It was down more than that in the first quarter. And that just has to do with the size of the quarter and revenues. But if you look at our strategies, clearly, we're employing every one of the digital strategies that are available to us. That does add a level of efficiency and effectiveness to our messaging, engaging consumers, enthusiasts and fans, and enabling them to curate our brands and get involved in their own content creation and involvement in our polling, whether it's in our Games business, or in our Preschool business is quite a enabling technology that does enable us to \u2013 allow us to more effectively advertise over time.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Research","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Congratulations, Brian, again. I know it's a small quarter. But a little additional color just to clarify, the streaming, this is more of a one-time payment, or will there be going forward a little bit starting to come in each quarter from that perspective? And I guess, in relation to that, obviously, we've got FX everybody's dealing with. But you talked about the comparables going across the year, the timing of the entertainment releases. Can you just, sort of, plot through the quarter (39:41) given FX and the timing of releases, will you have more difficult versus easy comparisons in the latter three quarters here?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think that as we look at the entertainment initiatives, what we were trying to point out is just simply that we have a very robust slate. We've said we've entered this unprecedented era of new entertainment. The company's certainly benefiting from our own entertainment as much as our partners' entertainment. In the first quarter, in percentage terms, the fastest-growing \u2013 the percentage growth was fastest for TRANSFORMERS. We have a new show that's on Cartoon Network.","This just broke in the carryover sales of our movie-related products from 2014 are quite strong in the quarter. So the combination of storytelling and movies and television benefited our own brands. As we go out through the second, third and fourth quarter, what we're trying to point out is that all of the big movie titles don't come just in the second quarter as they did a year ago that they're more spread out throughout the year. And I think that's something to think about as you map out the remainder of the year.","We're really not giving you kind of, if you will, overall annual guidance, but trying to say where those revenues may fall just to help be thoughtful around where the entertainment will really continue to drive our business. And, Tim, remind me the first part of your question?","Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. I guess, on the expense side of the comparables, given the timing and where you have hedges in your revenue and where that revenue comes from, just the comparability, how we should think about the FX? We kind of can see where the different currencies are, but there are other components we can't of FX. So that comparability, and then the first part was the digital streaming. Should we...","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Oh, okay.","Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So these \u2013 yeah. Should we think these more of just one-time payments or is there going to be a start component of where that's going to start to flow each quarter, Brian?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. The digital streaming, we mentioned that in 2012, we had done a similar digital streaming deal, that was a few years ago. We mentioned how that revenue comes in. Obviously, in Entertainment and Licensing, we also took in significantly more licensing royalty income. So it's not just digital streaming in that category. And, Deb, you want to...","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The digital streaming revenue does primarily come in one big chunk. So that's why, if you recall, Tim, I said it made things a little bit lumpy at the time. We'd say it's just a bit lumpy. But again, it's been built into our models. And that's why we've continued to say that our amortization for the full year will be consistent with last year, because obviously that number is impacted significantly.","As far as foreign exchange, you're right. I mean, the way numbers have moved and rates have moved and the dollar has strengthened, even from Toy Fair, has had an additional impact to us. If we looked at last year's revenue, it'd be about a $60 million additional negative impact to the year. And you can add another $60 million on that if the euro goes to parity. So as we watch how rates go throughout the year, it will have an impact on revenue.","Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","But no color \u2013 I remember you'd mentioned that earlier in the call, but no color given where your hedges are and then sort of the mix of your revenues throughout the year, would there be any quarters that were more challenging than the others other than just looking at where the FX is year-over-year?","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We've hedged about the same level as we did a year ago. And each month is a little bit different. Think about we have this rolling hedging program, as a matter of fact, after year-end, we'd had even put in more hedges to go out through 2019. So, you think about as you layer those hedges on at different times, they're at different rates, and you get different flow-through of positive impact to the gross margin. For us, we've always said we don't speculate, we do it really to protect our product pricing. So we know what we have to price our products at in the various markets over time.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And, Tim, as we go out beyond 2015 into 2016 and beyond, you know we go out and price product based on the prevailing elements of the marketplace. And given so much of our line is new every year, it gives us a chance to look at what the cost inputs can and should be, what the pricing should look like. And therefore, this year it's about the fact that FX changes were so significant across countries and so fast in terms of the change back in the fourth quarter of last year.","So this year we have to mitigate those changes, taking steps wherever we can on pricing and looking at our costs. But as we go out in the future years, we've taken that into account and begun to address that so that we can look at that in our cost of goods and into our product development as well as product pricing.","Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And final question. You've done a great job starting several years ago of seeding your content and brands into many international markets and now with the expanded Disney relationship and going direct also from a distribution standpoint, where do you see other markets where you need to go direct and the plans to do that there? Any additional opportunities over the next \u2013 through this year or into next year?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're continuing to develop our product along a number of different lines. We've said our first objective was to create the right balance of our Franchise Brands, Franchise Brand effort and Franchise Brand growth. We've then developed adjacencies that you've seen enter the market quite successfully around those Franchise Brands. And the next phase of our development you'll see over the next number of years some new brands that we will now take this blueprint and the model we've created and begin to introduce some of the new brands. Some of those are from our vault like Jem and the Holograms. Some will be absolutely new to us. A few are based on some historical acquisitions we made, like Micronauts, but that becomes part of the mix as we go out over the next several years.","Then in addition to that, we've talked about how in partnering with The Walt Disney Company, we have the opportunity to take advantage of their amazing slate of entertainment that's upcoming, as well as in future years the Princess business that we're very excited about. And it continues to allow us to balance our revenues where our partner brands revenues should be plus or minus 20% of our revenues, a couple points higher or lower in some individual years. But that balance enables us to continue to generate the kind of operating returns we're looking for as a company.","Deborah M. Thomas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And we still see opportunity in the various emerging markets that we're in now to continue to expand our market share and for growth as those markets grow as well. And outside of that, I mean, we talked about some other markets, we specifically spoke at Toy Fair about some growth in Indonesia and some Asia markets as we go forward. But nothing certainly of the size in investment that we've had in places like Russia or Brazil where they're just very large countries.","Tim A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you both.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with our question.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So on the Girls business, Brian, you mentioned FURBY as being a headwind. When does that stop becoming a headwind? And then does that prohibit you guys from growing the Girls business in 2015?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","For the full year, we have some amazing initiatives and new innovations across our Girls business. And if you look at MY LITTLE PONY, there's a brand-new product lineup as well as a whole new TV series we're hitting. This is season number five and a brand-new series that we've developed for MY LITTLE PONY. LITTLEST PET SHOP is seeing great growth in the quarter and really just beginning to build on the momentum that we said we would create based on all-new TV series and getting that entertainment out around the world.","For the second half of the year, of course, we add Disney Descendants and very excited about the new entertainment initiative from Disney and our lineup there. So I'm not going to really guide you on overall Girls growth. The last two years we've grown the Girls business and both years have been north of $1 billion. FURBY was a big brand for us. And last year, it continued to be a big brand as it moved through non-English speaking market. And it will continue to be a headwind throughout the year. But having said that, the teams are lining up some great product and storytelling initiatives for our own Franchise Brands and lots of new news within our challenger brands for the third and fourth quarter.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Okay. And I apologize if I missed this. Did you quantify growth for MAGIC in the quarter? And could you also comment on what you've seen in the channel in terms of receptivity to the new format or cadence of cards that you're doing for that franchise?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We saw great growth for MAGIC. We didn't put percentage terms on that, but MAGIC in the quarter was very strong. It was double-digit growth. We talked about the fact that that had something to do with \u2013 we've talked about the timing of new initiatives, the major release came in the first quarter of this year whereas it was in the second quarter a year ago. So you do have some points of comparison year-on-year that have to do with this new timing schedule.","But we're very happy to see both the sales as well as the sell-through of MAGIC continue to grow. And we'll see as we go through the year just the overall receptivity to the new cadence. But what I will tell you is thus far in the year, the engagement with fans and enthusiasts, the tournament play, and our effort and commitment to continue to improve the online experience with MAGIC: THE GATHERING is front and center at the company. It's something that we're investing in. We think MAGIC long term has incredible growth potential and we're just scratching the surface of the opportunity with that brand.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And, Brian, just one from me. Any update on a Transformers sequel film?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Our plan right now with the studio and film makers, you may have read something about some writers being hired and we have, in fact, brought in Akiva Goldsman to lead a group of writers to really create a strategic plan around Transformers. We think there's any number of stories to be told, that's a brand that's been around for 30 years with amazing canon and mythology. And we would expect the sequel to Transformer movie to happen in 2017.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Great. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Sean McGowan of Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Also I have a couple, if I can. When you look at the royalties and entertainment revenue that comes in and then you allocate them around the brands, can you talk a little bit about what that says about the growth of \u2013 would TRANSFORMERS have been up without such payments? And I'm not trying to say that's not legitimate revenue. It is. I'm just trying to get a sense of whether it's the payments that are driving that growth or is that actual sales of toys? And similarly, what does it say for Girls if \u2013 you had a lot of things going right on the entertainment licensing in the quarter for Girls and it's still down?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think we noted why Girls was down. We're up against a very big FURBY comp, and, of course, in the first quarter, Easy Bake was down because, again, it's very holiday-sales oriented. And there's a bit of impact with some inventories based on the West Coast port strike and some delays around a little bit of product. TRANSFORMERS would have been up without the entertainment payment. So I think that I would turn it around a little bit. I would say that our objective is to continue to grow our Franchise Brands across a number of dimensions. We're going to continue to be the preeminent creator of toys and games through great innovations and consumer insight.","But through storytelling, we are going to bring the power of our brands to other consumer product categories. That is the nature of the way fans and enthusiasts want to enjoy brands today. We are following the consumer, and they're telling us that that, in fact, is the most contemporary way to proceed, and that is modern-day brand building. And so we think that we're offering both a differentiated approach to the market as well as something that's incredibly compelling to our fans, enthusiasts, kids and other audiences around the world. And that's what's being borne out. The blueprint is \u2013 the strategy that we're employing and we see those revenues from our consumer products business as important as and an opportunity to expand our operating profit beyond just what our Toys and Games business can provide. But recognize that our franchise \u2013 but I recognize that our Franchise Brands inherently even within our toy business, enjoy higher operating margin than our partner brands because, of course, they have lower royalties to be paid out.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks for clarifying that. Similarly, was the increase in \u2013 like, was Games up ex-MAGIC?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Games was flattish. It was up in the U.S., down a little bit internationally, but we have a number of games that grew within the quarter. In fact, a raft of games including Dungeons & Dragons, which is really on a tear, Risk, Scrabble, Trouble, Life, Candy Land, CLUE and OUIJA were all up in the quarter. And we're seeing great sell-through of our games. Our Games POS was up in the first quarter in the U.S., and up in many markets around the world. And so down a little bit internationally, but we view a lot of that as just timing on some of our new games initiatives.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Co. LLC","Was that down internationally? Was that just currency, or was that in local currencies that it was down?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, that was inclusive of currency, because we didn't retranslate that number, so that includes the declines relative to FX.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Co. LLC","So it's probably up then, right, if it's just down a little?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I mean, I don't have that calculation in front of me. So I'm doing it as reported.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Then the last question. Can you help us at least with the order of magnitude quantify what impact there might have been from the Easter shift? And again, order of magnitude for the digital streaming deal that hit the quarter?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, I think that the Easter shift was a couple of weeks. It was \u2013 our week 14 this year versus week 16 a year ago. But we've seen strong POS since the very beginning of the year. And that strong POS has continued post-Easter. I said Easter on Easter. This year we're up a bit so it was a bit stronger than Easter a year ago. But overall, what we're really seeing is great strength in our Franchise Brands as well as some great partner brand initiatives.","The MARVEL business is performing incredibly well in the first quarter. Star Wars POS is up significantly in the first quarter behind both action figures and role play. We're very excited about the Star Wars entertainment even in this quarter of the year. So we're seeing kind of from strength to strength in terms of what's selling in the first quarter. We point out the impact of Easter only inasmuch as some shipments certainly have to happen before Easter in order to get on shelves. And we just think it's fair to be transparent about where Easter falls.","In terms of the Entertainment and Licensing business, the payment for streaming rights, digital rights is only part of our Entertainment and Licensing business. We also saw considerable increases in the entertainment royalties, the licensing royalties around our brands. And we talked about the fact that we had very good holiday sales around Hasbro franchise brands and in several categories, we're up around the consumer product sales related to our brands that we get paid in terms of royalties and hit the Entertainment and Licensing category of our P&L.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Co. LLC","And that's the plan, it seems to be working. Would you say that the Easter shift helped, or was it offset by the port delays with \u2013 like, are they kind of comparable? That would have been a negative, right?","Brian D. Goldner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. The port delays are certainly a negative \u2013 it's funny. They're certainly a negative in a few brands where some of the new spring initiatives have not gotten out as fully as they will in April and May. And so a lot of the teams \u2013 the marketing teams have noted that. Conversely, the fact that we had very strong carryover sales of brands like NERF actually benefited us, because we had such good sales of NERF around the holiday period.","We didn't have the spring initiatives, but our carryover items have sold incredibly well, and NERF's POS is up significant double-digits in the first quarter and grew considerably in the first quarter. So I do think that there's some puts and takes. Overall the port strike has been a negative. I certainly wouldn't characterize it as a positive. But we're working through that. And we said for the full year we didn't expect that to impact revenue.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Brian?","Brian D. Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we outlined earlier this year, we are executing our plan to drive long-term profitable growth across our Brand Blueprint globally. This plan includes heightening our focus around our core franchise and partner brands while aligning our resources and costs to streamline our business and eliminate $100 million of expenses by 2015.","The first quarter of 2013 was a good start to the year and reflects the early results of these efforts. We grew our business in the quarter, increasing our overall revenues 2% and our underlying operating profit 47% absent restructuring charges. We made decisions to streamline our organization and to focus on growth around fewer brands. We are unlocking efficiencies and opportunity across Hasbro and for our brand portfolio globally.","In the quarter, the U.S. and Canada segment posted 4% revenue growth and very strong growth in profits, with an increase of 124% absent charges. The U.S. business grew with reduced Hasbro and retail inventory that is of high quality, backed by solid pricing and execution. The new team is doing a tremendous job improving profitability and strong execution in partnership with our retailers.  Inventories were down mid-teens at our top 4 U.S. retailers.","Our International segment was flat but grew 1% absent a $3 million negative foreign exchange impact. The emerging markets posted strong double-digit gains, with many countries, including Brazil, China, Russia and Korea, up significantly in the quarter. Across regions, Latin America and Asia Pacific revenues both increased at double-digit rates. In Europe, the emerging markets, including Russia and eastern Europe, remain very strong. A few developed economies in Europe have difficult comparisons with both Beyblade and Star Wars last year, and the Boys category was down in the quarter. However, all other categories grew and many brands, including Marvel, Nerf, Play-Doh, Furby, My Little Pony and Magic: The Gathering, were up in Europe during the first quarter.","Looking at our product category performance in the first quarter. The Games, Girls and Preschool categories all posted year-over-year gains, and the vast majority of our franchise brands grew. In our developed global economies, we had difficult comparisons in our Boys category, with both Beyblade and Star Wars brands presenting challenging comparisons with the first quarter of last year. As we have discussed in the past, Beyblade was a very strong brand for us, particularly internationally, and continued to be significant in 2012. For 2013, we have all-new product innovation and entertainment coming this fall.  Also in the first quarter of last year, Star Wars shipments were up in support of the theatrical release of The Phantom Menace in 3D. While this presents a difficult comparison, Star Wars remains a perennial brand around the world and a priority for Hasbro. We are constantly innovating across the Star Wars brand, and we have several new initiatives launching this fall. We're very excited about the plans Lucasfilm and Disney have for Star Wars across television and film. There is tremendous talent working on the Star Wars brand and developing it for future generations. Star Wars remains a very significant and important priority within our portfolio, and we look forward to the future with this great brand franchise.","Partially offsetting the difficult comparisons in Boys, we experienced growth in Marvel, Nerf and G.I. Joe products in the quarter. At Toy Fair this year, we shared some of the global consumer research we fielded around the modern boy. This research has informed the innovation and consumer experiences we have developed and are launching in 2013 for our Boys brands globally, including several new innovations across our Marvel business.","After a tremendous year in 2012, Marvel and its studio licensees have several incredible films this year, as well as all-new television programming to continue building the brands globally. In support of the theatrical release, our new Iron Man 3 product line reached retailer shelves in the U.S. just in time for Easter and has already started hitting shelves internationally prior to the May movie release. New Wolverine product will be on shelves starting this summer, and Thor: The Dark World product will hit store shelves this fall.","Our Marvel revenues were up more than 20% in the first quarter, and while the comparisons for the full year will be challenging, there is tremendous amount of innovation in our line, supporting both film and television, including our new Iron Man 3 Assemblers and an entirely new Ultimate Spider-Man product line based on the animated series.","G.I. Joe is another brand within Boys which grew this quarter. G.I. JOE: Retaliation has performed well and to date, has earned more than $270 million at the global box office. Paramount has indicated they'll begin working on the third G.I. Joe movie, and we look forward to working closely with the studio and the filmmakers.  We are pleased with the strong reception to the film and interest in the brand globally. Finally, in 2013, we've completely reinvented Transformers across platforms, including a television series distributed globally, online and mobile games, licensed products and a full line of new toys based on the all-new Transformers Beast Hunters theme.","Moving to our Games category. Revenues grew 26% in the quarter. This is a great start to 2013, supported by positive point-of-sale trends in the category in the U.S. and in a number of markets globally. Our franchise brand, Magic: The Gathering, continues to perform well globally across all regions. However, revenue growth in the Games category was not solely driven by Magic: The Gathering. The reinvention of our Games business is being led by our Gaming Center of Excellence and the innovative new brand initiatives they are developing around targeted consumer groups.","As a result, there were a number of brands and initiatives which grew within Games this quarter. Boys Action battling games, including ANGRY BIRDS Star Wars and Transformers initiatives, continued to resonate with consumers, nearly doubling revenues in the quarter. The reinvention of the Twister brand, with TWISTER RAVE in our Girls Gaming business, drove growth again this quarter for the Twister brand.","Finally, we were all reminded of how much a part of our lives another one of our franchise brands, MONOPOLY, has and continues to be. Our global \"Save Your Token\" campaign brought in votes from 185 countries, 10 million Facebook fans and created 2 billion impressions, driving increased revenues in the quarter, with new versions of MONOPOLY due out later this year.","In our Girls category, several brands contributed to our 23% growth. Notably, Furby continues to be in high demand where it is launched. Furby is now also available in non-English-speaking markets and selling very well. In English-speaking markets, Furby Party Rockers are at retail, and our all-new Furby line will be available this fall.  My Little Pony also remains in high demand, with more than 30% revenue growth globally across categories, including licensed products and even greater point-of-sale growth in several markets.","Our Girls category also had positive contributions from One Direction, Care Bears and Easy-Bake products. As we continue its reinvention, our franchise brand, Littlest Pet Shop, did not grow in the quarter. Littlest Pet Shop is supported by one of the top-rated shows on The Hub Network in the U.S., and we will be launching television programming outside the U.S. during 2013. Our Gameloft app continues to be extremely successful, and we are integrating this digital play into the physical product. We remain confident that with the investments we are making, Littlest Pet Shop will remain a top Girls brand globally and grow over time.","Finally, the Preschool category grew 8% in the first quarter. This reflects our focus on initiatives where we believe we can deliver differentiated innovation, as well as profitable growth. This is evident in our newest franchise brand, Play-Doh. Play-Doh is growing domestically and internationally. Revenues were up more than 30% in the quarter, and we launched a whole new way to play with our new Play-Doh Plus compound. We are also supporting great entertainment brands, including DISNEY PRINCESS, Marvel and Sesame Street. Also within Preschool, our PLAYSKOOL HEROES line is leveraging great brands, including Transformers and Marvel, to deliver growth. Having launched less than 2 years ago, PLAYSKOOL HEROES has performed extremely well, growing revenues and gaining share.","Across Hasbro, our teams are delivering the product innovation and rich storytelling behind our brands and our partners' brands necessary to fully leverage our Brand Blueprint across categories and geographies. In closing, the first quarter was a positive start to 2013. We have a number of exciting brand initiatives launching later this year and are encouraged by the reception to our spring initiatives and launches in key brands and categories. Our focus on executing against our Brand Blueprint globally guides our decisions and actions as we target long-term profitable growth for Hasbro and enhance returns for our shareholders.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deborah M. Thomas","Thank you, Brian, and good morning. As Brian stated, we had a solid start to 2013, and we are pleased with our first quarter results. We made gains both in revenues and profitability after restructuring while delivering a very strong balance sheet and generating healthy cash flow. All 3 of our major operating segments grew revenues absent foreign exchange. 3 of our 4 product categories posted higher revenues, and the vast majority of our franchise brands grew year-over-year. Our underlying operating profit, excluding restructuring charges, increased 47% over 2012. Our global teams are very focused on the quality of execution in our business and ensuring revenue growth also drives profit growth.","Also impacting the quarter, last year's first quarter was a 14-week period. And at that time, we identified approximately $6 million of expenses associated with the extra week. This year's first quarter is a 13-week period, and while the extra week in the first quarter has an impact on total expenses, it does not tend to have a material impact on revenues. Absent the extra week and charges in both years, operating profit still grew more than 20%. Our balance sheet was strong at quarter end, with $1.1 billion in cash, supported by the generation of $297.5 million in operating cash flow in the quarter and lower inventories versus last year. While relatively small in significance in relation to our full year, our first quarter results are a good start to 2013.","Before we look at the quarterly results in more detail, I wanted to update you on our cost-savings initiative. During the fourth quarter, we began the implementation of a program targeting $100 million in annual savings by 2015. To date, the focus of the initiative has been on an approximate 10% reduction in our workforce, including an early retirement program, as well as working to ensure we have the right skill sets and talent to meet the needs of a global branded play company.","The ultimate $100 million in targeted savings will come not only from workforce reductions but also strategic process improvements, facility consolidation and expense reductions, including our SKU reduction program. During the first quarter, we recognized $28.9 million in pretax charges associated with this restructuring. This equates to $0.14 per share. Given a higher-than-expected participation rate in our early retirement program, we've revised our full year expected range of charges and now expect to incur charges of $30 million to $35 million this year before any potential pension charges.","This higher participation rate gives us an opportunity to further rationalize our organization and add new talent to the business, particularly in our highest growth potential areas. We anticipate pension charges could be as much as $10 million, but this depends solely on whether or not participants request a lump sum payout. We will not know how many participants make this election and therefore, how much the charge, if any, will be until likely the third or fourth quarter. We also anticipate growth savings in the range of $45 million to $48 million for the year. While both absolute amounts are higher than our original estimates at year-end, we estimate 2013 net savings of $13 million to $15 million before pension charges.","In addition to the $28.9 million of pretax restructuring charges this year, we also had $11.1 million of restructuring charges in the first quarter 2012.  The following discussion excludes restructuring charges in both periods. A full breakdown of these charges by segment and by line item on the income statement was included in today's earnings release and on Slides 21 through 23 of the presentation.","Looking at our segment results for the quarter, the U.S. and Canada segment net revenues increased 4%. Growth in the Girls and Games categories more than offset declines in the Boys and Preschool categories. The U.S. and Canada segment reported 124% operating profit growth and an operating profit margin of 11% of revenues versus 5.1% last year. This gain was driven by higher revenues, favorable product mix and profit improvement in the U.S., including savings from last year's first quarter restructuring.","In the International segment, revenues were flat, including a negative $3 million impact of foreign exchange. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, International segment revenues grew 1%. A few developed economies in Europe face difficult comparisons in Boys to 2012, and the European region declined 7% despite growth in emerging markets, including Russia and eastern Europe. This was offset by a 21% increase in Asia Pacific and a 17% increase in Latin America. In total, our emerging markets grew 34% in the quarter. Games, Girls and Preschool all increased internationally but were offset by a decline in the Boys category. The operating loss in the International segment increased by $1 million, primarily due to the lower revenue and operating profit in Europe.","The Entertainment and Licensing segment net revenues increased 5% as we continue to benefit from higher sales of Hasbro Studios television programming. Operating profit in the segment declined $1.3 million. This decline is primarily due to the mix of revenues and reflects an increase in program amortization versus last year.","Looking at our overall expenses. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was essentially flat year-over-year. Total operating expenses declined 1% or $2.7 million. The decline came from lower overall costs due to a 13-week quarter in 2013 versus a 14-week quarter in 2012 and savings from workforce reductions in the first quarter 2012. We also had lower royalty expense versus last year due to product mix. These declines were partially offset by investment in innovation and consumer demand creation. Product development, advertising and program amortization each increased modestly and were essentially in line with last year as a percentage of revenue.","Moving below operating profit. Total non-operating expense increased $6.5 million. The year-over-year increase came from foreign currency losses in 2013 versus gains in the first quarter 2012 and investment losses this year versus gains last year. Non-operating expense also includes our 50% share of The Hub. For the first quarter 2013, our share in The Hub Network was a loss of $1.1 million compared to a loss of $1.8 million a year ago.","Our underlying tax rate for the first quarter 2013 was 26.4% compared to an underlying tax rate of 26% in the first quarter 2012 and 27% for the full year 2012. During the quarter, we had favorable tax adjustments of $5.5 million. These adjustments were not unusual but had a significant impact on the results of the quarter given they came in the first quarter, when our earnings are historically at their lowest. For the full year, this impact would not be significant, and we would not anticipate calling it out in our full year 2013 results.","For the quarter, average diluted shares were 129.3 million compared to 129.6 million shares last year. Similar to last year, when we also reported a loss in the first quarter, basic and diluted shares are the same. If we had reported net earnings for the quarter, our average diluted shares would have been 130.9 million versus 131.6 million a year ago.","Now let's turn to the balance sheet, which remains very healthy. Our business continues to generate strong cash flows from operations. During the quarter, we generated $297.5 million of operating cash flow. For the trailing 12 months, operating cash flow was $547.5 million. At quarter end, cash totaled $1.1 billion.","After strategic investments in our business, we continue to return cash to our shareholders through our dividend and buyback programs. Our next dividend payment, the first reflecting the 11% increase approved by the board in February, is scheduled for May 15. We repurchased almost 520,000 shares during the quarter at a total cost of $20.2 million and an average price of $38.81 per share. At quarter end, we had $107.1 million left on our share repurchase authorization. Our intent is to continue repurchasing shares opportunistically against that authorization.","During the remainder of 2013, we have 2 royalty advances due Marvel: a $30 million payment in May and a $50 million payment in July. We also have our final guaranteed royalty payment of $25 million due to The Hub in November. We're evaluating the appropriate level of cash to hold domestically and outside the U.S. Our objective is to get the best return on this cash for our business and for our shareholders, and we're carefully reviewing our options.","Our receivables at quarter end were up 12%, and DSOs were 69 days versus 63 days last year. Last year's DSO was abnormally low due to the extra week during the first quarter 2012, allowing for greater-than-normal collections. Our current DSO of 69 days, is more in line with historical trends for the first quarter.","Inventories declined $73 million versus last year on lower inventory levels in all regions except Asia Pacific, where inventories are up to support the growth in our emerging markets, including China and Korea. Compared to year-end, inventories increased slightly, up $7.7 million. We remain committed to tightly managing inventory levels. And overall, at Hasbro and at retail, our inventory is of high quality.","We're pleased with our start to 2013. As an organization, Hasbro is focused on delivering profitable long-term growth while driving innovation across our key brand initiatives and successfully executing our multiyear cost-savings initiative. We remain focused on smart decision-making and leveraging our investments and executing our global Brand Blueprint.","Now Brian and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sean McGowan of Needham & Company.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions, one is a quickie. Deb, what would you say we should be expecting for the balance of the year as an underlying tax rate?","Deborah M. Thomas","We would expect our underlying tax rate, Sean, to be consistent with what we said at year-end, somewhere between 26% and 27%.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I think one of the things that may have come out of last year's presentation -- or the presentation rather at Toy Fair was just how big Magic is and how much it's growing. But I don't -- personally, I don't have a sense of how that product might be seasonally compared to the rest of the business. So can you give us some sense of kind of the order of magnitude? I guess, specifically, would sales overall have been up excluding Magic? Is it big enough to move the needle that much?","Brian D. Goldner","Sean, if you look at Magic, actually, it typically runs fairly flat quarter-on-quarter. It's more of release-driven, meaning the new releases of characters that contribute to people's cards to their collections and to their deck that they are then playing with. So it tends to be more release-driven based on the content that's put out in the market, so less seasonal. It's driven by the couple of different components. There's a major online digital component and a mobile component now, as well as the card-based component that's sold at retail. Remember that 4\/5 of that retail is in nonentity[ph]-type retail stores, so a lot of hobby shops and lots of hobby shop playing. And we did talk about the fact that other parts of our Games business was up during the quarter. There were several brands in Games that were up in the quarter. And of course, our Girls business and Preschool and Games were all up. And Girls and Games were up significantly in the quarter. So I think that it was certainly a contributor, but we have a lot of good initiatives working in the first quarter for us.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Brian, quick question for you. You had mentioned in your prepared remarks that POS was up for Games, but I was just wondering if you could talk about it more broadly across your entire product portfolio.","Brian D. Goldner","Sure. If we look at U.S. data, what we see is that POS was up significantly in Girls, it was up significantly in Games and up well in Preschool and for obvious reasons, down in Boys. If you look at the overall POS really in line with inventories, it was -- fared far better than our inventory reduction. Our inventories were down mid-teens in the U.S., and our own inventory, as you know, is down 18% despite being up in Asia Pacific. So we feel very good about what it is a early quarter, obviously, a less important quarter for the year.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Just to be clear, the -- you said the point of sales was up better than your inventory reduction, and that's inclusive of Boys?","Brian D. Goldner","Correct.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And Deb, on accounts receivable, would you say that the entire release was due to the tough comps of having an extra collection day last year?","Deborah M. Thomas","That's, by far, the biggest piece of it, Felicia. We said that if you look back at historical trends, the first quarter for, say, the last 5 years, it tends to be around that 69-day period. We've been decreasing slightly as of the past, but we're adding a little bit of extra days because of the longer-term receivables as we grow in places like Brazil, where we had growth again this quarter. That has a slightly longer -- but the majority of it was from extra collections, so if you look at that average, that's the best way to look at the DSO.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. So we had 1 extra week of collections last year.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right, helpful. Last final question. Brian, just on Furby, has that rolled out in to all the international countries yet? And if not, can you just walk us through the schedule?","Brian D. Goldner","It's rolling out right now in non-English-speaking countries. As you know, last year, we've launched an English-speaking in the second half of the year, actually, fourth quarter mostly. And then, throughout the year, it's going to roll out in multiple languages, including lots of markets where we have set up emerging markets teams since the last Furby launch. So you'll see certainly Furby in Brazil, in Russia, in Korea and rolling into China. So again, Furby will go worldwide throughout the year.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And by the end of the year, it will be all rolled out?","Brian D. Goldner","It'll be everywhere. And then, we have a brand-new Furby and Furby line coming, and we've not said much about that publicly except this morning, we did note that in English-speaking countries, we'll roll out our, call it, Furby 2.0.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Tim Conder of Wells Fargo.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple things here. Deb, can you give us any savings, gross or net, in the quarter, just as a more of a housekeeping item? And then, Brian, in Brazil, a competitor mentioned last week that the industry as a whole, the channel inventories were a little elevated, and those were being worked through. Can you give us some color on Brazil from your perspective?","Brian D. Goldner","Sure. Our Brazilian business was up significantly, and the industry is up. Trends in the industry are quite strong, albeit a little bit more muted than the economic environment but still up quite strongly.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And you're talking retail, correct?","Brian D. Goldner","Correct. Retail inventory was up, and our business was up. We gained a number of share points, in fact, something like 2.1 percentage points of share in Brazil, and our business is doing quite well. The team down there is doing a great job. Our franchise brands are performing quite well in Brazil across the board, as well as our partners brands and entertainment. So Brazil continues to be a high-growth market for us. And in combination with our other emerging markets, we grew emerging markets in the quarter by 34%.","Deborah M. Thomas","And as for the savings, Tim, as we've mentioned, we had $28 million worth of costs in the quarter, and we expect the majority of the growth savings that we talked about for the year to really come from the second quarter on.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So basically, nothing gross or net from a savings perspective in the first quarter?","Deborah M. Thomas","Well, we did have some savings, as we mentioned, in the first quarter in the U.S. and Canada division from their restructuring that they did in the first quarter of 2011. So what you're seeing in our underlying results, which is why we tried to split that out, is really the benefits we're getting from what we did last year. And we'll see more of what we did this year later this year.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. So Tim, let me just say it's -- what we saw, the U.S. business have sort of returned to historical levels of operating profit margin this year. The underlying operating profit in that segment was 11%, up against 5.1% a year ago. So that's really -- the first quarter last year was when we saw those -- when we started to see those savings versus this year.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then from the new restructuring program, Deb, just to clarify. As you mentioned, that'll start -- savings will start kicking in, in Q2 here?","Deborah M. Thomas","Yes, that's -- they'll start to kick in, in Q2. And we talked about our -- the reason for the increase in our cost was really related to a higher-than-expected acceptance of our voluntary retirement program. So obviously, we have a few of those people who are staggering throughout the year. And that's why we have been very clear to say we are -- we remain firmly on track to achieve our $100 million in expense reductions by 2015, so we just want to be clear we're on track to achieve that still.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe the first thing, just to follow up on what you were just talking about. Can you maybe talk us through a timeline of the labor reductions a little more granularly? And I ask only because SG&A of about $188 million in the quarter is in line with the last 2 years despite the reductions in labor that I thought started several months back. So I just wanted to get a better understanding of the timeline.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, we created the program and worked on the program in -- toward fourth quarter of last year. And we identified the first round of savings in the quarter and had made a plan, although none of the reductions began to take place until the first quarter of '13 in the absolute, maybe a few people. But the first quarter was when we began and offered the voluntary retirement program. We had a significant uptake on that program. In addition, other changes to the organizations and that's happened globally. So this quarter's when the changes predominantly have happened around the company and around the world. There are some people in the voluntary retirement program that will leave throughout the year, so not everyone will leave or has left in the first quarter. And so that's planned out throughout the year. And it is approximately a 10% net reduction in heads. We're also hiring in certain key areas where we see high growth potential so that's always part of our plan. And as I mentioned earlier, if you look back over the last decade, while we've added hundreds of people to our international organization, to our licensing capabilities and IP creation capabilities, our headcount has remained flat from late 2000 until 2012. So this is really another change that enables us to bring in talent in new high growth areas.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then, you said in your prepared remarks that you are carefully reviewing your options with respect to the cash balances. And maybe you could review with us what you see as your primary options and what the positive, negatives are of those options.","Deborah M. Thomas","Sure. Well, we have been clear that most of our cash, again, at the end of this quarter is overseas, and we continue looking at what to do with that cash. And we continue to generate and we said, we generated $297.5 million of operating cash flow in the quarter just from our business and almost $550 million over the last 12 months. So we continue to generate enough cash and have sufficient borrowing capacities through our commercial paper program to fund our business, so we're not worried about funding our business or paying our dividend. But we do look at -- and we could, at any time, bring that cash back to the U.S. should we need it, but we don't because we have sufficient capacity to run our business elsewise. But we believe that by the investments we've made have -- that we're providing a greater return to our shareholders. If you look at our emerging markets and those investments, they've paid off in 34% revenue growth in the quarter and increasing profitability to the company. And we look at that for the long term for the shareholders, but we do remain committed to returning the excess cash to our shareholders. Our board just announced an 11% increase in the quarterly dividend this year, which is the first payment of that is in May. We continue to target our payout ratio of about 45% to 50%, which in 2013 will be impacted a little bit because our board had paid our normal February dividend in December. So while we keep looking at that, we're looking at the most effective way to utilize that cash for the best return for our shareholders.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You're strongly considering repatriating, is that what I should be hearing?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, we're looking at strategies on how best to repatriate given that we want to do that in a tax effective manner.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then one last thing. The Hub is still running at a loss despite the improvement in ratings that you guys have seen. What will it take for that to turn to positive?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, I think that we are in a position right now where this is about the kinds of investments that we've made to grow our ratings, frankly, in the backdrop where other networks are not growing their ratings or they're going backward. So we've made investments in marketing. We've made investments in programming. So we are looking at what the right pivot point will be in order to begin to generate operating profit within the network. But we're all committed to the idea, as we had mentioned earlier, of a long-term profitable network that was also a great competitor in the marketplace. And so we're reaching those points, and we're looking at when the right time to make that pivot would be.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Eric Handler of MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","When you look at your inventories, and your inventories have been down now on a year-over-year basis for at least 5 or 6 quarters, should we look at these -- are these just permanent decreases now? Or do you get a sense from retailers that if the economy starts showing more significant signs of improvement that they'd be willing to allocate more shelf space to toys? Or just talk about some of the retail dynamics that are going on right now.","Brian D. Goldner","If you look outside the U.S., our business in Latin America and Asia Pacific continues to grow. Our retail shelf space continues to improve across several segments or categories. Across Europe, our business is improving. The biggest difference on European sales in the quarter really has to do, first and foremost, with Beyblade. Beyblade is kind of overdeveloped relative to European business, particularly in markets like Germany and France and then secondarily, Star Wars. So in fact, it's really more brand comparisons than it's about an economic environment or a retailer's commitment to toys. The kinds of sales that we're seeing in Girls, the new initiatives we have planned for Girls, in Preschool and Games and also for Boys for the second half of the year, I think, positions us very well in terms of retail shelf space. And what we've really done is manage our inventories to enable us to bring more inventory in, in time for consumer demand and more in line with consumer demand. And that was a stated strategy we had that we executed a year ago, and I think we then work from there with this new template or this new model as our plan go forward.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then as far as the Easter season is concerned, again that's a U.S.-centric type of selling season, was there any significant benefit from having that in the first quarter? And does that sort of reverse out in the second quarter?","Brian D. Goldner","No, I don't think that there's a significant benefit for our business now given that 51% of our business in the quarter was outside the U.S.","Operator","Our next question is from coming from the line of Jaime Katz of Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I guess, can you talk a little bit about Preschool and what you guys think you've done really well in that because it appears it's grown pretty strongly in the quarter.","Brian D. Goldner","Well, we take a very broad portfolio approach within our key franchise brands there. So there are really 2 major brands that are developed in there for us. One is the Play-Doh business that we continue to drive globally. It's a great brand for us globally. It's growing significantly and growing really in every region around the world. That is a brand that hits a lot of the key critical milestones that global parents really enjoy. It's a brand where if you go to Turkey or Brazil or China, parents really are in favor of the creativity that Play-Doh provides. And we've launched a lot of new product innovations and as well as have partnered with some great partners in Disney and Marvel and others to continue to expand the brand offering. In PLAYSKOOL, we've really identified this idea of characters, and PLAYSKOOL HEROES is a segment of our business that's becoming more major over time. We've launched it just a couple of years ago, and it's really beginning to accelerate as we go out around the world. It's led by both Transformers, as well as Marvel properties, and it's a great insight for us as we look at global boys and the opportunity to give boys their first action heroes that are consistent with things their parents feel good about. So we've got kind of a couple segments there that are really key drivers for us.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And was there any, like, new marketing program that you had going with any of these brands in the quarter?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, as you know, across all of those, we have great marketing programs, and in support of the PLAYSKOOL HEROES line, we have a great TV show that's going out around the world in Transformers Rescue Bots. And in Play-Doh, we have a show that's launched now in China, known as Pei Le Doh or loosely translated as Elf and the Can. And it's a really fun imaginative show, and it's a great preschool show that's been done in partnership with Chinese television.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And then can you, finally, just remind us, was there any specific pricing increases that you guys took this quarter? I can't recall if you had offered that at the Analyst Day.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, overall, our pricing is probably up low- to mid-single digits. But remember that we have -- that's really on carryover items, on new items. We are able to take the pricing up on carryover, and then on new items, we price for whatever that cost increase. Primarily, the cost increases we're seeing are in labor.","Deborah M. Thomas","Right, Brian. And I think we took that low-single digit price increase already in the U.S., and we have the low-single digit price increase outside the U.S. more a little bit in the second quarter, early in the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Drew Crum of Stifel.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So Deb, I wonder if you could comment on the gross margin. It looks like it's 61%, your 5-year high. As you look at the balance of 2013, what -- how are you thinking about that line? What are some of the puts and takes on gross margin as you look at the next couple of quarters?","Deborah M. Thomas","Sure.Well, Drew, we had talked about, at Toy Fair, that we expected the level of gross margin we had for the full year 2012 to be sustainable. And as Brian just mentioned, we price to recover the cost of the product, and we continue to believe that our gross margins on that full year basis would be sustainable. Now every quarter, it can be a little bit different dependent upon product mix, but what we're seeing is with cleaner inventory at Hasbro and lower inventory at retail, we have less in the way of closeouts and markdowns. And for many reasons, that's really why we believe that those levels are sustainable.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then Brian, you specifically called out the performance of Littlest Pet Shop in the quarter, and the ratings on that show on The Hub have been quite strong. Are you still tracking on plan with respect to the product launch in support of that program? And is this a brand that we should expect to grow for Girls in 2013?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, the last part of your question I really won't answer. But I will tell you that, over the long term, the reason we called it out was the vast majority of our franchise brands grew in the quarter. We wanted to highlight that Littlest Pet Shop is on a track very similar to what we did with My Little Pony a few years ago, and it does take a bit of time to create the storytelling, to create a really great television series that is getting very high ratings. So thanks for noticing that. And those -- that show is now rolling out around the world. The product line follows as well. We'll license products, and our Gameloft relationship is quite successful there as well. We've had millions of girls downloading their Gameloft app game for Littlest Pet Shop. And so we're going to connect up all of the digital and analog play patterns in the product line, and it will launch late this year and into 2014. So we feel like we're on track long term to regrow that brand.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last question, can you remind us the nature of the Marvel royalty payments and the timing as to when those flow through the cash flow statement?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, go ahead.","Deborah M. Thomas","Yes, sure. We have a couple of advances left to do with -- on the Marvel agreement for this year, and we did want to call them out because they're a larger payment. So we have $30 million due in May, and we have another $50 million due Marvel in July so that's really the timing of that. And just to remind you as well, the final payment of our guarantee to The Hub, the $25 million, will be in November of this year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Gerrick Johnson of BMO.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","First, I just want to clarify your answer to Felicia's point-of-sale question. Did you say down a little bit less than inventories in the U.S. and Canada?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, correct. It's -- the POS is down less than inventory overall and strong growth in POS in Games and Girls and Preschool. Not surprisingly, Boys POS was down in the quarter.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And the inventory you're referencing is retail down mid-teens?","Brian D. Goldner","Correct.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Is there any sort of impact to be expected on the bottom line from any participation in G.I. Joe, in the box office there?","Brian D. Goldner","We'll have to see over the longer term just how that looks. Obviously, we do participate a bit in the box office, and we're also very excited about the long-term opportunity with that brand. Kind of an update, over the weekend, we saw the great box office results coming out of China, so now the global box office is over $300 million. And we're up significantly in major emerging markets as we've talked about the box office there around emerging markets has grown dramatically, particularly for 3D. So great box office results in China, in Russia, Brazil, and so it portends great things for the brand longer term.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great. Production amortization, it was up $2.5 million in the quarter, but that had declined in the fourth quarter by about almost $2 million. Why the swing there?","Deborah M. Thomas","Well, I think it's about timing of -- that particular swing is about kind of timing of delivery of programming. So as we mentioned at year-end, our ultimate revenues had increased, which is what had lowered our overall amortization expense. But we delivered and started airing Littlest Pet Shop and other programs this year. So it's just a timing issue.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And Deb, on the fourth quarter, you -- on the fourth quarter call, you said that there'd be restructuring charges of $20 million to $30 million, and that range was wide because there could be some pension costs included in that. Now you've raised and expanded that range and now calling pension out as something that could be incremental to that. Can you just go through the thought process between what you said then and now?","Deborah M. Thomas","Sure. Well, as we mentioned, we -- I think we said $25 million to $30 million in additional costs at year-end. And we did have some pension expense in the first quarter of this year, which is what we could anticipate at the time, and we said we now expect to have costs of $30 million to $35 million, which, obviously, we had a large -- for the full year, we had a large portion of that in the first quarter. And that was really due to the higher-than-anticipated participation rates in our voluntary termination program, so we have a lot more people elected to take early retirement than we had anticipated so that's really the primary driver. We continue to see, and I mentioned last year-end, it would be difficult to predict exactly how much of the potential noncash pension charges that are left to come. We anticipate it could be as much as $10 million. But it really is dependent on how many of those participants in the voluntary retirement program take lump sum payments. So if a lot take lump sum payments and the majority take lump sum payments this year, we could see an additional $10 million of expense associated with this. If only a few do, we may see nothing. So that's why it's -- we wanted to let you know what the potential could be. We'll obviously call it out when it happens. But right now, we can't say with certainty exactly how much the amount will be.","Brian D. Goldner","And Gerrick, if you look, that corollary is the savings, and the savings rate has gone up versus our estimates, having to do with more people taking the voluntary program. So the savings rate, we now expect for the year is $45 million to $48 million.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, okay. But that still equates to $100 million by 2015?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. So if you took out -- if you look at it, we've identified already nearly half of that in 2013. We're running at that rate. And then obviously, there's a '14 interim year to get you to 2015.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great. Just one little quick one here. Do you guys have licensing rights to American Greetings brands worldwide, Care Bears, Strawberry Shortcake?","Brian D. Goldner","We share those with them, yes.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Share those, what does that mean?","Brian D. Goldner","We have -- we share the licensing income from the licensing of those brands. You're asking about licensing, you're not talking about the toy rights. We have -- now we may look at having other people do some of those brands over time, and we've had those conversations. It's similar to what -- so we've had ...","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I was talking about Care Bears and the American Greetings-owned IP.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, so we can -- yes, we're selling those toys. But I thought you were asking about licensing income. Licensing income, we actually split with American Greetings.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Taylor of Arcadia Investment.","John Taylor","I've got a couple of questions, too. Could you -- for those of us who aren't paying that close attention to One Dimension (sic) [Direction], could you talk a little bit about the cadence of kind of what their visibility looks like this year, TV or concert tour, that kind of thing, and how you're thinking about shipments of that line?","Brian D. Goldner","Sure. One Direction contributed to the quarter. Obviously, we had brands like My Little Pony and Furby also contribute significantly to the quarter. One Direction has a movie planned for the end of August this year and obviously, I'm sure, tons of publicity around their concert tours. But the one I would call it kind of major piece of entertainment is a movie that's planned for the end of August.","John Taylor","Okay. And they're -- aren't they touring, though, as well this year?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, correct. That's what I said, yes. So they have a number of tours, and around those tours, there's a lot of publicity. And the fans know where they're going.","John Taylor","Okay, cool. Okay, I guess I missed that one. And then the -- as I recall, in first quarter of last year, Transformers had eroded at a -- kind of at a lesser rate than what we typically think of as a minus 50. So I wondered, could you hang any number, give us any sense of kind of what Transformer did in year -- the second year of the movie this time versus the last time.","Brian D. Goldner","Transformers in the quarter was relatively flat. We're transitioning out of what was last year mostly an entertainment-led, television-led business, and we're transitioning into the whole Transformer Beast Hunters re-imagination and new TV series, which really launches just now, and products start rolling out throughout the year. And Transformers, as you know, is a very strong international brand for us. So we saw, again, a roughly flat business as we come out of one product line and into another.","John Taylor","Okay, good. And then last question, on the Boys side, so you're seeing strength with ANGRY BIRDS and some of the action games for boys. Do you -- in your mind, is there any sort of cannibalization that might be happening between that and Beyblade since Beyblade is essentially an action game as well?","Brian D. Goldner","We're not really seeing anything that I could point to, JT. The play pattern using both the Jenga brand and standalone Transformers and Star Wars is really -- it's fun off-the-board kind of games, building-and-smashing type of games, and Transformers, the Bot Shots brand has been great and a very different play pattern than Beyblade. Beyblade has held up well in some markets like the U.S. and several other markets in Europe. It just happened to be such a big part of certain regions or certain countries business a year ago that the comparisons are pretty challenging. So I would -- go ahead.","John Taylor","Sorry. Yes, I was going to say any difference in the age focus of those kinds of things?","Brian D. Goldner","We're -- again, I think what we're seeing with kids is where they're able to find apps, they like playing the apps, but where we're able to bring new play to brands and games, we're able to get paid for that play. So the idea of being able to build a set that you're then able to break apart with ANGRY BIRDS or in Twister for girls, where you're able to really change the nature of the game from just the dots to TWISTER RAVE, which is now using elements like Skip-It and other light -- fun light dancing elements. And that reinvention is certainly contributing to the growth of that brand. So again, it's -- playing in ways you just can't play on a digital game.","Operator","Our last question is from the line of Michael Swartz of SunTrust.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just sticking with the Boys business, I guess, given the decline in the first quarter and knowing it's early in the year, I mean, is -- I guess, what, in particular, gives you comfort that, that business can grow this year?","Brian D. Goldner","I don't think we've ever said that the business would or wouldn't grow or that any category would or wouldn't grow nor have we talked about whether we would grow. We're really sort of setting up the year in major initiatives. I think the second half of the year has lots of new initiatives across every one of our categories. We're just pleased with the progress we made in the first quarter as we're seeing some of our spring initiatives take hold, and I think it's a good start to the year.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And then with -- just with regards to the gross margin. I know it's not kind of the heart of the production cycle yet but could you maybe outline some of the puts and takes there on maybe input costs or freight or anything to that extent?","Brian D. Goldner","I think the one area where you're seeing input cost change is in labor. There was a 7% labor rate increase that was accepted by the Shenzhen government. There's another labor increase across the region that will come in later in the year. So I think as you see cost pressures, it's really related to labor. Some of the labor shortages we've seen have started to reverse a bit as the economic environment in China has cooled a little bit. But still, I think labor will become the big watchword for the year. The other input cost in ABS and paperboard go up and down by quarter and tend to run in arrears, especially ABS and resin, in arrears to oil prices.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the floor back to management for closing comments.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you to everyone for joining the call today. The replay will be available on our website in approximately 2 hours.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ms. Debbie Hancock, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning are Brian Goldner, Hasbro's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Deb Thomas, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer.","Today we will begin with Brian and Deb providing commentary on the company\u2019s quarterly performance and then we will take your questions.","Our first quarter earnings release was issued this morning and is available on our website. Additionally, presentation slides containing information covered in today\u2019s earnings release and call are also available on our site. The press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that whenever we discuss earnings per share, or EPS, we\u2019re referring to earnings per diluted share.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management\u2019s expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters. These forward-looking statements may include comments concerning our product and entertainment plans; anticipated product performance; business opportunities, plans and strategies; costs and cost savings initiatives; financial goals and expectations for our future financial performance.","There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements.

We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.","I would now like to introduce Brian Goldner. Brian?","Brian Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. In February, at Toy Fair we shared with you how Hasbro is creating a revolution in play across geographies consumer engagement and Hasbro brands.","Hasbro franchise brands, emerging markets and our entertainment and licensing segment revenues grew year over year. In total, first quarter revenues increased 2% despite Easter happening in the second quarter of 2014 versus the first quarter of 2013 and ahead of most of our major movie shipments for the year.","Geographically, the revolution in play is based on the premise that the emerging markets will deliver the fastest growth in our industry. Hasbro\u2019s emerging market revenue grew 15% in the first quarter. Within the international segment, Latin America was our fastest growing region, up 17% as reported and up 27% excluding foreign exchange. All major countries within the region grew, including Mexico as well as the emerging market countries of Brazil, Chile, Peru and Colombia.","Additionally, Europe increased 8% with growth in several mature countries, including the UK, Italy and Spain plus strong growth in our emerging market Eastern European countries which include Russia.","As we said in February, we are poised for improvement in the U.S. and Canada segment. The U.S. business did improve in the first quarter behind new initiatives like Hero Mashers, continued momentum in franchise brands, My Little Pony, My Little Pony Equestria Girls, Nerf, and Nerf Rebelle as well as movie launches, including Captain America: The Winter Soldier out in theaters now.","Several major films, notably Transformers: Age of Extinction and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 are launching in a significant way in the second quarter. In addition, in the first quarter, Canada, Australia and France continued to present challenging economic conditions for our business. Overall the U.S. and Canada segment declined slightly in the quarter. International segment revenues increased 5% and entertainment and licensing revenues grew 13%.","Within the entertainment and licensing segment, we had a contribution from Backflip Studios which was not in our results during the first quarter of last year. In addition, lifestyle licensing revenues grew driven by our franchise brands in particular My Little Pony.","In 2014, we have strong retailer support both in-store and online for Hasbro product and licensing initiatives as we drive the revolution in consumer engagement with content, licensing and in partnership with our global retailers.","From a brand perspective, Hasbro franchise brands grew 15% in the first quarter with growth in all our segments. Five of our seven franchise brands grew year-over-year, specifically Magic: The Gathering, Monopoly, My Little Pony, Nerf, and Play-Doh. The remaining franchise brands Littlest Pet Shop and Transformers have significant new initiatives slated for the remainder of the year backed by strong global retailer and entertainment support.","This strong franchise brand performance helped deliver growth in our boys and girls categories. Boys category revenues increased 2% with growth in Marvel, Nerf and Super Soaker. Transformers revenues declined slightly in the first quarter as we shifted focus and geared up for shipments tied to the movie in the second quarter. We have strong global retail support for Transformers: Age of Extinction product as well as licensing programs as we activate the brand globally across our brand blueprint.","Girls category revenues grew again this quarter increasing 21% year-over-year. Our franchise brand initiatives for My Little Pony and the addition of My Little Pony Equestria Girls and Nerf Rebelle delivered strong year-over-year gains for the girls category in the quarter.","Our games revenues declined 4%. Both franchise brands Magic: The Gathering and Monopoly increased. With respect to Magic: The Gathering, the timing of releases can impact quarterly performance. While the brand grew this year's first quarter release was planned as a lighter release with fewer cards than the 2013 first quarter release. This change in release size had the biggest impact on the U.S. and Canada segment.","Several other games mega brands grew this quarter, including Operation, Jenga, and Elefun and Friends. These games did not offset declines in our action battling initiatives and in Duel Masters, a Japanese trading card game.","Finally, preschool category revenues declined 4% though Play-Doh continued to be a strong performer globally. Doh Vinci will launch later this year and will be reported in the girls category. Transformers Rescue Bots and Marvel Super Hero Adventures also grew slightly in the quarter but were more than offset by declines in core Playskool initiatives.","In closing, the first quarter was a solid start to the year, a year which we feel very good about from an innovation, entertainment and execution standpoint. We are focused on driving our franchise and key partner brands, growing profits faster than revenues and delivering on creating a global revolution in play.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deborah Thomas","Thank you Brian and good morning everyone. As Brian stated, the first quarter was a solid beginning to 2014. Revenues, operating profit and earnings per share increased year-over-year reflecting good momentum in Hasbro franchise brands and key partner brands, combined with the benefit of cost savings.","Before we review our results, please note that the first quarter 2014 as reported had a $13.5 million or $0.10 per share favorable tax adjustment related to discrete items. Additionally, in the first quarter 2013, we had pretax charges of $28.9 million or $0.14 per share associated with restructuring and related pensions actions as well as favorable tax adjustments of $5.5 million or $0.04 per share.","We've included a reconciliation to reported amounts in today's release. During the rest of my discussion of our business, I will exclude these items as they do not speak to the underlying performance of Hasbro.","Looking at our segments, the U.S. and Canada segment first quarter revenues declined slightly, down 1%. The girls category grew but was offset by declines in the boys games and preschool categories.","Segment operating profit declined 5% in the quarter, primarily resulting from lower revenue and product mix. In the international segment, the first quarter revenues increased 5% with Europe growing 8% and Latin America up 17%. Additionally, emerging market revenues increased 15% in the quarter.","Boys and girls category revenue growth more than offset revenue declines in the games and preschool categories. Revenue growth in the international segment drove significant operating profit growth in the quarter, as the segment posted an operating profit of $2.4 million versus an operating loss of $4.5 million last year.","Entertainment and licensing segment revenues grew 13% in the first quarter. The segment benefited from the revenue contribution of Backflip Studios. Revenue growth in lifestyle licensing was offset by lower entertainment revenues. Segment operating profit was $6 million compared to $7 million a year ago.","Looking at our overall expenses. We continue to make progress and remain on track toward our goal of achieving $100 million in underlying cost savings by 2015. We continue to lower our costs while investing in areas of the business to drive long-term growth, including Backflip Studios, Magic: The Gathering and our IT and digital infrastructure.","Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue in the quarter declined and continued to benefit from improved inventory management and favorable revenue mix, including higher entertainment and licensing segment revenues. Royalty expense in the quarter was close to flat with last year but as we\u2019ve discussed 2014 is an entertainment rich year for both Hasbro and our partners.","Product development increased mainly due to the addition of Backflip Studios and incremental investments in Magic: The Gathering. Intangible amortization increased year-over-year due to incremental expense associated with Backflip.","SD&A in the first quarter increased $7 million, reflecting the items we discussed at Toy Fair, including inflation, higher compensation and investments such as Backflip and Magic: The Gathering, partially offset by cost savings.","Turning to our results below operating profit for the year. Other income was $5 million versus other expense of $4.1 million in 2013. Our 50% share in the Hub Network improved to a profit of $1.3 million in 2014 versus a loss of $1.1 million in 2013. The Hub Network remains on track to achieve its plan of pretax profitability in 2014.","Additionally we had a $3.4 million gain from the sale of an asset, lower foreign exchange losses and improved investment returns in 2014. The first quarter underlying tax rate declined to 26.1% versus 26.4% in the first quarter 2013 and we continue to expect our full-year tax rate to be in the range 26% to 27%.","For the quarter, average diluted shares were 132.7 million shares compared to 129.3 million in 2013. This increase is due to the appreciation in Hasbro stock price which resulted in higher stock option exercises. The actual amount of shares outstanding at the end of the first quarter 2014 was 130.2 million shares.","Diluted earnings per share absent charges and the favorable tax adjustments were $0.14 in the first quarter 2014 versus $0.05 in 2013. Our business continued to generate strong cash flows from operations. During the quarter we generated $242 million of operating cash flow.","For the trailing 12 months, operating cash flow was $345.7 million. At quarter end, cash totaled $792.2 million. Our capital deployment commitments remain intact. Our first priority is investing back into Hasbro for the long-term profitable growth of the business. The second is returning cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we remain committed to executing against these priorities in a manner consistent with maintaining our solid investment grade rating.","In the first quarter we returned $132.9 million to shareholders, $52.4 million in cash dividends and $80.5 million in share repurchases. At quarter end, $444.3 million remained available in our current share repurchase authorization. Our first quarter repurchases were consistent with our stated objective to increase the pace of our share repurchases in 2014.","We have $425 million of long-term debt which is current and matures in May of 2014. Given current interest rates, our plan is to refinance all of this amount. Receivables at quarter end increased 8% versus 2013. DSOs were 73 days compared to 69 days last year, reflecting the timing of collections and the mix of revenue.","Inventories increased $67.1 million versus last year, ahead of our major movie launches in the second quarter. Additionally, international inventory growth was primarily in support of emerging markets. Our inventory at U.S. retail was down slightly at quarter end and internationally our inventory at retail was healthy. Overall, retail and Hasbro-owned inventory is of good quality.","In closing, with most of the year still ahead of us, Q1 was a solid start to 2014, with good momentum in our franchise brands and more major entertainment launches beginning in the second quarter. Brian and I are now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Stephanie Wissink with Piper Jaffray.","Stephanie Wissink - Piper Jaffray","We have two questions if we can. One, Deb, for you, just on clarification around the inventory. I think you mentioned that the U.S. inventory at retail down slightly. How should we think about inventory pacing through the second quarter as you move into some of the other movie releases? And then a question as well for the group just on, broadly if you think about the year, how should we also think about first half versus second half in terms of kind of the pacing of revenue?","Deborah Thomas","Great. Well, good morning, Steph. As far as inventory at retail, we did say it was down slightly at the end of the first quarter. But you'll notice our inventory was up and as we put some color around that, we said it's really in light of our major movie and entertainment launches that are coming in the second quarter and beyond this year, and also in support of our emerging market business where we continue to build in inventory to support the full year. So while it\u2019s down a bit at retail, it's all of good quality here and internationally and we\u2019re gearing up for more major entertainment releases later in the year.","Brian Goldner","Hi, Steph, if you look at the inventory increase year on year, you'll see that two-thirds of that inventory is in support of our international and emerging market business and about a third is focused around the U.S. business and the fact that we have so many significant entertainment launches and momentum in several of our franchise brands.","And if you look at the full year, we\u2019ve talked about the boys business, clearly we have some great start to the year in several of our boys brands, particularly the Marvel business. We have seen growth in Nerf in the first quarter but if you look at boys action properties even with movies that occur in the second quarter, the template for the year-long sales still remains more backend loaded, we\u2019ve talked about that before and as is true with the rest of our business and certainly true around the world. And so I think you\u2019d see gating that is similar to prior years as you look at the four quarters of revenues.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of James Hardiman of Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research ","I guess two questions, on Marvel, certainly encouraged by the fact that it was a positive contributor in the quarter. Obviously that was one of the biggest drivers of the declines in the boys business last year. Is it too early to say that Marvel will be a positive contributor for the year or is it more of a function of movie timing, how should we think about that?","Brian Goldner","I think overall if you look at the boys first quarter, what you see is clearly Marvel has moved ahead and have a number of initiatives there, both some great innovations with Hero Mashers that really began the new year in a great way and the product line that\u2019s all about customization for boys, Captain America in the quarter and then as you move into the second quarter, clearly you really get into Spiderman in earnest as well as Transformers, not Marvel but Transformers as we look at the major launches for the year. Clearly this is a great year for the Marvel business. There is a lot of new entertainment coming and Guardians of the Galaxy coming later in the year. And if you look at our first quarter, again you talked about some of the challenges up against boys comps a year ago. Our biggest challenge in the first quarter in boys comps is actually in Beyblade and that's there. This is probably one of the biggest quarters a year ago that we had for Beyblade. And that represents a challenge this year versus last year.","But as we move forward, we\u2019re not going to give you the specifics except to say we are absolutely excited about the plans for Marvel this year and going into the future.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research ","And then a couple of just housekeeping questions. Deb, the $3.4 million gain, was there a tax benefit associated with that, or was that a net number? And then I guess in terms of the balance sheet cash flow, it sounds like there were some timing things associated with inventory and accounts receivable. Once those sort of work their ways through during 2Q, should cash be more at sort of historical levels? They were obviously lower than a year ago coming out once you were, are those going to get back to sort of normal, or how should we think about that?","Deborah Thomas","Sure. Well, if you recall, we made a large payment to Disney toward the end of last year in connection with extending our -- and harmonizing our agreement to have everything go through 2020. So if you kind of look at the trailing 12 months, if you add that payment back in, you\u2019re getting close to the $500 million and there were some timing issues of payments with inventory and receivables. But really nothing unusual in connection with that.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research ","Great, and the $3.4 million gains, was that a net number?","Deborah Thomas","No, that was actually a gross number, and if you think about that, that was something that occurred in the U.S. So if you use really a U.S. tax rate it really shows it wasn\u2019t a bigger number net as it looks on a gross basis. But we wanted to give that to you. Other than that, I mean our other income included better investment returns and lower foreign exchange losses kind of things that ebb and flow from year to year. But that was unusual, so we wanted to call that out and also within other income and expense as we were saying the Hub remains on track to pretax profitability and in fact had profit of $1.3 million versus a loss of a year ago.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Sean McGowan of Needham & Company.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","Wanted to focus on the Magic release, a couple of questions about that. First, are you planning that there won't be any larger packs released later this year or is it really just timing, there will be some later?","Brian Goldner","In fact, Sean, it\u2019s just timing. They go up and down through years, not really calendar oriented but really around the storyline that the teams work on and then put out to our players. And so yes there's larger and smaller releases planned throughout this year and that's been true throughout time.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","Okay and I think you said, Brian, that, that was the major \u2013 that has a major impact on the U.S., maybe you haven\u2019t said it, would it be fair to infer that it also had a major impact on the overall games business?","Brian Goldner","If you look at games, remember games, particularly more traditional face-to-face gaming is a very responsive category to Easter. So the fact that Easter is three weeks later this year does have an impact on what we see in terms of games shipments and sell-through more than other categories. And if you look at Magic, the fact that it was a lighter release this quarter we saw, if you look at within the U.S. and Canada segment, that Canada was more challenging. We saw momentum in the U.S. business, Canada as we change over some retailers as well just the economic environment. And so I would say overall it was magic impact first and then the Canadian business second as impact.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","Okay. And since we are now past Easter, can you say that retail performance suggested that whatever negative impact there was on the timing in the first quarter has been made up in the second quarter?","Brian Goldner","We really saw that over the last few weeks leading up to this weekend, and we\u2019re still digesting some of the data from the last day or two. But we\u2019ve seen significant increases in U.S. POS that\u2019s improved and we\u2019ve finished the Easter season with a very good momentum to start Q2.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","A couple of others. Deborah, is there any change in your guidance on expenses, that highly detailed breakdown that you gave at Toy Fair? Any change directionally in some of the key drivers there?","Deborah Thomas","No. No change directionally, and I think you are seeing some of that in the first quarter where we are seeing cost savings offset a bit by some of the investments we\u2019re making. So overall we may have some timing impact but no change to the guidance we gave at Toy Fair.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","And last question, that is, I didn\u2019t hear anything about Furby. Was Furby a net negative in the girls category?","Brian Goldner","Furby is rolling out in the non-English-speaking markets Furby boom, the second-generation of Furby. Furby was down in the quarter, I mentioned back at Toy Fair that we thought Furby would be our most challenging comp for the year but in fact in the first quarter it was a Beyblade. So Furby has performed relatively well although down in the quarter. It continues to have very strong POS in a number of markets around the world and we are launching Furby boom in non-English-speaking markets this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Swartz of SunTrust Robinson.","Michael Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","A quick question with the girls business up 21%, I mean that\u2019s a pretty big number coming on top of a pretty nice comp from last year. I mean could you maybe talk about that in terms of how much that's been driven by POS versus maybe some larger product shipments in the quarter?","Brian Goldner","In fact, POS in the girls business across-the-board is very strong. We're really seeing that both My Little Pony core as well as Equestria Girls as an additional line is very positive to the brand and additive overall. Nerf Rebelle has been a great launch for us. It continues to have great momentum and we are rolling that out around the world. We saw growth in a couple other of our brands within the girls business. And remember that Nerf Rebelle and Equestria Girls began shipping late in Q2 last year. So this is a quarter where we're clearly clear air versus year ago really adding to our position in the girls business. We\u2019re also seeing our market share in girls, in particularly in dolls grow, grow in the U.S. around the world and we\u2019re also seeing that growth in outdoor activities where Nerf Rebelle has scored on NPD data. So overall I would say that it is a good start to the year and we have lots of new initiatives coming for girls. In the fall we launched Littlest Pet Shop initiative, the TV show is now out around the world, in about 140 countries. And we are really looking forward to getting Littlest Pet Shop launch again.","Michael Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","And then just maybe looking at the Asia-Pacific business and just talking around that, have down 13%, and one of your competitors pointed out Australia as being pretty weak. I mean could you maybe flush out what's going on there? Is this a temporary issue or just any color you can give us?","Brian Goldner","Sure. It is, Australia is a market that had been more challenged from an economic situation. You look at consumer data and a number of other indications over the last year, and clearly it's been a market with more of a consumer malaise and we\u2019re working through that. We don't view it as a permanent position but rather something that we\u2019re addressing, a new leadership in there as of about 10 months ago and a team on the field that\u2019s doing a great job in helping to turn that business around. And that really had the dominant impact on the Asia-Pac results. There is \u2013 there are some timing issues related to some shipments in China and other Asian countries in the first quarter. But we view those as very temporary.","Operator","Your next question will be coming from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","Brian, thanks for the POS data on the girls side of your business. I was wondering if you could give us that for games?","Brian Goldner","Yeah, that POS in games in the first quarter was down, if you look as I said we got that three-week difference. We saw overall as a company in our games business the POS really accelerating later into right before this Easter and we\u2019re still digesting this past weekend\u2019s data. But the fact is we've seen some really good improvement in POS across the company. We do see in our franchise brands strong POS growth whether it's Nerf or in our girls business obviously Marvel is a contributor in POS as well as in shipments. And we have a number of big launches coming in our games business in the remainder the year, a number across the Monopoly brand, including My Monopoly this fall and the house rules Monopoly as you know.","And then in girls a number of new gaming initiatives coming in particular the Disney Princess line within the girls games business. In boys one of the biggest contributors to the decline in the first quarter in games was in our boys and action battling as we\u2019re shifting out of one form of action battling games and we\u2019re launching this year something called Battle Masters which you may have seen at Toy Fair that features both Marvel as well as Transformers characters, and that\u2019s coming. And then we have a number of things coming in our preschool areas of games as well, including a brand-new Mousetrap Play-Doh games and also a line up of Disney junior games and then in teens we\u2019ve got that new Simon Swipe game. So we feel again as you look broadly for the year, we\u2019ve got a lot of great new initiatives in games and our magic business and again I think that Easter did have an impact on the games business.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","So it sounds like you would expect games to generate growth, year-over-year growth this year?","Brian Goldner","We don\u2019t want to forecast specifically but I would tell you that we have a lot lined up in our games business. And we certainly feel as good about games this year as we did last year this time. And we \u2013 the teams have done a really good job of creating new innovations in our games business and that's true both in the core games business as well as in Magic: The Gathering and other games.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","And then other than that shift in the new introduction in Magic, are you seeing any kind of other issues competitively or anything like that?","Brian Goldner","No, I think that, again the games business overall is certainly holiday oriented and that's true of both Easter as well as obviously Christmas. And we\u2019ve got a number of new initiatives launching that are in support of a number of new games across categories.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","Okay, I guess I was specifically talking about the timing of the release -- of the new release up for Magic?","Brian Goldner","Oh, what we \u2013 sorry, I didn\u2019t understand. So we have releases that come throughout the year. So there's not just one more, there will be a couple more. And they just vary in size and they're all related to new storylines and the team swears me to secrecy as they take us through this because obviously each of the new releases is met with great excitement and buzz and there is a lot of buzz out there for some of the new releases that are coming among the fans. But there will be a number of new releases this year in Magic.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital","And then just, can you \u2013 when are you planning on starting to ship the Transformers product?","Brian Goldner","Transformers ships in this quarter in time for the movie. As you know typically we have product merchandise anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks before the movie launches around the world, and we work with our global retailers to ensure that both our toys and games product as well as great licensing initiatives are set for that time period as marketing builds and interest in the film builds.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup","Just to follow up on the movie shipments for Spiderman, you shipped I guess a little bit of that out in the first quarter and most of it will come in the second quarter.","Brian Goldner","Spiderman shipped a little bit more than Transformers. Transformers we only shipped very very little bit at the end of the quarter. So predominantly second quarter and then obviously we will follow the DNA of most boys properties where still the second quarter will not be probably as big as the third and fourth quarters for those properties. A bit more in Spiderman but still not the pre-movie set.","Gregory Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup","And then internationally maybe just POS for Europe and Latin America just generally speaking or if anything stood out to you?","Brian Goldner","As we look around the world that industry growth as well as POS, and you look at Latin America where we have third-party data in Brazil and Mexico the industry is up and our POS is up very strongly. As you look around the rest of Latin America we have our own proprietary data and work with retailers to see where the market is, we believe the industry is up and our business is up with very strong POS and growth market for market. In Europe we\u2019re seeing some POS growth but also a few declines in a couple of countries where again we\u2019ve got differences in timing and also our new initiatives are garnering a very strong POS relative to the underlying business. So whether that\u2019s My Little Pony or Equestria Girls or Rebelle or Marvel which has had a great start internationally. That's all being borne out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler, MKM Partners.","Eric Handler - MKM Partners","I wondered if you could talk a little bit about Transformers, go back a little bit in history and talk about the international growth that you\u2019ve seen with the brand with the last couple movies and how much more developed your sort of emerging markets are now versus the last film?","Brian Goldner","Sure. If you go back and look at the first three films, the first film our sales were about \u2013 we released those numbers -- were about $492 million, the second film was $592 million, third film was something like $482 million. And then if you look at the growth, and just look at the growth in global box office which is benefiting all these entertainment initiatives, the first Transformers movie\u2019s entire box office is not as big as our international box office for the third move. So we\u2019re really seeing the growth around the world particularly in emerging markets. You\u2019re seeing people building malls and multiplexes and consumers in these developing economies, emerging middle class is wanting to go out for the movies and it's great to see how global movie initiatives can take hold and help to support and drive the growth of those brands. We\u2019ve certainly seen that, we have historically strong brand presence and legacy for Transformers around the world particularly in Asia. It's been on the air in markets around the world in 180 territories in our television over the last couple years.","We, Hasbro, are running the biggest footprint, we've run in the history of the company and all the markets we now enjoy having our teams on the ground and are doing a great job. So again I think that as we look go forward part of the building of the brand blueprint was the idea of running a bigger global footprint with Hasbro\u2019s own marketing and sales personnel and then executing that blueprint in immersive experiences either our own films or great partners\u2019 films from Marvel and from over time Lucas film coming over the next couple of years.","Eric Handler - MKM Partners","So as quick follow-up, out of those totals that you gave for the first three films, what percentage of your business was international from those three films? How was that increase as a percentage of revenue?","Brian Goldner","Yeah, I don't have that specific number in front of me but it's always been -- the first film obviously more North American focused and the third film more internationally focused, and you\u2019ve seen a bit of a shift but it's not gotten to 70:30, it\u2019s a bit over pronounced in terms of the international business relative to the domestic business just like the rest of our business.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jaime Katz of Morningstar.","Jaime Katz \u2013 Morningstar","I just have one housekeeping question. Can you just talk about refinancing that debt and how you plan on managing to your leverage targets and if those maybe have changed?","Deborah Thomas","Sure. No, what we -- we did say at Toy Fair and continue to state today that on given current interest rates we would expect to refinance all of that debt and we have $425 million due mid-May. So that's kind of the timing of it. And as we think about our debt targets they are pretty consistent with what we said before. First and foremost we want to maintain our solid investment grade rating. So as we look at our targets of debt to EBITDA I think we're about 2.0 something this quarter debt to EBITDA. But our target remains in that 2 to 2.5 range and EBITDA to interest, our target remains at 8 times, I think we were 6.5 or 7 for the quarter. But our intent is to refinance that debt.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gerrick Johnson of BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick Johnson - BMO Capital Markets","We\u2019ve heard a lot of commentary on POS for different segments. I was hoping you give us an overall US retail POS and the actual international if possible?","Brian Goldner","Hello Gerrick. The overall US POS was down in the quarter relative to quarter on quarter comparatively. You have to look at the difference between the three weeks -- three weeks difference to Easter in order to see that, and as I said we\u2019ve had significant improvement in POS over the last few weeks as we head toward the Easter week and that\u2019s true in the US and in several countries around the world where Easter is meaningful.","And sorry, I didn\u2019t get the second part of your question?","Gerrick Johnson - BMO Capital Markets","It was just a follow up on international POS and what that looked like, and I understand the whole Easter shift but this is for our modeling purposes, it helps to know what the actual POS was in the quarter?","Brian Goldner","Yeah, so overall POS was down in the first quarter in toys and games compared to a year ago. As i said you look at through this past weekend and we\u2019re still digesting the last few days of data. We've made up a lot of that ground. So I would say Easter looks relatively good and we certainly have great momentum going into the second quarter. Clearly Latin America is particularly a strong region for us market to market where we have both third-party data as well as our own data. In Europe we've seen some good growth in the UK, POS down in a few other countries where we have data, we mentioned Australia and in France we talked about challenges in France, and down a bit in Germany.","And then if you look at the franchise brands, we talked about franchise brands growth of 15% and we\u2019ve also seen great growth in POS against those brands whether it's Nerf exclusive and then inclusive of Nerf Rebelle, My Little Pony and then the inclusion of Equestria Girls but core My Little Pony, the Marvel business all showing good growth and growth in POS.","Gerrick Johnson - BMO Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. I guess that covers all POS questions. Maybe you could give us an idea of what Backflip contributed in the quarter and then also just to get back to Wizards of the Coast, to understand and you\u2019re very clear about the release impact on Magic but I was hoping you give us an actual shipment number on which Wizards, it\u2019s a metric you\u2019ve given us in the past.","Brian Goldner","Overall Wizards, and we\u2019ve never really given you a number but overall WotC business was slightly down in the quarter but we talked about Duel Masters which is obviously a Wizards initiative, a Japanese trading card brand. So again it's in that area where we saw some of the changes going on in the Japanese trading card market. That\u2019s where we are with that.","And then on the Backflip, it's -- backflip contributed in revenues and EBITDA if you take out amortization but with amortization was bit dilutive.","Gerrick Johnson - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Any idea how much it did contribute in revenue?","Brian Goldner","We're not reporting it, we\u2019re not breaking it out separately but clearly I will tell you like overall digital gaming business was up nicely in the quarter. So that includes Backflip as well as some other categories of digital gaming.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo.","Timothy Conder - Wells Fargo Securities","On Furby, you mentioned that that was down and obviously you expect that to be down versus difficult comparisons this year. Can you just sort of outline what quarters will be the most difficult comparisons in Furby? And then on Playskool, a little bit more color there, any impact you\u2019re seeing from the broad category having I guess some challenges?","Brian Goldner","The Playskool numbers, if you look Playskool and look at the overall preschool business, the core preschool business, we have the January and February NPD data and clearly the industry category was down. What we\u2019re really seeing is accounts is the character-led preschool initiatives are clearly working. We saw growth in our Marvel preschool business as well as Transformers preschool business and then our Play-Doh business is performing nicely globally and really growing as one of our newest franchise brands and taking hold. The core Playskool business was down in the category and that\u2019s consistent with what we've seen in some of the industry trends.","If you look at Furby, clearly Furby would -- the biggest impact would be in the third and fourth quarter of the year consistent with holiday sales.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andrew Crum with Stifel.","Andrew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus ","Wondered if you guys could comment on mix and its impact on gross margin in the quarter and how you see that playing out going forward, as this is a big year for the boys business which tends to carry lower gross margin than games? That\u2019s the first question. Secondly, one of your competitors is entering the shooter outdoor category with a new line, I wonder if you could comment on conversations you\u2019re having with retailers in terms of anticipated shelf space for Nerf?","Deborah Thomas","Sure, but let me take the gross margin question and then we will talk about \u2013 Brian can talk about the other question. But from a gross margin standpoint we are benefiting from mix and a lot of that\u2019s really coming from the growth in our franchise brands. We talked about our franchise brands have grown 15% in the quarter and that mix is impacting us positively as well. We\u2019re also benefiting from cost savings in the quarter in that gross margin line. So as we said at Toy Fair, we expect it to be able to [indiscernible] gross margins around levels consistent with full-year \u2013 a year ago, and that still remains our guidance for the full year.","Brian Goldner","Drew, if you look at the Nerf business, in the first quarter Nerf\u2019s momentum was both in shipments as well as strong POS and that's within the boys arena. The addition of Nerf Rebelle was also significant over and above those increases and the POS there has been great in that part of our business, the new Nerf Rebelle brand is rolling out around the world and is merchandised primarily in the girls aisles of global retail. And we\u2019re seeing great new innovations coming from Nerf throughout the year and feel very strongly that our Nerf business from an innovation and marketing standpoint is in a very good place.","Andrew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus ","And just one more question for me. As far as Beyblade is concerned, when does that no longer become a factor in terms of comps for the boys business?","Brian Goldner","Yeah, I think you will really see it diminished particularly as we get to the second half of the year -- as a significant comparison, Drew.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back to Brian Goldner for any additional comments.","Brian Goldner","Thank you.

Brian?","Brian Goldner","Thank you. Debbie. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Through the execution of our brand blueprint, the Hasbro team is building brands across toy and games, digital gaming, storytelling, entertainment and consumer products. These efforts support our mission of creating the world\u2019s best play experiences, and are delivering growth in our business. Second quarter revenues increased 10% and operating profit grew 12%. Each major segment grew revenues and operating profit. All four product categories increased revenues. Consumer takeaway continued to grow, and we are making investments to enhance our talent and capabilities around the brand blueprint.","Last week we significantly enhanced our animation capabilities with the acquisition of Boulder Media. Boulder is a leading animation studio based in Dublin, Ireland. This 150 person-team is creating award-winning content for networks around the world. We are very excited to Boulder join Hasbro, as we build a world-class team in storytelling and content-creation. The acquisition is not expected to have material impact on our 2016 financial results, but strategically it reflects our mindset of investing in capabilities around the brand blueprint.","Hasbro franchise brands increased 3% overall, or 5% absent FX, with double-digit growth from both NERF and PLAY-DOH. Revenues from our partner\u2019s brands increased 15%, led by STAR WARS and the addition of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY\u2019S FROZEN. These brands and future launches, including the introduction of Furby Connect, Dreamworks Trolls, and products supporting the December release of Lucasfilm\u2019s ROGUE 1, A STAR WARS Story, position us well heading into the fall and holiday season.","For the quarter we grew across geographies, with 11% net revenue gains in both the U.S. and Canada segment and the international segment.","Emerging market revenues increased 5% as reported, and 13% absented FX. Europe grew 23% in the quarter, including a 25% or greater increase from the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Russia. While the UK BREXIT vote has created some near-term uncertainty, and negatively impacted its currency, we have positive momentum in both the U.K. and in Europe heading into the second half of the year. To date, we have not seen a negative impact on our business. Overall, global point of sale increased 6% in the quarter, with growth in the girls, boys, and games categories. For the first 6 months of the year, POS is up 17%. According to industry and Hasbro estimates, with data available through May, we continued to gain share in nearly every available market. In total, we increased our share by approximately 1.2 percentage points. Our portfolio is well-positioned for the remainder of 2016 and future years. NERF and PLAY-DOH have continued to deliver strong growth. Several other Hasbro brands contributed to the gains, including Baby Alive, FurReal Friends, and Easy Bake, as well as several games brands, including Pie Face, YAHTZEE and Bop-It. MY LITTLE PONY declined slightly in the quarter, as we transition elements of our toy line. Over the past five years, content and innovation has propelled this brand, in both games and toys and consumer products. MY LITTLE PONY: Friendship is Magic season 6 is currently airing around the world, and our fall product line features the core cast inspired by the locations they visit.","MY LITTLE PONY Equestria Girls mini dolls have performed very well, exceeding our expectations and are helping offset difficult comparisons to a year ago. This leads us to next year, when October 6, 2017, MY LITTLE PONY the movie will hit theaters with an all-star cast and global distribution from Lionsgate. The film introduces new characters, new worlds, and new play experiences for the MY LITTLE PONY fan.","TRANSFORMERS is also driving a significant business, supported by both television animation and theatrical films. The second season of TRANSFORMERS: Robots in Disguise is airing on Cartoon Network in the U.S., and on networks around the world. TRANSFORMERS\u2019 story is further being developed by an all-new digital streaming series and partnership with Machinima, kicking off in August, and aligned to when our toys and consumer products become available. TRANSFORMERS revenue is down versus last year, but we have a rich content and product line for the year, and clearly a strong entertainment calendar and immersive stories and characters moving forward.","TRANSFORMERS","The Last Knight is slated for release by Paramount on June 23rd 2017, with two additional TRANSFORMERS films planned for 2018 and 2019. In addition, TRANSFORMERS Earth Wars, the first major Hasbro-branded game from Backflip Studios, was released on June 2nd. With over 3 million downloads in the first month, it quickly rose into the top 100 grossing games in the U.S.","Through investment in our in-house capabilities and expansive industry-leading partnerships with the best gaming companies across platforms, Hasbro\u2019s digital gaming presence continues to grow. With millions of daily active users, consumer spending on Hasbro-branded mobile games increased over 80% in the first half of 2016, versus the first half of last year. One example of strong year-over-year growth is our YAHTZEE with Buddies social dice game from Scopely. Our face-to-face gaming business had a very good quarter, behind several brands and play patterns.","Pie Face remains a top selling game in many markets, and point of sale is very strong. Pie Face Showdown, which brings the Pie Face gameplay to a whole new level, will be at select retailers in August, and will be widely available in Q4. In addition, as we deliver gaming for all platforms, Pie Face is being developed as a standalone mobile game for play on Apple and Android devices, and for living room play on Apple TV.","By responding quickly and bringing games to market in only a few months, we are capturing the excitement created by social media in our face-to-face gaming business. Hasbro\u2019s newest game, identified through our social listening expertise, is Speak Out. Available this fall, the game captures the excitement around mouthpiece challenge videos.","In addition, on July 22nd, MAGIC: THE GATHERING will launch Eldritch Moon, the second set within the Shadows of Innistrad. Shadows is off to a strong start, as global prerelease event attendance matched our previous record, and our launch weekend event had the highest global participation ever. Magic revenues grew in the international segment in the second quarter, with strong metrics in all regions. However, planned set release timing shifted this year and created uneven comparisons versus the first half of last year. Despite the shift, we expect 2016 to be the eighth straight year of revenue growth for MAGIC: THE GATHERING. Its popularity remains unmatched within the strategic trading card genre and we are successfully expanding global engagement and advancing the game into new formats including E-Sports and digital..","Within Partner Brands, STAR WARS and DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY\u2019S FROZEN represented the largest increases in the quarter. STAR WARS demand remains very strong. During the third quarter we will begin shipping product in support of the December release of ROGUE 1. However, the third quarter last year marked the initial shipments for new STAR WARS products. DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN lines are selling very well, both in fashion dolls and the small doll line. We also have plans to launch two new properties this year, Elena of Avalor later this summer to support the new Disney animated series and Moana in the fourth quarter tied to the theatrical release. The transition to our DISNEY PRINCESS dolls product has been smooth overall and we look forward to a second half of the year as retailers should have transitioned out of previous inventory.","This year we have several other great brands we are supporting including Yo-Kai Watch, which has been rolling out in markets globally and the upcoming Dream Works release of TROLLS. Our TROLLS product will begin to hit retail in August ahead of the November 4 premier. We have tremendous partnerships with great IP owners. We approach each of these brands as if they were our own, committing to them the best talent, resources and innovative ideas in the industry.","Looking ahead, we have positive momentum and a powerful line of brands and play experiences for the remainder of 2016 and clear line of sight to growth in future years. We have made tremendous progress in advancing our strategic capabilities to execute brands around the blueprint, but continue to prioritize the further development of our skill set and our culture toward creating the world\u2019s best play experiences.","Deb will speak in detail about our financial results, but we are very pleased with the strength of the first half of the year and remain focused on growing both revenues and profitability to enhance shareholder value over the long term. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deb Thomas","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. The Hasbro team continued to drive strong results for the second quarter, including double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion. We expanded our storytelling capabilities through our investment in Boulder Media and our balance sheet remains strong. We returned $179 million in cash to shareholders this year and remain committed to investing in our business, returning excess cash, and maintaining our investment-grade rating.","For the second quarter 2016, revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 11%. The boys, girls, and games categories posted revenue growth, more than offsetting a decline in the preschool category. Hasbro franchise brand revenues are flat. NERF, MONOPOLY and PLAY-DOH increases were primarily offset by a decline in TRANSFORMERS. Partner Brand revenues were up in the segment.","U.S. point of sale increased in the high single digits for the quarter and more than 20% in the first half of the year. Retail inventory continued to be of very good quality. Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 23% to $58 million, or 13.6% of net revenues, reflecting higher sales only partially offset by higher expense levels as leverage improved in the quarter.","International segment revenues grew 11%. Excluding the negative $17 million impact from foreign exchange, international segment revenues increased 15%. The boys, girls, and preschool categories posted growth in the quarter, while the games category was down slightly. Franchise brand revenues increased with growth in PLAY-DOH, NERF, MY LITTLE PONY and MAGIC: THE GATHERING. Partner brand revenues also grew in the quarter.","Operating profit in the segment increased 17% to $29.7 million, or 7.4% of net revenues. Similar to the U.S.","and Canada segment, operating profit improved on higher revenues, which were only partially offset by increased expenses year-over-year.","Through the first six months of the year, currency has negatively impacted revenues by $46.3 million. Given the current global economic environment, we anticipate additional negative foreign exchange impact for the second half of the year. However, we now expect it will be slightly below the $100 million we initially projected for the full year. We continue to believe approximately 15% to 20% of that impact will also affect operating profit.","Entertainment and licensing segment revenues increased 9% with gains in consumer product licensing and digital gaming revenues. Segment operating profit increased 86% to $13.8 million, or 26.6% of revenues. Higher revenues coupled with lower intangible amortization and lower program production amortization drove the increase, despite higher expenses associated with digital gaming launches from Backlit Studios.","Overall, operating profit increased 12% and operating profit margin gained 20 basis points versus last year. The revenue increase from entertainment and licenses, franchise brands, and Partner Brands delivered a favorable product mix, which drove cost of sales to revenue down 40 basis points versus last year. Royalties increased to 7.9% of revenues, associated with continued strong growth in partner brands.","In product development we continue to invest at a higher level to drive innovative play and grow our brands. We also continue supporting our efforts with multi-faceted advertising campaigns. Intangible amortization declined, reflecting some of our digital gaming assets becoming fully amortized at the end of the second quarter of last year. Program production cost amortization was also down in the quarter. We continue to invest in both television and film context, but this quarter we\u2019re amortizing fewer television programs than last year at this time.","SG&A increased 12% in the quarter, primarily due to investments in brands, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING, marketing, and higher compensation expense. Through the first half of the year, operating profit margin has improved to 10% from 8.6% last year. This gain is being driven by the strength of our brands, solid execution from our global teams, and continuous strategic investment to drive growth over the long term.","Turning to our results below operating profit for the quarter, other income was $6.1 million versus $2.3 million last year and reflected increase investment gains. The underlying tax rate was 26.1%, down from 27.1% last year and down slightly from 26.4% for the full year, 2015.","Diluted earnings per share were $0.41, compared to $0.33 last year. Our balance sheet remains strong. Cash totaled $924 million at quarter end. We generated $585 million in cash over the past 12 months. During the second quarter we returned $85.8 million to shareholders, $63.9 million in dividends, and $21.9 million in share repurchases.","Receivables at quarter end were down slightly and DSO\u2019s increased eight eights to 72 days. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, receivables increased approximately 3% versus the 12% revenue growth absent FX. The decline in DSOs was driven by the timing of revenue and collections in the quarter, as well as the bad debt provision we took in the first quarter. Overall, our accounts receivable remain in good condition, and collections continue to be strong.","Inventories increased 42% versus last year. Adjusting for a negative foreign exchange impact, inventory increased 48%. Approximately 80% of the year-over-year increases in brands which are knew to our portfolio or delivering high growth, including DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY\u2019S FROZEN, STAR WARS, NERF, PLAY-DOH and Yo-Kai Watch. The quality of our inventory is high, both at Hasbro and at retail, as we\u2019re supporting new initiatives in addition to our planned growth.","We enter the second half of the year in a very strong financial and market position. We have compelling brand initiatives and remain focused on delivering a very successful year. This strength of our business not only reflects the results of the investments we\u2019ve made in our blueprint and teams, but more importantly allows us to continue on our path of strategically investing in our brands and capabilities to further drive long-term profitable growth for Hasbro and our shareholders.","Brian and I are now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time we\u2019ll be conducting the question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions.) One moment, please, while we poll for questions.","Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Arpine Kocharyan with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Arpine Kocharyan","Hi, good morning, thank you. I have a bigger-picture question, but to just get this one out of the way, could you perhaps break down the $6 million of other income? Were there in FX one-time gains? I know that earnings from joint venture are going to that line, but if you could just break down, because it was about $0.04 in EPS in the quarter. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.","Deb Thomas","Sure, this is Deb, good morning, Arpine. The other income and experience line item includes lots of different things. There\u2019s no one-time FX gains in there. As a matter of fact, our impact from FX losses are fairly similar to what they were last quarter, in what we talked about versus last year, where currency is not quite moving in the same direction. We did have a gain from the sale of an investment in that line item and that was pretty much the only unusual thing that happened in the quarter.","Arpine Kocharyan","Okay. Helpful. And then, Brian, you are probably at peak production currently. Could you perhaps talk about the visibility you have on the second half of this year in terms how your largest customers are thinking about the toy category? And then I noticed, and thank you for that color, you broke down the inventory increase as a percentage of sales. It was highest over the past ten-plus years in terms of inventory and balance sheet as a percentage of sales. Maybe you could give a little bit of color on that.","Brian Goldner","Sure. If you look around the world, the industry is growing at quite a good rate. In most markets around the world it\u2019s growing from mid to high single digits. In a few markets it\u2019s growing as high as double digits, including Spain, Italy, Russia, and Mexico. Our business continues to grow around the world. We\u2019ve gained market share in 10 of the 11 markets that we measure and have measurement in the quarter, and very strong market share gains. We\u2019re also obviously seeing overall revenues growth above market growth strong double-digit growth for the company. And as we look out to the second half of the year, we have great momentum in our business, great POS momentum as well as momentum across both franchise and Partner Brands. Our retailers have clearly made plans that involve many of our brands. In fact, if you look at just the quarter and look at revenue contributors to the quarter, seven of the top ten revenue contributors in the quarter were Hasbro brands and the remainder were our Partner Brands, so a great balanced portfolio of our owned and operated brands plus our Partner Brands. And both NERF and PLAY-DOH were the top two brands in terms of overall revenues. So you\u2019re clearly seeing a number of strength in our product portfolio. They are in categories of business within the NPD categories that are also growing double digits, including action figures, dolls. Arts and Crafts is down a bit, but our business is up. And then outdoor sports and games. So, again, I say good visibility not only to the rest of the year, but as we go into 2017 and 2018 we have as good of visibility as we have ever had for multi-year plans for growth.","Arpine Kocharyan","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Everyone is focused on STAR WARS, and I know you mentioned seven of your ten top brands are franchise brands. It seems like franchise brands came in around 3% for the quarter, partner brands grew five times that rate. As you look out for the full year, do you still expect franchise brands to grow at a higher rate versus partner brands?","Brian Goldner","Yeah, so I\u2019m not going to guide on growth rates, one versus the other, but the one thing that did impact our franchise brands in the quarter was certainly TRANSFORMERS, and that is because a year ago, we were still selling plenty of TRANSFORMERS movie-related product, because we were coming off of movie four the prior summer, and the carryover was quite strong. Reassuringly, if you look at the product line that\u2019s associated with our television series Robots in Disguise in the quarter it was up significantly, but overall the brand was down, and that had an impact on our overall franchise brands growth rate. Despite, or if you took that out, obviously you would see stronger growth underlying for our franchise brands, particularly incredibly strong growth for NERF and PLAY-DOH.","Arpine Kocharyan","Right. Double-digit, that\u2019s helpful, and then could you talk about the cadence of STAR WARS shipments this year? We know that STAR WARS was over indexed last year, but you had the movie going into home entertainment in the first half.","And there is some industry chatter about Force Friday being a month later this year, I don\u2019t know if you can comment on that. You probably can\u2019t comment on that. But are you still expecting STAR WARS sales roughly flat to last year\u2019s, and the percentage of sort of total, what percentage you expect to come from Force awakens versus Rogue One in terms of when we think about that 500 million? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","We continue to believe that STAR WARS year should be roughly equal to last year. Every indication, the brand is off to a great start for calendar year 2016. We continue to see both strong shipments, but equally importantly, strong take away. A number of our product initiatives are selling incredibly well, and Hasbro\u2019s share of the STAR WARS business has improved as well. As you look quarter by quarter, I would remind you that -- that you are right, that -- if you look last year, Force Friday was September 4th, the merchandising date for Rogue One product is about a month later, at the end of September, and, you know, if you look overall quarter by quarter, there have been shifts. Obviously the first couple of quarters, we have been up significantly versus a year ago, but as I said for the full year, we would expect to achieve around the $500 million we saw last year.","Arpine Kocharyan","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please go ahead with your question.","Eric Handler","Yes, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick question on YO-KAI WATCH, seems to be building some momentum in the U.S. Just curious how you are thinking about the product launch- how many markets is it out this year, versus last year, and also, you know, how do you think about this property as sort of like a multi-year -- on a multi-year trajectory?","Brian Goldner","Yeah, you know, you are right. The TV placement continues to expand across a number of markets. It\u2019s in a handful of markets through 2016 and will roll out to more markets in 2017. And it\u2019s in Australia, European markets have just begun in May and will continue to roll out over the next month, and then the Latin American markets are really planned for late summer and early fall. We see it as a multi-year opportunity. It has been a multi-year strong brand in Asia, again we\u2019re sort of in the early days, although it is certainly a contributor to the quarter to year-to-date.","Eric Handler","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning, and thank you. Thanks for all of the color, and your comments on DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN were nice to hear. Obviously you\u2019re seeing strength there, just wondering how DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN is selling versus your expectation.","Brian Goldner","DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN are selling quite well. In fact our approach to all 11 princesses has worked incredibly well. The consumer take away is strong. And we\u2019re seeing great strength versus predecessor product. We expect that the markets have -- are clearing, and we\u2019ll see a clearer view as we go through the remainder of the year. Also in the small dolls -- what we call our Little Kingdom, the small dolls offering for both PRINCESS and FROZEN are doing quite well, and we continue to make great progress on that brand, and over time we expect we\u2019ll make progress. We\u2019re already seeing progress on the profitability. It will take a bit of time there, but again it\u2019s building momentum both in terms of shipments, but, again, very important to terms of sell-through. We\u2019re seeing great response to our product offerings.","Felicia Hendrix","So in line with kind of how your plans and expectations?","Brian Goldner","Actually it is ahead -- it is ahead of our plans.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Great. And with the profitability just to help us as we model -- I know you don\u2019t give guidance, but how should we think about that?","Brian Goldner","Think about it as profitability approaching company average operating profit for a partner brand, which as you know is a bit lower than the company average, over the next two years.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Great.","Brian Goldner","And just scale that out. As I said, our teams in development and creation and product development have done a very good job in identifying opportunities to continue to get our profitability on track toward our partner brand average over the next two years.","Felicia Hendrix","Super, and since you said it several times, I think it begs the question, how much is TRANSFORMERS down year-over-year?","Brian Goldner","TRANSFORMERS is down less than the boys\u2019 average one would expect in a movie year. It\u2019s down by, you know, around 20%, and again, it\u2019s as we mix out of the movie-related product and we get into the TV-oriented product, so this quarter has that impact. The biggest impact to the boys\u2019 category overall is JURASSIC PARK, and JURASSIC WORLD product is down significantly versus a year ago, and that also impacts our preschool lineup, because of Playskool Heroes, where we had preschool JURASSIC PARK product.","Felicia Hendrix","That\u2019s helpful.","Just a final one, in the slide deck, for the -- for your international business, it said in the second half POS was up, but in the little box for the second quarter it didn\u2019t mention anything about POS for the second quarter. So I was wondering internationally if anything changed in the quarter.","Brian Goldner","Yeah, if you look at POS, in the quarter, POS was up globally 6%. In Europe POS was up high single digits, Latin America mid-single digits Asia Pacific double digits.","Felicia Hendrix","In the quarter?","Brian Goldner","In the quarter.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. So nothing to read into there. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your questions.","Steph Wissink","Thank you. Good morning, everyone","Brian Goldner","Good morning.","Steph Wissink","Two questions for you Deb, the first is on the product mix. I know you cited that as favorable in the quarter, and Pony and Transformers were down, so should we expect that trend to continue through the second half and then start to reverse in the early part of 2017 as Transformers and Ponies come back online? And then second question related to Boulder, I know it\u2019s not expected to have a material impact this year, but as we look out over the next couple of years there is a third-party revenue stream in that business, is that going to flow through the entertainment and licensing line, or how should we think about that within the context of the P&L? Thank you.","Deb Thomas","Sure as for product mix, we expect in the latter half of the year as Magic, and Brian talked about it earlier in his prepared remarks, our product mix will continue to be favorable throughout the year. As our MAGIC: THE GATHERING is now launching the new set in the second half of the year, that will continue to improve our product mix. And just as a reminder from a hedging standpoint, because I know people who will be thinking about that as well, we hedged about 76%, 75, 76% of our product costs last year.","We have got about the same amount hedged this year as well, so as we think about the impact of FX, specifically on cost, we are in about the same place. And with respect to Boulder, we\u2019re really excited to add the studio to part of our business. They create award-winning animation, and they\u2019ll continue to do that for third-parties as we go forward. The revenue and expense associated with it will show up in our entertainment and licensing segments, and just a reminder, we did say it is a profitable studio, so that\u2019s why we don\u2019t expect it to have a material impact on our results, but more importantly with their good quality animation capability, it really adds to our opportunity to continue to create world class animation.","The one thing I would mention in the quarter is we talked a little bit about the investments we make, and there was a small impact on an expense from professional fees in the quarter that will be non-recurring. That would have had our SG&A line.","Steph Wissink","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please proceed with your questions.","Jaime Katz","Good morning, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019m curious what is motivating consumers in preschool. I think you guys had mentioned that it was weak in North America, or maybe I misheard that. And how are you thinking about facilitating sales going forward maybe in that category specifically?","Brian Goldner","Yes, actually if you look at the preschool business, particularly our Play-Doh business was up significant double digits, and the one area of weakness was really that we could talk about -- considerable weakness was the -- in Playskool Heroes, which is our preschool lineup of figures.","And Jurassic World\u2019s business was down significantly in that segment, down much higher than the typical -- we would see for a boys\u2019 action property. And that was true as well in our boys\u2019 business as well. And so that\u2019s -- that was the area of weakness there, and then the growth was in the Play-Doh business.","Jaime Katz","Okay. And then for Boulder Media, how do you think about that in the -- sort of under the umbrella with Allspark the Discovery Family relationship, and maybe do you think about how to organize them to get the best sort of synergies or allocate the best opportunities to each silo within that content angle?","Brian Goldner","Yeah, what we have been doing is running Hasbro Studios as a virtual studio. We bring on animators and professionals internally to help us to create the initial content, and then we\u2019re rendering and developing our content around the world in geographies, eight or nine geographies around the world, where there\u2019s an opportunity in great teams to develop content.","They also, in many places have tax advantages oriented toward creating animation in those geographies, and we\u2019ll continue to work with those teams over the next period of time. We have lots of shows in production. We have our animated feature film in production. But we also see the opportunity to build the Boulder business and to scale, in fact if you look at the kind of animation they create, it\u2019s world class and theatrical-quality animation. They are working for many different networks around the world and making shows for them.","And we see an opportunity as we are developing new brands, as well as new stories within our franchise brands, an opportunity to expand Boulder\u2019s capabilities and to continue to build our content capabilities as a company. So it\u2019s a matter of balancing between different resources, and continuing into looking at how we scale Boulder\u2019s operations, because they do provide incredible animation content at a great price point.","Jaime Katz","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your questions.","Tim Conder","Thank you. And Brian, congrats to you and the whole team again for your ongoing execution here, it\u2019s great. Just a couple here, if I may. I don\u2019t want to belabor the inventory point, but a little more color if you could, I know you mentioned it was STAR WARS and it was the DISNEY PRINCESS, which all makes sense.","Can you kind of bucket it? If you put those two in one bucket versus everything else of the percentage increase, how much those two collectively versus the other drove the increase?","Brian Goldner","Yeah, Tim, if you look at our overall inventory increase, 80% of the inventory increase were associated with best-selling brands as well as new business. So that would include princess and FROZEN. It would include increments in STAR WARS, NERF and PLAY-DOH and several other brands that are selling quite well, in fact.","Baby Alive is up significantly in the quarter, and for the year we\u2019re seeing growth in FURREAL FRIENDS. So there\u2019s a number of brands that would be part of that. So we feel like the inventory is in very good shape. It\u2019s just consistent with our forecast, and it\u2019s well balanced between regions, about 40% of the incremental inventory in the quarter was up in the U.S. and 60% outside of the U.S. and international markets. But we feel like we are well positioned with inventory, and it\u2019s associated with brands that are selling quite well, and\/or are new to the company.","Tim Conder","Okay. Helpful. Very helpful. And then as it relates to -- circle back to some previous questions on STAR WARS. You have us given good color about how you expect \u201815 and 16 to be rather balanced in the total revenues from STAR WARS. Anything you can say given ROGUE ONE is a spinoff, it would seem that that may not be quite as big so -- as we think about that in the latter part of the year here, and then carrying over into next year, ahead of episode eight coming at the end of \u201817, how should we kind of the about the balance if you look at the main episodes versus the spin off, if you can kind of look at them that way, as far as scale?","Brian Goldner","Yeah, we\u2019re incredibly excited about ROGUE ONE, and from the materials that have been out there I think you can see by now, that it\u2019s really around a classic story that everybody in the world knows of the Death Star and the plans around the Death Star. It\u2019s got a lot of great classic play patterns in it. We\u2019re very excited about the product opportunities and we\u2019ll have a robust line that\u2019s launching in late September. And we see it as a great compliment to the Trilogy story that\u2019s being told. And, as I said, for the full year, we expect STAR WARS to be similarly sized. That\u2019s obviously really contributed to our Boys business as has NERF contributed to the Boys business, and SUPER SOAKER. I think the one headwind to think about for the remainder of the year certainly is JURASSIC WORLD that was down significantly and above the Boys action average for the second quarter. We still have about half of the revenues. If you compare it in a movie year, Jurassic does about $100 million. So we have about half of that to do to compare to 2015, and we have made the decision at the end of 2017 we will no longer handle JURASSIC PARK. We had a many year relationship with Universal. We\u2019ll no longer handle JURASSIC PARK because we were unable to arrive at a mutually beneficial financial arrangement on that brand. So, again it\u2019s about $100 million in a movie year, it was a significant Q2 headwind and it will be a bit of a head wind for Q\u2019s 3 and 4. So as you think about the full year, and getting to your questions about how to think about gaiting around the Boys business and STAR WARS, I think that\u2019s a factor to consider.","Tim Conder","Okay. And then lastly, any color you with talk about the POK\u00c9MON GO? It\u2019s only been out there since the early part of July, but how that made headwind a little bit of maybe a brand or two within your portfolio? Or maybe even indirectly give a little bit of boost? Any color you could provide there?","Brian Goldner","Well, we have been developing our mobile gaming business for some time and we love that mobile games are really coming to the floor and the ability to use all of the capabilities of the smartphone in engaging a mobile gaming player is great. So we\u2019ve not seen any negative impact on our business, nor would we expect to. But we certainly believe in the mobile gaming genre, it\u2019s a wonderful way to contribute to storytelling as well as to get monetization of games through a premium model. And our brands in the quarter performed at a very high level around mobile gaming, and we continue to like the category, and we\u2019ll continue to build our business there. We love that mobile gaming is something that people are focused on.","Tim Conder","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your questions.","Gerrick Johnson","Good morning, two questions. First, Europe. What drove Europe to basically double the domestic growth for their shipments of certain categories that happened there in the second quarter that might not have happened in the first? And the second question is on BEYBLADE. When does that launch? What are your expectations for BEYBLADE? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Yeah, Europe just has seen great growth in its business across a number of dimensions.","There are similar brands and brand portfolio lineup, we have had-- we talked about the fact that brands like MY LITTLE PONY grew internationally, particularly grew in Europe for us this quarter, although it didn\u2019t grow in the U.S. We expect MY LITTLE PONY to continue to perform at a high level. But the lineup is very strong: DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN and STAR WARS as well as significant growth in NERF and PLAY-DOH.","PLAY-DOH is one of our more global brands and certainly impacts more of our international regions. And BEYBLADE is being placed and has placement in different markets around the world, and we see that as a late 2016 initiative, really contributing more fully to 2017.","Gerrick Johnson","Great. Thank you, Brian.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.","Drew Crum","Okay, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Deb, you mentioned the operating profit margin in the first half was up 140 basis points. I think you said you expect gross margin for the year to be kind of flattish.","How are you thinking about the EBIT margin for the second half. I know you don\u2019t like to guide, but any swing factors that could move that either direction that we should be thinking about? And then just to follow-up on the boys\u2019 business Brian. No mention of Marvel in the quarter. How did that business perform for you in the quarter? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","Sure. I\u2019ll take Marvel and let Deb take your other questions. Marvel performed at a very high level, it was one of our top brands for the quarter. It was off a bit versus year ago, but much lower than any Boys average decline one would see in a non-movie year because they just have done such a great job in entertainment. So you just, again, a major contributor the company in the quarter. They have great plans go forward. Obviously CAPTAIN AMERICA and some of the Marvel legends product were great contributors and obviously we\u2019re down a bit versus AVENGERS in the year ago. But again, very strong contributor overall and off just a bit. As I said, the biggest impact of the Boys category in the quarter as headwind was Jurassic.","Deb Thomas","And as far as our margins, we don\u2019t have anything that changes our estimates from what we talked about at toy fair last quarter, significantly. So we expect revenue to continue to drive expense leverage. We will continue to make investments for the long-term growth of our business. You have seen us do that consistently while growing our margins. And I think the estimates that we talked about, with the exception of FX, which we tried to say will be a little bit below where we thought it would be in February from a percentage and point of revenue, we\u2019re still looking at the same -- roughly the same estimates as then.","Drew Crum","Okay.

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ms. Debbie Hancock, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning are Brian Goldner, Hasbro's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Deb Thomas, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer.","Today we will begin with Brian and Deb providing commentary on the company\u2019s quarterly performance and then we will take your questions.","Our second quarter earnings release was issued this morning and is available on our website. Additionally, presentation slides containing information covered in today\u2019s earnings release and call are also available on our site.","The press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that whenever we discuss earnings per share, or EPS, we are referring to earnings per diluted share.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management\u2019s expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters.","These forward-looking statements may include comments concerning our product and entertainment plans; anticipated product performance; business opportunities, plans and strategies; costs and cost savings initiatives; financial goals and expectations for our future financial performance.","There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. Some of those factors are set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K, our most recent 10-Q, in today\u2019s press release and in our other public disclosures.","You should review such factors together with any forward-looking statements made on today\u2019s call. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.","I would now like to introduce Brian Goldner. Brian?","Brian Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter performance reflects the ongoing global execution of our strategic brand blueprint as we transform Hasbro into the leading branded play company across consumers and geographies.","Every brand we develop, whether it\u2019s a Hasbro franchise brand, a new or existing Hasbro brand or one of our steam partners brand, is being re-imagined across the blueprint to enable us to tell compelling stories globally. Our commitment to deliver the right content with the right innovation for the right audience in the right market is unwavering.","In the second quarter, Hasbro's revenues grew 8%. This growth was fueled by a 36% gain in franchise brands, 17% growth in international markets with emerging markets up 30% and 35% growth in entertainment and licensing, led by lifestyle licensing and digital gaming increases. Each one of these is a core element of our brand blueprint today and going forward.","Entertainment is supporting many of these brands. For example, TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY and franchises under the MARVEL brand, yet not all growing brands are entertainment backed in the traditional sense, but they are leveraging tremendous stories to enthrall consumers around the world.","Brands like PLAY-DOH and NERF, both up double digits in the quarter are examples of this strategy coming to life across the blueprint. Just this week storytelling and innovation are converging at Comic-Con International in San Diego.","Fan driven Hasbro brands including MY LITTLE PONY, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, TRANSFORMERS and JEM AND THE HOLOGRAMS are brand we are re-imagining through entertainment and licensing are engaging with some of our most avid fans.","We are unveiling exciting new initiatives which tap into creativity and engagement, including SuperFanArt.com, where we will leverage the creativity of fans with the technology of 3D printing and you'll hear more about this in the near future.","As we look more closely at the quarter, it's clear that the revolution and geography that we have recently outlined for you is upon us. We grew our business double digits in all major international regions, Europe up 16%, Latin America up 17% and Asia-Pacific also up 17%. Emerging markets including Russia, Brazil and China continue to contribute to the strong revenue gains in the segment up 30% in the quarter.","I'd like to take a minute and congratulate the Latin American team on its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. The team is doing a tremendous job executing our brand blueprint to grow in a competitive market and a challenging retail environment.","In the U.S. and Canada segment, second quarter revenues were down 2%, but U.S. POS was up double-digit for toys across the girls, boys and preschool toy categories and was up double digits for games.","Our franchise brands POS at our top five retailers in the U.S. was up significantly in the quarter, led by NERF, MY LITTLE PONY, PLAY-DOH and TRANSFORMERS. In Canada POS also increased across categories in toys and games. Clearly, there's momentum in our brands with U.S. and Canadian consumers.","Looking across the business, this momentum is evident globally. Five of our seven franchise brands grew revenue this past quarter, TRANSFORMERS, NERF, MY LITTLE PONY, MONOPOLY and PLAY-DOH.","Of the remaining franchise brands, MAGIC THE GATHERING declined low single digits and its flat year-to-date, while LITTLEST PET SHOP has been re-imagined and in all new line hit shelves during the third quarter in markets around the world.","Franchise brand TRANSFORMERS along with gains and franchises under the MARVEL brand helped deliver 32% revenue growth in the boy\u2019s category. TRANSFORMERS age of extinction has been incredibly well-received worldwide since its opening in late June. It has earned over $775 million globally, breaking records in many countries, including China, where the film is now the highest grossing film ever.","Many international markets only recently launched following the conclusion of the FIFA World Cup and as of this weekend has opened in most major international territories. Growth in MARVEL in the quarter was driven by the AVENGERS franchise supported by the 2014 film Marvel's Captain America, The Winter Soldier and two animated series and the Spider-Man franchise supported by the amazing Spider-Man 2 and the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series combined with innovative new products such as Marvel Super Hero Mashers. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy will be in theaters on August 1st and the product is hitting retail in many markets at this time.","NERF revenues in the boys category were down in the quarter based on the timing of shipments, but are up year-to-date and POS is growing in several markets we track including very strong growth in the U.S.","MY LITTLE PONY, MY LITTLE PONY EQUESTRIA GIRLS and NERF Rebelle contributed to growing the girl\u2019s category 10% in the quarter, more than offsetting the decline in FURBY.","We have identified FURBY as a difficult comparison in 2014 and looking ahead that comparison does not get easier as the second half of last year represented more than 70% of 2013 FURBY revenues.","We have innovative new initiatives in the second half of this year, including the launch of the re-imagined LITTLEST PET SHOP, MY LITTLE PONY POP and all-new MY LITTLE PONY EQUESTRIA GIRLS product and entertainment building on the equestria girl\u2019s position as a number five fashion-themed doll property year-to-date in the U.S. according to NPD. In addition, PLAY-DOH DohVinci is just now on shelves and contributed slightly to the girl\u2019s category in the second quarter.","Moving to the games business, despite positive POS in several markets including the U.S., U.K., Germany and Canada, our games revenues in the quarter declined 12%. There are several new games and market initiatives plan for the second half of this year, and we remain focused on growing the games business for the long-term across all platforms.","For the second quarter, franchise brand MONOPOLY continue to post positive growth with an all-new MONOPOLY JUNIOR in the market now and MY MONOPOLY coming for the fall. The category also benefited from the addition of Backflip Studios revenues and growth in the game of life, as well as initial shipments of Simon Swipe.","This growth, however, was offset by declines in TWISTER, which had strong growth last year, DUEL MASTERS, a Japanese trading card game and MAGIC: THE GATHERING, which decline in the U.S. and Canada segment, but grew in the international segment.","As we discussed before, magic is release driven and over the longer term poised for growth, as we continue to invest in the brand and technology development to enable global magic players and new recruits to enjoy playing across digital and analog format.","Last month we released Magic: The Gathering-Conspiracy and that has led to increase casual play activity in stores. In addition, fans are eagerly anticipating the released this month of the Magic 2015 core set, which position us well for the year.","Strategically, the second half of the year is extremely important for the games category, given the high consumer purchases over the holiday period. We have compelling new innovative games across consumer goods, including MY MONOPOLY, Simon Swipe and Battle Masters featuring TRANSFORMERS which is in market now and will feature MARVEL properties this fall.","Finally, the preschool category revenues declined 4%. PLAY-DOH continued to grow as did TRANSFORMERS RESCUE BOTS. This growth was more than offset by other declines in the category, including core Playskool and Sesame Street initiatives.","In closing, through the execution of our brand blueprint, we are creating compelling and engaging experiences for consumer globally. Building on this, we are leveraging the financial strength of our business, which Deb will speak to to invest in the transformation of Hasbro and execution of our blueprint to profitably grow Hasbrouck for the long-term in an environment of accelerating change. Our second quarter performance positions us well to successfully execute over the remainder of 2014 and in the coming years.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deb Thomas","Thank you, Brian, and Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results reflect growth key initiative, including our franchise brands and emerging markets, while continuing to strategically invest in our brands, our systems and our capital structure.","During the quarter we successfully repaid $425 million of debt and raised a total of $600 million at the lowest coupon in our history. Heading into our peak working capital period, our cash position is strong and our inventories are well-positioned for the holiday season.","Before we review our results, please note that in the second quarter 2014, we had an unfavorable tax adjustment of $13.8 million or $0.10 per share diluted share related to a proposed resolution of outstanding tax matters.","For the six months, nearly all of this adjustment will be offset by the favorable tax adjustments in the first quarter 2014. Absent any additional adjustments we do not anticipate calling these items out in the full-year 2014 results.","Additionally, in 2013, we had pretax pension charges in SG&A of $2.5 million or $0.01 per diluted share, related to partial pension settlement charges associated with restructuring action.","We've included a reconciliation to reported amounts in today's release. During the rest of my discussion of our business, I\u2019ll exclude these items as they do not speak to the underlying performance of Hasbro.","Looking at our segments, second quarter revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment declined 2%. Both boys and girls category revenue grew in the quarter, but were offset by declines in the games and preschool categories.","As Brian mentioned, U.S. POS trends were strong increasing double digits at our top five retailers across all product categories. POS in Canada increased as well. We ended the quarter with inventory of good quality at retail and at Hasbro and we are well-positioned for the second half of the year.","Segment operating profit in the U.S. and Canada declined 20% in the quarter, primarily due to lower revenues and the impact of product mix. Games category revenues declined including high-margin trading card games DUEL MASTERS and MAGIC: THE GATHERING, which has Brian discussed was the impacted by the timing of releases year-over-year. Additionally, we are making incremental investments to support the long-term growth opportunity for MAGIC: THE GATHERING.","In the international segment, second quarter revenues increased 17% and all major regions grew double-digit. Additionally, the boys, girls in preschool categories all grew and more than offset a decline in the games category. The 17% revenue growth drove a 98% increase in operating profit as the international segment posted an operating profit of $29.2 million, compared to $14.8 million last year.","Entertainment and licensing segment revenues also delivered strong double-digit growth, increasing 35% in the second quarter. This growth was the result of higher lifestyle licensing revenues for Hasbro franchise brands, including MY LITTLE PONY, MONOPOLY and TRANSFORMERS, as well as growth in digital gaming and the addition of Backflip Studios.","Entertainment and licensing segment operating profit increased nearly fourfold to $14.6 million, compared to $3.7 million a year ago, driven by the impact of higher revenues and lower program production amortization.","Looking at our overall expenses, our business reflects the long-term investments we are making in re-imagining our brand and executing across the brand blueprint globally. At the same time, we\u2019re lowering our overall cost basis to achieve our goal of $100 million in underlying cost savings by 2015.","Cost to sales as a percentage of revenue in the quarter declined. This decline reflects growth in entertainment properties, including TRANSFORMERS and MARVEL property, as well as higher entertainment and licensing revenues.","The higher entertainment-backed revenues also resulted in higher royalty expense in the quarter, which increased to 8.5% of quarterly revenues. As we outlined in February, over the past five years, our average royalty rate has been around 7.3%, we expect full year 2014 royalties to be at or slightly above that five-year average.","Product development as a percent of revenues was flat year-over-year, even with the addition of Backflip Studios, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2013 and continued incremental investments in MAGIC: THE GATHERING.","Absent these items, product development dollars would have been consistent with the year ago, reflecting our expected cost savings. Intangible amortization declined slightly as some of our assets have become fully amortized. This was partially offset by incremental expense associated with Backflip Studios.","Program production cost amortization declined year-over-year and advertising increased slightly as we invest in building awareness and demand for our brand.","SG&A decline as a percent of quarterly revenues, reflecting the impact of higher revenue in addition to lower underlying cost in the business and the positive results of our ongoing cost savings initiative.","These declines were impacted by the factors we spoke to you in February, including higher compensation and investments into long-term growth opportunity, including Backflip and MAGIC: THE GATHERING.","Turning to our results below operating profit for the quarter, other income was $4.8 million versus other expense of $800,000 in 2013. Our 50% share in the Hub Network improved to a profit of $2.3 million versus $131,000 last year. Additionally, we benefited from lower foreign exchange losses and improved investment returns in 2014.","The second quarter underlying tax rate declined to 26.8% versus 27.3% in the second quarter 2013, and we continue to expect our full-year underlying tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27%.","For the quarter, average diluted shares were 130.9 million shares, compared to 132 million in 2013, reflecting our active stock repurchase program. The actual amount of shares outstanding at the end of the second quarter 2014 was 127.9 million.","Diluted earnings per share absent charges in the second quarter 2014 were $0.36 versus $0.29 in 2013.At quarter end, cash totaled $586.2 million. Our cash position is strong and we continue to prioritize investing back into Hasbro for the long-term profitable growth of the business.","We're returning cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and as we\u2019ve stated earlier this year, this level of activity is higher than last year.","Finally, we remain committed to executing against these priorities in a manner consistent with maintaining our solid investment grade rating. In the second quarter, we returned $192 million to shareholders, $55.7 million in cash dividend and $136.3 million in share repurchases.","At quarter end, $308.1 million remained available in our current share repurchases authorization. In the first six months of the year, we repurchased 4 million shares returning $216.8 million to shareholders.","During the second quarter, we closed $600 million notes offering and paid down $425 million of long-term debt which came due in May. The deal was very well received by the market and enabled us to achieve the lowest coupon in Hasbro\u2019s history.","Receivables at quarter end increased 15% versus 2013. DSOs were 80 days compared to 75 days in 2013. The revolution in geography which Brian spoke of, also means a higher percentage of our sales are in international and emerging markets with DSO payment terms are generally longer. This revenue mix is resulting in higher DSOs for Hasbro overall. Additionally, in the second quarter, the timing of collections and shipments also contributed to the growth in DSOs.","Inventories increased $132.8 million versus last year with approximately two thirds of the increase coming from international markets. Our inventory at U.S. retail was down again this quarter and of good quality and internationally, our inventory at retail is healthy. Overall, retail and Hasbro-owned inventory is of good quality and we believe we are well positioned for the important second half of the year with the right inventory in the right market.","In closing, while the all-important second half of the year is still ahead of us, we\u2019re pleased with our second quarter results. They reflect the investments we\u2019ve been making in our brand blueprint, the innovation in our story-telling, product lines and licensing programs and savings we expected at this stage of our cost-savings initiatives. They also reflect our commitment to our strategy and the investments we continue to make for the long-term success of Hasbro and our shareholders.","Brian and I are now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Sean McGowan with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","Good morning everyone. Thanks. I\u2019ll focus the questions on the gaming area. So MAGIC, can you remind us what is coming up in terms of major releases and how you would characterize those releases versus a year ago in terms of magnitude and expectations? I mean, do you expect this category to be up for the year?","Brian Goldner","Good morning, Sean. Yeah, if we look at MAGIC business, it is clearly driven by releases. And as we were looking at 2013 year-to-date versus \u201814, last year we had our large and a small release in the first half of the year. And this year we had two small set. And yet MAGIC year-to-date is basically flat.","As we go into the fall, the MAGIC team will talk this week at Comic-Con and begin their talk about the size of each of the releases and what's coming up. So we haven\u2019t really talked yet about what that is. But overall again looking at MAGIC, the growth internationally, where we are so far year-to-date, the size of the sets that we put out.","We feel good about the MAGIC business and we are investing to continue to build the business, focused on the MAGIC online business so that we can run more concurrent gaming sessions more broadly and more online tournaments. And so we\u2019re building our capabilities there and that is some of the investment Deb had spoken to. So we feel very good about MAGIC. So far this year, we feel we're in a solid -- solid place and a strong position as we go into the second half of the year.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","And how much over the year would be overall impact on games. Can you explain by just looking at MAGIC, the decline in the quarter?","Brian Goldner","Actually MAGIC was down very little, very small percentages in the quarter. More of the decline would be related to example, a brand like TWISTER in terms of the dollar impact. And if we look at the overall games business, actually in games, very focused on particularly the impact was more in the U.S. on the games. Games declined in the quarter and our POS on games in the U.S. and around the world in several places but in the U.S., it was up sharply. It was up double digits in POS and our inventory on games in the U.S. was down double digits in the quarter.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","Does that surprise you that POS would be up double digit and yet your shipments would be down double digits?","Brian Goldner","It really speaks to the strategy we've talked about how we\u2019re executing this strategy, focusing our product lines, categories and brands where they sell the most recognizing retailers focus on just-in-time inventory. So this is consistent with the plan as we\u2019ve executed them.","And to us, the most important element in our games business is the innovation that's on the way and coming for the third and fourth quarter, whether you're talking about the new ANGRY BIRDS STELLA lineup for the pink bird or Scrabble showdown, MY MONOPOLY or our action gaming in Battle Masters and a raft of great Disney games that have come in the third and fourth quarter, including Disney Princess, Frozen games, even one of my personal favorites, Olaf\u2019s in Trouble. You\u2019ve got a lot of major games initiatives coming for the third and fourth quarters, which as you know, historically has always been a more pronounced part of our business.","And so I think this is reflective of a strategy that we were executing in line with the insights and retail insights that we saw coming from retailers. And it\u2019s just being born out as we execute this year as planned. So we feel very comfortable with our games business. We\u2019ve never seen such a good lineup of innovation coming for the third and fourth quarter.","And if I look at the POS, it wasn't just up for couple of games categories. Across different categories and consumer groups and games in the second quarter in the U.S., we saw a great growth, double-digit growth. So whether it's team gaming, whether it's preschool gaming, whatever it might be, we\u2019re seeing some great growth across those different segment\u2026","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","Thank you.","Brian Goldner","\u2026in POS.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steph Wissink of Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Steph Wissink - Piper Jaffray","Hi. Good morning everyone.","Brian Goldner","Good morning.","Steph Wissink - Piper Jaffray","Brian, a really quick question for you and I think a follow-up to Sean\u2019s question. Looking at double-digit increases in POS, for you are shipping down low single digits in the U.S. Can you talk a little bit about the balance of maintaining that tight inventory control and maximizing the selling windows particularly around some of those entertainment properties?","And then Deb, a question for you just on the inventory. I know you don\u2019t want to give guidance for the second half. But can you give us some sense of how we should think about that inventory balance at quarter end and to give us some sense of the complexion of that inventory relative to some of your second-half initiatives? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Yeah. Thanks Steph. So if you look at inventory at retail and let\u2019s use the U.S. data, inventory at retail in the U.S. in toy was down single digits but in games was down double digits, significant double digit. And if you pair that with our POS, our POS in toy was up double digits and in games was up double digits.","So as we are executing our plan, we feel comfortable that the growth in inventory that you're seeing in our numbers, is all related to high-quality inventory, a lots of these new initiatives that are shipping for the third and fourth quarters but obviously this inventory particularly focused on the third quarter. And across different gaming segments, we have a number of major new innovations coming whether you're talking about our past and party games, the action gaming category like Battle Masters, MY MONOPOLY that\u2019s coming in the family gaming arena, Scrabble Showdown with them, an exciting marketing plan in Scrabble Showdown coming.","So all those elements for us make us feel very comfortable that we're in a good position and it\u2019s very consistent with the insights, the retail insights that we've seen and we talk to you guys about over the last year or two, as we re-imagine the way the U.S. business would execute its strategy and as we\u2019ve executed the plan this year and going into the third and fourth quarter.","Deb Thomas","And our inventory that we\u2019re holding as well, Steph, it\u2019s of good quality. And it's geographically more importantly where we needed to be to meet consumer demand. So two thirds of our inventory is actually held outside of the U.S. And in addition to that, we also took in slightly more inventory in the U.S. during the quarter as part of our contingency plan related to the potential West Coast port labor strike that we\u2019re all facing. So our inventory is of good quality and it's positioning us well for the holiday season.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Hi. Good morning. Brian, on TRANSFORMERS, if you can adjust your -- I mean I know that your performance this quarter to where toy sales were at equivalent points with other movie releases and I know this one was more global. So it\u2019s a little bit -- might be a little bit more hard, difficult to do that. And we had the World Cup kind of in the way but if you were kind of trying to do an apples-to-apples comparison, would you say that toy sales are better, worse or even with prior releases at this point in time?","Brian Goldner","We feel really good about not only the box office, which as you note is giant and certainly growing in all those places we\u2019ve talked about over many quarters where we've seen the growth in multiplexes and the consumer that wants to go out to the movies, the movie theaters that are being built particularly in emerging markets and internationally besides the box office.","And I would say that our results overall in the quarter for TRANSFORMERS were very good. And we feel very good about the new innovation across both the toy and game category where we put out a very different kind of product line, a more expansive line, brought back in a lot of those innovations for the younger kids and we've seen that reflected in our takeaway. And then looking out over the remainder of the year, remember all three of the prior TRANSFORMERS movies, we did far more business in the third and fourth quarter than in the first half of the year.","And we would imagine that to be true here as well. And so as we get into the third and fourth quarter, into the entertainment windows and home entertainment, we would continue to believe that we\u2019ll do more business in the second half of the year than the first. That's been the case for this brand and for boys\u2019 action. But we\u2019re very pleased thus far with the results.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Great. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And can we just switch gears for a second to the Hub, there has been some news over the -- since the summer with Margaret Loesch stepping down and potential changes for the network. Just -- if you could just update us on your view on the Hub and how it all would relate to Hasbro and your participation in the JV. And then also one of those, I guess, you could use the word rumors out there would be the headquarter changes as well?","Brian Goldner","If you look at the Hub, the performance of the Hub over the last several quarters has been quite good. It\u2019s continued to grow over the last several quarters. And we\u2019ve had a very good recent performance and are seeing our highest levels of girls coming to the network and continue to be the most highly viewed, co-viewed network in percentage terms with parents and kids. So we think that that\u2019s one of the sweet spots of the Hub is that family viewing and family entertainment.","We really give Margaret and her team a lot of credit for what they've developed. It's a network that has far better ratings today than when we first started. It's distributed more broadly today than we first started. Our affiliate fees are higher as are our ad sales, and we\u2019re profitable in the quarter. Margaret\u2019s taken the decision that at the end of the year she would like to go do something else. It would have been five years with her at the helm. Obviously, four of those years since launch because we hired her about a year before we launched.","And it does give us an opportunity, both parents of the network an opportunity to look at where we take the network, how do we play to the strengths of both parents and continue to drive the momentum in the Hub. We are very committed to our TV strategy to the Hub, to our partnership with Discovery, and to building a great kids television presence both here in the U.S. and around the world.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Okay. So it sounds like other than -- you will have to obviously find a new CEO there, but it seems like otherwise its business as usual?","Brian Goldner","We have an opportunity to take all that Margaret and the team have built and continue to accelerate that growth. We think that\u2019s family entertaining and entertainment space, where we look at our brands that resonates so well across generations, the growth of the Hub itself and the fact that our brands will lead the way in terms of ratings, what we\u2019ve been able to do between the Hub and then distributing and streaming platforms outside the Hub, the over-the-top providers both here in the U.S. and around the world.","We see a real opportunity as does Discovery. They are great partners. David Zaslav and his team are tremendous partners and have been, and we want to continue to build this business and we\u2019re very committed to the Hub and some of the initial successes we\u2019ve had. Remember when we first got together back in fall 2010, we talked about that three to five-year time horizon to really find the footing for the Hub, and where it will go and what will it be as a network and by this October, we will be four years into our effort. And so it\u2019s a good time to continue to up our game and to look at how to build the Hub.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Okay. Very helpful. Final question, just back to Magic, you gave very good color earlier to Sean's questions, so appreciate that. Just one thing, just kind of getting back to things you said last quarter because when you talked about Magic as well and about that it\u2019s release driven and there was I think some impact last quarter to the shift in Easter, but you said early days, that it was off to a good start early in the quarter. So just wondering from then till now, did anything change regarding Magic or did everything go as you anticipated it back when you reported the first quarter?","Brian Goldner","Yes, no, it\u2019s very consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about. I think Magic is the most challenging sometimes for people to look at, because it isn\u2019t really seasonally driven. It is really a story that\u2019s told through the card releases. I think a good perspective for you is the fact that Magic is basically flat year-to-date, it was up in the quarter internationally and down in the U.S. only slightly. So, again it wasn\u2019t a giant decline, it was just a slight decline.","And the fact is a year ago we had both a large set and a small set, and this year we only had two small sets. So, that speaks to what\u2019s going on with the consumer base and the user base, the game players, the most recent launches of things like Conspiracy that just happened in June, the core set that\u2019s coming up, the 2015 core set, and the amount of casual game playing that\u2019s going on, the Duels of the Planeswalkers which is our casual entry level point doing well. So all those elements say to us it\u2019s a building blocks on the year, it hasn\u2019t really changed versus what we said last time, but we\u2019re just giving you more color as the year unfolds.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays","Great, okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Handler - MKM Partners","Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, on TRANSFORMERS, given that the film had a delayed release date in Latin America and Europe because of the World Cup, did you also delay shipments of the toys into those markets so that we should see an uptick in the 3Q as a result of that? And also wondered given how strong the film has performed in China, do you guys see a corresponding uplift in toy sales in that market as well? And then secondly, just quickly on MAGIC: THE GATHERING, we are starting to see some competition from Activision's Hearthstone game and wondered just what type of overlap there is among the customer base and is that having any impact as well?","Brian Goldner","Yes. So, Eric, first question on Latin America, we made our early shipments about the same time but recognize that the takeaway starts to accelerate after the World Cup, after all the marketing kicks in around the launch of the movie. And then remember that as we go into the third quarter, we do expect third and fourth quarter business to be far bigger than the first and second quarter, that\u2019s very consistent with the prior films. So yes, Latin America and some of the other markets that were delayed relative to the World Cup will have a slightly bigger impact to what are already larger numbers coming for the third and fourth quarter that would be our expectation. So I don\u2019t think that it would have a significant impact other than altering the otherwise planned out trajectory, which does have us a bigger numbers in the third and fourth quarter.","In terms of China, the result both this year as well the impact that we\u2019re seeing in China for us portends incredibly good things over the next several years. Remember that TRANSFORMERS was a brand that had its history in the 1980s in animation in China, so you have this great bimodal appeal of the brand with adults, fans as well as young people coming into the brand. The brand has performed very, very well. So it again will have meaning for us in China this year, but also sees this brand, it\u2019s why TRANSFORMERS is such a powerful franchise brand for us, and as a franchise brand the potential to grow over many years, of course many categories and geography. And also we\u2019ve worked on building our distribution in China. We have a strategic alliance with all the domestic Chinese company that would enable us to get to more points of distribution over time. So again, this is a multiyear plan and this year\u2019s movie results and the tremendous job that Paramount did to us really just sets the table for several years into the future of what we\u2019re seeing there for TRANSFORMERS.","In terms of Magic and competitors, the brand you note is a very casual brand, that\u2019s more focused on action. It would be more analogous to our Duels of the Planeswalkers product which is for entry level and it\u2019s played on the iPad in a casual way. Magic has a very deep strategic root 20-year history. The analog card game is still the most important element of that business, the fact that people are playing face-to-face, the fact that we are executing so many face-to-face tournaments in so many geographies on a regular basis, tournaments going on literally all the time around the world, and that differentiates Magic versus a lot of competitors, that organized gameplay organization that Magic team has in place, the ability to go out and execute that. Then Magic online gives us the opportunity to allow players to play at great distances and also to reignite players who may be dormant because they don\u2019t have a lot of friends around who used to play Magic with them. So it\u2019s a very different, much more deeply seated strategic gameplay in Magic. We take all competition seriously, but I would tell you that they are different games.","Eric Handler - MKM Partners","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You guys broke down what drove operating profit for the U.S. and Canada segment and International operating profit was significantly stronger. Could you talk about whether that was mostly mix driven or entertainment or what was behind that and maybe where do we expect the ultimate sustainable level to be there?","Deb Thomas","Certainly, Jaime. Good morning. Internationally, I think you\u2019re seeing a lot of kind of what we talked about for the company overall. It really is mix driven. And also, you are seeing the benefits of our cost savings initiatives. So in International, some of our costs have come and given the mix of heavily entertainment driven products, which tend to carry higher gross margins, a little bit higher royalties, the higher gross margins, you\u2019re really seeing that mix plays real combined with our cost savings initiatives.","Brian Goldner","You also have the fact as we grow revenues off of a relatively fixed cost base, it\u2019s what we talked about that international markets over time should begin to -- operating margins should begin to look more like company average operating margins.","Jaime Katz - Morningstar","It\u2019s perfect. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo","Thank you. Brian, a little bit more color if you could by the geographic POS and the product lines. And I guess then the other part is just to stay on the trading card line of questioning. I know you normally don't give forward guidance, but given what you have coming, do you anticipate that business being up on a year-over-year basis in the second half?","Brian Goldner","Yes. We really look at -- if you really look at what\u2019s going on with Wizards of the Coast year-to-date, it\u2019s more about Duel Masters, the Japanese trading card game being down. As we said, Magic\u2019s performance is flat year-to-date. I don\u2019t want to steal the team\u2019s thunder. They are going to tease one of the new releases at Comic-Con this week coming into the week and the plans are very robust for Magic for the remainder of the year. But again, the team would like to reveal those in the right time, in the right way, and we\u2019re really focused on our game players and fans and we don\u2019t want to ruin any of the great surprises and fun they have in stores as they play the game.","And so I don\u2019t want to guide you there, but I will tell you that they built a great business, that business has grown and more than doubled over the last number of years. And so I had great confidence in that team as they built the plans for this year and into \u201915 and beyond.","If we look at the POS across categories, POS was up and I will use U.S. and then go to International. POS and toy was up double digits and game was up double digits in the U.S. In Boys, it was up double digits; in Girls, it was up double digits; in Games, it was up double digits as I said; and in Preschool, POS was up double digits. So across all our segment categories, POS was up double digits.","As we go to international markets where we have specific syndicated POS data, POS was up double digits in Canada and double digits in Mexico, double digits in the U.K., high single digits in Germany, was down a little bit in Australia, down a bit in France and down a bit more in Spain.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo","Okay. And anything on Latin America?","Brian Goldner","Well, we have results in Latin America. We don't get syndicated data in the same way. Obviously, we have seen great results in the market in Brazil. We have seen our results obviously are very strong in Brazil. The market is growing and we\u2019re growing faster. Our market share is growing. And around South America, Latin America, we feel good at several of the markets, actually all of our markets down there really looking good and the results there are very strong.","We even had a brand like Furby, which is challenged in the rest of the world. They grew in Latin America in the second quarter and that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about as we roll out to non-English speaking markets. Playskool grew in Latin America as it did in Asia-Pacific. In fact, Playskool grew internationally in the quarter, just not in the U.S. and not overall. So we\u2019re seeing again the strength in our portfolio and the strength in growth across several of our initiatives in these regions.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo","Okay, great. Thank you.","Brian Goldner","And then Tim, the other pieces is -- and then, we\u2019re also seeing growth in market share so the last two. So, growth in market share in the dolls business and in Girls, growth in markets share in outdoor and sports and growth in market share in games.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo","One quick question then on follow-up, any impact yet from a new competitor in the outdoor sports area?","Brian Goldner","Well, our NERF business, our NERF brand and business were up in the quarter and our POS was up and our market share was up. So I would say, we\u2019re focused on executing our plan for the year and we feel very good about the results in N-Strike and as well as in our Zombie Strike product and we have several new initiatives lined up for the third and fourth quarter in NERF. So we just continue with the innovation and great marketing and the team has done a great job.","Tim Conder - Wells Fargo","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Drew Crum from Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Crum - Stifel","Hey, great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So you guys have had very good momentum with the Girls business. And Brain, I think you mentioned that 70% of Furby\u2019s revenue came in the second half last year. As you look at the second half of this year, do you feel like you have enough initiatives to grow the Girls business notwithstanding that headwind from Furby?","Brian Goldner","Yeah. Drew, thanks for the question. The Furby business, I should give you a kind of little color on it, because I think we\u2019re seeing some impact in the second quarter on challenging comparisons to Furby and we\u2019ll see that through the remainder of the year. As I mentioned, Furby in the second quarter was up in Latin America, so you have some mitigating elements. But overall, Furby is clearly one of the two big headwinds we cited early in the year, the other one being Beyblade.","In the second quarter, Furby\u2019s decline overall and Beyblade\u2019s decline were similar. And we actually saw that Furby had a bigger impact than Beyblade in Europe and in Asia-Pacific, where Furby was very big a year ago. So Beyblade\u2019s impact starts to diminish, Furby\u2019s impact gets bigger in the third and fourth quarter.","Having said that, we feel very good about the momentum in our Girls business and in the third and fourth quarter, you will see the Rainbow Rocks movie coming for Equestria Girls, Rainbow Power coming for MY LITTLE PONY. So we are as the team would say very Rainbowfied for the third and fourth quarter this year in that brand.","Littlest Pet Shop\u2019s, new product comes into the market related to the TV series. It's been out on the air in 130 plus geographies over several quarters and so that comes in for the third and fourth quarter. And we have a raft of really fun play in lots of other categories in Rebelle coming. And then even in other elements of our kind of Girls games business, we have really fun Disney Princess product lined up for the third and fourth quarter. And again, we feel very good about the plans for our Girls business going into the holiday season.","Drew Crum - Stifel","Got it. Very helpful. Okay. And then, Deb, let's see, the royalties were up in the quarter, which would be expected, but also advertising was up. And I think in years you have big entertainment slates, you typically see royalties up and advertising down. Is that still your expectation for 2014? Thanks.","Deb Thomas","I think overall Drew that would still be our expectation for 2014. I think what you have is just really the mix of products in the market, that\u2019s driving both at the same time.","Drew Crum - Stifel","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Gerrick Johnson - BMO Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning.","Brian Goldner","Good morning.","Gerrick Johnson - BMO Capital Markets","Hi. Can you let us know how much did Backflip contribute to the games segment in revenue?","Brian Goldner","I don\u2019t think we give those specific numbers, but Backflip did contribute to games and would be noted inside of digital gaming.","Gerrick Johnson - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And then in China, did the Alpha Animation joint venture contribute to results or was the growth there all organic?","","Brian Goldner","It was all organic thus far, but the plan over time is in the next year or two will start to really activate that across some new IP as well as some of our other brands.","Gerrick Johnson - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And lastly, you may touch on this in the future, but maybe if you could give us some idea now how you plan on monetizing your 3D printing venture with Shapeways? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","It\u2019s exciting. It's just launching this week. We\u2019ve always said and we talk to you guys about the modern boy and the modern girl and what we\u2019re seeing in play. We want to revolutionize play and one of the big areas there is the creative makers, people who want to have their hand in making their own playthings with the brands and the play places they want to go. And we\u2019re going to give them the opportunity, the enabling technology, Shapeways is a great partner.","We wanted to start with Superfanart.com, which, as you know, launches an artist because there there's been a lot of interest among our fans for new art and art that has been created by both artists as well as fans. But you will see us continue to build product that allows people to customize and to contribute and to curate to that brand and that's like MY LITTLE PONY POP, that Hero Mashers already on the mass customization level.","And then on the far end will be those folks who really want to create their own play things as well as their own engagement, the way they want in our brands. And so, we\u2019re going to satisfy the desires of all of our fans and kids and adults alike.","Gerrick Johnson - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Swartz with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Swartz - SunTrust","Yeah. Hey, good morning everyone.","Brian Goldner","Good morning.","Mike Swartz - SunTrust","Just clarification that the POS numbers that you pointed out earlier, are they normalized for the Easter holiday?","Brian Goldner","Not sure how we normalize them. These are the results of the quarter. So just as in first quarter, we didn\u2019t normalize, we didn\u2019t pick, put it back in Easter. So now these are the results that we got. We think it\u2019s pretty reflective of what we\u2019re seeing over-the-counter. And I would say, in the U.S. remember, Easter is really most impacted in U.S. Easter to Easter, we didn't see much variation year-on-year. So I would say that obviously just as in the calendar. Yeah.","Mike Swartz - SunTrust","That's perfect. Thank you. And then just maybe on advertising and just product support dollars for the remainder of the year, I mean how do you look at that? I mean, are you changing the way that you are investing in terms of digital versus in-store support?","Brian Goldner","We have focused on engaging the consumers and our fans and audiences digitally that comes in a lot of forms including content that's available ubiquitously and allows for young people and families and adults in some cases to view our content anytime and anywhere they want. It has a lot to do with the game play and gaming, whether it's from Backflip or whether it's from EA or Activision or DNA or Gameloft providing game playing experiences that feed back into the brand and the brand experience.","In the marketing area, we have significantly increased our digital engagement, as well as social engagement with our brands. Look at the MONOPOLY site as people vote and millions and millions of people are getting involved in the House Rules MONOPOLY or Scrabble Showdown. So there's all kinds of digital and digital marketing that we\u2019re doing and we will continue to increase those percentages.","And that will have -- we think a change because obviously, the out-of-pocket costs for those initiatives are different. Although the CPMs might be viewed as higher the out-of-pocket costs are probably different. But then combine that with the acceleration in growth in some of our emerging markets where we do want to invest in advertising in the early quarters because we are seeing momentum there and we want to continue to grow those businesses.","But again, I\u2019d echo what Deb said earlier, which is for the full year, we would expect the numbers in advertising to normalize and obviously, royalties to be a bit higher in a strong entertainment year.","Mike Swartz - SunTrust","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we have come to the end of our Q&A session. I will turn the floor back to Ms. Debbie Hancock for closing comments.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you to everyone for joining the call today. The replay will be available on our website in approximately two hours. Additionally, management's prepared remarks will be posted on our website following this call.

Brian?","Brian D. Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Hasbro's 2014 results highlight the power of understanding our consumers and audiences by garnering great consumer insights to drive innovation and build brands globally. Superior retail execution, compelling storytelling and global consumer engagement across mediums further strengthens these brands. At Hasbro, consumer insights and storytelling surround our brands and sits at the center of our brand blueprint. This brand blueprint is the strategy our global teams are employing around the world, and through which we are differentiating Hasbro in a competitive marketplace. Through innovation and storytelling, we are creating the world's best play experiences. In 2014, the execution of our strategy resulted in revenue growth of 5%. Improved profitability across segments delivered an adjusted operating profit growth rate of 7%, and an expanded operating profit margin of 14.9%.","For the year, Hasbro Franchise Brands grew 31%. This growth was driven by story-led brands, including MY LITTLE PONY and TRANSFORMERS, but also from innovation based firmly in our global consumer insights for brands, including NERF and PLAY-DOH. In total, 6 of our 7 Franchise Brands grew in 2014: MAGIC: THE GATHERING, MONOPOLY, MY LITTLE PONY, NERF, PLAY-DOH and TRANSFORMERS. Within our partner brand portfolio, great story telling and content supported by innovation propelled MARVEL properties to higher levels, behind The Avengers, Spider-Man, and the Guardians of The Galaxy franchises. Geographically, the global execution of our strategy drove International segment revenue growth of 8% in 2014 or 13% on a constant currency basis. 6 of 7 Hasbro Franchise Brands grew in the segment. Emerging market revenues increased 20%. Our playbook to continue growing in these significant markets includes driving consumer engagement with innovative product lines for Hasbro and partner brands, combined with television and film content distributed across mediums. These elements make our brands more attractive to a growing middle class, increasingly shopping for brands. Emerging Markets now represent 16% of our total revenues, a significant increase from a few years ago. International growth, however, was not limited to Emerging Markets. We grew across all major geographic regions, including major markets such as the U.K., Italy and Spain, as well as Mexico, a developing market for Hasbro, although early 2015 point-of-sale in major European markets is strong. Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues increased 15% and posted its highest ever annual revenues. Investments to establish global licensing teams, our focus on Franchise Brands and global consumer engagement across mediums, in addition to television and film drove these strong results. Our 2014 performance highlighted the strength of our licensing efforts across multiple brands, as both MY LITTLE PONY and TRANSFORMERS fueled this growth.","In the U.S. and Canada segment, actions we took over the past several years to reduce inventory, strengthen our channel strategy and enhance our digital and online capabilities helped return the segment to growth in 2014. This strong execution, coupled with innovation and content, resulted in all 7 of Hasbro's Franchise Brands increasing revenue in the segment. If we turn the clock back to this time last year, the outlook for Hasbro was strong, and we delivered on that promise. Yet as is true in our industry, delivering on that opportunity was not without its challenges. Total Hasbro revenue growth of 5% was broad-based across franchise and partner brands and geographies, but had to compensate for significant declines in both Furby and BEYBLADE. In the U.S., shopping patterns continued to shift later in the year, with the end of the holiday period representing an even greater percentage of consumer takeaway. Point-of-sale trends were positive over the last 4 weeks of the year. For the full year 2014, U.S. POS at our top 5 retailers was down 3% versus 2013, but grew more than 30% in our Franchise Brands.","If you remove the impact of declines in both BEYBLADE and Furby, total POS grew 4%. In fact, if you removed either BEYBLADE or Furby, POS was positive in the year. These same trends were true in the fourth quarter. Additionally, online point-of-sale continued to deliver double-digit growth in both the fourth quarter and full year 2014. The positive trends at year-end have carried forward into early 2015, with growth in the U.S. point-of-sale continuing. As I mentioned, international revenues grew 8%, but were significantly impacted by the strengthening dollar. The impact was most pronounced in November and December, and in total, foreign exchange translation reduced 2014 revenues by $93 million. Excluding this impact, growth in the international segment would have been greater at 13%. We anticipate foreign exchange to continue to be a headwind in 2015, and Deb will speak to this further. In the U.S., where currency was not a factor, the industry faced a significant challenge due to the ongoing port dispute on the West Coast. We put our contingency plan to work early on, incurring higher cost to ship product to our East Coast warehouse. As a result, we did not experience any significant issues in delivering our product, and further grew operating profit in the U.S. We anticipate some residual impact early in 2015 as a result of retailer inventory making its way to store shelves, but we do not anticipate this impacting the full year 2015. I can't say enough about what a great job our teams did in minimizing this impact to Hasbro. We achieved 5% revenue growth and 7% operating profit growth, while addressing these challenges.","Let's discuss our performance. As expected, given the robust entertainment slate in 2014, the Boys category had a strong year with revenue growth of 20%. Growth in TRANSFORMERS, NERF and MARVEL initiatives more than offset the revenue decline in BEYBLADE. 2014 TRANSFORMERS revenue were in line with 2011 movie year revenues, with revenue gains internationally, in particular, within the Emerging Markets, as well as Licensing.","NERF delivered its largest year in history behind incredibly innovative new product and impactful global marketing campaigns. According to NPD, when combined together, NERF and NERF REBELLE would have been the second largest property in the U.S. in 2014. For MARVEL, compelling entertainment and innovation across several franchises resulted in strong growth for MARVEL properties in 2014. Each of these was a significant contributor to Hasbro's growth versus 2013. The Girls category posted its second straight billion dollar year, growing revenues 2%. We have made tremendous progress in building brands that Girls around the world want to experience. MY LITTLE PONY and MY LITTLE PONY EQUESTRIA GIRLS, NERF REBELLE and the launch of PLAY-DOH DOHVINCI all contributed to this growth, and offset a significant decline in Furby, which was in its third year in English-speaking markets.","LITTLEST PET SHOP, our only Franchise Brand, which did not grow for the full year 2014, was relaunched in the second half of the year. Revenues grew slightly in the fourth quarter across Hasbro, and increased for the full year in the U.S. and Canada segment. We continue to build our Girls portfolio, and have a number of exciting new initiatives over the coming years. Our ongoing development of a more contemporary and relevant Games business continued in 2014. MAGIC: THE GATHERING and MONOPOLY, revenues both increased as did revenue for several of our brands, including SIMON and THE GAME OF LIFE. ANGRY BIRDS, DUELMASTERS and TWISTER were among the initiatives that declined in 2014. Over the past few years, we have invested in building our gaming capabilities across analog and digital platforms, including new gaming experiences across our portfolio and investments in the digital platform for MAGIC: THE GATHERING. We continue to build MAGIC: THE GATHERING as a compelling brand experience for our players, and they remain significant growth opportunity globally.","Despite a slight revenue decline in 2014, our core gaming brands and our approach to gaming, including our retail execution, have evolved and strengthened significantly over the past few years. We are well positioned to continue driving innovative gaming experiences for global consumers.","Finally, the Preschool category revenues declined 4% in 2014. Throughout the year, PLAY-DOH and TRANSFORMERS RESCUE BOTS performed very well, but were offset by declines in core PLAYSKOOL and SESAME STREET. In Preschool, we are focused on Hasbro Franchise Brands and story-led initiatives, where we believe we can differentiate our offerings and deliver higher profitability. While revenue has declined, today's revenue commands a higher margin and our profitability is growing. For 2015, we have new initiatives across our portfolio of Hasbro and partner brands. We look forward to sharing these with you on Friday at Toy Fair.","In support of our brand development efforts, we also furthered content and digital capabilities last year. Hasbro Studios continues to drive storytelling and brand activation. Our shows were among the highest rated shows globally where they appear, and today are airing at a 100% of the territories into which they sell. Storytelling is unlocking incremental revenue and earnings power in our business. In October, in the U.S., Discovery Family debuted in partnership with Discovery Communications. We incurred incremental costs in 2014 associated with this transition, but we believe these changes enhance the value of this network and its long-term profitability. We're already seeing improved ratings on the network, including the best December since forming the joint venture. Discovery Family remains the most co-viewed network in terms of percentages of adults and kids watching together across all kids networks. Hasbro studio shows are prominently featured on the network. Since debuting in October 2014, Discovery Family Channel has aired more than 1,000 total hours of Hasbro content with an average of 68 hours per week to date. We also advanced our film strategy with multiple films in development with studio partners and the formation of Allspark Pictures. Similar to television, we are making strategic investments with our resources and in selective instances, our capital, where we believe we can deliver higher returns and more compelling brand experiences.","Finally, our continuous determined drive to build on our consumer-centric insights, brands resonance and operational efficiencies are paying off with growth and profitability across all segments. At the same time, we are investing in future brands and capabilities while returning significant capital to our shareholders. We look forward to sharing with you more about our plans for 2015 and beyond later this week at Toy Fair.","I would like to now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deborah M. Thomas","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As Brian said, 2014 was a good year for Hasbro, as revenues and profit grew. We returned significant capital to shareholders, and our underlying financial performance was strong despite several challenges in the marketplace, including a large negative foreign exchange impact at the end of the year. Our business grew across segments, geographies and franchise and partner brands. Our investments in new markets, in global teams and in new capabilities and systems enabled this performance, and our ongoing focus toward lowering cost and maximizing profitability is delivering results. We ended 2014 in a strong financial position. We generated $454 million in operating cash flow, and ended the year with $893 million of cash on the balance sheet.","Before we discuss the year's results, please note there were a number of charges and benefits in both 2014 and 2013. We've included a reconciliation of both years to reported amounts in today's release and the presentation accompanying this call. During my discussion of our business, I will exclude these items as they do not speak to the underlying performance of Hasbro.","Looking at our segments for the full year 2014, revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 1%. Growth in the Boys category offset declines in the Girls Games and Preschool categories. All 7 of Hasbro's Franchise Brands grew revenues in 2014, as did MARVEL properties. This growth more than offset the expected declines in Furby and BEYBLADE. Our U.S. business is posting positive gains after several challenging years. Franchise Brand POS was up 31% in 2014 and we're well positioned from an inventory and brand initiative standpoint for 2015. In Canada, revenue declined in the year, but point-of-sale at our retailers increased.","Looking ahead to 2015, given Target's decision to exit the Canadian market, the environment will be more challenging. Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 7% for the year, reflecting the higher revenue levels and improved expense leverage. In the international segment, full year 2014 revenues increased 8%, with 6% growth in Europe, 14% growth in Latin America and 10% growth in Asia-Pacific. Emerging market revenues increased 20%. For the year, foreign exchange had a negative $87.7 million impact on revenues for this segment. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, international segment revenues grew 13% and Emerging Markets grew approximately 30%. Internationally, the Boys, Girls and Preschool categories all grew revenues in 2014, and more than offset a decline in the Games category.","As in the U.S. and Canada segment, strong growth in Hasbro Franchise Brands was further supported by growth in MARVEL products. 6 of our 7 Franchise Brands grew, and this growth was partially offset by declines in Furby and BEYBLADE. Operating profit increased 17% in the international segment on higher revenues and improved expense leverage. We continue to make investments in certain international territories to build our brands, enhance our talent and build new capabilities. In 2015, the International segment and Hasbro overall faced difficult comparisons, given the current foreign exchange environment and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. 55% of our 2014 revenues were denominated in U.S. dollars. The next largest currency was the euro at 16% of revenues, and all other currencies were less than 5% each of revenues. Total Hasbro 2014 revenues translated at current foreign exchange rates would be approximately $250 million lower than what we reported. Translation not only impacts our top line revenues, but our profitability as well. Given the impact from foreign exchange occurred so late in the year, it had an approximate $25 million negative impact on net earnings. While we anticipate raising prices in many markets outside the U.S. to recover some of the profitability in these markets, the comparison will be difficult.","Our final major segment, the Entertainment and Licensing segment, grew revenues 15%. Growth in lifestyle licensing revenues for Hasbro Franchise Brands, including MY LITTLE PONY and TRANSFORMERS, was the primary driver behind the record year for this segment. The Entertainment and Licensing segment operating profit increased 28% on an adjusted basis, reflecting the higher lifestyle Licensing revenues in the year. For Hasbro, overall, higher revenue and improved expense leverage delivered higher overall profitability in 2014, both in operating profit dollars and margin. Cost of sales, as a percentage of revenue, declined to 39.7% versus 40.7% in 2013. As we experienced throughout the year, growth in entertainment properties, including TRANSFORMERS and MARVEL, as well as higher Entertainment and Licensing revenues, were the primary contributors to this improvement. With the growth in Entertainment-backed revenues, royalty expense also increased. For 2014, royalty expense increased to 7.2% of revenues. This is in line with our stated expectation of being within the range of our 5-year average of 7.3%. Full year product development expense increased to 5.2% of revenues. Investment in our brands and innovation is ongoing and strategically important for Hasbro. As we previously communicated, we began development of the Disney Princess and Frozen properties in the fourth quarter, ahead of revenues which do not commence until 2016. As a result, as anticipated, 2014 product development expense was above the high end of our typical product development range of 4.5% to 5%. In 2015, we anticipate product development as a percent of sales to be in the range of 5% to 5.5%. This expense should return to our more normalized range in future years, as we begin to recognize revenues associated with the Disney Princess and Frozen properties. Intangible amortization declined to $52.7 million for the year, as some of our assets had been fully amortized.","The program production cost amortization declined slightly, and remained near the 1.1% of revenues we projected for the full year. Brian discussed the importance of storytelling, and the role film and television has in building brands globally. We will continue investing in content creation to build our brands. SD&A increased 6%, slightly ahead of our revenue growth for the year. As we discussed previously, we're making investments in our business, including our digital capabilities with MAGIC: THE GATHERING and Backflip, where we've increased staff, and had a full year of expense versus 2013. Additionally, equity compensation increased in 2014 versus 2013, as did depreciation associated with systems in which we've invested. Our efforts to lower our underlying cost basis have unlocked additional earnings power in our business, while enabling us to invest in new capabilities, innovations and systems to drive the growth of Hasbro over the long-term.","Turning to our results below operating profit for the quarter. Other expense for the year was $8.5 million compared to $9.7 million in 2013. Our share of the operating income of Discovery Family Channel was $7.8 million versus a loss of $2.4 million in 2013. We also record the impact of foreign exchange transactions in this line. In 2014, given the dramatic swings in currency devaluations during the year, most notably, the significant drop at year-end in the euro, ruble and real against the U.S. dollar, we recorded an expense of $20.9 million versus an expense of $5.2 million last year. There are also 2 large items in our reported other expense I want to highlight. The first is that 2014 reported other expense included $29.8 million associated with restructuring our equity investment in the Discovery Family Channel joint venture. The second is that reported other expense for the year also included $36 million from the sale of our license rights associated with intellectual property. Our 2014 underlying tax rate was 26.5% versus 25.8% in 2013. For 2015, we currently expect our full year underlying tax rate to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%, reflecting continued higher anticipated earnings in the U.S.","During the fourth quarter, in the interest of resolving a long-standing dispute, Hasbro reached a settlement for the years 2000 to the end of 2013 with the Mexican Tax Authorities. This is in line with our previously stated expectations totaling $65 million in tax payments. This settlement does not materially impact our overall tax rate in future periods. We remain committed to meeting our tax obligations around the world, and for the end of 2013, are no longer subject to audit in most markets. For the full year, average diluted shares were 129.9 million shares compared to 131.8 million last year. The actual amount of shares outstanding at the end of 2014 was 124.5 million. Diluted earnings per share, absent charges and benefits, for the full year 2014 were $3.15 versus $2.83 in 2013.","We returned $677.6 million to shareholders in 2014, $216.9 million in cash dividends, and $460.7 million in share repurchase. Given the availability of cash in the U.S., we increased our repurchase activity in 2014. Our expectation is that 2015 share repurchases will return to a lower more normalized level. At year-end, $64.2 million remained available in our current share repurchase authorization, and today, we announced our Board has approved a new $500 million share repurchase authorization. Additionally, we announced today that the board has approved a $0.03 per share or 7% increase in the quarterly dividend. The new quarterly dividend rate of $0.46 per share will be payable on May 15 to shareholders of record on May 1. We remain committed to investing in our business and returning excess capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Receivables at year-end were essentially flat with 2013, and DSOs declined 1 day to 76 days. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, receivables increased approximately 10%. Inventories declined $9.2 million versus last year and is of good quality. Inventory in the U.S. and Canada declined, while inventory in growing international markets, in particular, Emerging Markets, increased. Adjusting for a negative foreign exchange impact, inventory increased 8%. We also ended 2014 with good inventory positions at our retailers.","In closing, 2014 was a good year for Hasbro as the team delivered improvements in both revenue and profits globally, and both our financial and cash positions are strong. We believe in the underlying top and bottom line strength in our business, and we're well positioned to capitalize on our innovative lines and robust entertainment in 2015, while we continue to invest for growth in our business for the long-term.","I look forward to seeing you at Toy Fair later this week to further outline our initiatives and financial outlook for 2015. Brian and I are now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Sean McGowan with Needham & Company.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I have a couple of questions, if I can. First, can you give us an update on what's happening with Backflip Studios, and should we expect in 2015 to see some Hasbro properties coming out of that studio?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, good morning, Sean. We will start to see Hasbro Studios and Hasbro brands properties coming out from Backflip Studios this third and fourth quarter. We've had a few that were more about network building than revenue generation early on, but you'll see a significant increase in Hasbro Studios brand, Hasbro brands properties. The other element is they are working on some new exciting brands within the Backflip portfolio, including something very exciting with DragonVale.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Did anything else go on with their other properties during 2014?","Brian D. Goldner","No. They continue to have NinJump and Paper Toss and several other brands that they launched, PLUNDERNAUTS and Seabeard, but DragonVale, obviously, is the largest brand, their Franchise Brand, if you will, and they're working on an exciting new initiative around DragonVale for the second half of this year.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. You may have said this in the remarks or maybe I didn't catch it clearly. What was the performance of MAGIC in the fourth quarter? Was that up?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, it was. Yes.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Can you just remind us why the change from 2 sets to -- I mean, from 4 to 2 sets?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, we actually -- for 2015, there are a couple of things going on. So there are more than 2 initiatives that are going on that we'll launch in 2015. We'll have 2 sets, but then we also have an additional, the core set. So in fact, it's a transition, and the teams got some pretty robust storytelling plans around that brand. And again, we're very excited about what we're seeing in MAGIC, the momentum in MAGIC continues. The number of Friday gaming sessions has increased. We're up to nearly 7,000 every Friday, where fans are getting together to play. We have additional tournaments this year around several of the releases. By summer, we'll have a tournament that will actually take place in 3 different countries around the world. So in fact, I think MAGIC and the opportunity for MAGIC players to play face-to-face in a number of different ways increases throughout the year.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then last question, can you help us understand what the impact was, if any, to Hasbro from these West Coast port disruptions? I mean, was -- did you recognize some sales earlier than the fourth quarter, and what do you think the impact will be in the first half of 2015?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. I think you have to -- you divide up our business between our domestic inventory that we carry into the U.S. into our warehouses. Our team did a tremendous job of thinking through what might happen with West Coast ports and brought more into the East Coast throughout 2014. We didn't advance shipments. We just took those shipments, and took the extra time that we knew it would take to get to the East Coast. It resulted in slightly higher cost, although we expanded the U.S. business' operating margin at the same time. The impact really comes when you look at the way retailers take their FOB or direct import shipments because they, in certain instances, continued to bring those into the West Coast more prevalently, and that's why we commented that early in the year, you might see some shipments continue to come in to the first quarter, but we think for the full year, we don't see any impact to our 2015 numbers.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So with the impact to a company like Hasbro be that open to buys might be lower in the first half because retailers are still taking a product that they had thought would come in early, is that what you mean?","Brian D. Goldner","I think it's not prevalent among retailers. I think there's probably 1 or 2 retailers that their direct import business will carry over into 2015 a bit. And so I think in the first quarter, certainly, we're going to see a little bit of that come in, not impacting Hasbro per se, as much as maybe their total direct import shipments, but we don't think that, that has an impact beyond the first half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Schwartz with SunTrust Robinson.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to touch on, Brian, you made a bunch of commentary just around POS, and maybe I missed some of it. So can you maybe go over that again just in terms of how POS looked to the fourth quarter into '15 maybe by regions, if possible?","Brian D. Goldner","Sure. In the U.S., what I was saying is that our POS in the fourth quarter and for the full year was down slightly single digits. However, it was really impacted by high dollar sales items like Furby, and obviously, the dollar sales associated BEYBLADE. So my point was, if you took out either of those initiatives, our POS for the year in the quarter would have been up. So again, it's not related to the underlying strength of several of our segments, it was related to the absolute dollars, and please keep in mind that POS doesn't count all of the sales that we have in the U.S. because, obviously, MAGIC -- 4\/5 of MAGIC is outside of the purview of major retailers and POS inside NPD is about 90% of our sales, so they're sales outside. Then if you look at our international business, POS both for the quarter and for the full year was up significantly in a number of markets, was up overall, with the exception of really 2 where we have data. So it was up in Canada, up in Mexico, Australia, up in the U.K., up in Spain, and POS was down single digits in France and Germany.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And that's for the full year?","Brian D. Goldner","That was for the full year and the fourth quarter.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","That's great. And then just -- you had mentioned specifically just the closing of a part of Canada's -- can you give us any sense how large that business is for you and maybe how you kind of deal with that in the year ahead? I'm assuming inventory will be adjusting around and some other things.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, I think that in the short term, it impacts our business. Longer term, we've already heard from several customers who plan to expand their businesses in Canada, who had great success in Canada, and so we think this is more of a short-term issue as stores and store locations close, change hands, and perhaps reopen under new ownership. And it's just a matter of working through that process. Overall, the Canadian business in terms of POS was quite good for the year, and our brands continue to resonate quite well up there. So I think this is a matter of working through some shorter-term issues, 2015 related issues as we change out for kind of dominant retailers in that territory.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Stephanie Wissink with Piper Jaffray.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a couple of questions if I can. Deb, one for you. With respect to your comment that the revenue is now commanding a higher margin, can you just talk about the next couple of years, are there any major investments we should be aware of or can we assume that this incremental margin continues to expand here over the next, I would say, 1 to 2 years? And then Brian, a question for you. I'm just curious, as you think about the STAR WARS opportunity, your international business and your global distribution platform has evolved substantially since 2008. Does that change either how you think about the potential volume or the profitability of that business as we face that opportunity in the back half of this year?","Brian D. Goldner","Sure. Why don't I -- I'll start with the brand, and then Deb can -- will come back and talk about expanding operating margins. I think STAR WARS, there are several elements to the brand that are both new and different as we go forward this year. Obviously, the new initiative, we saw great success around the television that was on in the fourth quarter of 2014, and how it helped to drive the STAR WARS brand. We all know how content really drives that brand, as well as many others. We're very excited about the movie, but the movie does come later in the year, December 18, 2015, and so therefore, I would expect that our revenues for the first movie would be split across calendar years, and I would hope that people would recognize that you'd see a couple of quarters of impact to STAR WARS this year, and then into '16 for several quarters, and really into what becomes several years of STAR WARS positive impact between the trilogy movies, and then the new stories that will be told. The second piece, as you asked about globality, clearly, what we've seen in MARVEL is the impact of Disney, our partnership with Disney, our increasing global scope and scale, their increased global scope and scale. We're seeing a more internationally-oriented MARVEL business. We also saw a more internationally-oriented TRANSFORMERS business this past year because we are having impact in so many territories, and we would expect that to carry forward for STAR WARS. As we are starting to see increases in operating margin in those regions, we would expect over time to see increases in operating margin, but recognize that, today, our international territories in Emerging Markets operating margin are below the company average operating margin. So I think that, that does have a mitigating impact in the short term and an expanded operating margin opportunity in the longer term. The last piece I'll note is that the excitement around STAR WARS is significant, and I think that there are a number of licensees that have the opportunity to share in that brand, and therefore, we are going to do all that we can. We have an amazing innovations in action figures and role play and games and several other categories. We can't wait to show the line. There are others that also will have the opportunity to sell in market, STAR WARS product coming this fall, and then throughout the trilogy series.","Deborah M. Thomas","So the other things that are impacting our margin, we did see an improvement in our gross margin this year, and that was due to the success of our brands, particularly our Franchise Brands. But one of the headwinds that we talked about for next year is foreign exchange. Many of our product costs are denominated in U.S. or Hong Kong dollars, which had stayed pretty stable, as the U.S. dollar has strengthened against foreign exchange. So while over the longer term we do have the opportunity, as Brian was saying, to really adjust for the currency impact because of the rate and pace of the change, it had a more significant impact for us in the fourth quarter, but will continue to have an impact to us in 2015. So as far as hedging, as you know, we hedged a substantial amount of our product purchases, but not all of it. And I think on a blended basis, we've hedged about just under 70% for 2015. So we'll continue to be impacted by currency from that, and we will continue to invest in MAGIC: THE GATHERING online and in projects that create the longer-term cost efficiency. So we've talked about in the past our $100 million cost-savings initiative, which we've established about $90 million through the end of 2014, and we've identified that final $10 million, we'll talk a little bit more about that on Friday. But for us, it's really about investing in our business and putting things in place that create those longer-term efficiencies, still allowing us to invest in creative storytelling and innovative product line. So the one other thing that we have impacting our margins on the shorter-term basis is the development expense for Disney Princess and Frozen line because I'll just remind you, we don't have revenue that coincides with that until 2016.","Brian D. Goldner","And while we're continuing to drive, develop and create new storytelling, our cash expense in storytelling have declined '14 versus '13. And as we build efficiencies and experience in how to create content, we're able to sort of take that into account as we go forward.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That's really helpful. Deb, just one more follow-up on resin. Can you just give us a level of exposure in your cost of sales that's related to resin and any benefit from oil costing coming down?","Brian D. Goldner","If you look at the -- if you take our total cost of goods, it's 39.7% this past year. If you take the percentage that's resin, it's 5.7 percentage points of that 39.7%. So actually, labor and paperboard are higher as a percent of cost as a component of our total cost of goods. So what we've seen in the past, what we tend to see, is that resin falls in arrears to oil prices because, obviously, it's a produced product beyond just crude oil. So over time, we would expect to get some benefit, but again, try to size the impact overall.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions here. I wanted to revisit your POS in Europe. You called out a few countries to where it was strong in Western Europe and a couple were just down a little bit. But as a whole, maybe if you want to include Eastern Europe or not, your shipment seemed quite a bit above that POS, and just maybe kind of help us with the difference between those 2, and then...","Brian D. Goldner","No, actually. Yes, okay, sorry -- go ahead.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","No, go ahead, Brian, that may change my second question.","Brian D. Goldner","Okay. Yes, so if we look at Europe, we said that the revenues were up 6% for the year in Europe, obviously, up stronger in Emerging Markets, so Eastern Europe and Russia were up better than that. Our inventories are very much in line with our sales. If you look at inventories at year-end, you'll see that they are really aligned to where the sales have occurred. So across Europe, what we saw is that POS increases were absolutely in that range. U.K., for example, was 8% POS increase for the year, and I would say that inventories today are very much in line with those kinds of sales increases. We don't see significant issues and pockets of inventory. I think we've managed that very well. The inventory is really following the rate of sale globally. Inventories also, obviously, going into Latin America. We don't have specific POS data the way that it's reported through NPD. We have our own data, and we've seen great performance throughout Latin America. Obviously, the region was up by 14%, and we saw great growth in -- not only Brazil, but Columbia, Peru and into Mexico, and I would say, again, we're very comfortable with the inventories we have, and the inventories are following our sales growth globally.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. That's very helpful. Then the second question is, whoever wants to take this, as you look to '15, and I know, in general, you don't give a lot of specific guidance. But as you look at '15 on a reported sales basis, if currency rates hold at yesterday or Friday's level or whatever near benchmark you're using here, and given the headwinds in Canada, do you expect reported sales growth at this point for '15?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, let me say it this way because we've look at, and really thought about where our business is in '15, and you're right, we don't provide specific guidance. But I would tell you that we feel very comfortable in saying that our underlying growth in our brands and our underlying growth in our operating profit in '15 should be positive. We feel we have the initiatives, certainly, across all of our major segments. As we look at FX, there's really 3 elements to the impact of 4x. It was the size of change, the rate of change and then the range of currencies impacted. In the case of the fourth quarter, all 3 came in at high levels, if you will, the size of the change, the speed of the change and the rate of currency. Obviously, with a bit more time, we start to address that. Deb noted that in her comments that we begin to address that as we look at our longer-term cost of goods and in the short-term pricing for products to recover those revenues and earnings power in the country. So I would be -- it would be too early for us to say one way or the other, because again, we don't know exactly where FX will be. But I will tell you, the underlying strength of our company and the strength of our people running countries around the world, I feel very confident in the underlying strength of our brands and our trajectory for 2015.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So again, Brian, by saying underlying, you're saying excluding FX, you feel highly confident in both of those being up?","Brian D. Goldner","That's right, yes. The underlying strength means absent FX. I don't know if you want to comment further.","Deborah M. Thomas","We have, and we do, as Brian said, we feel pretty good about the initiatives we have for '15 and the underlying top and bottom line strength of our business. But I'll remind you, in case you missed it in our prepared remarks, currency does have a big impact on a translation standpoint, and we don't hedge for translation, and at current rates, it would had about a $250 million impact on our reported earnings for 2015 -- '14.","Brian D. Goldner","Reported revenue.","Deborah M. Thomas","Reported revenue, sorry.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Last question, Furby, BEYBLADE, really not a comparable factor for '15 at this point?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, actually, although we'd all like to move beyond the comparisons, I think BEYBLADE becomes de minimis in 2015. Furby has performed very well, was down to a significant degree, but please remember that in non-English-speaking markets, Furby Boom just launched in fall of 2014. So Furby still represents a sizable brand and business in our international market, and therefore, we'll probably continue to talk about Furby comparisons for a bit of time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Taposh Bari with Goldman Sachs.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I had a question on capital allocation. It's nice to see that you're raising your dividend, as well as your buyback authorization this morning. But I was hoping, Brian, you can speak your philosophy around M&A, and specifically, acquisition criteria, and where acquisitions fall in your list of cash priorities.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. Well, thank you for the question. If you look over the last 5 years, this management team has returned 143% of net earnings to its shareholders via both the dividend and the share buyback. Last year, nearly $680 million returned, $217 million of which was in a dividend, $461 million of which was in buybacks. Deb will talk more about capital structure, but you have a management team that's very committed to returning excess capital to shareholders. We still also believe strongly in investing in our business, and we're also building our brands and innovation insight and storytelling capabilities organically as we speak, and certainly we think given the global growth potential of something like MAGIC: THE GATHERING, and its strong profitability that enjoys investing in that brand for longer-term growth is certainly warranted, and I think something our shareholders would support. And in terms of specific M&A, there's not anything that we look at today that where we say that there's something out there that we're thinking about at all, and that we continue to be skeptical about M&A activity. I think that we focus on our brand blueprint, and the acquisition we made in Backflip were really working to get Backflip to grow and to invest there so that we can be more a player in that mobile gaming space where we see both kids and casual players going.","Taposh Bari - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just another kind of philosophical question around your portfolio, you have several owned brands and many licensed brands with good momentum today. As we think about the company, let's say, 5 years out, I know it's a long time from now, but how do you envision the owned segment of your portfolio? You've got properties like TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY, NERF, extremely good momentum. If we look out 5 years from now, are we looking at a whole new set of brands, whether organically created or acquired, that could be needle movers within the portfolio or are TRANSFORMERS and MY LITTLE PONY and the likes going to be even bigger contributors to the portfolio?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. I think there are really 3 elements to our brand building and the way we look at brand building. The first in the early 2000s was building our core brands, which are now Franchise Brands, and continuing to foster growth there; secondly, major brand adjacencies. You've seen the success of things like NERF REBELLE, DOHVINCI, EQUESTRIA GIRLS. You'll continue to see those adjacencies. And as we move forward here over the next bit, including 2015, you're going to see some new brands, and we'll begin to add new brands. Some of them will be vault brands that Hasbro owns and controls, and some will be new brands that we invent, and some may be some from our partners over the next period of time, and we'll talk more about that. John Frascotti will lead the discussion of that on Friday as we start to talk about 2015, and you'll certainly see entrance in all 3 of those areas. We do believe that our Franchise Brands can be much larger. We're starting to see our brands get to highest ever revenues. We talked about how NERF is performing, and certainly, PLAY-DOH and MY LITTLE PONY, and that we've moved those brands significantly versus when we first started, but there's still a lot of headroom and growth for our Franchise Brands globally over the next several years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Brian, in your prepared remarks and throughout this call, when you talked about the performance of Girls, you mentioned a number of things that were headwinds there. But we do not hear you talk about the competitive environment, particularly given Frozen and how popular that was, so just wondering was that an impact at all in your Girls business? And if so, how should we expect that to continue to be a headwind, if at all, in early '15?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. We saw very strong growth with our Franchise Brands in our Girls business. The one headwind I talked about in Girls was Furby, and I would say that unfortunately, to talk about Furby as a headwind, it's one of our brands, but it was a headwind. It was a headwind in the fourth quarter, had a large impact in the fourth quarter, and frankly, throughout the year, but clearly, the fourth quarter had significant impact. If we look at the growth of our Franchise Brands, MY LITTLE PONY had a very strong year, up double digits, both in the fourth quarter and for the full year, EQUESTRIA GIRLS contributed significantly to that brand. In addition, NERF REBELLE has really performed well. PLAY-DOH DOHVINCI is off to a very strong start. So I would not view the Frozen success in any way as impeding our progress as a company. We think that Frozen and the Princes business is very complementary to what we are currently working on, and EQUESTRIA GIRLS is very different than the Frozen brand and recipients of those 2 brands, very complementary. So what we would say is a great opportunity for growth, we're very excited about the developments we are undertaking in 2015 around Frozen and Disney Princess, and we're very excited about 2016 as we bring product out to the market, and we may show you a few things later this week that are equally exciting for 2015 in our Girls arena, but I'll leave that to the team to share that with you on Friday.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess that's a little teaser to get us all out, huh?","Deborah M. Thomas","[indiscernible]","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then, Brian, folks have asked this question in a number of ways. I'm going to go forward here. You say -- especially in the first half of 2015, you say there's different puts and takes because you have the headwinds that you've talked about. You faced tough comps in Boys. We have the Target, the issue of Canada, Target in Canada. You have FX. You have the -- the stuff you talked about in the port issues, although you said that might not affect you as much, Furby, but you also have tailwinds in the first half, which you've alluded to, which I'm sure we'll see some of that on Friday. Are you -- when you think about the headwinds, the tailwinds, are you optimistic that the tailwinds can offset the headwinds in the first half because that's really what investors are most focused on right now?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. If you talk about the Boys business, I know that we're talking about tough comparisons, but we have a line up, as I indicated a year ago. We said we were entering the first year of an unprecedented era of new Boys entertainment coming to the market, and 2015, in our mind, is even better than 2014. You have Avengers that comes in early May. You have Jurassic World. We have Ant Man, the Fantastic Four, and then, obviously, in December, you have STAR WARS. So I would say that as we look at the year, we feel very good about the underlying strength of our brands, and we feel good about each of our categories of product that we're bringing to the marketplace. What we obviously are contending with was a very fast-changing foreign exchange environment. Over the longer term, companies like Hasbro have always been able to adapt to marketplace factors, and can address those issues, and we are already underway in addressing those issues, but, clearly, given the size and rate of change of ForEx, I would say that, that's probably, in the short term, the biggest headwind. And everything that management and our teams can control, we are controlling toward growth, with good momentum coming into '15. I also mentioned that our POS is quite good, is up in the U.S. and is quite strong throughout Europe, 2015 POS. So we're off to a very good start.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And Deb, should I just -- I know you gave us a lot of data on FX and translation and transaction and all that, and we can do -- crunch numbers all afternoon and figure that out, but should I just give up hope that you'll ever give us just a nice, easy sensitivity to work from?","Deborah M. Thomas","Felicia, if I had my crystal ball and I could do foreign exchange, I'd be happy to share that with you, but I do think it's important. If we just look at current rates, as Brian said, it really is the rate and pace of change. So rates declined so significantly at the end of the fourth quarter, and continued to go down into January. And of late, they've been a little bit more stable, but still went down from there. At current rates would have had a $250 million impact to our reported revenues. That being said, over the long term, we believe it will still have about a 10 -- any impact you model in from foreign exchange would have about a 10% to 15% impact to earnings over the longer term.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just going back to the U.S. POS that was positive in 2015, which brands really stood out? Did anything change in terms of momentum you saw in the fourth quarter?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, what I had said, Greg, was just to be clear, absent either BEYBLADE or a Furby, you would see positive POS in the fourth quarter for our brands. So what that speaks to is the underlying strength of our brands, particularly, our Franchise Brands. Our Franchise Brand POS in the full year was up 30%, and revenues were up 30% as well. So we've seen strong growth in Franchise Brands, obviously, up some comparisons in -- comparing Furby and BEYBLADE, obviously, have some impact to overall POS. And then of course, MAGIC: THE GATHERING in the U.S. is outside of 80% of that business outside of the NPD data or the POS data, and we have said that MAGIC was up. Both in full year, it was up quite strongly in the fourth quarter with the new Khans of Tarkir launch and release, which has been very popular among players. So as we look at this underlying strength of our brands, Franchise Brands, and then our adjacencies, new brand adjacencies, as well as new brands, we feel that we are well positioned and have good momentum going into 2015.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Very helpful. And retail inventory being in a good position, if we go back to last time, this time last year, I was trying to read the transcript, and I didn't really see a comparable type of comment. So how would you characterize it last year? Was it in a good position, worse off, and now you're in a better position inventory level wise?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. I think that we certainly have inventories where we have sales growth. I think they're really well lined-up. I think a year ago, we were still clearing through a little bit of NERF inventory, maybe a little bit of LITTLEST PET SHOP inventory as we were changing over the brand for 2014. So overall, we would say we began the year 2015 with inventories in a good place, our retail inventories in a very good place, and our own inventories are strong as well and in the right spot. U.S. inventory is down. International inventory is up, and it tracks quite well up against the sales increases we've seen country-by-country.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Very helpful. And then I'll just bring -- because you had mentioned Toy Fair, is there one segment where if we're looking out at your new products that could really see an acceleration in growth from the level -- sort of innovation that you're going to be introducing? Should we look out for one category in particular?","Brian D. Goldner","Actually, I would say that you're going to see innovation across all the categories of our brands, and you'll see that on Friday. You're going to see new brand initiatives, core franchise initiatives and adjacencies, new in several instances, and we're going to take advantage of the momentum we have in our brands and add to that. And we've spent a significant amount of time looking at proprietary consumer research. Our team over the last year has interacted with nearly 80,000 consumers, kids and parents, in several countries around the world. So our investments in consumer insight are really leading us to these innovations and marketing initiatives because we want to understand our consumers and our audiences better than anybody else.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Can you guys just talk to any trends that you may have seen emerging in the Preschool space that's made it more difficult for everybody to compete? And then any color commentary you might have on the cadence of promotions at the retail channels since the end of the holiday season, would be great?","Brian D. Goldner","In Preschool, we've really seen that as kids have gotten a bit more media-savvy at a younger age that, clearly, characters and story-led brands are winning today. We've seen that in our own portfolio, where our TRANSFORMERS RESCUE BOTS performed quite well. We also have early creativity brands like PLAY-DOH, which have performed incredibly well and are doing so globally. It's one of our most global brands. I think that our focus has been in core PLAYSKOOL to bring some level of value to the company back in getting our profit margins more in line with our expectations, ensuring that we have innovative products that are valuable to the consumer and our customers, and also provide a good operating return to Hasbro. So looking at the innovations, and you'll see some things at the end of the week that bring great innovation back to that core PLAYSKOOL business, and do so in a way that enables our customers and Hasbro to make money, and I think that's one of the watchwords. The other area that we're very excited about is in SESAME STREET. Again, I don't want to steal the team's thunder, but there's some new product in that area for the fourth -- third and fourth quarter that is very exciting and very intuitive, so we're looking forward to launching that as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Wondered if you could talk about the impact of Discovery Family Channel now that you are below a 50% owner. How is that going to impact your P&L, and how should we be thinking about your TV development strategy?","Deborah M. Thomas","Sure. Well, certainly, from our television development strategy, as Brian mentioned earlier, we remain committed to our storytelling capabilities because we really see the benefit that has in our brand. And while we develop programming for Discovery Family Channel, which we will continue to do, we then take that programming and leverage it by selling it internationally and through other channels. So it really is more of an effort in that spend for us than just the U.S. brand, but what we've seen now is Discovery Family is that the network continues to perform well. As we said, we had some charges that we kind of called out in the third and fourth quarter just because they're not ongoing, but overall, the network has moved to a profit, and we continue to expect it to do well. We'll still program a good part of the day part, and so our programming still is doing very well on Discovery Family Channel.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","So your overall programming hours, you don't expect is going to be changing?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. In fact, we noted that since the relaunch in October, we had aired over 1,000 hours of programming on the channel, and it's, on average, about 68 hours a week. So we're primarily programming the daytime kids day parts. We have a range of library shows that are running, plus new shows that we're producing. As Deb said, we're then able to take those shows out around the world. One of the changes that we made as a result of the new relationship, the amended relationship, is the ability to take some of our shows out beyond the channel for a first run. So Transformers: Robots in Disguise, which is the new series, will air globally on Cartoon Network beginning next month, so that's a change. So both domestically and internationally, we'll air on Cartoon Network. What we're really seeing for the network is that it's performing quite well, particularly, for girls and younger boys, but we have this opportunity for a show like TRANSFORMERS that skews a bit, older boy, to go out to a network that's more suited for that programming.","Operator","Our final question is from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","I was hoping you could discuss the timing of shipments for movie-related products, so when will you begin shipping product for STAR WARS, Avengers, Jurassic World and anything else that might be material?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, typically, the range for shipping product is somewhere between 4 and 8 weeks before the launch of the movie. So Avengers is May 1. So in that range, you'll see the different retailers, depending on how quickly they're setting. And Jurassic mid-June. Minions is July 10. Ant Man's the 17 of July. Fantastic 4 is August 7, and then STAR WARS is December 18. STAR WARS, you'll probably see an effort that begins more in the fall with classic product, and then rolls into the movie product about on the timetable I just outlined. And then obviously, STAR WARS will continue into 2016. And each of those, as you'll recall, Gerrick, will have the kind of prior to movie, and then of course, they have windows as the movie hits, all different home entertainment windows marketing around that, new products around that. So it's not just the one and done window. It will carry forward for the year.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. Maybe to be a little bit more specific, when do you anticipate shipping the incremental STAR WARS movie related product? Will that be a back-to-school, July, August type shipment or will be October resets? When will that movie product hit shelf?","Brian D. Goldner","I'm not going to get specific on the call here, but I would say that you will see STAR WARS-related product on shelves in September overall, and then movie product will feather in as we get closer to the movie.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. And then can you quantify the incremental cost for the build-out of Disney Princess infrastructure? How much did it, I guess, hit the fourth quarter? And I know you gave us a range for R&D, but can you give us a sort of a dollar amount, all-in you're expecting to spend on this?","Deborah M. Thomas","Well, we did say that, as we mentioned in the third quarter, we expected to be at\/or above the high-end of our normal 4.5% to 5% range, and did have an impact. So our development expense was 5.2% of revenue for the full year of '14. We do expect that given development in our innovation, but also the impact, particularly of developing for the Disney Princess and Frozen line, without the related revenue, that we will be in the 5% to 5.5% range for 2015.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. And since I'm last here, I want to ask a few more. What was the sale of the license rights? What does that refer to?","Brian D. Goldner","We had a few non-core brands, where we didn't control the brand, where we had some underlying license rights that we sold to a third-party.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. Do you care to tell us what they were?","Brian D. Goldner","No, I'll leave it to them to talk about that.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay, okay. And then one last one, please? Your gross margin performance is quite nice in the quarter. Are you now -- are you fully reserved for any additional markdowns that may pop up in the first quarter? How do you feel about those reserve level?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, we feel very good about our reserves. Obviously, related to inventory and to promotions, and we enter the year with good momentum. We talked about early POS, and feel like we have the inventory in the right place, both in the U.S. and globally.","Operator","Thank you.

There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements.

Brian?","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. The Hasbro team's continued strong execution of our Brand Blueprint strategy is building immersive 360 degree experiences for our fans, children and their families. We continuously identify proprietary insight, create engaging storytelling, invent innovative new play experiences and execute in collaboration with global omni-channel retailers. Through our investment in brands and capabilities around the Blueprint, we are connecting with more consumer groups across more platforms and screens than at any time in our history.","Our first quarter results were consistent with the expectations we shared with you in February, and position us well to execute against the major theatrical and content releases as well as innovative new play experiences planned for the full year.","Revenues grew 2% against a very strong first quarter last year, and the negative impact of the Easter shift into this year's second quarter. In the first quarter, where small shifts have a big impact, operating profit was impacted by an extra week of expenses, and to a lesser extent, a shift in product mix. The mix included a shift to partner brand products with a higher cost of sales, notably Disney Frozen and Frozen, where we are investing, along with the decline in the quarter for our higher margin MAGIC: THE GATHERING business. As we noted at our Toy Fair investor meeting, these shifts were anticipated and we continue to forecast modest full year operating profit margin growth versus 2016 reported operating profit margin of 15.7%.","Net earnings grew 41% in the quarter to $0.54 per share, which Deb will speak to more in detail shortly. Our year is set up for success. Hasbro retained its position as the number one company in the G8 markets through the end of March according to NPD. And Hasbro is the number one company year-to-date through March in the U.S. Our point of sale was strong, increasing double digits globally. All regions POS grew and we drove double-digit growth in all brand portfolio categories: Franchise, Partner, Gaming, and Emerging Brands.","Easter was in the second quarter this year, versus the first quarter last year. Point of sale year-to-date through the Easter week also grew double digits, including growth in the Easter period, year over year. Hasbro net revenues grew in the U.S. and Canada segment and in the Entertainment and Licensing segment. International revenues were flat. Franchise brand revenues grew 2% in the quarter, led by growth in NERF, TRANSFORMERS, and MONOPOLY. The launch of NERF AccuStrike and the continued momentum in NERF Rival drove robust revenue growth. TRANSFORMERS recorded strong shipment and POS growth. We shipped a small amount of the TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHT line for today's on shelf date for movie supported consumer products. TRANSFORMERS also had strong support in digital gaming and Backflip Studios TRANSFORMERS: EARTH WARS continues to perform well.","While MY LITTLE PONY revenue declined in the quarter, brand engagement continues to be high in markets around the world as we prepare for the August 1 on-shelf date for our product line and consumer products supporting MY LITTLE PONY: THE MOVIE. Our investment in all screen storytelling continued with the April 15th premier of the seventh season of the MY LITTLE PONY FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC animated series. MAGIC: THE GATHERING revenue was negatively impacted by the timing of new story-led releases. As outlined at Toy Fair, the second quarter marks the release of the Amonkhet set, which is expected to deliver strong performance for this franchise brand.","Hasbro gaming grew 43% in the first quarter, with continued growth in PIE-FACE and SPEAK OUT, as well as the launch of several new games. In total, the Hasbro gaming category, including MONOPOLY and MAGIC: THE GATHERING grew 10%, with strong double-digit global POS increases.","Capitalizing on people's passion for playing games, this summer Hasbro Gaming is launching the Hasbro Gaming Crate. This all new subscription service brings game night to your doorstep, featuring all new games carefully selected by Hasbro gaming experts.","Further expanding gaming experiences, we announced an all new music mixing game DROPMIX. In partnership with Harmonix, this fast-paced game has players blending hit songs from award-winning artists. This new gaming system will be available beginning in September.","Emerging brand revenues increased 25% behind continued growth in BABY ALIVE and FURREAL FRIENDS. In addition, we launched Hanazuki earlier this year. To date, we have released over 200 minutes of content and are approaching 120 million views. We are developing plans to expand storytelling globally across screen.","Moving to Partner Brands, revenues declined as anticipated, 18% in the quarter. BEYBLADE, which is rolling out globally, and continued strength in DREAMWORKS' TROLLS contributed positively, but did not offset the declines in STAR WARS and MARVEL ahead of major theatrical launches this year. In May MARVEL's Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 2 will be released and product is rolling out globally now. Spider-Man: Homecoming opens in July, and November will see Thor: Ragnarok. Star Wars: The Last Jedi will be in theaters on December 15th, with Force Friday II scheduled for September 1 globally.","In addition, Star Wars Forces of Destiny, an original micro series of animated shorts by Lucasfilm was recently announced. This initiative celebrates the inspiring stories of iconic heroes from across the STAR WARS universe. Developed in collaboration with Disney and Lucasfilm, the shorts will launch in July and Hasbro's line of adventure figures, plus expanded role play offerings will debut in August. This innovative new line addresses broadening audiences while also appealing to existing fans.","This quarter was the anniversary of our launch of Hasbro's line of Disney Princess and Frozen fashion dolls and small dolls. Global point of sale was strong, including gains in Disney Princess and Frozen, plus the addition of Beauty and the Beast, Elena of Avalor, and Moana. We are seeing additional demand for Moana from streaming and home entertainment. This is a trend we are seeing and we look forward to the second window on other properties, including Beauty and the Beast later this year.","In closing, the first quarter was consistent with our expectation as we grew compared to a very strong first quarter last year. We are well-positioned to execute against the storytelling and brand initiatives for the year, while investing to expand the reach of our brands and deliver profitable growth for this year and future years. Deb will now speak further about the first quarter financial results. Deb?","Deborah M. Thomas - Hasbro, Inc.","Thank you, Brian and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter performance was in line with our expectations, and reinforces our full year outlook. As expected, 2017 began with a difficult comparison, yet we grew revenues 2%, and earnings per share 40%. Operating profit was negatively impacted by anticipated events in the quarter, including an extra week of expenses and a shift in product mix.","Given the first quarter's smaller relative size to other quarters of the year, these changes are amplified and are expected to smooth out over the course of the year. Net earnings increased to $68.6 million, and earnings per share increased to $0.54.","We experienced a $0.03 favorable foreign currency gain recorded in the other income line, as well as an $0.11 benefit from Hasbro's adoption of the new accounting standard governing stock-based compensation. This tax benefit was $0.03 higher than we forecasted in February due to the stock price appreciation over that time.","Hasbro is in a very strong financial position, with positive consumer takeaway, strong earnings, and a healthy balance sheet. For the quarter, revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 2%. Revenue growth in Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brands offset lower Partner Brand revenues and a 1% decline in Franchise Brands, primarily due to the decline in MAGIC: THE GATHERING.","In total, U.S. and Canada point of sale increased in the high single digits and remaining retail inventory is of good quality. Allowances during the quarter remained consistent with last year. Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment decreased 17%, or $13.6 million, due to the anticipated decline in MAGIC: THE GATHERING revenue and certain higher expenses.","International segment revenues were flat, including a positive $3 million impact from foreign exchange. Within the international segment, Franchise Brands, Hasbro Gaming, and Emerging Brands revenue increased. Partner Brand revenues declined. Point of sale grew across all three regions: Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific.","Retailer inventories are overall of good quality and while there are always certain regions with pockets of inventory, our overall inventory continues to be concentrated in new and growing brands.","Operating profit in the segment was $0.5 million, compared to $2.9 million last year. The $2.4 million decrease was the result of product mix and higher expenses in the quarter. Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues increased 24%, driven by growth in digital gaming, including Backflip Studios. Segment operating profit increased over 100%, or $5.9 million to $11.3 million in the quarter. The improvement came primarily from the growth in higher margin digital gaming revenues.","Overall, Hasbro operating profit decreased 9%, and operating profit margin was 9.2% versus 10.1% last year. In addition to a shift in product mix, the first quarter of this year had 14 weeks versus 13 weeks last year. Falling in the last week of the 2016 calendar year, the extra week does not drive much incremental revenue, but did drive incremental expense of approximately $7 million.","Cost of sales increased 6% to 36% of revenues. This reflected the shift in product mix, including in Partner Brands and MAGIC: THE GATHERING revenues and the timing of lower margin closeouts. These closeout sales have a lower gross margin and are part of our normal annual activity, but were more highly concentrated in the first quarter this year compared to a year ago, as we aligned around marketing for entertainment windows. The decline in Partner Brands drove an associated 8% decline in royalty expense. Combined, cost of sales and royalties increased 30 basis points.","Product development increased as a percent of revenues in the quarter, in part due to the incremental expense associated with the extra week and, more strategically, as we continue investing to drive innovation. SD&A increased as a percent of sales to 28.7%. We experienced higher expenses due to the extra week as well as investments in IT systems, higher IT depreciation, and higher compensation expense. We continue to expect full year SD&A to be in line with 2016 excluding the impairment charge as a percent of revenue.","Turning to our results below operating profit, other income was $17 million versus an expense of $2.7 million last year. Other income was driven primarily by foreign currency transaction gains this year, versus a loss last year, and to a lesser extent, higher interest income. The underlying tax rate was 24.9%, down from 26.5% in the first quarter last year, and versus the 24.5% for the full year 2016.","The quarter included $15.4 million in discrete tax benefits, primarily from our adoption of the new accounting standard governing stock compensation. As we discussed at Toy Fair, given the timing of Hasbro's equity grants, this impact is greatest in the first quarter.","The $0.11 benefit was higher than we had forecasted in February and reflects the incremental benefit of our stock price appreciation over that timeframe. The anticipated EPS impact for the remaining quarters of 2017 is approximately $0.015 per quarter. However, as we experienced in Q1, that impact is ultimately dependent on our stock price. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.54.","Our financial position is strong, including a healthy balance sheet with robust cash generation. We generated $411.9 million in operating cash flow in the quarter, and $916 million over the trailing 12-month period, ending the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash. Our capital priorities remain investing in our business, in particular, to enhance capabilities around the Brand Blueprint and returning excess cash to shareholders.","In the quarter, we returned $81.5 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchase program. On May 15, the first dividend at the 12% higher quarterly dividend rate of $0.57 per share will be paid. We repurchased 218,000 shares of common stock during the quarter at a total cost of $18.1 million. We continue to target repurchase levels for the full year in line with the $150 million we purchased last year. Repurchases are subject to market conditions and availability of U.S. cash.","Receivables at quarter end increased 1%, and day sales outstanding decreased one day to 72 days. Our accounts receivable are in good condition and collections continue to be strong. Inventories declined 10% in the quarter to $416 million. Overall, our inventories are in good shape, supported by disciplined execution from our team. With new merchandise coming in now, we're well-positioned for our second quarter focused on entertainment and new initiatives.","In closing, our first quarter positions us well for 2017, with strong consumer engagement and takeaway, investments to drive long-term growth of our business, and new entertainment and innovations slated throughout the year.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Brian.","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","Thank you, Deb. Before we take your questions, I want to thank the global Hasbro team for all they do in setting the highest standards for a responsible business. Last week, Hasbro was ranked number one on Corporate Responsibility, CR Magazine's 2017, 100 Best Corporate Citizen List, which ranks the Russell 1000 companies across seven categories. This is a tremendous honor and the result of years of work from our teams around the world.","Hasbro continues to be recognized by some of the world's most prestigious business rankings for our CSR commitments and advancements. It is a priority that our management and board have set, but it is the actions our teams take every day that sets the standard.

Our first question is from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","Morning, Drew.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Let me start with STAR WARS. Guys, I think you talked about having elevated inventory for that brand entering the year. Just give us an update as to where you are with that. And with Star Wars Celebration, I believe last week, how that impacted point of sales and the year-to-date figure you gave through Easter?","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","Yeah, STAR WARS at this point, we are seeing that we have a number of opportunities and are selling through product. We took advantage of the fact that we have Rogue One home entertainment, which broke just in early April, and we are seeing great sales on the Black Series and role play are some of the key drivers, the Black Series figures. We've kicked into a marketing program around joining the rebellion and we are moving into the 40th anniversary of the STAR WARS business, and certainly celebrating that. In fact, we'll also have the Early Bird set from 1977 coming out of Celebration, which we've re-imagined and will be on sale. And then, again, we will have, over the summer, Forces of Destiny, which we're very excited about, the micro series of animation, plus product in our adventure figures and role play, And then that takes us to our September 1 which is Force Friday II and certainly very excited about that moving into the movie in December, mid-December.","So overall, what we've seen is that STAR WARS year-on-year continues to perform and we've taken advantage, as Deb noted in our remarks, of marketing windows and entertainment windows to move through additional inventories in the first quarter.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then moving over to BEYBLADE, I know it's really early. But any commentary on the launch and just general consumer interest in the line, relative to the last product cycle? And then on NERF NITRO, can you just give us a sense as to what the timing is of the launch of that product?","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","Sure. BEYBLADE is only off to a start in a few markets but off to a very good start. And we've seen a very good start in Australia and very early days in the U.S. but a very good start here. And it will begin rolling out around the world. So, I would say staged and rolling out around the world as we have entertainment placed, but the play pattern is really compelling with BEYBLADE BURSTS. So, I'm very excited about that. And NERF NITRO will kick in late summer into fall sets and we're very excited. But NERF year-to-date has performed at a very high level. AccuStrike has gotten off to a very strong start. We continue to see great growth in NERF RIVAL and that brand is experiencing very robust growth and very robust sell-through, along with a lot of our product line.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. I'll jump back into the queue. Thanks, guys.","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","Morning.","Deborah M. Thomas - Hasbro, Inc.","Morning, Felicia.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. So, not to get caught up in semantics and hold you too much to this, but \u2013 so in the release and your prepared remarks you said that first quarter was in line with previously communicated expectations, but you did better on revenues, because you guys were guiding for the first quarter that revenues would be down a bit and they were up 2%. So, I'm assuming that when you talked about in line with expectations you were meaning overall. But given that you've kind of provided that guidance within six weeks to go in the quarter, I was just wondering what drove the better than expected revenues.","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","Well, we're really seeing great acceleration in several categories. Our Gaming business up 43%, including great contributions from Backflip Studios, continued great growth in digital gaming. Our emerging brands are just accelerating. The BABY ALIVE team and FURREAL FRIENDS team have done a great job. So that business is up within our Emerging Brands.","And, of course, our Franchise Brands, we've seen great acceleration in the TRANSFORMERS business. So, I think, as we were talking about guidance, clearly for us revenues growth is important, but as you know, earnings growth and profitability are important for us as well over time. And so we had noted that we would have this extra week, and the week does fall at the end of the year. So that's a week primarily of expenses with very little revenue between Christmas and New Year's with very little shipments. We had a mix shift that we spoke to within our Partner Brands where we're mixing more into Princess and Frozen where we continue to invest in that business for innovations and for the full year. So, that obviously had an impact.","We talked about MAGIC: THE GATHERING being our release schedule for our storytelling being more Q2 and Q4 oriented this year with Qs 1 and 3 probably being down a bit. So, I think overall, we tried to paint a picture in February that's been primarily borne out. Clearly, our point of sale, it's very robust and that's been very helpful for us around the world. It's up in the mid-teens around the world. And very, very strong growth in regions, which has enabled us to both have overall lower inventories, but also lower inventories at retail in the U.S. So we're selling out through product and setting ourselves up well for the full year situation. So, I would say overall, we are, in fact, pretty consistent with what we said back in February.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then can you just give us some point of sales color for the quarter in the U.S. and then also, if you have it, for the top five Euro markets?","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","Sure. Overall in the U.S., as Deb noted in her comments, U.S. is high single-digit growth in Toy and Game. And then we also have very strong growth in Emerging Brands, double digit growth in Emerging Brands and in Gaming. Our online POS was very strong and, again, continues to run ahead of our overall POS growth. We have really good data, particularly for our U.S. business and it was very strong growth. And we can talk more about that in a moment.","Global POS was up mid-teens, but with certain regions up even higher, like Europe and Latin America. And we've seen even great sell through on global Partner Brands just because revenues were down, the sell through on Disney Princess and Frozen has been very, very robust. We continue to see great sell through in places like MARVEL, where our MARVEL LEGENDS business has continued to perform well. And as I said, global Games are up even more strongly than overall POS.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then, Deb, I was just hoping you could just clarify something on for Other Income. You did break out that there was an FX gain of about $0.03. So, I calculated that's about $4 million. Other income was $17 million, which is kind of higher than it usually is. So, you had said that most of the benefit in that line was coming from FX, but that's only $4 million. I'm kind of wondering what else was in that. Like, if you could just call out for us what that Other, what else is in there.","Deborah M. Thomas - Hasbro, Inc.","Sure. Well, everything else was kind of relatively consistent with the prior year, with the exception of we did have higher interest income this year, as we see rates going up a bit and with our cash balance, we do have higher interest income in that line. But the one thing that was different and we really don't forecast \u2013 it just is kind of what it is \u2013 is the FX gain and it was just a little bit higher than that. But your math is not that far off. So, we wanted to point that out.","The other thing was the excess tax benefit, because the increase in our stock price, we had said at Toy Fair, we thought it would be about $0.08 in the first quarter and it was about $0.11. So, we wanted to make sure we highlighted that. And that was just the benefit that our employees got from when all of the vesting took place in the beginning of the \u2013 or during the first quarter.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And that falls in the Other Income line?","Deborah M. Thomas - Hasbro, Inc.","No, that falls into the tax line. But, our underlying -","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, okay.","Deborah M. Thomas - Hasbro, Inc.","I guess I'm still thinking about your question on our expectations versus not. We really tried to highlight and that was something that was different than our expectations that we laid out at Toy Fair and that is in the tax line.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I guess I'm asking just because a lot of investors this morning were just trying to figure out what your \u2013 kind of the normalized earnings are for the quarter. And so I think everybody understands the $0.08 from the accounting change. But looking at the $17 million in Other Income, I think some folks are inclined to kind of not give you credit for any of it. And I'm just trying to figure out what's, kind of, a normalized run rate for that line, versus some extra things you had in the quarter.","Deborah M. Thomas - Hasbro, Inc.","Yeah, we would say the only unusual thing that you really can't put your finger on is the FX gain. I mean, that's still dependent on where the rates are going. So-","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All righty. Thank you.","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Just a couple of clarifications here. Brian, you said global when you were responding to Felicia's question. So you meant global collectively, not just international on that?","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","Yeah, global was up mid-teens. As I said, North America was up high \u2013 very high single digits. Europe was up double digits. Latin America up double digits above our global POS gain. Asia Pac was more in line with our global POS gain. So, in Europe and Latin America was particularly strong.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. And then, Deb, you'd called out how you had some very favorable FX hedges in 2016. Where are those comps more difficult on the FX side with the favorable hedges? And I apologize if you hit this before, but I just wanted to double check. How do you see the FX now versus that $50 million to $60 million you outlined at Toy Fair?","Deborah M. Thomas - Hasbro, Inc.","We hedged about 75% of our product purchases last year. And we're hedged a little bit less than that this year. The hedges are a bit less favorable than they were in the past, as rates have kind of leveled out this year. So, overall, we'll have a bit of a negative impact that impacts gross margin, but \u2013 and we'll take pricing to compensate for some of that as we go through the year. We still see our numbers kind of in line with what we set out for the full year, just as a bit of \u2013 because it's such a small quarter, little things can have such a big impact on our different percentages of revenue in the first quarter. But overall, for the full year, we still see our numbers in line with what we set out at Toy Fair.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And the quarter that would have the most difficult comparison, versus the more favorable hedges last year?","Deborah M. Thomas - Hasbro, Inc.","It's really hard to say. I mean, it's probably \u2013 most of our purchases come through in the third and fourth quarter, along with our sales. So, I would think that that would be it. But you probably just won't see it as much because they are such big quarters.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, okay, okay. And then any areas, Brian, where you believe you're short on inventory?","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","Well, I think overall, we do have some product lines that are selling quite well. If you look at the acceleration in our Games business and some of the new launches that we've come out with, they're selling quite well. And the Games category is up and POS is up very strongly. I would say overall, clearly, you see that retail inventories in the U.S. are down and our overall inventories are down a bit. I think you'll see in Qs 2 and 3 as we get into our storytelling and our Partner Brand storytelling you may see a bit of an increase in inventories, but only in line with sales. So, again, we'll try to put more inventory around the entertainment initiatives and more adjusted time inventory as we continue to manage that.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then lastly, and I know you've had and we've had questions related to the concerns about cannibalization on TRANSFORMERS and Spider-Man and you've answered that, as those address different audiences. How, I guess, are the approach of yourselves and Disney, as it comes to the five to six months between The Last Jedi and then the spinoff coming then in May of 2018?","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","Yeah, I would say that 2017 has certainly lined up to be a very strong year. You have a number of initiatives, but you do have different audiences, demographics, fan bases for each of those and some good separation in the calendar as well. One of the things we're also seeing is this very good strength in the electronic sell through windows, the home entertainment windows. So you're getting both the theatrical as well as the electronic sell through windows, like Moana had performed so well around the home entertainment window.","As we get into 2018, we go from strength to strength. We have a number of new theatrical pieces of entertainment. We'll have our own TRANSFORMERS movie in Bumblebee next year and then you have a number of MARVEL movies. And then, you're right, summer we'll also have the Han Solo movie. But, again, there's very big differences between the fan bases and the \u2013 both demographics and psychographics, the play patterns. And we have dedicated teams of individuals. We don't have the same teams working on Lucasfilm that we have working on MARVEL. They're different teams, they have different innovations. We're bringing new innovations to the market first around those brands, as well as around our brand.","So, because of that, we're able to look at the marketplace and take global consumer insights and apply them differently so that we're able to tease out and offer different play patterns and role play and action figures that really help to keep all of our fans, children, and families enthusiastic around those brands. So we really don't see it \u2013 and by the way, we've experienced years with Spider-Man and TRANSFORMERS movies before, and both of those brands performed at a very high level. I'm very excited about the Spider-Man movie. I think the materials look fantastic.","Timothy Andrew Conder - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Arpin\u00e9 H. Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, thank you. So, thanks for the expense color on extra week. And I understand revenue was not up commensurate with expense, but in terms of year over year terms, what did the extra week add in terms of revenue year over year? And does incremental expense and MAGIC: THE GATHERING being down for the quarter explain the 340 basis points of operating margin contraction in North America?","And then I have a follow-up on that. Brian, I heard you reiterate the 15.7% operating margin on GAAP basis. It seems like you expect good strong top line growth this year, with some puts and takes, of course, in terms of mix. And if this is the case, I'm just trying to understand why wouldn't it be operating margin accretive, given the fact that mix shift is lower for Partner Brands, according to your guidance, and that's lower operating margin business for you, why wouldn't adjusted operating margins grow for the year, if you expect additional revenue?","Deborah M. Thomas - Hasbro, Inc.","Arpin\u00e9, let me address your first question. So, the extra week comes at the beginning of our fiscal year, which is the end of the calendar year. So it's essentially that week between Christmas and New Year. And really, a lot of retailers don't take a lot at shipments in that timeframe. Many of our offices are closed down. So, from a revenue standpoint, it truly is negligible, if we have any at all, but the expenses are fixed. Typically, we have to pay salaries. We pay things like that, rents. So our expenses are pretty much fixed. And that's why you get that extra week. It only happens once every several years. So, we don't talk about that much. But it's a 14-week period versus a 13-week period, and that's really why we highlighted that.","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","Yeah. And then on operating margin, we do expect operating profit margin expansion, versus our reported 15.7% last year. And, as I noted in February, we would expect over time to continue to expand operating profit margins towards that 16.4% level over the medium term. But as you know, we're also investing in our business, creating new content and innovation, and ensuring that we have the horsepower to deliver great results in both top and bottom line over multiple years and that requires investing back in our business, and you'll also see that. So, again, I want to reiterate that we do see operating profit margin expansion versus the 15.7%.","Arpin\u00e9 H. Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. And then I have a quick follow-up on Backflip. Was there anything outsized for the quarter that you don't expect reoccurring in Q2, Q3, Q4 this year under Backflip?","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","No, the Backflip business, we made the transition and now own 100% of that business. The business revenues have been accelerating as we brought on board some new leadership, and also we see our brands like TRANSFORMERS: EARTH WAR performing well. There'll be a couple of new Hasbro titles that will come out over the next year, and DragonVale World and DragonVale continue to sale. So, I think it's some good progress as we move forward. And then, of course, we have third-party digital gaming business with our embedded teams that also performed at a very high level and we've seen great results there, as our brands really resonate in that mobile gaming platform.","Arpin\u00e9 H. Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Great. And then one quick follow-up, Brian. One of your large customers, I guess, in the prior week talked about a tough retail environment, whether in terms of inventories, as well as sell through and trade spend. Could you just take a few minutes to kind of give investors an update on the overall health of the category as you stand here at the beginning of the year, in terms of Toys? Thanks.","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","Sure. You saw that our overall sales grew, despite the fact that we had the flip in Easter and, as I said noted, our overall POS grew both without and including Easter, and grew very robustly. Our allowances overall are in line with prior periods. So, as we said in the fourth quarter, back in February, it's very consistent with the first quarter, where allowances really are very much the same as they have been in the past. We have a lot of products that are selling quite well.","As Deb noted, we did take advantage of some of the marketing windows and entertainment windows in EST and our own windows around MY LITTLE PONY launching its new TV series mid-April to clean up some inventories and that goes out through closeouts. But for the full year, we do not expect closeouts to differ materially from any prior year. Just, again, taking advantage of what we're seeing in the marketplace, which is this great much more robust uptake around the home entertainment windows for major entertainment and also the continued drive that television has on businesses.","So, I would say, overall, we're partnering with that retailer and all our retailers, both in store and Omni channel online, and we are seeing a great convergence of content, commerce, and innovation happening at retail and also particularly in the online space. And we're seeing a lot of our retailers performing quite well across both of those dimensions.","Arpin\u00e9 H. Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Could you talk a little bit about the response to Beauty and the Beast? Did it meet your expectations and what type of benefit will you receive from the box office versus the home entertainment? How do you think that's going to differ for this movie?","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","Yeah. Overall, the sell through for our Disney Princess, Beauty and the Beast, and Frozen has been extremely positive around the world. And what we saw for Moana I believe we will also see for Beauty and the Beast. We saw great sell through during the time of the movie, but this EST or electronic sell through window has become a more marketable window for those OTT platforms. Lot of OTT platforms are now marketing around the availability of new movies and content and that's really helping to engender a lot more interest and driving a lot more merchandise sales. So, we saw it for Moana around EST and home entertainment. It's been a major driver, and I would expect it to be the case for Beauty and the Beast. Clearly, we see the Beauty and the Beast as a major contributor and we are very excited about the kind of sales we are seeing.","In fact, if you look at the 11 Princesses that we have available in the market, right now, Belle is our number one seller. So, I think that's a good indication of just how well Beauty and the Beast is performing. But then, as you go out through the year, we have a number of new initiatives coming in the area of content. There's a new lineup for a new Tangled TV series. I mentioned the Beauty and the Beast home entertainment window. We also have innovations like Dance Code Belle coming from the product line that we're very happy about and other innovations and fashion dolls. You have the summer Descendants 2 movie coming that will be in television. And then, of course, around holiday, you have new entertainment for holiday coming for Frozen \u2013 the Olaf's Frozen Adventure and a whole new line of product coming for us to celebrate that. So, again, overall, sell through has been up significantly across the business and Disney Princess globally.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right, good. And then in terms of M&A opportunities and maybe the potential to combine with some other large manufacturers like Mattel, do you see opportunities or would that just be a distraction given the strong POS and momentum that you're seeing?","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","We're very focused on building our brands and building our capabilities around the Blueprint. And we've said that we remain open to looking at new capabilities and on boarding new capabilities. We've also looked at a lot of our vault brands and over time have acquired a few brands here and there, like Micronauts that have been great comic book brands that we're developing. But, as you see, we're sort of shifting into the next gear as a company, and beginning to identify those new brands we want to put in the marketplace, like Hanazuki and you'll see a TV series coming this fall from us as an exclusive on Netflix which is Stretch Armstrong coming out of our vault. So, we feel like we have the right brands, the right team, and the right blueprint to drive our business.","Gregory Robert Badishkanian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Ng - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks very much. I have a question for Deb and one for Brian and then a content question for whomever wants to take it. First, Deb, just a question on the ASU 2016-09 benefit of $0.015 each quarter. What stock price are you assuming?","And then, for Brian, Gaming was particularly strong in the quarter and this is despite MAGIC being down year on year. Can you provide any additional color on what drove the strength? And maybe are you able to provide any color around gaming POS? I'm just trying to better understand the underlying consumer demand versus the benefit from initial shipments. And then I have a follow-up.","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","Sure.","Deborah M. Thomas - Hasbro, Inc.","So, Michael, I'll just grab the stock price one, quickly. We're just assuming a stock price similar to what we had around the end of our first quarter.","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","And then in Gaming, we've had a number of new initiatives and continuing initiatives that have been strong contributors to shipments and to sell through. In fact, our sell through is very strong as well, up double digits, as I noted. And we're seeing that globally around gaming.","So, in the area of games, we have a few new games. I never thought I'd actually get to talk about this on an earnings call but, TOILET TROUBLE is off to a very good start and as everybody here sort of laughs, it's a fun game for preschoolers. FANTASTIC GYMNASTICS has been off to a great start. We continue to see great results around Speak Out Kids vs Parents, which is a new line extension for that brand. PIE-FACE has continued to perform at a very high level. We saw growth in MONOPOLY in the quarter, as you know. I also am very happy to see very strong growth for brands like DUNGEONS & DRAGONS and Duel Masters. So, the team at (46:34) has gone to a new storytelling modality for MAGIC and, obviously, impacted the quarter. But they've also done some very good work around DUNGEONS and storytelling and in engagement with that audience.","So overall, I would expect that our face-to-face gaming business will continue to perform at a high level and the team's done an absolutely stellar job at both the social media oriented games, as well as some more of our classic games. And then, of course, you have to note the growth in our digital gaming business, the owned and operated Backflip Studios, as well as our third party digital games both performing at a very strong level.","Michael Ng - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you very much. That was helpful. And the content question is, I believe that MY LITTLE PONY: THE MOVIE will be Hasbro's first theatrical release where you'll actually have meaningful ownership. And I think this will be the first time that Hasbro will actually book box office revenue. First, is that right? And then, from a modeling perspective, is that going to be booked at the geographical level or within the Entertainment and Licensing segment?","Brian D. Goldner - Hasbro, Inc.","Yeah, so let me take the first part of that question and then Deb can talk about the geography on the P&L. The first part is we are working in partnership with Lionsgate. They've have done a great job in helping to get us global distribution. And all the territories are very excited now as we line up the global box office date for MY LITTLE PONY. Again, remember, for those of you less familiar with how we produce animation, we are taking advantage of new technology and capability so that we're able to produce this animated feature film with animated quality, animated feature film quality with a very notable cast, very all-star cast, and all-star music, but yet at a price point that's lower than other feature film studios out there, and I think that's important to note.","And we're using a great modality as we roll the product line out around the world. And, yes, we will participate in box office for the movie. I don't know, Deb, if you want to -","Deborah M. Thomas - Hasbro, Inc.","Right. So we've had some moderate box office before. Our share of TRANSFORMERS, again, very modest share of box office, but that was booked in our Entertainment and Licensing segment and the box office related to this movie will be booked there as well.","Michael Ng - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.

Brian?","Brian Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. The Hasbro team delivered a very good third quarter, the highest revenue and earnings quarter in our history. We\u2019ve positioned Hasbro to unlock the full potential of our brands, investing significantly across the brand blueprint. We're still in the early stages of realizing our ambition.","During this quarter, we demonstrated our strategy's ability to deliver growth amid challenging conditions, across a number of dimensions. Revenues grew in each operating segment with double-digit consumer takeaway globally at retail. Franchise Brands, Hasbro Gaming, and Emerging Brands revenues increased led by growth in NERF, TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY, MONOPOLY, BABY ALIVE, FURREAL FRIENDS, SPEAK OUT, and TWISTER.","Our commercial and finance teams are effectively managing the short-term disruption from the Toys \"R\" Us restructuring and bankruptcy filing in the U.S and Canada, as well as ongoing softness in the U.K and Brazil.","And our investments in our multi-screen content to commerce and omni-channel retail strategies are building deeper consumer engagement across multiple brand experiences as evidenced by the growth in TRANSFORMERS and MY LITTLE PONY. The industry data supports our success. And through August, Hasbro ranked first in the G11 toy and game markets according to industry sources.","Hasbro revenues grew in developed economies including the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, and Australia. Emerging market revenues increased 8% with growth in China and Russia, as well as from our new operations in India.","As we discussed last quarter, the U.K and Brazil continued to face tough economic conditions and we forecast that to continue in the near-term. Our diverse geographic and brand portfolio positions us to overcome these challenges with strength in other major markets.","In addition, over the past several years, our global commercial teams have invested in an omni-channel retail strategy, which puts Hasbro where consumers are shopping not just at mass and toy specialty, but importantly in e-commerce where consumer take away continues to outpace total point-of-sale, as well as in emerging channels including value, grocery, and drug, new feature shops at retailers, fan and specialty retail.","While the near-term impact of Toys \"R\" Us is disruptive, and we paused shipments for a short period as we gain clarity on the situation. We are working with them as we enter the holiday period. This doesn't impact our outlook for overall consumer takeaway, which has continued to be strong, but does introduce higher uncertainty as to the level of shipments to them in the fourth quarter.","Importantly, we're also well positioned in new and growing channels with the wealth of retail options, in store, online, and omni-channel, we're confident in the collective long-term outlook for the retail landscape.","For the third quarter, Hasbro's Franchise Brand revenues increased 7% with growth in NERF, TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY, and MONOPOLY. Hasbro Gaming increased 22% and Emerging Brands were up 9%. NERF has posted double-digit growth throughout 2017 and Q3 was no exception.","Global POS was up in the mid to high teens for the quarter, increasing in all regions. NERF Nitro launched and is off to a good start. TRANSFORMERS multi screen entertainment continued to drive revenue growth in the franchise. Point-of-sale was up versus last year and up versus the last movie year. This fall, we continue with new entertainment initiatives to engage our fans.","The global home entertainment release of Transformers: The last Knight took place on September 28 and all new episodes of Robots in Disguise and RESCUE BOTS are running on linear and streamed services. In addition, in partnership with Machinima, in November we're debuting the second chapter of the critically acclaimed digital animated series Prime Wars Trilogies: TITANS RETURN.","We see every day that brands backed by multi format stories combined with merchandise based on robust investment in innovation, deliver engaging experiences for consumers, fans, and audiences. Consumer insights, storytelling, and content remain an integral part of creating successful sustainable brand franchises and Hasbro is building industry-leading expertise.","My Little Pony revenue increased behind the release of MY LITTLE PONY: THE MOVIE and successfully drove point-of-sale gains around the movie debut. Our content to commerce model delivers multiple revenue streams, including entertainment and merchandise, and we are well positioned in our investment.","The film was successful in reinvigorating and energizing our core consumer base and our fan base, while inviting new fans into the brand. The film is yet to be released in a number of international markets and will be followed by the Home Entertainment window, an important element of expanding the audience.","MONOPOLY revenues were up with several new games, including the Token Madness edition as well as MONOPOLY Gamer, featuring Nintendo characters and new game play. As expected, MAGIC: THE GATHERING revenues declined in the quarter, while play numbers remained high and sentiment from players and stores is positive.","Our new digital gaming initiative MAGIC: THE GATHERING arena was announced on September 7 and will go into close beta in November. MAGIC: THE GATHERING franchise remains strong and our investments in its content, storytelling, and digital platform will continue as we believe there remains significant future potential for the franchise.","Hasbro Gaming revenues grew 22% and consumer takeaway increased at a similar level. Gaming growth continued across multiple formats and our expertise in gaming coupled with our ability to translate social trends into commercial gaming experiences is driving growth around the world.","Partner brand revenues decreased led by declines in YOKAI WATCH as well as DREAMWORKS' TROLLS, which was down versus last year's third quarter launch of movie product. Point-of-sale for the category was up, including gains in MARVEL, DISNEY PRINCESS, and DISNEY DESCENDANTS, DREAMWORKS' TROLLS and Sesame Street.","Trolls is performing well this year and we look forward to the upcoming entertainment DREAMWORKS' TROLLS Holiday airing November 24 on NBC. STAR WARS revenue increased in the quarter with robust global retail support of STAR WARS: The Last Jedi merchandise released on September 1.","We anticipate consumer interest building as promotional activities increase and we get closer to the film launch date. The multi-year entertainment slate for STAR WARS has created a larger, more sustainable level of business for this top industry property. Today's entertainment cadence enables a higher, more repeatable level of sales versus historical periods when revenues will decline significantly in years without theatrical entertainment.","Beyblade is now available in all regions and contributing to year-over-year revenue gains. Europe and Latin America launched in the quarter and both off to a good start. We continued to release new waves of Beyblade, top supporting ongoing innovation in the line.","Hasbro's portfolio of Marvel toy lines saw consumer momentum in the third quarter behind the theatrical release of Marvel Studios Spider-Man: Homecoming, as well as the home entertainment release of Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol 2 with especially strong brand momentum in our Marvel Legends segment across Marvel franchises, as well as SPIDER-MAN role-play items.","We also have a new line supporting the November 3 theatrical release of Thor: Ragnarok. In 2018, Marvel has eight theatrical films, including Marvel Studios Black Panther in February, and Marvel Studios Avengers: Infinity War slated for release in May.","Disney Princess And Disney Descendants consumer takeaway increased behind strength in Moana and new Descendants 2 entertainment. In addition, Hasbro's new line in support of Disney's new holiday featurette Olaf's Frozen Adventure is now at retail ahead of the limited theatrical release in front of Disney\/Pixar's Coco on November 22.","Finally, from September 8 to 10, we hosted our first ever HASCON in Providence, three days of hands-on brand experiences, meet and greets, sneak peeks, and fan-centric events for families and fans of all ages. This first of a kind event is emblematic of our journey from a toy and game company to a global play and entertainment leader, delivering immersive entertainment experiences around our brands.","To conclude, I want to reassure you that our brands and global POS are strong through today. Our growth plans for the holiday had been impacted by recent events at Toys \"R\" Us as well as the economic outlook in certain countries.","As a result, we currently expect fourth quarter revenue growth in the range of 4% to 7% year-over-year. This is a shift from our prior expectation, but reflects our current shipment plans for the next 60 days. Consumer momentum continues to drive our business and we are well positioned with a diverse in demand brand portfolio to deliver growth for 2017 and beyond.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deb Thomas","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter presented economic and retailer challenges, yet the Hasbro team delivered revenue and earnings growth, while returning $164 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchase program.","We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and are well positioned to capitalize on the innovation we have in the marketplace as holiday season. As Brian mentioned, the Toys \"R\" Us bankruptcy filing in the U.S and Canada negatively impacted our third quarter revenue and operating profit, including incremental bad debt expense associated with the bankruptcy.","Excluding the incremental expense, total company operating profit would have been approximately a 100 basis points higher in the quarter. While this event has also negatively impacted our initial growth outlook for the fourth quarter, we continue to work closely with Toys \"R\" Us to be able to deliver the right products to consumers for successful holiday season.","For the third quarter, revenues in the U.S and Canada segment increased 7% and grew in all product categories, including Franchise Brands, Partner Brand, Hasbro Gaming and Emerging Brand. In total, U.S and Canada point-of-sale increased double digits for the quarter and the first nine months of the year. Retail inventory remains of good quality.","Operating profit in the U.S and Canada segment declined 5% to $217.3 million or 21.9% of net revenues. The year-over-year decline was the result of a shift in product mix, including the decline in quarterly MAGIC: THE GATHERING revenues, the revenue impact from ceasing shipments to Toys \"R\" Us for a short period, and incremental bad debt expense. Excluding bad debt expense, operating profit margin in the segment was down slightly.","International segment revenues increased 7%, including a favorable $27.9 million impact from foreign exchange. Within the international segment, Franchise Brand and Hasbro Gaming revenue growth offset a decline in partner brand and emerging brand revenues. Revenues increased across all three regions: Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. Although Europe declined 1% on a constant currency basis.","Point-of-sale increased in all three regions for the quarter and over the first nine months. The challenges we saw emerging in the second quarter have continued in the U.K and Brazil, and we anticipate this will continue for the remainder of the year. We entered the quarter with good quality inventory at retail, having address the pockets of inventory we previously discussed.","Operating profit in the international segment declined $1.1 million or 1% to $132 million or 17.9% of net revenues. The decrease was primarily the result of a less favorable product mix. Entertainment and licensing segment revenues increased 4%. Growth was the result of higher consumer product revenues associated with our entertainment initiatives, as well as a contribution from Boulder Media.","Segment operating profit increased 20% to $16.9 million or 28.9% of revenue on the higher revenues and expense leverage. Overall, Hasbro operating profit dollars were essentially flat and operating margin declined to 20.1% versus 21.6% in 2016. As [technical difficulty] mentioned, operating profit margin would have been approximately 100 basis points higher, excluding the bad debt expense.","Cost of sales increased 11% to 40.8% of revenues. The primary driver of the increase was a less favorable product mix, including the expected decline in MAGIC: THE GATHERING revenues and slightly lower partner brand revenues. Royalty expense decreased 20 basis points to 7.8% of revenue, and the small decline in partner brand revenue is partially offset by the continued growth from Transformers: The Last Knight movie product, which carry some external royalties.","Our investment in product development was essentially flat year-over-year, but declined as a percentage of revenues due primarily to lower expenses at Backf1ip Studios. our Investment in innovation remains a point of differentiation and a high priority for our team.","Program production amortization declined slightly in the quarter, but will increase in the fourth quarter as we begin to amortize our investment in the MY LITTLE PONY movie. SG&A increased as a percentage of revenue to 17.4%. The percent increase over 2016 is the result of higher bad debt expense associated with Toys \"R\" Us. SG&A declined as a percent of revenue absent this expense.","We remain focused on the most efficient cost structure for our company. Given the current environment, changing revenue expectations may slightly impact our operating profit margin outlook for the year.","Turning to results below operating profit, other income was $14 million versus income of $8.5 million last year. Consistent with prior quarters, the biggest components of this line are higher interest income and our share of the earnings from the discovery family channel.","During the quarter, we refinance $350 million of 6.3% maturing debt by issuing $500 million of new 10-year 3.5% debt. We took advantage of the low interest rate environment to raise an additional $150 million to use for general corporate purposes. We're pleased with this result and expect this transaction to provide a very low cost of capital over the next 10 years.","Going forward, this will have a favorable impact of approximately $4 million per year to interest expense. The underlying tax rate was 23.5%, down from 26% last year and versus the 24.5% for the full year 2016. The quarter included an approximate $0.04 benefit from our adoption of the new accounting standard governing stock compensation. This is consistent with our forecast from August and we continue to expect the fourth quarter's favorable impact to be in the range of $0.11 to $0.13.","Our underlying tax rate is trending to the lower end of our estimated range. Based on our projected mix of revenue and earnings for the remainder of the year, we expect this trend to continue.","Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $2.09. Hasbro is in a strong financial position, including a healthy balance sheet and good cash generation. We generated $823.6 million in operating cash flow over the trailing 12 month period ending the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash.","During the quarter, we paid out $71.4 million in dividends and repurchase $92.9 million worth of common stock. We continue to target approximately $150 million in share repurchase this year and had $216.5 million available in our authorization at quarter end.","Receivables increased 14% and day sales outstanding increased 5 days to 83 days. The increase was due primarily to the mix of revenues as well as the timing of collections. Our accounts receivable are in good condition and collections continue to be strong. However, we expect the timing impact of ultimate collection from our Toys \"R\" Us receivables could add an incremental two day's on our year-end receivables compared to the end of 2016.","Inventories are in good shape, increasing 4% versus revenue growth of 7% and essentially flat absent the impact of foreign exchange. Inventories both at Hasbro and at retail are well positioned and of good quality to support our growth expectations for the holiday season.","In closing, despite a dynamic environment which has impacted our initial estimates for the year, we now expect our fourth quarter revenues to grow year-over-year in the range of 4% to 7%. Consumer trends remain positive through today, but there is higher near-term uncertainty with Toys \"R\" Us as we see how they'll begin to execute their plan to emerge from Chapter 11.","Our global teams are effectively executing our strategy with the industries best brands and strong commercial programs heading into the holiday season, while profitably driving our business both in the fourth quarter and beyond.","Brian and I are now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Michael Ng","Great. Thank you so much for the question. My first question is for Deb. Deb, I was just wondering if you could revisit some of the seasonality comments that you made with some of the revenue shift being more concentrated in the fourth quarter due to a retailer preference for just-in-time and a growing share for e-commerce. Did the quarter come in as you expected despite some of the Toys \"R\" Us bad debt expense headwinds?","Brian Goldner","Thank you. Good morning, Mike. The -- as far as the quarter, we did mention earlier that we did have some shipments that we stopped when we heard of Toys \"R\" Us declaring their bankruptcy, but just for a short period of time. So I would say absent that, the quarter did come in as we expected and absent the bad debt expense. As far as the seasonality, we continue to see that. And with Toys \"R\" Us just having filed for bankruptcy so late in the third quarter, we've adjusted a bit our thoughts around the fourth quarter. However, we still expect to grow and wanted to just give context around that as well. We found that moving to omni-channel retail strategy has certainly helped and moved a bit more to just-in-time. However, we are about close to 60 days out from year-end now, and we're starting to get more visibility into year-end every day as we get closer and closer.","Michael Ng","Okay. And could you expand a little bit just on your assumptions around Toys \"R\" Us. I\u2019m just trying to get a better sense of what you're assuming in terms of Toys \"R\" Us for the fourth quarter? Are you assuming that you ship less than to Toys \"R\" Us? Are you assuming that Toys \"R\" Us orders less? Any color around that would be very helpful.","Brian Goldner","Sure. Hi, Mike. So to be clear, I think first and foremost, we do expect to grow more than the industry in Q4 and the industry growth rate estimate now is between 3% and 4%. So we do expect to grow more than that. We've seen great, very strong sell-through up until this weekend. So, that Chapter 11 is just one month old. We've come to agreement on receivables and we also now agreed to terms go forward just over the last few days on our -- over the last month our finance and the Toys \"R\" Us commercial teams have been working on and focused on getting an agreement which we signed just a few days ago. So now our Toys \"R\" Us team and the merchants can focus and refocus on the holiday joint business plan with just two months to go. In fact, this wouldn't have been an issue had it happened earlier in the year and it's not an issue for us in 2018. We do have a more expansive retail channel strategy that gives us great confidence that we can deliver industry-leading growth this year even in this environment. We just need to determine what Toys \"R\" Us can receive over the next few months. But meanwhile it's great to see that our POS is outstanding and very consistent with our expectations.","Michael Ng","Great. And the last one for me, I think DISNEY PRINCESS was down in the quarter. I was just hoping if you could help parse out what happened there? How much of that was because of the Elena of Avalor rollout a year-ago, and how much was Toys \"R\" Us?","Brian Goldner","Yes. So year-to-date DISNEY PRINCESS is up and it was also up in the quarter in international markets. Also very heartening to see that point -- the point-of-sale for DISNEY PRINCESS was up quite considerably. In fact, it's among our strongest point-of-sale gainers in the partner brand Arena. So what we\u2019ve really seen throughout the year is great growth around the entertainment initiatives. The entertainment has been a key driver, so Beauty and the Beast and Moana are key drivers of the growth that we've seen year-to-date. And then there's a bit of timing, because you also now are getting into shipments of Frozen around the Q4 featurette, this Olaf's Frozen Adventure. And so, Frozen it was up in the quarter in the U.S. And so again Descendants was very strong in the quarter. So I think it's a bit of timing overall, but we're seeing great robust sales for the brand and particularly strong sales this quarter -- shipments this quarter in international.","Michael Ng","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.","Drew Crum","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Brian Goldner","Good morning.","Drew Crum","Going back to Toys \"R\" Us, Brian, were you able to divert any of the product that you had previously earmarked for shipments for Toys \"R\" Us to other retailers? And as you think about the fourth quarter any uncertainty around shipments that may go to Toys \"R\" Us? Do you have the flexibility to move those other retailers and is that in any way embedded in that 4% to 7% sales guidance that you\u2019ve provided?","Brian Goldner","Yes, so clearly we are assessing what Toys \"R\" Us can receive, but our expanded retail channel strategy gives us great confidence that we can find home for our inventories, and given where our inventories are and that they\u2019re in great shape and that fact that POS is growing at double digits both globally as well as in the U.S. Both year-to-date and in the quarter we feel very good about where we are and obviously our teams are very focused on a very strong growth rate in the fourth quarter, and we do think we will end up ahead of the industry growth of course. So I would say that, overall, we want -- we can find a home for all the inventory that we have, we don't see that as an issue. But we do need to assess what Toys \"R\" Us will represent of the total inventories in the quarter -- in the fourth quarter.","Drew Crum","Okay, got it. And then I didn't hear STAR WARS mentioned as being one of the partner brands were POS was up in the quarter, maybe I misheard that, but could you comment on consumer takeaway during the quarter and do you think Brian having just five months in between the two STAR WARS films in any way limit sales upside for The Last Jedi to the holiday period?","Brian Goldner","Yes, so overall for STAR WARS shipments were up in Q3. And we saw that POS was up in the U.S and Latin America, and improving in the other territories and that's just because the way the marketing is just beginning to roll out. We're very encouraged about the long-term opportunity for The Last Jedi. In fact, I think a lot of the impact will happen not just in '17, but as we get into the home entertainment windows that are becoming increasingly important again into spring of 2018. And we're very excited about the new Han Solo movie, Solo: A STAR WARS story. I think that will be great and I don't think it will cut off the tale of The Last Jedi. In fact, I think it really sets us up for a great 2018 for STAR WARS. And then you add to that the fact that we just started to ship The Forces of Destiny product, and we're very excited about that initiative and the content that\u2019s streaming online. And so, I think overall STAR WARS is in pretty good shape now. Obviously, we've come through a couple of quarters where we work through some Rogue One product and feel very good about where we\u2019re heading at this point.","Drew Crum","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi. Good morning and thank you.","Brian Goldner","Good morning.","Deb Thomas","Good morning.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi. Brian, just something that you had -- starting on Toys \"R\" Us for a second and then I have another question just -- on Toys \"R\" Us. I think reading between the lines of what you said about working on the receivables and stuff that you have received critical vendor status?","Brian Goldner","Yes, we have. Yes, we have.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And so does that just, I guess, accounting wise, does that mean that when all is said and done and everything settles, you could have a potential -- maybe not a whole, but some part of reversal of the bad debt expense?","Deb Thomas","Our expectation would be as we see how things settle out, we would certainly look at the situation at the time and adjust whatever expense we needed to on the receivable.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And then the other thing is, you\u2019ve said a couple of times that you\u2019re currently assessing what Toys \"R\" Us can receive. I\u2019m just wondering, is there a chance -- once you go through that with your 4% to 7% shipment guidance for the fourth quarter, is there a chance that that you could end up shipping more than you're currently expecting to Toys \"R\" Us or would you have a hard and set number?","Brian Goldner","No, I think that it's a very fluid situation. So as you prepare for earnings which happened to be this Monday and you're working through month-old Chapter 11 situation. We signed an agreement literally very late last week on the go-forward position. I think the teams can return to focusing on our joint business plans, which were in place going into the holidays and Toys \"R\" Us was performing for us quite well. Our overall business is performing really well. It's just now a matter of refocusing on the holiday. And as I said, had this happened in any other time of the year, we would've had ample time before the holiday period to make a new plan together and do it in a more -- in a longer-term way, but the fact is we feel very good about our overall business. The POS gains that we're seeing across categories are very strong. Our toy and game business POS was up in the high teens. That\u2019s same as true for Franchise Brands, even partner brands were up more than 20%. Our Hasbro Gaming POS was up more than 20%. So, again, we feel very good about the fourth quarter and that we can grow ahead of the industry, But out of an abundance of caution, we did want to highlight that it's a more fluid environment only because of the Toys \"R\" Us situation, and of course the U.K and Brazil situation. But clearly the bulk of the difference in our point of view was about the Toys \"R\" Us situation. And just want to now get the teams focused again on a broader retail channel strategy, we go to more doors now than ever before. We see the acceleration in growth in omni-channel and online retailing which is still two or three times stronger than our overall POS gains. So, again, we just provide a range that given the timing of earnings and our focus now on the holiday.","Felicia Hendrix","Just to understand the flipside of that is -- is there a risk that you could end up shipping less than you're anticipating to them?","Brian Goldner","Well, even if we shipped less than we would expect, again that's what I was saying that we think there's an opportunity to put our inventory out in the marketplace in a number of places. Obviously, Toys \"R\" Us has been a growth arena for us, a growth partner for us, and we want to continue to support their initiatives now that we have an agreement in place, we can do that. And so our teams are very focused on continuing the kind of strong growth that we've seen throughout the year, up 7% year-to-date. And so we just give you a range because again as we formulated our look at the earnings picture as of today we felt that our range would be prudent.","Felicia Hendrix","And is there any way you will quantify the revenue impact of Toys \"R\" Us in the third quarter?","Brian Goldner","No, but we did note that we had stopped shipping for a number of days as a result of the bankruptcy. We wanted to get clarity on the situation and we're now shipping Toys \"R\" Us in all the retail, and again the POS gains are quite considerable against shipments.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Final one, not about Toys \"R\" Us. Just wondering, I think you\u2019ve talked about this, so I just you want to expand, you had the MY LITTLE PONY movie in the quarter, maybe the movie didn\u2019t end being as successful as you may have expected. Just wondering what that did for toy sales?","Brian Goldner","Well, the movie as of this past weekend globally is just shy of about $40 million. The brand is up in the quarter across every region and across our entertainment and licensing business. We are really building this media digital mix model and our brand blueprint we think is really working. And the film will absolutely pay back its investment. Remember, we made the film for modest budget. It is driving consumer products. It's driving toys and games. It's also driving our digital gaming business and MY LITTLE PONY is up year-to-date. So, again, that combination of storytelling between stream content, television content, and the film is a great formula for the brand. So we feel very good about the brand heading into the holidays in 2018.","Felicia Hendrix","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.","Stephanie Wissink","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Brian Goldner","Good morning.","Stephanie Wissink","I have three questions as well. Brian, just a bigger question for you. If you could just give us an insight into where we are in the investment cycle around the capabilities as you navigate around your blueprint? Do you see any big step ups in the next couple of years? And then, Deb, a question for you on operating margin. I think that couple of years ago, I mean, 18 month ago, you detailed three headwinds, the Princess was one just as that business scale MAGIC digital investments and then emerging markets, particularly China. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk a little bit about where we are on that continuum of operating margin scaling in gaining against those initiatives? And final question for -- second, one more just on games. I need to compliment you on the strength of games, because it seems to continue beyond what we would have expected. Maybe talk a little bit about the pipeline for Q4 and into 2018 for that segment in particular?","Brian Goldner","You got it. So, look, I think that the MY LITTLE PONY approach is very emblematic of what we're going to do as we go forward, meaning modest investments in film type content, using very strong partnerships and strong investment from a major studio that will pay for the best proportion of our films and distribute those films very effectively and market them globally. So, again, our approach is the television model, stream content model, a digital first model and then modest investments where appropriate in the film model and we're adding capabilities and personnel, people who are professional storytellers in those spaces. As you know we continue to add great capabilities around the blueprint and MY LITTLE PONY and TRANSFORMERS growth are absolutely all about the fact that we're really executing our model quite strongly. You want to talk about the \u2026?","Deb Thomas","Sure. So from a margin standpoint, we have had Princess now for almost -- Princess and Frozen for shipping all last year, and then this year as well. And we are starting to see some improvement in our margins as we\u2019ve grown that business to scale. So I think we're well on our way to that. However, we still have a little bit of a way to go. We talked about Arena, in August. We were out in our Investor Day and we announced that MAGIC: Arena will be -- it's in beta right now. And our investments are finishing on that, however, it's a constant investment in MAGIC, perhaps not to the same level that we\u2019ve had in the past. However, it's such an important brand for us that as one of our major Franchise Brands will continue investing in that, but perhaps not at the same level as we've seen in the past. So we're looking forward to Arena in being out in more distributed play in 2018. And as far as emerging markets go, we\u2019ve had some hiccups in Brazil this year. We've seen the economic conditions just haven't been as great as they could be, because of political situation and how people are really reacting to what's happening there. However, our consumers -- our products are being well received by consumers and our emerging market profitability continues to improve, and as our business grows in China we expect that to grow as well.","Brian Goldner","Yes, China's POS growth in the quarter was quite substantial as well as Russia, and our new market in India was quite good as well. So, Brazil is really the one exception within emerging markets and overall emerging markets grew at 8% in the quarter. As we look at games, Steph, you\u2019re absolutely right, the team has done a fantastic job. The social trend games that are about social listening and social scraping and really understanding what's going on in the global market for stream content has really paying dividends, but also our classic games are up and growing through reinvention and reimagination. So, whether it's MONOPOLY that's grown considerably, Fantastic Gymnastics, even Clue Life TWISTER operation, risk, and then of course some of the more -- the fun social games like SPEAK OUT. And then we have a number of new games that are launching in the fourth quarter, including Simon Optix. Hearing Things is off to a great start. Something called Get a Grip, Coinhole, and then of course we just launched our Drop Mix Gaming System, which is very exciting. The reviews have been great and it's just early days, but we feel great about that new music mixing platform as we head into the holidays and into 2018. So the team has done an outstanding job there and I think you will continue to see us use best-in-class digital capability and social media capability to build some fantastic product line up.","Stephanie Wissink","Thank you. very helpful.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Badishkanian","Thanks. Just a follow-up on one of Brian's comment. So, I think you mentioned you were seeing great sell-through until the weekend. So is that a continuation from the third quarter? Is it little bit slower, faster, pretty similar and any change in trend that you\u2019ve been seeing since you did bring up fourth quarter trends and POS?","Brian Goldner","Yes, look, I wanted to reassure people that our trends of double-digit growth have continued into the quarter. Obviously, we're -- on October 23 we are still seeing great fourth quarter trends through the -- through this past week some great trends and we are seeing it across our business and across regions. And that gives us great confidence and the fact that we can grow beyond industry growth rate and we're at not for this Toys \"R\" Us situation to have happened in the fourth quarter. We would not be having to talk about the kind of ranges that we're talking about. We just need to get our arms around now the Toys \"R\" Us situation and obviously, with a broader retail channel strategy with all the omni-channel and online retailing that\u2019s going on and the great growth rates we're seeing there that are two or three times the overall growth rate that we\u2019ve seen in the market. It's quite great. So, for example, in the quarter we saw Franchise Brands grow by in the teens and online we saw Franchise Brands grow by 30%. And that's similar across our business where we\u2019re just seeing this great acceleration both in brick and mortar, omni-channel, and online. So, again, it portends good things for us in the fourth quarter as we're in the fourth quarter and as well into '18.","Greg Badishkanian","Yes, good additional color. Thanks, Brian. And then another, a quick one. So -- and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard this a lot, but 2017 entertainment lineup has been just fantastic. Comparing 2018, next year's, can you achieve similar revenue growth or even increase that when you think about the entertainment for next year versus 2017?","Brian Goldner","Yes, I believe that the entertainment lineup for 2018 is actually stronger than 2017. If you think about the opportunity that begins early in the year with Black Panther, an exciting new movie from Marvel Studios, we get into Avengers by May, we have a Han Solo: STAR WARS story movie in the end of May. We have our very own Bumblebee movie that comes in December next year, you\u2019ve got Toy Story 4. You\u2019ve Ant-Man and the Wasp, and then you have Spider-Man animated movie that comes at the end of the year as well, at the end of '18. So the lineup is quite considerable from Marvel, from Lucasfilm, from Hasbro. Of course, we have all kinds of television entertainment that's also going to support all those brands both from Disney as well as Hasbro's own Studios. And so we feel very good about the lineup in '18 and entertainment should continue to be a key driver of our business.","Greg Badishkanian","Okay. And then, just finally on Toys \"R\" Us. Your -- did I hear you right there, you're not expecting an impact in 2018 or material impact from Toys \"R\" Us? This is limited to 2017?","Deb Thomas","Yes, we will see how things emerge, as they begin to execute their plan and give more color around it to emerge from bankruptcy.","Greg Badishkanian","Yes.","Deb Thomas","As we sit and see how that goes, and if something changes in that, that could have an impact. But as we sit here today, we do not expect a significant impact from the situation as we know it today.","Greg Badishkanian","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Handler","Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. Couple questions for you. First, I appreciate given some guidance on the fourth quarter revenue. Just curious, is anything changing on the expense line relative to what you\u2019ve previously discussed for the year, particularly, with regards to resin cost given how much they\u2019ve been increasing? Secondly, with regards to MY LITTLE PONY and how you\u2019re recognizing your revenue and operating income from the film. One, are you allowed to recognize any revenue before Lionsgate recoups its marketing spending? And as you look at the film, how much -- did you do -- how much of the film internationally did you pre-sell and how much did that allow you to recover from your budget, and just looking at the film forget about the toys, forget about the other licensing opportunities, is the expectation for the film itself to be profitable?","Brian Goldner","Yes, so let me start with MY LITTLE PONY and then Deb can talk about the resins for a second. The way Lionsgate works is they pre-sell the film in a substantial part of the global marketplace. They self distribute in the U.K., as well as virtually self distribute in Latin America.","Eric Handler","Right.","Brian Goldner","The rest of the markets they are pre-selling, so you get that recoupment right up front around your production expense. The movie itself, if you take it through the waterfall should be a contributor to the company over time. Obviously, it may not occur in the -- by the fourth quarter this year, because obviously our expenses for producing the movie will hit in the fourth quarter this year, but again, remember it's a modest budget. However, all the streams of income that it's creating, including consumer products are toys and games business. The digital game that\u2019s performing at a very high-level from Budge Studios and new games that are coming we think it's a great model for the brand. And of course we continue with the 7th season of the television that's appearing globally on linear television services as well as in stream services, it's a very strong performer on Netflix and other services. We see this as a very good model for us go forward.","Deb Thomas","And as far as our resin prices, well, we have seen some increases in resin prices. As a reminder, we set our pricing 12 to 15 months in advance. So when we do that, we're able to go out and hedge our expected cost, number one, to a large extent from an -- to try to take out some of the FX impact of that and in addition to that we adjust our pricing accordingly. So as far as fourth quarter goes there, we don't expect any impact from that.","Eric Handler","But then as you think about '18, how does that resin price now sort of impact '18 potentially?","Brian Goldner","Well, we would set our prices accordingly.","Eric Handler","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Q - Tim Conder","Thank you. Deb, we will hit a couple of housekeeping items here, first. The tax benefit of -- that you outlined here for Q4, is that more of a one-time due to some one-time option grants and then should we think about Q1 is the more reoccurring on the tax benefits under the new accounting standard?","Brian Goldner","Yes, exactly. I think we have a grant that\u2019s probably bigger than normal that's maturing in the fourth quarter this year. And when we get to Toy Fair, we will try to lay out what we think our normal quarterly basis will be, but as we think about first quarter I\u2019m thinking about it as the same -- around the same level as the first quarter of this year.","Eric Handler","Okay. Okay. And then we will circle back to the topic of the day, the Toys \"R\" Us. Brian, you\u2019ve alluded many times here that you\u2019re further developing the omni-channel, the ability that this -- for consumers to also shift among retailers. So let\u2019s take the draconian scenario here, hypothetical, the Toys \"R\" Us North America liquidates in 2018. Again, draconian hypothetical at this point obviously. Given what we've seen in the past with Woolworth in the U.K and Target's withdrawal, not bankruptcy from Canada, how fast do you think under that hypothetical would we see the absorption reallocation of the channel? I mean, if you can an answer that in anyway?","Brian Goldner","You know. I\u2019m so heartened our financing commercial teams have really executed the current plan during the holidays with such excellence. Our belief, as we go forward is that the current situation would not be an issue for us in 2018. I don't know how to answer a hypothetical like the one you post. However, I will tell you that we\u2019ve increasingly found great homes for our great products. Our products sell quite well at a number of different new channels that we've expanded into including value and drug as well as other new retailers. Our mass partnerships as well have really expanded. Our performance with Amazon, our performance with Walmart and Target have been very substantial and very strong. So, again, long-term as you described, our business will be fine and our products will find homes and we will find the consumer, and increasingly we\u2019ve talked about how online continues to dis-intermediate some of the toy departments, and the consumer continues to find our products and it's really heartening to see how online sell-through is even stronger than brick-and-mortar sell-through when there's no friction in the finding of our products. It just says that our products really resonate with consumers.","Eric Handler","Okay. And then the agreement that you signed late last week, was that in preparation of tomorrow's [indiscernible] hearing for Toys \"R\" Us or could anything change coming out of that hearing tomorrow from what you know from last week?","Deb Thomas","We are in a position that we want to make sure that Toys \"R\" Us has all the support they need to emerge from bankruptcy, so we entered into that agreement with them to go ahead and help them in that path forward. As we see how their plans develop and we see how -- what comes out of whatever hearings there are, we will just have to wait and see, but our expectation is that that there would not be any change.","Eric Handler","Okay. And then as you talked about, Deb, the costs related to some of the investments in the trading card business in MAGIC and so forth, should we start to see that lever in the back half of '18 sort to see some good leverage benefits from that?","Deb Thomas","That would be our expectation. As a matter of fact if you look at our SG&A expense, absent the bad debt charge, you're starting to see us get -- getting leverage from the higher revenue numbers now. And as MAGIC Arena is out there, our expectation is that we would continue to see that leverage and when we get to Toy Fair, well, you know us, we will give more specific guidance about what we think the different category should look like at that point.","Eric Handler","Okay, great. Thank you both for the color.","Brian Goldner","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","Hi. Thank you. Good morning.","Deb Thomas","Good morning, Arpin\u00e9.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","So, if we were to adjust the operating profit for $18 million of Toys \"R\" Us charge. Growth in that line would still be below where top line came in and that's despite very strong high margin entertainment and licensing growth for the quarter? And I know, Deb, you mentioned obviously MGT mix impact for the quarter, MAGIC: THE GATHERING which is the high-margin business for you. But could you perhaps go through the puts and takes on gross margin outside of mix? What drove that 160 basis point of decline for the quarter?","Brian Goldner","So we said absent the charge which we did not say what it was that our operating profit would have been 100 basis points higher. But if you move up to margin, gross margin and you think about the guidance that we've been giving all year is that we did say we expected our gross margin and our cost of sales actually to be higher than a year-ago, because of the mix of product and also some less favorable hedges that we had in place and it's not that were not hedging. We are hedging to protect pricing and margins, but we've -- it has more buying euros at $1.40, it was a lot more favorable than a euro at what $1.20 today, I didn\u2019t check this morning. But -- so we did say that we expected our cost of sales for the full-year to be a bit higher. When you particularly look at the phasing and our product mix that can have a significant impact on gross margin, and as we had said we did not -- we expected Q3 to be down in MAGIC, and it was, and that did have an impact on our mix for the quarter.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","Okay. And then on operating profit margin guidance, Deb, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expect impact, obviously, since last time we spoke, but you had previously indicated growth off of GAAP adjusted number of about 15.7%. Now with the visibility you have -- as much visibility you have for Q4, could you update where that expectation is now for the year in terms of offering margin?","Brian Goldner","Yes, I believe that our operating margin for the full-year can be very similar to the margin that was last year. We just talked about the fact that we would -- prior had expected or more confirmed that we would get some modest growth. Now I would say it's probably more similar to a year-ago, and again we're just talking about 20 basis points of difference. That was -- we were talking about the 15.7% number. So again, I'd expect it to be similar to that this year.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser with Davidson. Please proceed with your question.","Linda Bolton Weiser","Yes, hi. So you\u2019ve some very good performance with several of your Franchise Brands and PLAY-DOH was such a big success story, but yes, you\u2019ve had some sales declines this year. Can you talk about what\u2019s going on with that brand and the outlook for rejuvenation of growth there? And secondly, with MY LITTLE PONY, do you think that the movie here in the second half that\u2019s improving growth of the brand, can that have some carryover effect into 2018 to support the brands that you can expect growth next year as well in that brand? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","Yes, I think the model for MY LITTLE PONY has really worked and I think the team is beginning to think about what our next movie might look like. Meanwhile, we have ongoing television support. The brand, we believe, will halo quite strongly. We're seeing a great reinvigoration of our core fans as well as families and inviting a lot of new fans into the brand around the world. So, we like the model combination of the horizontal of television, the verticals of film for brand like MY LITTLE PONY done well. On the PLAY-DOH side, we\u2019ve seen very strong performance around the PLAY-DOH itself. There have been a few play sets in the spring that have had a weaker performance. Having said that, as we come into the holidays we have some new play sets which are performing early days, very, very good level including our Rapunzel full play set. We also have a number of play sets and something they call Kitchen Creations, which we would expect good performance on. So I think long-term PLAY-DOH has been one of our most global brands. It's one of the most heavily consumed, parents really enjoy and it's definitely a part of children helping to create or enjoy developmental milestones. And so I think long-term I\u2019m very confident in the PLAY-DOH and the PLAY-DOH's teams ability to grow that business over time.","Linda Bolton Weiser","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO. Please proceed with your question.","Gerrick Johnson","Hey, good morning.","Deb Thomas","Good morning, Gerrick.","Brian Goldner","Good morning.","Gerrick Johnson","Hi. It seems three questions per, I\u2019m going to ask three. First, can you just quantify your answer to Arpine's question about the operating margin being similar to the 15.7% [ph] last year. Does that include or exclude the bad debt charge, that\u2019s one. Number two, STAR WARS for the year $500 million, has kind of been the bogey that I everyone has been shooting for, how do you feel about $500 million of STAR WARS this year? And then, lastly a more open-ended, you talked about the shift in retail sales for movie based properties, sort of from movie released to more of DVD streaming. Can you talk about that shift and is there any way to quantify how much revenue sort of shifted away from the movie debuts and towards the DVD and streaming? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Sure. Let me talk to STAR WARS and the shift, and Deb you can do the first one. The -- on STAR WARS, clearly it's become a much bigger more consistently big brand year-after-year, and that's what we've really seen. And again this year as we head into The Last Jedi, it's a brand that's up in the quarter and we expect very good things this holiday, but also Gerrick as you were describing, expect very strong spring around the brand. We saw it last time for The FORCE AWAKENS. We've seen it throughout this year for Moana and for Beauty and the Beast. We are seeing it around TRANSFORMERS as the DVD dropped on September 28 and the performance has been quite strong. So I think people are enjoying motion pictures both in the theater as well as through electronic sell-through windows and then into DVD windows. Overall, I think it again says good things about the ability to tell stories and have those stories enjoyed across a multitude of screens. It's really obviously one of the premises of our approach and strategy to be both digitally oriented as well as content oriented. And so, I would expect that to continue and continue for our properties as well as Marvel, Lucasfilm and DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN properties.","Deb Thomas","And from an OP standpoint, if we exclude bad debt expense our year-to-date operating profit margin is just slightly behind last year. So we -- as you know as a company always remain very focused on the most efficient cost structure for our company. So given the current environment in our changing revenue, expectations, it just may as Brian said slightly impact our expectations from the beginning of the year. But overall we remain focused on really creating the most cost efficient structure for our company as a whole.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to Debbie Hancock for closing remarks.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, Rob, and thank you everyone for joining the call today.

There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements.","These factors include those set forth in our annual report on form 10-K, our most recent 10-Q, in today's press release and in our other public disclosures. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.","I would now like to introduce Brian Goldner. Brian?","Brian Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today.","The Hasbro team is making progress to accomplish our stated goal of returning to profitable growth this year in an environment where the trade conflict is having the short-term impact we have outlined throughout the year to our stakeholders. We are delivering innovation and creativity globally in gaming, across our Toy business and around the Brand Blueprint as we operate during a very dynamic quarter, and year.","We are actively developing our brands for success in analog and digital play and entertainment while investing for long-term profitable growth, including the September 26 launch of MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena, our investments in Wizards gaming beyond Arena, and our announced plans to acquire Entertainment One.","We are doing this amid a very choppy environment where retailer order patterns have changed in response to potential tariffs, and our supply chain is being pushed to meet high levels of demand in condensed periods of time. We view these dynamic supply chain challenges as short-term, and we are positioning our business for growth in 2019 and over the long-term.","Overall revenues in the quarter grew 2% absent foreign exchange. Revenues were up in Asia and Latin America, including double-digit growth in China and Mexico. Europe remains on track with our plan to stabilize revenues and grow profit this year.","Global point-of-sale declined in the mid-single digits for the quarter, showing declines in July and August with improving trends in September and growth into October. Online point-of-sale continues to grow rapidly. We are the leading toy and game company year-to-date through August, across the G11 markets, according to NPD.","We posted revenue gains in MAGIC: THE GATHERING and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, where only a small percentage of our sales is captured by NPD data, and we generated 20% revenue growth in the Entertainment, Licensing and Digital segment.","In the U.S., however, the threat and implementation of tariffs negatively impacted our quarterly results. For the third quarter, U.S. point-of-sale declined slightly, and retailers continued to lower inventory. With many of our holiday initiatives launching in early fourth quarter point-of-sale has improved in recent weeks and is up to start the quarter.","As you recall, since the administration began discussing tariffs, we have outlined the ripple effect they would have on our business. We've spoken about the changing order patterns in the U.S., whether or not tariffs are ultimately enacted.","In the third quarter, the threat of, and the implementation of tariffs in certain instances, impacted our shipments, and our ability to fully meet demand. Importantly, during Q3 alone we saw multiple different dates for the enactment of List 4 tariffs come and be delayed, now scheduled for December 15 and yet the prospect had our retailers cancel major direct import program orders and rewrite many of those orders as domestic shipments. The impact of the shift was that July and August total shipments were lower and September shipments were far higher than a year ago.","However, given the location of our inventory in Asia to satisfy direct import orders during July and August, we ultimately were unable to re-plan the orders and rewrite all of the orders from direct import to domestic orders all within the quarter.","We were also unable to ship all the orders, many of which came late in September, by the end of the quarter. Our supply chain team worked to rapidly respond as our domestic shipments increased to 59% of orders this year versus 51% of the U.S. and Canada segment this quarter last year.","We prioritized critically important launches like STAR WARS Triple Force Friday, Frozen 2, and NERF Ultra, all of which are off to very strong starts in line with, or ahead of our plans. To meet demand, we added air freight and shifted warehousing at an incremental expense to ensure shelves were stocked as the promotion builds for these initiatives.","We are working to catch up in the first weeks of the fourth quarter and, while early, we are seeing strong consumer demand for these new initiatives. We are working diligently to improve our approach to domestic shipments, and still face the prospect of more direct import cancellations and shifts to domestic orders as the December 15 List 4 date approaches for most of our product lines.","We've built a domestic supply chain that, like much of our approach to product manufacturing and distribution, is asset light. We have historically used a balance of customers' shipments and our own domestic shipments through third-party suppliers to manage our costs and make our supply chain most effective and cost efficient.","In this current environment, we've been transitioning and redesigning our U.S. supply chain at pace.","In addition, while the December 15 action will hit the majority of our products, List 3 tariffs enacted in September impacted some of our games during the third quarter. The direct import orders for these items were cancelled and we worked to get supporting domestic orders while also adjusting pricing to cover the tariff's impact and protect our gross margin.","As we have discussed previously, and experienced in both the second and third quarter, if we take no action the planned December 15 tariffs will curtail direct import shipments by retailers as they want product arriving on or after the 15th to be imported by Hasbro and demand fulfilled in the U.S.","The team is working on programs to help mitigate this impact as well as the impact on our consumers this holiday season, but we anticipate continued potential disruption in the fourth quarter.","Our teams are actively moving our strategic sourcing footprint and are on track to achieve our target of sourcing 50% for the U.S. out of China by year-end 2020. We are having good success identifying and building products in geographies including Vietnam, India, and others. Importantly, as a reminder, we are also sourcing 20% of our U.S. business from the U.S.","At the same time, as online retail grows rapidly and the mix of retailers evolves, retailers continue managing their business to carry lower retail inventories. U.S. retail inventories declined in the quarter mid-single-digits and European inventories were down more than 20% to meet the just in time needs of retailers, and we anticipate inventories will remain lower through the fourth quarter.","We have many new product lines launching in Q4 and more dynamic advertising support driving our innovative products and we are already seeing momentum in POS, and yet, we will likely not recapture all the revenues associated with canceled direct import orders in the third and fourth quarter. We have partnered with retailers to grow demand in a holiday season that has six fewer shopping days than last year.","During the third quarter, global retailers championed Hasbro's lines for Frozen Fan Fest and STAR WARS Triple Force Friday in support of the October 4th merchandising date. Partner Brand revenues increased 40% behind growth in these initiatives as well as Marvel product lines, including the Avengers and Spider-Man franchises, which continue to perform well.","The highly anticipated Disney's Frozen 2 is set to debut in many markets on late November. Hasbro is supporting this huge initiative with a complete line of fashion dolls, small dolls and playsets, including an iconic fashion doll castle which is already outselling our expectations.","STAR WARS Triple Force Friday featured meaningful pre-order activations tied to product reveals and launch initiatives planned by online retailers. We also created limited editions of some of our most popular fan items to drive foot traffic to retail on opening weekend.","Key retailers featured out of aisle placement of product and plan to continue to ramp support of the line as we move closer to the holidays.","We see the power of storytelling in our brands. TRANSFORMERS revenues were up on Bumblebee film-related revenue. Point-of-sale increased in the U.S. and revenues are up year-to-date, although shipments declined in the quarter with no feature film this year.","POWER RANGERS is off to a great start in the U.S. and several countries garnering high ratings for our new series and we're seeing early sales momentum.","Throughout nearly 10 years of storytelling, MY LITTLE PONY grew into a global lifestyle franchise with billions in retail sales. The series finale of Friendship is Magic aired earlier this month. While revenue has declined as this story line comes to an end, we see the potential to once again reimagine the brand and are investing in content and innovation. In partnership with Paramount, we are developing a MY LITTLE PONY animated feature for 2021.","We will seize upon our opportunity to leverage the talent we expect to onboard with the close of the acquisition of Entertainment One to chart the next great stories for Hasbro IP for kids, fans, and families around the world.","Storytelling also sits at the heart of MAGIC: THE GATHERING where the team delivered another quarter of revenue growth including the launch of Thrones of Eldraine and the live launch of MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena in late September. As part of Arena\u2019s launch, we are expanding marketing and promotional activity to reach new potential players. The game will be available at the Epic games storefront, connecting with a sizable global gaming audience in 2020 and beyond.","Given the shift in release timing, the fourth quarter will be a difficult comparison with last year for MAGIC, but we have delivered meaningful growth in the franchise in 2019 and are investing in new digital games and entertainment for future years. This also includes new gaming investments for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS which again grew revenues this quarter.","The team at Wizards of the Coast continues to do tremendous work advancing our capabilities and delivering exceptional experiences to our growing player and audience base.","Through both in-house development and with partners, the Wizards of the Coast team has close to a dozen games in development for delivery over the next five to six years. This includes Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, a highly anticipated DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game we recently announced with our partner Larian.","Finally, the NERF team is delivering new innovation and experiences. While revenue and point-of-sale has not yet turned around this year, point-of-sale is improving following the global launch of Alpha Strike in August and the U.S. launch of Ultra in October.","According to NPD, the category is down through August in the G9, but NERF is gaining share, or was flat, every month since March, in part through the strength of our Fortnite line, where we are delivering more innovation this holiday, and in the under $20 dollar segment with the recent launch of Alpha Strike, where we are also gaining share.","Throughout the rest of this year you will see strong media support behind our key initiatives as well as more social media content.","In early October, in partnership with Kingsmen Creatives, we opened the world's first Nerf Action Xperience located in Singapore. The arena is designed to promote active play, which is the essence of NERF.","In the U.S. we are partnering with Kilburn Live on a new entertainment touring event, NERF Challenge. This all new attraction is debuting in Los Angeles at L.A. Live starting early December and brings the competitive fun of the NERF brand into an action-packed play experience.","In summary, we are continuing to make meaningful progress in a rapidly changing retail environment. Our team is redesigning our go to market efforts as the market shifts. We entered the fourth quarter with the initiatives to drive our business and look forward to 2020 and beyond as we bring more Hasbro owned story-led IP and gaming initiatives to global audiences, gamers and consumers.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deb Thomas","Thank you, Brian and good morning everyone.","As the year progresses, our global teams continue to manage through a dynamic global trade and retail environment. We anticipate this continues throughout 2019 as retailers work to manage inventory, and we are working to mitigate the impact on consumers this holiday season.","This disruption is reflected in revenues, expenses, and in our underlying tax rate. However, within this environment, our teams are delivering an innovative slate across demographics and categories, including in digital gaming that we are supporting with robust marketing programs and continued investment in future gaming initiatives. We are delivering on the goals we set for the year of stabilizing Europe, launching MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena and continuing to grow points of distribution.","Our financial position is strong and we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash on our balance sheet.","Revenues are up slightly over a year ago and include a negative impact from foreign exchange of $20.5 million. Absent this impact, revenues grew 2%. If currency rates stay at similar levels to the end of Q3, we expect a similar negative impact of foreign exchange translation in the fourth quarter when compared with the fourth quarter of last year.","The brand mix within revenue also had an impact on our expenses for the quarter, in addition to the impact on our supply chain from changing retailer shipping patterns. This resulted in operating profit margin of 18.9% for the quarter compared to 20% a year ago.","Within our segments, U.S. and Canada segment revenues declined 1.5%. Franchise Brand and Hasbro Gaming revenues declined in the quarter, while Partner Brand and Emerging Brand revenues grew. As Brian discussed earlier, the U.S. business was impacted by retailer cancelation of direct import orders in the quarter, and some of those orders were not re-written during the period. This had a particular impact on Hasbro Gaming, and represented most of the decline in the category for the quarter.","In franchise brands, MAGIC and MONOPOLY grew, with the remaining brands decline more than offsetting this growth. The largest decline in franchise brands was in NERF, as we positioned the brand for new innovation launching in North America early in the fourth quarter and globally thereafter.","In order to ensure we had inventory available domestically to meet on shelf dates for Frozen 2 and STAR WARS, we also prioritized our Partner Brands through our supply chain. In addition to products associated with those two brands, MARVEL properties also continue to perform well. As retailers focus on reducing inventory levels, retail inventory is down.","Due to the impact of the brand mix of revenues and the additional costs of warehousing and distribution in the U.S., the U.S. and Canada segment operating profit decreased 13% and operating profit margin was 21.6% compared to 24.5% a year ago. Favorable cost of sales was more than offset by higher royalty expense, freight, and warehousing costs, as well as intangible amortization associated with POWER RANGERS, which began selling in the segment in Q2 of this year.","International segment revenues were flat to a year ago including a negative $19.9 million impact from foreign exchange. Revenue declined in Europe and grew in Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, segment revenues grew 4%. At constant FX rates, revenue in Europe was flat to a year ago, Latin America revenue increased 9%, and Asia-Pacific revenue increased 10%.","Within the segment, Partner and Emerging Brand revenues increased, while Franchise Brands and Hasbro Gaming categories declined.","International operating segment profit increased 1% to $67.2 million. Flat revenues and lower cost of sales were somewhat offset by increased royalty expense and intangible amortization.","Entertainment, Licensing and Digital segment revenues increased $19 million or 20% compared to the third quarter a year ago. Revenue growth was driven by MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena and TRANSFORMERS: Bumblebee revenues.","Operating profit decreased to $24.6 million or 21.2% of net revenues, versus $37.1 million, or 38.3% of net revenues in 2018. The decline in operating profit was due to several factors. In the third quarter of last year, we signed a multi-year digital streaming agreement for Hasbro television programming. This typically happens every few years, and has a high pass through to operating profit. Additionally, this year, the segment had higher program production expense as we are receiving revenues and therefore amortizing production costs associated with the Bumblebee film.","Lastly, we continue to invest in digital gaming initiatives, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena and future digital games. As we have discussed in prior quarters, we increased advertising and marketing expense in support of this launch. In addition, we continue to invest in the teams and development of new digital games we expect to launch in the future.","As a reminder when thinking about the fourth quarter, we had a major card set release for MAGIC in the second quarter of this year which occurred in the fourth quarter of last year and we began recognizing our first meaningful revenue associated with Arena last year in the fourth quarter.","Overall, operating profit for the quarter declined $16.1 million or 5%, to 18.9% of net revenues.","Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased 195 basis points in the quarter. Favorable product brand mix from higher entertainment driven revenues, such as Frozen 2, MARVEL and STAR WARS, and a greater mix of Entertainment, Licensing and Digital revenues, including Arena, were somewhat offset by higher costs to bring inventory into the U.S. to sell domestically upon cancellation of direct import orders resulting from tariffs concerns.","Royalty expense increased in dollars and as a percentage of revenue on higher Partner Brand revenues. Based on our expectations for the full-year, we now anticipate royalties to be approximately 8.5% of revenues. Dependent on the level of shipments associated with Frozen 2 and STAR WARS which occur during the remainder of this year, royalty expense could exceed this amount.","Intangible amortization increased in the quarter, and we continue to expect full-year amortization of existing intangibles to be approximately $47 million.","Program production amortization increased as we are now receiving revenue and amortizing the costs associated with TRANSFORMERS: Bumblebee.","Given the timing of expected revenues, we now expect full-year program production cost amortization to be greater than historical levels but remain under 2% of total net revenues. Given a change in the expected timing of receipts on tax credits, we now expect full-year content spend of approximately $50 million to $60 million.","SD&A was up slightly in dollars and 10 basis points as a percentage of revenue over a year ago. Driving the increase are higher shipping and warehousing costs, primarily in the U.S., from higher costs on rerouting shipments to customers initially expected to be taken through direct import. This required moving inventory, into U.S. warehouses to ultimately ship domestically, as well as higher warehousing costs to store domestic U.S. inventory.","We also incurred higher costs associated with building our teams as we invest in digital gaming initiatives surrounding our Wizards of the Coast brands.","Finally, incentive-based compensation expense is higher than a year ago. These increased costs were largely offset by cost savings being achieved from our 2018 cost savings initiatives. Given the higher distribution and warehousing costs we are experiencing, we anticipate that full-year SD&A could be a similar percentage of revenue compared to adjusted full-year of 2018.","As Brian discussed, we continue to believe we will have full-year profitable growth in 2019 and we continue to take the steps to ensure we can grow operating profit margin over time.","Below operating profit other income expense decreased in the quarter, due primarily to losses associated with hedging the GBP purchase price for our proposed acquisition of eOne. Absent this $25.5 million loss, other income improved approximately $5.6 million. After taxes, this loss negatively impacted net earnings by $20.9 million, or $0.16 per share.","Our underlying tax rate, absent discrete events, was 18.2%, compared to an underlying rate of 17.6% last year. During the third quarter of 2018, we also recorded a $17.3 million tax benefit, or $0.14 per share, related to our interpretation of U.S. tax reform guidance that was released during that quarter. Based on the shifting mix of our business, primarily in the U.S., we believe the full-year tax rate will trend to the middle to high-end of our guided 17.5% to 19% range and could potentially go slightly above the high-end due to our customers' and our own responses to potential tariffs.","For the third quarter, reported earnings per share was $1.67. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding the $0.16 FX hedging loss, was $1.84.","Operating cash flow over the past 12 months totaled $860.8 million and we had $1.1 billion in cash at the end of the quarter.","During the third quarter we returned $87.4 million to shareholders, including $85.9 million in dividends and we repurchased $1.5 million in common stock. Year-to-date repurchases total $60.1 million. As a result of our planned acquisition of eOne, which Brian will speak more to in a moment; we anticipate suspending our share repurchase program as we focus our cash flows on reducing leverage arising in the transaction.","Hasbro's balance sheet remains strong. Both our debt to EBITDA and EBITDA to interest ratios at 2.0 and 9.8, respectively, remain within our targets.","Receivables increased 2% and days sales outstanding were 82 days. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, receivables increased 4% in part due to the shift away from U.S. retailers use of direct import orders.","Hasbro owned inventory decreased $21.8 million, or 4%, most significantly in Europe and Latin America. This decrease was partially offset by growth in U.S. and Canada owned inventory as we have previously discussed. Absent the impact of FX, inventory decreased 1%.","Retail inventories declined in the U.S. and internationally, notably in Europe.","In a rapidly changing retail environment, and an uncertain trade situation, we are addressing these changes and adjusting our business on a real time basis. At the same time, we are investing to strengthen our brands and expand our revenue and profit drivers through investments in digital gaming and in entertainment. We are delivering innovation across the portfolio, working with new retailers and introducing new ways to experience our brands, all positioning us to profitably grow in 2019 and going forward.","I would now like to turn the call back to Brian to give an update on the eOne acquisition.","Brian Goldner","Thank you, Deb.","Before we take your questions, I want to update you on the progress of our acquisition of Entertainment One. Last week, the shareholders of eOne overwhelmingly approved the acquisition. We are delighted with their support. We have received regulatory approvals in two of the four jurisdictions where it is required, the U.S. and Germany, with Canada and the UK outstanding. We continue to expect to close the transaction during the fourth quarter. We also continue to expect to finance the transaction with the proceeds of debt financing at approximately $1 billion to $1.25 billion in cash from equity financing. The strategic opportunity to bring onboard the brands, capabilities and talent from eOne is compelling to our long-term prospects as a leading global play and entertainment company and we look forward to sharing more about our plans after the close.","Deb and I are now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","Thank you. And our first question is coming from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Steph Wissink","Thanks. Good morning everyone. Brian, I wanted to just follow-up on your comments regarding shipment timing, because that seems to be the gap to everyone's expectations today. Can you walk us through an illustration of what you observed in your quarter, it sounds like the quarter was extremely backend weighted, should we assume that the fourth quarter is also going to be frontend weighted then as you catch up on some of the outstanding shipments to meet demand? So that's kind of framework for one question. And then I'm wondering if you can just help us appreciate within your supply chain, where are the greatest constraints, is it in getting goods into the U.S. meaning shipper or container capacity and getting things through the port, which is why you were forced to air freight? Or is it more on the 3PL warehouse and logistics side just getting access to enough space to hold the inventory and to sell domestic? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Well, thanks. Thanks for the question. Let me try to summarize in a couple of ways because you're right, in an environment like this one, without the trade conflict, our growth in the quarter could have been more consistent with our year-to-date results. There are a number of regions and brands that grew revenues and our overall revenue was impacted by the disruption that was caused by the threatened implementation of tariffs.","We do use this asset light model that relies on the balance of our domestic shipments coming from a 3PL supplier provider, and then our customers direct import orders.","So let me give you an example as you ask. A retailer would place an order let's say in August for direct import, so sales and product ownership, the transfers that would occur in Asia. Then when the tariff is announced for goods arriving after September 1, they cancel that order, and they shift it to a domestic order where they take ownership in the U.S. This happened multiple times in the quarter as the rolling tariffs or potentiality of enactment of tariffs.","As a result, we needed to rewrite the order from a domestic or a direct import order to a domestic order, as they have different terms, and then we need to ensure that the inventory is available in the U.S. because of the original order required inventory in Asia. And then we need to fulfill the order in the United States. So given those number of shifts and nearly 10 percentage point increase of domestic orders as a percent of U.S. and Canada in the third quarter, we didn't meet all the demand during the quarter. So the impact of the shift was that July and August total shipments were lower and September shipments were far higher than a year-ago.","We believe that we could meet all the demand in September, but the really the timing of new orders in many in instances was just too late. We did incur some incremental shipping and warehousing expense including some air freight, which also impacted our margin. We've been catching up in the fourth quarter. But we also are still looking at a potential December 15 date for the enactment of tariffs. The team is working in real time to come up with and we have new plans around ways to in 2020 and beyond deal with the balance between our domestic shipments and our direct import shipments.","But we've been working to redesign in real time, our domestic shipping plan. And we really have a number of new initiatives coming for the fourth quarter we're very excited about a lots of new innovation we've seen early results in NERF Ultra. We're seeing the early results on Disney's Frozen 2 and on STAR WARS and a raft of other brand initiatives. But the results in Q3 were primarily related to the timing of the potential enactment of tariffs. And the way we've gone to market historically.","Steph Wissink","Brian, should we model your own brands and to improve as a rate in the fourth quarter, I'm just trying to make sure I'm understanding what you're saying because it sounds like you prioritize franchise which makes sense. But should we assume that the rate of decline in your own brands in the Q3 will get much worse or will get better in Q4?","Brian Goldner","Yes, the two brands -- the two brand areas that were most impacted by the direct imports first, Deb noted is that our games business was directly impacted. And remember, some of our games were actually tariffs as part of List 3 tariff. So we're now in a tariff environment on those games. We took pricing in the quarter to offset the impact of those tariffs and those direct import shipments were impacted.","The brand that's most associated with direct import and remember Q3 is our highest quarter for direct imports is the NERF brand. So that clearly was a brand that was impacted.","Having said that, if you look at our overall brands, we did note that in the fourth quarter, we do have a tough comparison on MAGIC. MAGIC has grown substantially throughout the year. In fact, our plan to grow MAGIC over the next five years is really well underway. And yet in the fourth quarter, we have some tough comps versus a year-ago where we had a major card release.","So I think overall, we have a lot of brand initiatives around Hasbro's brands. We have a lot of new innovation coming into the market. We have a very big fourth quarter lined up for our partners between Disney's Frozen, STAR WARS, and the continuation in the strength of Marvel. And so I'd say it's a bit more of a balance, but we also noted that we probably have a bit higher royalties in the fourth quarter as well. ","Operator","The next question is from the line of Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Ng","Hi, thanks for the question. I just want to talk a little bit about the moving parts around royalty expenses. I think you guys said that in the shift to the direct import program, you were prioritizing partner brands like STAR WARS and Frozen this year. So as we think about 2020, should we expect a decline in royalty expense as the mix of partner brands normalize? And could you give us a sense of what you expect the mix of partner brands to be this year? Thanks.","Deb Thomas","Yes, I think that, good morning, Michael. The -- as we look to 2020 while we usually give guidance about the upcoming year at Toy Fair and we will do so again, really the strength of our partner brands that we're seeing right now at Retail, with Frozen 2 and STAR WARS just coming out and launching initially with mostly the fan base in STAR WARS coming out on October 4, for Triple Force Friday, very exciting. We see that as we've previously spoken about really continuing into 2020.","So in a year where we have major movie releases coming so late in the year, we tend to see the benefit of that continuing into the next year. And I think we continue to believe that as we sit here today, as well as being excited about things, like, the Marvel Properties coming next year and our own Snake Eyes, as well as some other properties that we have coming from an entertainment standpoint.","So as I sit here today, I would think our royalty expense might be a bit higher than it's been historically. But perhaps you're seeing the impact of much of it coming late in the year, this year. When we look to our own brands for 2020, we're very excited about those as well.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Tim Conder","Thank you. Just to circle back to the what seems like the primary focus here the tariffs and direct import dynamic. Granted, that won't fully anniversary to a degree until Q3 next year. But given things that kick in December and how you're scrambling and doing the best you can obviously under difficult circumstances here. Do you see that adjusting by Q1 or Q2? I guess is question number one. And then on the Canadian and UK approval, I know you're anticipating closer here the deal in Q4, but any update on timing of that, Brian? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Sure. Look, we expect to still close eOne deal in Q4 of this year. And that's the timing we have two of the four regulatory authorities having approved and we're very happy to have the shareholder vote and support and behind us.","As we look at the business going forward, we feel like we have a number of strong initiatives coming into the fourth quarter this year. We have been addressing our supply chain and the balance between the DI and our domestic shipments. As we go forward, the team is already working with our retailers on new ways, new techniques, and new programs that we can get a great balance using our asset light model, but picking up on new ways to bring product into the U.S. using the strength of our biggest retailers who tend to also be our biggest direct importers and then continue to drive our business with our own domestic shipments, so finding that balance.","I would expect in early 2020, we could get back to that balance and also recognize that we would like to see the tariff environment abate and to mitigate. And we would hope to continue great dialogue with the administration to see that occur. We continue to lead our strategic sourcing footprint outside of China to be below 50% at year-end 2020 and we will continue to source in great other geographies like Vietnam and India.","And so again, it's a dynamic environment. But the underlying strength of our business is apparent. The underlying strength of our brands is -- is being presented to our customers and our consumers. We have great partner brands as well as own franchise brands and gaming initiatives and it's been obfuscated by this tariff environment.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Crum","Okay, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Deb, can you remind us what your expectations are for ad spend during the year. I think the original guidance was around 10% and as net revenue and the rate of growth has been a little bit slower relative to our model, given some of the initiatives you guys outlined at the beginning of the year. So just looking for an update there? And then, Brian, can you remind us its importance to MAGIC: THE GATHERING and MAGIC: THE Arena is that an important markets for the King. Thanks.","Deb Thomas","Sure. Well, let me take the advertising questions. And if you don't mind, Brian first, Drew we do continue to expect our advertising kind of in line with our initial guidance and just under -- just as around that 10%, or, just under that that 10% range, and much of that was, as we said, kind of gearing we had some specific expense gearing up around the launch of MAGIC. So it launched very late in the quarter and you'll continue to see us advertising and marketing heavily around that in the fourth quarter now that we're in open launch.","Drew Crum","Okay, got it.","Brian Goldner","Yes. And then if you look at Wizards overall in our strategy, we said that we believe we could double the size of the Wizards of the Coast business over the next five years, as we've accomplished over the past five years. And this year's growth puts us on pace to achieve this objective. And yet, the storytelling cadence of the card releases has it's up against the tough comparison from last year's fourth quarter.","Both analog and digital are performing very strongly. And then we're also working on person, first-party and third-party games and they're progressing really well. In 2020, we're going to have several new games to talk about with you.","As we look at the TCG, we're seeing growth in unique players. We're also seeing growth in games played. As we get into Q1 of 2020, there's a new gathering and new card release that returns to Theros which is a fan favorite, and a launch of a new standard legal set called Theros Beyond Death. So we're excited about the card games that gets back up and pace -- on pace for first quarter 2020.","As we look at MAGIC Arena, we ended the Open Beta with over 1.5 billion games played, with the game seeing significant year-over-year growth in every quarter since the start of our closed beta in December of 2017.","Our streaming growth is up over 100% with over 65,000 streamers streaming the game in Open Beta. We're one of the best reviewed Free to Play Games released in 2019. And it's very exciting to see a Metacritic score of 82 which is really on par with some of the best games in the industry. The launch weekend saw the game featured in the top 10 games streamed on Twitch. And again we've had and want to thank no more than three-and-a-half million participants that have been in our beta for making Arena really the most successful MAGIC digital game in the 25-year history. So we're really well on our way, we also have making progress to be on the Epic Games storefront for 2020 and we'll expand our audience.","We're developing a Mac OS version of the game, but we're also making progress with our mobile MAGIC game that's currently in test market and we'll have more news for you on that shortly into 2020.","So, again, we feel very good about the portfolio of games that we're bringing for the Wizards of the Coast brands and for MAGIC: THE GATHERING.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Gerrick Johnson","Hey, good morning. So List 4-301 I think it was announced back in May. So we knew this impact was coming on our last call in July. The conversation here sounds a little bit like there's you were caught off guard a little bit in some regards. So what changed since we talked about this in July? What's different from how you're originally planning and what's going on right now?","Brian Goldner","Yes, the three different communications also happened during the third quarter because the tariffs continue to get push back throughout the third quarter. And there were different proclamations around where the tariffs would occur. So the teams continue to gear up recognize that you're talking about in the third quarter, a year ago, about 50% of our sales were direct imports. So it's a big business for us in the third quarter, and we use that balance between that in our 3PL supply in the U.S. for domestic.","Given it continued to get pushed back, we were canceling orders in Asia, moving the inventory to the U.S. And the biggest difference versus our expectations for the quarter was what went on in September, and that we were unable to get all the products domestically through our supply chain, with the DI orders having come down or being cancelled. And that's really the difference maker of the quarter.","And as we head into Q4, we obviously prioritized around the earliest launches, and we have product in market, we're seeing really good results. But it was just the fact that we were short of either getting matched inventory, meaning inventory that comes in from Asia that's now available domestically that we can then put to a domestic retailer in time to meet an order or the actual domestic supply chain.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay, okay, that makes sense. But you mentioned that some orders were cancelled or not rewritten. So what are those products and what was not rewritten of the orders that were cancelled?","Brian Goldner","Yes, Deb talked a bit about it, there was and as you recall, there's a List 3. Some of our games that are more off the board games were part of List 3. So the tariffs were enacted, those DI orders were cancelled. And then we began to get some additional supporting orders for those games, but it came much later to come into the fourth quarter a bit. But we also had to take pricing across a number of dimensions to again support our gross margin around those games. As we said, we would, once the tariffs were enacted on certain products that are in our portfolio. So that was a process that went on for during Q3 as well.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","Thank you very much. So as retailers' right size their direct import programs and also given the need that Hasbro need to hold more inventory into Q4. Also we have Entertainment's plate rich Q4, I'm trying to understand why inventory is down on balance sheet entering the quarter?","Deb Thomas","Hey Arpin\u00e9, it\u2019s Deb. I'll take that. It's actually, so there is a couple of things. We've been working hard on reducing inventory in several locations. And it's -- we haven't actually talked about the fact that we have stabilized our European business actually and our international business was up in the quarter absent FX.","So FX is the -- is a big factor of why inventory is down. So as we think about it, it is up in the U.S. as we moved more inventory here domestically in order to be able to ship what we need to ship domestically versus direct import with what we're seeing in these trends now that we've been talking about, but it is down in our European business primarily and also in Latin America, it's up a little bit in Asia, just because where our business is growing there. But FX is probably the biggest reason why it's down overall.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","Okay. And then quick follow-up with Brian, I know it's still early on. But are there potentially parts of the eOne business that Hasbro could opportunistically divest over time, if you look at the business today?","Brian Goldner","We're very excited about bringing on board the brands, the capabilities and the personnel. And we are actively meeting one another and beginning to share what each business is all about. And I'd say, we'd like to close on our deal. And then we'll begin to look in earnest about the strongest and best and biggest growth drivers.","But it's very exciting to look at the prospects of the two companies together and how we can continue to drive even more of our owned IP to drive value for our shareholder across multiple dimensions of the Brand Blueprint. And we have a number of great brand initiatives coming this year for the holidays and we feel like in the future we'll have even more owned IP in the marketplace that will support our toys, games, and consumer products business as well as location based entertainment. So we'll close the deal and then we'll be able to give you a broader perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser with D.A. Davison. Please proceed with your question.","Linda Bolton Weiser","Hi, so, could you talk about the price increases you did take already and if you are sensing any in the data, any kind of demand reduction in terms of volume demand by consumers in reaction to the pricing? And also can you comment on the different comments that the retailers have been making with regard to pricing related to the tariffs because I think Walmart has been openly saying that consumers are going to face higher prices, whereas Target actually said that they're not going to accept any more price increases related to tariffs. So can you talk about the whole-- the whole pricing situation? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","Sure. Well, the tariffs have been enacted now on List 3 products, which includes some of our games, and I would focus you again on kind of face-to-face games that are kind of non-traditional board games like games like Bop-It. And what we've done is looked at a portfolio approach to pricing. So we really look across our portfolio of games, we have many new games launching. And again, we're looking at critical price points. We're looking at demand and price elasticity, spending a lot of time to ensure the consumer gets the great games that they want, that they're able to participate fully in the broad array of our games and portfolio of our games.","And so being thoughtful about how we take pricing, but we are taking pricing to protect our gross margin. Thus far we have communicated the intention to take pricing on List 3 and have on List 4, we are actively communicating but if the December 15 tariffs were to go into effect, we would take pricing to again protect our gross margin and those price increases would be passed along to consumers. And, again, we'll use a combination of product and portfolio approach to get pricing for our products ensure we still hit critical price points, and really trying to give the consumer a great holiday.","We don't see tariffs being enacted two weeks before Christmas is giving the consumer the optimal holiday season. And we're hoping through engaged dialogue with the administration that we can mitigate any impact and\/or preclude that from happening.","Linda Bolton Weiser","Thanks. And then if I could have a second question. You talked about your difficulty in getting the product over here to be able to fulfill the domestic orders, but yet, end demand for the toys will or will not be there Christmas, we're assuming it will be there because you have strong popular product. So is the supply chain constraint, just something that pushes over demand fulfillment into the first quarter or early part of 2020 such that consumers will still want the product and you make it carry over demand into the early part of the year. Is that something that's possible?","Brian Goldner","Well, I think you've hit on something really important as we think about some of the initiatives that are launching in Q4. Let's just take three, three initiatives. You look at Disney's Frozen 2, STAR WARS and NERF Ultra. These are three initiatives that we absolutely believe will have even more impact in 2020 than they'll have in 2019. So we're very excited about the launch. We're very excited about what's been happening since October 4 in the marketplace. We're seeing very strong demand for each of those initiatives. And yet, will satisfy even more demand coming through the holidays as millions and millions of people around the world get to enjoy that entertainment or get to begin to enjoy NERF Ultra. Right now, Ultra is only in the U.S. is a launch and we wish we had even more product and are racing to get product out to more markets around the world.","We're already seeing that several of our products are in hot demand and are selling incredibly well. Our Frozen Castle is a great hot seller. And again, it's selling ahead of our demand. And so you're right, there'll be a big impact into 2020. We have a lot of new initiatives coming in 2020 and a number of other new entertainment initiatives as well as brand initiatives. Year-to-date, we have four brands that are up, MONOPOLY, MAGIC, TRANSFORMERS, and PLAY-DOH. So we do have brands that are selling quite well, we had some puts and takes in the third quarter.","Many of those elements or issues were related to the just the supplying of product that we've talked about. We do view this tariff environment as short-term in nature and certainly disruptive. But we also view 2020 -- 2019 holiday and 2020 as an opportunity to grow our business. We have great initiatives, great marketing, and teams on the field who are actively redesigning our path to the marketplace. And we believe we'll be in a very good position coming into 2020.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Fred Wightman","Hey guys, good morning. It\u2019s actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. I think it'd be really helpful just given all the noise from a timing and a tariff perspective. How should we think about potentially getting back to those 2017 revenue and operating targets next year? Is that something that's still on the table? Or is sort of everything that you're seeing in the market today change that target?","Brian Goldner","I think that in many ways, we continue to track towards that idea. We said that if things few things broke right 2020 could look like 2017. Obviously, the tariff and tariff environment has created some short-term disruption to our growth trajectory. But if you look year-to-date having grown 5% absent FX, that's that mid-single-digit growth, we've talked to you about getting back on track remembering that we were just coming through Toys R Us. We certainly are seeing the acceleration in our gaming business particularly in Wizards of the Coast, we have a number of new initiatives coming for 2020 and yet, in overall, we saw that in September, overall retail sales were down a bit.","So we just feel that we have what it takes to be successful for the long-term. We believe that we will be back on track with the kind of growth trajectory we created from 2012 to 2017 that 5% CAGR in revenues and double-digit net earnings CAGR that we can get back there. And that given some of these short-term issues, 2020 is possible and we just need, as we've said, from the very beginning, a few things to break right for us in order to accomplish that objective.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Handler","Yes. Good morning, and thanks for the question. Brian, I wondered, if you could talk a little bit about the fundamentals of eOne, when eOne reached the end of its last fiscal year, you talked about for its, the family -- the family kids business, they expected to see strong revenue and EBITDA growth in its current fiscal year fiscal 2020. The company has in recent weeks come out with Q1 statement and the first half of the year statement saying revenue in that segment is flat year-over-year and margins have contracted a little bit. So wonder if you could provide some perspective of first, is that business -- was that business always expected to be backend weighted. Has anything changed in with the core of that business and what's in and what you expected to see when you first took a look at the books?","Brian Goldner","Yes, we feel very good about multiple aspects of the eOne business, the family and brands business clearly, there's a perennial star in Tampa and we feel that together the teams can do even a better job into the future as we take on more of the toys and games business as they continue to reinvent, reimagine the storytelling. And we do more of the licensing in-house. We see an opportunity again with PJ Masks as it goes forward. Ricky Zoom is just getting launched around the world. And so again, that's a very, very exciting new prospect; they have a number of new original IPs in development that they intend to launch.","And then they -- also when they recently spoke, they were not full-year results, so not all the interim periods were the same. So I think that that was just to try to get some correspondence or communication out to shareholders in advance of our potential close in Q4 this year.","Eric Handler","Okay, so overall, for you nothing is at least on the near-term perspective. I fully understand the long-term perspective, the long-term view, but nothing has changed at least on the near term, fundamental basis with them?","Brian Goldner","No, not at all. No, we feel very enthusiastic about coming together with eOne.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Raymond Stochel with Consumer Edge. Please proceed with your question.","Raymond Stochel","Great, thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about NERF innovation both out the strike and Ultra as far as the timing, just an update on the timing there? And then where do you think you're trending for year-end for NERF overall within hopefully the context of what you're seeing this holiday in terms of competition?","Brian Goldner","Yes, so overall, for NERF the team has brought forward a lot of new innovation and in the fourth quarter will have 10 new blasters across the NERF business, so they brought a lot of new innovation to the business and into the category. Clearly Fortnite has been a strong performer and yet they have new innovation coming now, there's new form factors also coming within the Fortnite part of the business.","We've seen our share of growth for NERF overall, we've seen our share in under $20 grow with Alpha Strike. And we're now with the launch of Ultra in the U.S. seeing U.S. POS up for the first time in several quarters. So we believe we're on the right track as we get more innovation at volume, at scale, to not only grow the NERF business, but once again grow the category as we've been the leader in really inventing and reinventing this category over time.","As we get into 2020, there's a number of new innovations that are coming clearly Ultra scale gets out to more countries globally. We have new innovations coming across other platforms for NERF. And we're also bringing that experiential part of NERF to bear around the world between our agents, first location based experience and then something here in the United States that I spoke to.","So again feel very good about NERF in the long-term prospects. Obviously, some interruption of that in the quarter because of the way a lot of NERF direct import business gets done. But where we have new innovation, we are seeing the growth in POS and very happy NERF Nation where we bring the product to the market.","Raymond Stochel","Got it, thanks. And then a follow-up would be on some incremental details around guidance. So, royalties, sort of at least higher than what we were contemplating could be different maybe than what you all were contemplating or what Street was contemplating. And also SG&A sort of flat as a percent of sales. So are those two things driven by I guess royalties, one higher partner brands, brand sales, and we may have thought prior in SG&A such as the incremental warehousing and supply chain? Or are we having an issue on both of those line items, which is just lower overall expected revenues? And maybe we had been thinking prior for the full-year?","Deb Thomas","I think on the royalties, we wanted to make sure we put that new guidance out there because it actually is exceeding our guidance that we've previously provided. And that has to do with the way the mix of our partner brands are playing out with our franchise brands and frankly exceeding our originally expected demand from what we're seeing right now. So that's really royalties. And that's why we wanted to update you when we know we saw this trend developing.","From an SG&A standpoint, we are getting the cost savings that we anticipated, we still expect that we'll get the $50 million in cost savings, just being masked a bit by higher shipping and warehousing costs and also within that line a big piece of that is the investment we're making in growing our Wizards of the Coast brands as we think about adding the teams to do the game development, you've got some amortization of previously capitalized games that are going through that admin line.","So you're seeing that there this year, we really think it's primarily that that shipping in warehousing that's impacting us. And that's hitting -- that\u2019s hitting that line that that will keep the comps about the same to adjusted SG&A because we had some unusual charges that went through that line item last year as well.","So overall, we're getting the cost savings, we believe we'll get the cost savings next year, we need to work on these factors that are hitting us in the quarter. But we continue to work to reduce costs in that line, but make the appropriate investments to keep investing in our future because as Brian said, our goal has been to grow the Wizards of the Coast brands, we think we can double them like we did in the last five years and the next five and that just requires investments. So we won't take our foot off the gas on those investments and we'll continue looking at different ways to save money to pay for those investments as we go forward.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Thank you so much for the question. First I would just like to ask about, how you're thinking about the importance of trying to maintain access to your two commercial paper market as you consider the funding mix for eOne. And then just as a follow-up, again, on the funding mix, are you considering also incorporating any sort of Sterling or even Euro borrowings in addition to dollars? Thank you.","Deb Thomas","So good morning, and thanks for asking question. For us, it's a great question. It's important for us to maintain access to the commercial paper markets and we stated it's our intent to be an investment grade company, we think in addition to giving us access to commercial paper and affording us with the appropriate available liquidity to keep investing in our business to grow in the long-term, that's very important to us.","So we will prioritize paying down our debt to get back to our leverage targets, two to two-and-a-half times and greater than eight as we look at debt-to-EBITDA and EBITDA to interest. But it is important to us to maintain that. That being said, we did end the quarter with $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet. In the last 12 months, we've generated about $860 million of cash flow. So we do generate a lot of cash.","As we look at the transaction, we have hedged a portion of the transaction knowing that we will need pounds to pay it and we saw that running to our P&L this quarter, and we're looking at the various borrowings that we could do to actually pay for the transaction in various currencies as well.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","And no further sort of delineation between how your liquidity needs could be affected, if you were to say, falter Tier 3 CP access versus Tier 2 would that impair your borrowing ability at all?","Deb Thomas","Well, we look at our borrowing ability, it's pretty strong, but it also get -- affords us at the rates we're at, and being an investment grade company and with the ratings we get from our rating agencies, that it is something we can afford go forward while we continue to invest in our business.","Operator","Thank you. We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call over to Debbie Hancock for closing remarks.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, Robin. Thank you everyone for joining the call today. The replay will be available on our website in approximately two hours. Additionally, management's prepared remarks will be posted on our website following this call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Debbie Hancock, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me today are Brian Goldner, President and Chief Executive Officer; David Hargreaves, Chief Operating Officer; and Deb Thomas, Chief Financial Officer.","Our fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings release was issued earlier this morning and is available on our website. The press release includes information regarding non-GAAP financial measures included in today's call. Additionally, whenever we discuss earnings per share, or EPS, we are referring to earnings per diluted share.","This morning, Brian will discuss key factors impacting our results, and Deb will review the financials. We will then open the call to your questions.","Before we begin, let me note that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management's expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters. These forward-looking statements may include comments concerning our product and entertainment plans, anticipated product performance, business opportunities and strategies, costs, financial goals and expectations for our future financial performance and achieving our objective.","There are many factors that could cause actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. Some of those factors are set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K, in today's press release and in our other public disclosures. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.","Now I would like to introduce Brian Goldner. Brian?","Brian D. Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In 2011, we continued to develop and execute our branded play strategy. We invested in growing our capabilities to deliver innovation globally across our brands and our business. We invested in creating new teams to deploy our brands around the world adding new immersive experiences through entertainment, digital media and licensing. While these investments enabled us to deliver very strong growth in our International business during 2011, and overall solid revenue growth for the fourth quarter and full year, we did not meet our expectations for growth in the U.S. and Canada including in the Games & Puzzle business.","When we look to our success in both mature and emerging markets internationally, we know and you can see that our innovation, marketing and brands are very successful. It is clear we can do better in the U.S. and Canada. In both this business and in gaming, we have taken steps to deliver more innovation and growth through the direction of new leadership and the implementation of new plans. I will speak to this more in detail shortly, but let's first review a number of successes from 2011.","Revenue grew 7%, reaching $4.29 billion for the year, ahead of our 5% compound annual growth rate target for revenue. As a result of our expanded global footprint, marketing and brand innovation, the International segment grew 19% or 16% without the benefit of the foreign exchange impact. Revenue grew in every major territory internationally, in both mature and emerging markets, and we gained share in 9 of the 10 countries for which we have third-party data.","As we indicated and planned, we are growing in Latin America, posting 19% growth during 2011 and at Asia Pacific, where we continue to have strong growth, up 24% in 2011 as we establish our presence in emerging markets and grow our business in mature markets. ","In 2011, Hasbro was the fastest-growing major toy company in Western Europe. We gained 1.4 percentage points in market share, and have achieved market share leadership in 3 European countries. Through the successful implementation of our branded play strategy, which at the core, focuses on the innovation and invention of Hasbro brands worldwide, we are building bigger and more global brands. In 2011, several brands were more than $400 million of annual revenue including Transformers, which posted $483 million in revenue growing more than 85% year-over-year. Beyblade delivered $477 million in revenues on strong growth in the U.S. and international markets. And Nerf, which has grown fourfold over the past 5 years, was $410 million in revenue in 2011, essentially flat with 2010 and driven by strong growth overseas. The Nerf team continues to deliver great innovation for the brand and we have 2 major new initiatives planned for 2012.","In addition to innovation within our core brands, we are inventing new global brands. In 2011, we successfully launched key initiatives including KRE-O and Sesame Street. Beginning in July 2011, KRE-O launched in 10 markets globally, generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue and good early market share. In 2012, we will add 15 new markets by year end, as well as expand the line to include Battleship supported by our major motion picture with Universal.","2011 was also our first year with Sesame Street and marked a great first step toward building a year-round global brand. To do this, we are creating play experiences around a number of Sesame Street characters, which engage children and help them to learn. We are very excited about the potential of this brand over the coming years. ","Hasbro's inventory levels at year end are down 8%. In the U.S., retail inventory was essentially flat and of better overall quality than last year. Given the growth in our business internationally, retail inventories grew in many countries, but we are comfortable with the quality and level of inventory.","In 2011, we also funded important investments, which expanded our global capabilities in sales, marketing, licensing, entertainment and infrastructure. ","And finally, we grew EPS for the 11th consecutive year while returning $577 million to shareholders through our stock buyback and quarterly dividend programs. Last week, the board voted to increase our quarterly dividend 20% to $0.36 per share, marking the third year in a row we have grown our dividend 20% or more.","In total, there were a number of things that worked well for Hasbro in 2011. However, despite these significant accomplishments, the year did not meet our performance expectations. Our U.S. and Canada segment declined 2%, weakening most notably post-Thanksgiving when the positive point of sale trends we had seen early in the quarter did not continue. This decline was in line with the industry decline in the U.S., reflecting a challenging economic environment but was not up to our expectations. As a result, we made some strategic moves in the leadership of our business. Wiebe Tinga, who many of you heard from at our Investor Day in November, has taken over as President of the U.S. and Canada business. He is a 24-year veteran of Hasbro, most recently serving as President of Asia-Pacific and Latin America and has been instrumental in the company's expansion in key emerging markets. In this role, Wiebe has built a strong team both in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, and the heads of these regions are now reporting directly to David Hargreaves, Hasbro's COO. Wiebe brings a tremendous track record of strong performance, and I'm delighted to have someone with his experience, passion and financial discipline to step in and lead our U.S. and Canada teams. He and the team are focused on returning the business to historical levels of profitability and rebuilding our share in the region by capitalizing on the strength of Hasbro innovation, marketing and brands as he has done successfully around the world.","Additionally, our Games & Puzzle category performance in 2011 was disappointing, contributing to the weakness in U.S. We have already outlined for you a multi-year plan that is designed to drive innovation and excellence in gaming, stabilizing this business in 2012 and delivering growth in 2013 and beyond. We have a new team with a lot of talent from outside the traditional board game arena. We've invested in this team establishing the new Gaming Center of Excellence, and they are innovating, creating new technologies and inventing new brands. We continue to believe that through a combination of face-to-face, off-the-board, and digital gaming, there's an opportunity to grow our gaming business. We had a good foundation upon which to build as Hasbro has 8 of the top 10 game brands in the U.S. last year.","At Toy Fair, we'll unveil a number of new gaming initiatives, which we are excited about and set the stage for the types of innovation we seek to bring to market go forward. Before I move on from gaming, let me speak to the continued success of Magic: The Gathering. ","The team at Wizards of the Coast has done a tremendous job of taking this brand, which totaled less than $100 million in revenues in 2008, and was on the decline to where it is today, the largest brand in our Games & Puzzle category, the largest game brand in the U.S. and more than double the size it was just 3 years ago. It proves that with new leadership, strong consumer insights, innovative game play and the integration of face-to-face and digital play, gaming brands can thrive. We need to do more of this. In 2012, the team at Wizards of the Coast will unveil a completely new brand initiative, which you will learn more about at Toy Fair.","Looking at the rest of our business in 2011, our Boys category had a tremendous year, growing 35% on the strength of Transformers and Beyblade, as well as the launch of KRE-O, significant sales of Nerf and growth in Super Soaker. Transformers revenue grew by more than 85% year-over-year and came in at the low end of our targeted revenue range for the brand. As the fourth highest grossing film of all time, Transformers: Dark of the Moon was extremely successful at the global box office, and we recently began airing Transformers Prime television animation around the world. In 2012, we have the benefit of global television programming, an innovative line with new characters and play patterns and several new digital gaming introductions behind the Transformers brand.","Beyblade exceeded our expectations and was an incredible success globally. When we began to work on Beyblade with our partners, Nelvana, d-rights and Takara Tomy, we set out to manage it as a long-term battling brand, with continuous innovation beyond the core tops. We are entering the next phase of that strategy this year. In fall 2012, we are introducing an all-new play pattern supported by Nelvana's television entertainment and digital play called Beywheels [ph]. In addition, we have other new innovation in the line for 2012, which we will unveil at Toy Fair that will help the continued momentum in the brand.","In 2012, we believe in our Marvel opportunity with Marvel and Sony's reinvention of The Amazing Spider-Man, as well as Marvel Studios' The Avengers. We're also looking forward to new Ultimate Spider-Man animation and continuing Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes animation. These films and television series help make up a tremendous entertainment slate we are supporting in 2012, which also includes Star Wars: The Phantom Menace in 3-D, which hits theaters this Friday; Battleship with Universal; and G.I. Joe: Retaliation with Paramount; as well as the global television programming behind Transformers; continued television animation and innovation in Beyblade.","Now turning to our Girls category. Although overall, the category did not grow in 2011, My Little Pony through a coordinated entertainment, merchandise and retail program, as well as Baby Alive, which is growing in the U.S. and internationally, both posted year-over-year gains. FurReal Friends, after doubling revenues in 2010, remained essentially flat in 2011. This brand is a great success story. Created just 10 years ago, it is now a very significant growth brand for Hasbro. In 2012, FurReal Friends brings new play with the all new Dizzy Dancers line and an exciting new feature pet for the holidays. In fall 2012, Littlest Pet Shop will get a new look at its own Hasbro Studios television series set to air in the U.S. on The Hub. Similar to how we are successfully reigniting My Little Pony, Littlest Pet Shop television will tell stories, which engage the Littlest Pet Shop consumer and carry through our merchandise and retail presence. Finally, our Preschool category grew 4% in 2011 supported by the successful introduction of Sesame Street and innovation in core PLAYSKOOL.","As I mentioned earlier, 2011 marked the first year we had product on shelf in our 10-year alliance with the Sesame Workshop. We are delighted to be working together, and last year was the beginning of building a year-round global brand for Sesame Street. We're off to a good start in 2011. Sesame Street was the #1 dollar growth property within the plush category. ","Within Preschool, we also successfully introduced the all-new Playskool Heroes line based on Transformers, Star Wars and Marvel. In 2012, this line will benefit from theatrical releases for Star Wars and Marvel properties. Additionally, Transformers Rescue Bots television programming will premiere on The Hub on February 18. We're also excited that Marvel Super Hero Squad programming began airing on The Hub on January 30. In conjunction with this, Marvel is expanding its licensing business behind Super Hero Squad, which Hasbro will support with an expanded line of product.","Turning to Hasbro television. Our global initiatives are making real progress with Hasbro Studios programming now airing globally in over 140 countries this year. In the U.S., we are one year into the launch of the all-new Hub Television Network, and the ratings trends continue to be positive. The fourth quarter is the first quarter we have year-over-year comparisons for The Hub. And during the quarter, The Hub posted 31% gains in total day against kids 2 to 11. The network posted growth throughout 2011, and Hasbro Studios series accounted for 5 of the top 10 series for the year. ","In respect to our movie deals, Stretch Armstrong is scheduled for release on April 11, 2014, and we are partnering with Relativity to bring this film to global audiences. I've described to you before the value of reinventing a brand like Stretch Armstrong. Remember, we have not actively marketed Stretch Armstrong for nearly 20 years. While it is a vault brand, the reinvention and reimagination of this brand will deliver incremental revenues and profits as we activate the entire brand blueprint globally in 2014 and beyond.","With Candy Land, we're pleased to expand our relationship with Sony. We are also looking forward to be working with Adam Sandler and his production company, Happy Madison, for the first time. The creative talent on board for Candy Land is amazing, and we're excited to see the world of Candy Land come alive for kids and families everywhere. ","In 2012, we have 2 films based on Hasbro brands. First, in partnership with Universal, Battleship will debut on the big screen in April, internationally and in May, domestically. And together with Paramount, the second G.I. Joe film, G.I. Joe: Retaliation, will hit theaters in June. We are now working with 4 major studio partners: Sony, Relativity, Universal, and Paramount, which provides us access to amazing talent and tremendous resources. As we look ahead to this year, we believe absent the impact of foreign exchange, we can again grow revenues and earnings per share in 2012. Our focus is on the core tenets of our branded play strategy. This is centered on creating the most innovative play experiences in the industry, inventing new brands, keeping momentum in our International businesses while delivering new immersive brand experiences for our consumers. Our plan includes a return to historical profitability levels in the U.S. and Canada business and a drive for growth while creating innovative gaming experiences globally through newly created and reinvented Hasbro brands. I believe we have the right teams in place to make this happen. We have invested in the infrastructure to move from global aspirations to global execution and are positioned to capitalize on the innovation in our line all around the world. Our branded play strategy is working even as there are areas of improvement we need to make in our execution. We look forward to speaking with you later this week at our investor event in Toy Fair in New York, where we'll update you on our business and provide visibility to a number of new and exciting Hasbro brand initiatives. We hope you're able to join us. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deborah Thomas","Thank you, Brian, and good morning. As Brian spoke to, 2011 was a good year for Hasbro albeit with areas to improve. We grew our business, invested in long-term growth opportunities and returned $577 million in cash to you, our shareholders, through dividends and share repurchases. We grew revenue, operating profit and earnings per share including strong international growth. However, the results of our U.S. and Canada segment did not meet our expectations, and this impacted our performance for the full year. As Brian mentioned, we put new leadership in place to drive growth and improve profitability in this segment go forward. We're also keenly focused on managing our worldwide costs and improving the leverage of our expenses while continuing to unlock the potential of our brands globally.","For the full year 2011, net revenues grew 7% to $4.29 billion from $4 billion in 2010. Foreign exchange had a $64.3 million favorable impact on net revenues for the year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net revenues grew 5.5%. While not as high a percentage growth as we had planned for, revenues were a record for our company.","Looking at our full year 2011 results by segment, the U.S. and Canada segment net revenues were $2.25 billion, down 2% versus $2.3 billion last year. Growth in the Boys and Preschool categories was offset by declines in the Girls and Games & Puzzles category. The U.S. and Canada segment reported an operating profit of $278.4 million or 12.4% of revenues for the full year 2011. This compares to $349.6 million or 15.2% of revenues in 2010. The decline in operating profit margin is primarily the result of lower revenues in the year, product mix and the impact from the sale of closed out inventory.","In the International segment, net revenues for the full year 2011 increased 19% to $1.86 billion versus $1.56 billion in 2010. Absent a positive foreign exchange impact of $59.3 million, net revenues in the International segment grew 16%. The results in this segment reflect growth in all major geographic regions, including mature and emerging markets in Europe, Latin America and Mexico as well as Asia-Pacific.","Growth in the Boys category more than offset declines in the Games & Puzzles, Girls and Preschool categories. The Boys category benefited from strong growth in Transformers, Beyblade, Nerf, Super Soaker and the introduction of KRE-O. Games & Puzzles declined but much less than in the U.S. Magic: The Gathering and the GAME OF LIFE were among the games brands which grew in 2011 internationally. ","In Girls, FurReal Friends and Baby Alive grew in the year, but Littlest Pet Shop declined. And finally, the Preschool category was down slightly. Play-Doh continued to grow, and Sesame Street contributed to year-over-year yield gains but not at the level it did in the U.S.","Operating profit in the International segment grew 29% to $270.6 million or 14.5% of revenues compared to $209.7 million or 13.4% of revenues in 2010. While we made higher levels of investment in building our global teams and capabilities during the year, the strong performance of this segment in 2011 more than offset those investments, and we delivered operating profit growth in all major regions. Consistent with our comments during the year, the full year International segment operating profit improved on these higher revenues and increased leverage on our investments. ","The Entertainment and Licensing segment full year net revenues increased 19% to $162.2 million compared to $136.5 million in 2010. Revenue growth in the Entertainment and Licensing segment reflects the sale of television programming globally as well as movie and licensing revenue from Transformers: Dark of the Moon. For the full year 2011, the Entertainment and Licensing segment reported an operating profit of $42.8 million compared to $43.2 million in 2010. The impact of the higher revenues in 2011 was offset by investments we made in growing our global licensing teams and strengthening the capabilities of the U.S.-based team.","Now let's look at earnings. For the full year 2011, we reported net earnings of $385.4 million or $2.82 per diluted share compared to $397.8 million or $2.74 per diluted share 1 year ago. 2011 earnings per diluted share of $2.82 includes the impact of a $20.5 million favorable tax adjustment or $0.15 per diluted share and pretax expense of $14.4 million or $0.07 per diluted share related to cost associated with establishing Hasbro's Gaming Center of Excellence in Rhode Island, both of which were announced in the second quarter 2011.","2010 earnings per diluted share also included a $0.15 favorable tax adjustment. Absent these factors, 2011 earnings per share increased 5.8% or $0.15 to $2.74 versus $2.59 in 2010. For the year, average diluted shares were 136.7 million compared to 145.7 million last year.","Cost of sales for the year was $1.84 billion or 42.8% of revenues versus $1.69 billion or 42.2% of revenues in 2010. This resulted in a gross margin of 57.2% of revenues, which is below our stated target of 58%. The difference versus our expectation is attributable to the weakness in the U.S. and Canada during the fourth quarter. However, the year-over-year decline in gross margin is tied to several factors. These include a negative impact from product mix including a decline in the Games & Puzzles category for 2011, sales of closed down inventory and higher manufacturing variances due to slower games production during the year. Partially offsetting these factors were higher revenues for Magic: The Gathering as well as the higher margin Entertainment and Licensing segment.","Operating profit for the year was $594 million or 13.9% of revenues versus $587.9 million or 14.7% in 2010. This includes $14.4 million related to costs associated with establishing our Gaming Center of Excellence. Excluding these costs, operating profit was 14.2% of revenue.","As we've communicated to you throughout the year, 2011 included important investments in people, offices, and infrastructure to advance Hasbro's global capabilities, much of which is in our SD&A expense. For the full year, SD&A increased $40.9 million to $822.1 million, representing 19.2% of revenues versus $781.2 million or 19.5% of revenues in 2010. This includes $7.6 million of costs related to establishing the Gaming Center of Excellence. Despite the significant investments we made in 2011, our full year SD&A expense did not increase as much as we had originally anticipated. The lower-than-expected SD&A increase is primarily the result of lower stock compensation in bonuses due to the underperformance of the company versus our financial performance targets combined with a proactive effort to reduce planned expenses.","As Brian mentioned, our global Hasbro teams are focused on innovation, and our investments in product development fueled these efforts. In 2011, product development expense totaled $197.6 million or 4.6% of revenues and included $6.7 million in costs related to establishing Hasbro's Gaming Center of Excellence. Product development in 2011 was lower than 2010 as we leveraged our spending on bigger, more global brands.","Advertising expense for the full year 2011 was 9.7% of revenue compared to 10.5% in 2010. The lower level of spending was primarily due to the higher mix of entertainment back products including Transformers and Beyblade. Additionally, with its revenue growth, we also saw improved leverage on our advertising to sales ratio in international markets. This richer mix of entertainment back revenues drove royalties higher both in dollars and as a percentage of revenue. For the full year 2011, royalties increased $90.6 million to $339.2 million, and represented 7.9% of revenues versus 6.2% in 2010. In 2011, we had a full year of television program production cost amortization versus 2010 when we only had expense in the third and fourth quarters. For the full year 2011, program production cost amortization of $35.8 million was in line with our stated expected range for the year. This compared to $22.1 million in 2010.","Moving below operating profit, other expense net for the year totaled $18.6 million compared to other income net of $2 million in 2010. The year-over-year change was primarily the result of foreign currency losses versus gains in 2010, as well as investment losses which were mark-to-market. Also, as we mentioned last quarter, in 2010, we had a gain of $4.9 million recognized from the sale of intellectual property. Our 50% share of The Hub is also included on this line in the P&L. For 2011, our share on the earnings in The Hub was a loss of $7.3 million compared to a loss of $9.3 million in 2010. The Hub was EBITDA positive in 2011. ","Our underlying tax rate in 2011 was 26.2% compared to an underlying tax rate of 25.4% in 2010. Over the past few years, our profits internationally have grown, lowering our underlying tax rate. In fact, in 2009, our underlying tax rate was 29%. ","Now, let's turn to the balance sheet. At year end, cash totaled $641.7 million compared to $727.8 million 1 year ago. Operating cash flow for the past 12 months was $396.1 million and includes $81 million in television programming costs over the period. Almost all of our yearend cash balance is held outside of the U.S.","During 2011, we repurchased a total of 10.5 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $423 million and at an average price of $40.42 per share. At year end, $227.3 million remained available under our current share repurchase authorization. ","Last week, our board voted to increase our quarterly dividend 20% to $0.36 per share from the previous quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. This was our third consecutive year of a 20% or greater dividend increase. And since 2005, our quarterly dividend has increased fourfold. During that timeframe, consistent with our stated objective to return cash to shareholders, we also repurchased 87.1 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $2.6 billion.","The quality of our receivables portfolio remains good, and receivables at quarter end were $1 billion compared to $961.3 million last year. This reflects both the growth and timing of revenues in the fourth quarter. DSOs were 70 days, up 2 days versus last year, and inventories at $334 million were down from $364.2 million 1 year ago, in line with our efforts to lower our inventory levels from 2010. Inventory in the U.S. and Canada segment was down year-over-year and despite strong growth internationally, on a year-over-year basis, our International segment inventories were essentially flat. Depreciation in capital expenditures for the year were $113.8 million and $99.4 million, respectively.","Our branded play strategy is working and we're still in the early stages of unlocking the full global potential of our brands. As Brian stated, absent the impact of foreign exchange, we believe we will again grow revenues and earnings per share in 2012. This continued execution of our strategy keeps us on track to deliver a compound annual revenue growth rate of 5% or better over time. Additionally, beyond 2012, we expect operating profit to grow faster than revenues. In 2012, we expect only modest operating profit growth as we rebuild our U.S. and gaming businesses.","Finally, we continue to target operating cash flow generation in the amount of $500 million on average. Our financial stability and continued strong cash generation has enabled us to execute our strategy including investing in our brands and our people while maintaining our commitment to return cash to you, our shareholders. Now Brian, David and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just starting with the games business. I think, Brian, your characterization of the business in 2012 would be to stabilize it. Can you just put a little more color around that? And then, as you look back at the fourth quarter, I think in 2010, you suggested that there's too much focus on several SKUs, you relate to market with the Family Game Night promo and you didn't get the retailer support you were expecting. As you look at the fourth quarter of '11, what do you attribute the 11% decline to?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. So first, Drew, if you look across the business, there were a number of games brands that grew based on having kicked off the Center of Excellence and began to build some of the momentum. So whether it's the GAME OF LIFE or Simon, Magic: The Gathering, Duel Masters, Risk, Yahtzee, a number of brands including Monopoly electronic edition, the Electronic Banking. We need to continue to build the momentum in the innovation and reinvention of our games brands. Inventory in the games business was down at the end of the fourth quarter. So retailers were sort of destocking in some of the other SKUs within our brands. We focused in on a number of campaigns around those brands, those bigger, more global brands, our core brands, if you will, within the games business. And that's our strategy go forward. We need to build greater momentum given the size of the games business to reach across more of our games business, and that's our intention over 2012. You'll see a number of new games initiatives that will be launched throughout the year 2012. Therefore, rather than providing some specific guidance, talking about stabilizing the games business in 2012 and growing it in 2013 and beyond. We know we can grow this games business because every time we innovate, and the team's focused around great innovation and off-the-board gaming and face-to-face gaming, we know we can drive that brand and grow that brand. We need to build more mass and we will do that.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Brian, looking at 2012's entertainment slate, pretty strong for a number of properties there. How are retailers approaching entertainment properties? What is their appetite stock product around those initiatives? And specifically on Transformers, what are your expectations in terms of year-on-year declines as you're past the theatrical release?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, it was great that last night in the Super Bowl, our partners and our own brands were so heavily featured, and it was really emblematic of the kind of year we have in entertainment. Within that, we had The Avengers, and Star Wars, Battleship and G.I. Joe. And in the pregame, we had the Transformers theme park ride that opens at Universal in May. Retailers are excited about our initiatives. We're very excited about what Sony and Marvel have done to reinvent Spider-Man and you'll see that product shipping in the second quarter as we go on shelves for May.","You'll see in Avengers, product shipping late in the first quarter and a lot of excitement around a combination of superheroes there. Battleship, we focus on other categories like KRE-O, and continue to roll out a very successful new product launch in the KRE-O brand. In G.I. Joe, really good support. So again, across the board, if you look at the entertainment initiatives, people are excited about those. Lots of new innovation within those lines. So again, a good start to 2012.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just one last housekeeping question for me. Deb, can you give us the free cash flow for 2011?","Deborah Thomas","Sure. The free cash flow for 2011 was $297 million.","Brian D. Goldner","And, Drew, the other piece I just remembered. On Transformers, obviously, Transformers Prime, it's a TV series that's now airing at over 140 countries around the world. So as we've seen in prior years, where we have television following a movie year, we would expect to mitigate the decline. So I would look to those years where we've had television following motion pictures as more of a guidepost. Although I can't provide you specific numbers, but I would say that we're very excited about the early rating successes as we're having on Transformers Prime around the world.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Sean McGowan of Needham & Company.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to clarify something. Deb, you said right at the very end of your comments regarding expectations for operating income growth in 2011, did you mean the growth will be modest in dollars or the growth would be modest as a percentage of sales?","Deborah Thomas","As a percentage of sales.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's a little different. Okay. One other thing. Brian, at the outset, you've, I think, alluded to 4 brands that do over $400 million but I think you only gave us 3. Well, can you tell us what the fourth was? You gave us Transformers, Beyblade and Nerf.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. I think that those were the 3 that I talked about. Those are the 3 that we have. I don't think I said 4.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Oh, I thought you said there were 4.","Brian D. Goldner","No. The 3 that we cited.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Question in Marvel, the partnership you have with Marvel for the Squad games. I mean, Squad plays on The Hub. I don't know about everybody else, I was a little surprised to see you kind of teaming up with Marvel for programming on The Hub. Do you think this is something we can look forward to seeing more of in the future?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, actually, this trend began earlier on if you look at the lineup on The Hub, you see Batman animation on the air. So certainly, that supporting product line from other companies, a number of toy companies are advertising on the air on The Hub. The Super Hero Squad is something we're very excited about. It really fits our programming lineup. It allows Marvel to go out and enhance its licensing efforts and our team is also working on enhanced line of products. So again, it's sort of emblematic of the trend that we're creating in The Hub as the ratings continue to increase year-on-year as we've seen through the fourth quarter and again in January. So again, we talked a long-term plan to make The Hub successful and then to distribute our programming around the world. So this is just another one of those building blocks in that progress.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then final question, whoever wants to take it, regarding retail inventories, you commented that in the U.S., they're flat versus one year ago but the quality's higher. Now one year ago, you weren't the only ones in that position, higher than desired, higher than expected going into beginning of 2011 caused a benefit of a clog in terms of shippability in the early part of 2011. What are your expectations for what impact that inventory position might have on shippability in the early part of '12?","David D. R. Hargreaves","Firstly, Sean, this is David, and as we said, in the U.S., we're essentially flat. When we said sort of a better quantity, last year, we had too many games but our games are down almost 20% at retail inventory as we come into the end of the year. Where we're up is things like Beyblade. We were in very short supply on Beyblade last year. So logically, that's not a bad thing. We're up on Star Wars, which is another good thing because their movie in 3-D is launching this Friday. And we're up on KRE-O because that's a new brand for us. We didn't have any KRE-O last year, and we're up a bit on Transformers but the DVD on Transformers already hit in the fourth quarter of last year. So you've got kids down to watch right now and still good demand for that as well as television. So where we're up, we're sort of good place to be up and where we are down, in places like games. And actually, we're down a little bit in Nerf. I think we said that Nerf was flat for the year. As a line, it grown internationally but was down a bit in the U.S. and our inventory is down reflecting that. In terms of the first quarter, yes, I think whenever -- obviously, the new brands people were taking that to the extent that you got pockets of brands that you're bit long on, that is going to sort of have some kind of impact during the first quarter. I want to say that remember, half of our business nowadays is in international markets and in international markets, which have clearly grown nearly 19% this year. Last year, we're very happy with the level of inventory we're having in the retail trade.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Kelter of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just from a big picture perspective, you guys said in the prepared remarks a couple of times that the branded play strategy is working, but this is now the second disappointing Christmas in a row. And so I guess I'm curious if there are at least any parts of the strategy that you need to tweak at this point or if perhaps one direction this may go is whether or not there's going to be a little too much organizational tension on entertainment and not enough on the core. And I wanted to hear what you guys think about that at this point.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. Michael, if you look at the strategy in 2012 as we executed, we are focused on that core tenets of our strategy and 2012 is about executing our strategy. Over the last couple years, we've been putting in place the building blocks, that blueprint that enables us to get there. So we have great brand innovation, and we're focusing on new brands as well as reinvented brands. Our international growth again speaks to the kinds of innovation we've had and the growth that we have in our lines. We're going to return the U.S. to historical levels of profitability and momentum, and we're creating immersive experiences, whether it's in motion picture television. So again, focused on the core reinvention of toys and games primarily and then building the capabilities around that blueprint in order to create that immersive experience for consumers. We did have a setback in the U.S. in 2011. We've already taken steps to change that momentum to return the business to operating profit in the immediate present, and then to continue to drive for growth. So in any transformation, there are steps forward, and then there are areas where we need to improve our execution. But overall, if you look at the growth in Europe at 19%; Latin America, 19%; Asia Pacific at 24%, our growth in Entertainment and Licensing in revenues and soon, in operating profit as we digest the investments we made in personnel there. Again, we're going to grow our operating profit in the long term, in the absolute, faster than revenues over time. And in 2012, as Deb mentioned, we'll have modest improvements in operating profit margin back to more historical levels, particularly focused on the U.S. business. So we're focused on execution, putting the right teams into place.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And in the U.S., where you made the change to management. I mean, obviously, results weren't what you were expecting from a numbers perspective but could you be maybe somewhat specific as to in retrospect, what the team should have done that they didn't do and what you're looking for from the new team in the U.S.?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, I think one of the things that we've done a lot of is investing in innovation, and I think around the world, we've gotten paid for that innovation and we've gone after marketing campaigns that have really worked for us around those brands, global marketing initiatives. The U.S. is a more sophisticated market, more technologically savvy, it's where we need to focus on that off-the-board gaming, face-to-face gaming and the marriage of digital gaming along with analog gaming as we've done with the Wizards of the Coast business, where we've seen that kind of growth in Magic: The Gathering. We've seen that kind of growth from Simon or Risk or Yahtzee and MONOPOLY Electronic Banking where we add those elements. Those are the kinds of things we need to go after so you'll see a combination of product development that's focused on a more technological savvy consumer, marketing campaigns that focus on a consumer that's consuming media in any number of platforms which is very true for the U.S., the ability to provide those -- the connection to consumers and that immersive experience across any number of platforms. So it's all about recognizing the difference in a mature market like in the U.S. and growth in growing market share there as we have done internationally.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And on these games, I mean, minus 11 on top of last year's minus 22. It's hard to imagine there's not some sort of secular element and, I guess, as you've continued to see the evolution there, iPhones, iPad, aren't the first technological threat over the years, but is it different this time and is the analog board game business going to, in your opinion, slowly go down and at best, you can try to keep up with technological advances of your own? Or is that overstating the issue?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, I look at the -- where were the teams have been able to get to new innovations and recognize they've started to take on this just over the summer, spring and summer of 2011. Everywhere we've put new innovations and new marketing campaigns in place, those brands are growing. Although recognize the size of the games business and the number of brands that we currently market. We need to create some focus and create some impact around that. So as I said, whether it's Magic: The Gathering that's grown, Duel Masters, the GAME OF LIFE, Simon, Risk, Yahtzee, MONOPOLY Electronic Banking. In fact, one of the areas that has been the fastest percentage decline is our puzzle business and we're addressing that business. So that's not where we can apply our best innovation. So again, I don't believe that overall, we're just talking about some secular change. I think what we're talking about is a recognition that we can create all kinds of gaming experiences off the board, the marriage of digital and analog, and on the board with digital and analog connections and you will see a lot of that as you come to Toy Fair on our analyst presentation on Friday and we're quickening the pace and impact of our innovation through the creation of the Gaming Center of Excellence, and we're very committed to and believe in the ability to grow our games business overtime.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, I wanted to hear what your expectations were in '12. First of all, for Beyblade, just kind of what your feel for the direction of things will be in '12. And then also, should we assume since you didn't update your prior guidance of Boys being flattish and in games, Girls and Preschool all being up, I think, you guys have said in your analyst day. Is that still good as ongoing guidance or any tweaks to that?","Brian D. Goldner","Great. Well, if you look at the Boys business, clearly had a very successful year last year having grown 35%. And so one might be hard pressed to say you expect additional growth. Having said that, we have so many great new initiatives and so many partnered brands that are really being reinvented in such a spectacular way. We could see growth in the Boys business. I think we certainly have put plans in place to continue to reinvent the Beyblade brand and work with Nelvana to put that new innovation into the animation. And you'll see a whole new segment called Beywheels [ph] as well as other new innovations in Beyblade. In Transformers, with the television, we would expect that to mitigate a decline we'd normal see in a movie year. Spider-Man looks fantastic. Avengers looks great. Star Wars launches this Friday in 3D. So whether it's in motion-picture supported brands or television-supported brands, we feel very good about our Boys business. I won't provide specific guidance but suffice it to say, we could see the continued success in our Boys business over and above last year. In games, we've talked about the idea of stabilizing the games business, which we believe we can do and we are seeing momentum in certain brands that we need to expand across a broader array of volume, of revenues and volume to create that critical mass in our games business. We do expect that our Girls business can grow this year and we would expect continued momentum in our Preschool business as we've already created, and you can see the results in our fourth quarter. Sesame Street is just really begun to roll out. It hadn't had as much impact in the international markets as it did domestically and that's just about getting out to more markets beyond English-speaking, as well as new innovations in the Preschool business.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays Capital.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","While we're on the topic of your 2012 outlook, I just had some follow-up questions there. You had mentioned in the release that earnings would grow in '12 depending on FX. I was just wondering what you were thinking the impact to earnings would be based on current exchange rate?","Deborah Thomas","I think it's difficult in today's market, Felicia, looking at foreign exchange in what we really wanted to indicate that absent the impact of FX, which if you just look at the euro alone, it's been having a $0.10 range in the past month of trading against the dollar. Absent that, we expect to grow underlying revenues and earnings per share.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So your message is just that let's think about this excluding all the kind of exogenous factors, you're still going to grow?","Brian D. Goldner","That's right.","Deborah Thomas","Yes.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then gross margins, are you still, based on kind of where you ended up this year, you're still looking for that to be in that 58% range?","Deborah Thomas","Yes, we are.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on Sesame Street, Mattel in their earnings call gave enough color to imply that for them, it was roughly $75 million in revenues. Still a new brand for you, you just mentioned that internationally. You're still trying to get traction there but I was wondering if you were able to kind of achieve something near that this year and do you see yourselves being able to generate growth higher than that?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, we're focused on the business in a number of ways. First, creating a 12-month business through constant invention of new segments beyond just the plush business has to been historically more back end loaded; focusing on a number of new characters, which you'll see; focusing on learning, which also will be ever present throughout the Sesame line as one might expect. So we have seen great success in Sesame Street, thus far, albeit early days. And we do need to get the brand out to more markets. Sesame Street is one of the most widely distributed TV programs around the world. We need to take advantage of the fact that so many consumers love and admire and watch Sesame Street programming. So we're in the early days but with really positive indications.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just moving to entertainment side. Given your experience with Universal and now you're kind of spread out through a number of different studios. I'm just wondering if you could give us any thoughts on perhaps self financing production of a movie or at least taking on some of the expenses at yourself?","Brian D. Goldner","The Universal relationship kicked off in 2008. As we all know, the motion picture business has really evolved dramatically since then. Our goal in moving some of those movies to some great new partnerships has everything to do with our ability to create visibility to new initiatives, to work with our global retailers and potential license partners as well as in digital gaming and to be able to plant the flag around timing in the near future, whether it's 2014 or beyond. So it's really mostly about that and signing with Relativity who's a great studio, very innovative studio on Stretch Armstrong and it's currently slated for April. In Candy Land, it was a lot of excitement around working with Adam Sandler and expanding our relationship with Sony, where we already have Risk in development. And so that's really been the plan. If you think about it and the motion picture business for us, while our 3 movies have certainly generated $3 billion at the box office, more importantly for us, those 4 movies have generated over $1.6 billion in merchandise sales for Hasbro across a number of different categories and in license products. So we continue to focus on that. We don't have any plans currently to finance our own motion pictures. We're always out looking at weighing our strategic options and running the math of every number of scenarios in every one of our business initiatives. 2012 is really about executing the core tenants of our strategy. It's about making that pivot and albeit there'll be some investments and continuing to build our emerging market business, it's really about executing our strategy, and you know our brand blueprint as by now. And that's what we're focused on, is executing that strategy.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then just finally, on The Hub. I'm just wondering if there were any changes to your anticipated marketing spend and any further initiatives that could continue to drive ratings in '12?","Brian D. Goldner","As we mentioned, we're EBITDA positive in 2011. We do have marketing budgets considered within our operating plans each year. The Hub has made great progress. We've seen a number of different platforms really work for us, 5 of the top 10 rated shows are Hasbro shows. But we also have some great spooky stuff that's really performing from R.L. Stine, the Haunting Hour and Goosebumps that the team put together a great on-air promotional approach that was kind of an immersive experience onto itself in January called Janu-Scary, which was very effective and drove ratings growth. A combination of our Hasbro Studios programs as well as some of these spooky shows. Though the approach continues to build progress over time and we have marketing support contemplated, and the network is now in 62 million homes.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rob Carroll of UBS.","Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Housekeeping on guidance and then something on free cash flow for '12. Around guidance, so, I mean, on a constant-currency basis, has the rate of growth that you guys envision changed at all from what it was back in mid-November?","Brian D. Goldner","Rob, I think we're not going to try to forecast growth, as we mentioned, the 7% growth last year was above our 5% guidance on average revenue growth over time. We continue to maintain the 5% CAGR expectation on revenue growth over time. But I'm not going to guide specifically on '12 versus '11. Suffice it to say, we're trying to be clear on the fact that '12, we believe, will grow both revenues and EPS, returning the U.S. business to more normalized levels of profitability and getting operating profit percentage up modestly in 2012.","Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And then as we look towards '12, should the rate of share repurchase slow down somewhat? Just given the investment year and as kind of the capital commitments for '12 in terms of the increased dividend and spending on Hub production or Hasbro Studios production. I mean, should the availability of cash share repurchase flow down somewhat versus the, call it, $400 million run rate we've seen over the past few years?","Deborah Thomas","Well, I think as we look at share repurchase, we had done quite a bit in the third quarter and we had mentioned that. And in the past year, we had also called our convertible debt and repurchased an equivalent amount of shares that went into the market with that. So in 2010, you saw a pretty high amount. We've done quite a bit in 2011. And at the end of 2011, we had $227 million remaining under our current board authorization. And my expectation and our expectation would be that we would continue to use that authorization as appropriate in the open market.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First one is just with respect to markdown money in the first half of '12 year-over-year just given that you have flat inventories in the U.S. How would -- is that going to be a lot less or is that going to be about the same as last year?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, I think that if you look at the fourth quarter, clearly the U.S. operating profit was impacted by our taking more significant steps in markdowns and price variance. So as to ensure we could clean inventories and sell through our inventories at retail. So taking those steps earlier once we saw the decline in rates of sale post Thanksgiving. So I think we've taken into account what we know to be the need -- the necessary markdowns within the fourth quarter. I don't know, David, you want to comment on first?","David D. R. Hargreaves","Yes. I think when we think about the first quarter and you look at the calendarization of our sales, clearly, as our International business grows, our international sales tend to come later in the year and less in the first quarter. So I think you're going to see a reduction in the overall percentage of sales in the first quarter and maybe the first half. I think another factor is in the U.S., I think we're going to work with our retailers to try and sort of deliver product to them more in line with consumer demand much more like we do in international markets. So I think in the first quarter of this year and indeed, the first half, you're going to see a lower percentage of our full year sales than you would have done historically for those 2 reasons, not because of our sort of a retail carryover inventory so much.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. With movies in entertainment lineup, would that help though the first half a little bit more than last year?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, it would. I mean, it mitigates it a bit in that we have initiatives that are earlier in the year, but I think what David said is particularly important. If you look last year, international sales over the last 10 years in the fourth quarter and then over the last couple of years has actually been more than 50% of our revenues. And so it's a significant difference in first quarter revenues in international versus fourth quarter revenues. So that does tend to -- that will tend to skew as international is growing at the rate that it is and as we play catch up in several markets around the world as we put teams in place and move from distributor businesses into our owned and operated subsidiaries. So that's going to have probably the biggest impact on quarterly sales as growth of the International business relative to the U.S. Equally, if you look at Entertainment and Licensing, a lot of our license fees are paid to us in arrears. In other words, quarters after the activity. And so again, that tends to have an impact of more third and fourth quarter oriented. That, combined with focusing on consumer insights and partnering with our retailers in a very significant way, the team has already been out to see our retailers, and is working with our retailers on great partnerships in the U.S. and promotional partnerships to ensure that we really understand the consumer and shopper insights better than we ever have, and to return to an era of strategic thought leadership around retailing with them.","Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. Okay. And then just on POS internationally, in the U.S., is there anything that was particularly strong in a regional world or any region that was particularly weak?","Brian D. Goldner","If you look overall in the POS around the world was particularly strong. And where we get absolute POS data was particularly strong. If look at the international markets, in several markets around the world, there were double-digit gains, significant double-digit gains. So we get POS data in a number of markets. In the U.S., overall, POS was down a bit, it was really led -- that decline was led by games. If you look at toy, it was up a bit. But again, as we look at our markets, international markets are very healthy. We talked about retail inventory levels and the momentum in those markets as we put teams in place, we would expect some of that to continue.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Eric Handler of MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Last year, at Toy Fair, you sounded very excited about the opportunity with Nerf growing internationally and Vortex, and now we see a year where Nerf was flat year-over-year. I wondered if you could sort of talk around those points. And then secondly, with regard to the film business, will there be another $5 million cancellation payment for Universal in the first quarter for Stretch Armstrong?","Brian D. Goldner","So the second question first, no, there won't be. It was our prerogative to move and to take the opportunity with very excited studio partners in Relativity and Sony to move those films and to plant the flag around dates and years so that we can provide visibility to those initiatives out in the marketplace with retail partnerships and promotional partnerships and the like. So, no, there won't be a charge or a payment. ","And what was the other one? Oh, sorry, Nerf. So there are actually 3 major initiatives in Nerf coming this year, you'll hear more about those at the end of the week but suffice it to say, there's some underlying initiatives as well as some new brands and new initiatives within that. I think that in the international markets, Vortex work well, but recognize that our business is still primarily a dart business. International growth certainly offset the U.S. challenges. But for the fourth quarter, we recognize that the dart business is still the significant part of our business. You're going to see some major innovations within the lineup of darts and I'll talk more about that at the end of the week, as well as innovations within our sports business, as well as a Volt [ph] brand that we're taking out in the sports action category that we're very excited about and will be new business for us go forward.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Margaret Whitfield with Sterne Agee.","Margaret B. Whitfield - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I wondered if you could discuss input cost pressures and any plans to take prices up. And, Brian, after this year's strong entertainment lineup, I think, I'm aware of 2 Marvel movies for '13. Anything else you can share on the entertainment outlook for that year?","David D. R. Hargreaves","Margaret, this is David. In terms of commodity cuts, we do see them going up again in 2012. I think what happened in '11 is in the first part of the year, they went up faster than we expected and then they stabilized a bit more towards the back half of the year and in the fourth quarter. However, overall, they were significantly up. And I think we're going to see them going up again in 2012 over the course of the entire year. I think labor costs, we've already seen that in various provinces in China that had increases ranging from like 15% to 20% that was sort of predetermined, I guess, multi-year increase in place. So labor costs will continue go up. And the second part of the question is given that your costs are going up, are you going take to pricing to cover that? And the answer is, yes, we are. We took a 5.5% price increase on carry-over items in the U.S. on February 1. And in markets around the globe, exchange rates come into impact as well but generally, we're taking sort of similar increases around the globe to offset the cost escalation.","Brian D. Goldner","And on the entertainment front. While there have been a couple of announced movies that are certainly supporting some of our brand initiatives, we have a couple of others, one in particular that we'll talk about on Friday for our brand in KRE-O, but I'll let John walk you through that on Friday. And then some other potential news for 2013 from some of our partners. But again, I'll let them share that news with you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Investments.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of clarifications off the bat here. Regarding Transformers, Brian, the figure that you gave in your preamble, did that include or exclude KRE-O?","Brian D. Goldner","It included.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Okay, any color on the size of KRE-O?","Brian D. Goldner","KRE-O was, I think I mentioned tens of millions of dollars. So we only launched in 10 markets this past year, already off to a very good start. We look at the initial market share data in those markets where we have data and very promising early market shares albeit only in a few months. And again, we'll roll out KRE-O now to 15 additional countries in 2012. We also add 1 brand that I will tell you about, which is Battleship. I think we mentioned that before but significant product offering within Battleship. That will go into our first 10 countries that we started KRE-O in, and then, that will roll out over time. And so that's sort of the strategy that we've employed as we look to create the innovations but also to have the capacity to make really high-quality innovative product and to market it in territories.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then a few more clarifications. If I -- maybe I misunderstood but are you saying that you anticipate by the end of '12, U.S., Canada being back to those historical profit levels that you have seen in the past or will that be more into '13?","Brian D. Goldner","I think that you'll see the profitability return to the U.S. business, and we're focused on the return to profitability and then the drive for growth beyond that. But there are some specific things that had an impact on U.S. profitability in the fourth quarter, had to do with cleaning up the market. It had to do with material price variants in markdowns and partnering with our retailers given that we had higher expectations for sales in the U.S. that didn't materialize, and we had inventories. So I think you've seen we've worked our inventories down. We've gotten retail inventories in pretty good shape in the U.S. recognizing that it's mostly now focused on new initiatives and good performers in the marketplace versus year ago where we had certainly too much carryover inventory in games.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So you're saying returning to profitability or you're saying returning to the historical levels [indiscernible]?","Brian D. Goldner","Sorry, returning to historical -- sorry, I thought I've said that. Returning to historical levels of profitability.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","By the end of '12. Okay, okay, okay. And then one piece that I think was missed regarding your commentary from the November analyst meeting. The Entertainment and Licensing, I think you said at that point in time given the heavy Transformers year that you kind of expected that category to be flattish, just an update there. And back to the Beyblade question, also at the analyst meeting, you said given the strong performance of Beyblade that you alluded to and now you've given us the exact numbers. And Transformers that you expected the Boys business to be flattish, now you're saying maybe up a little bit. Beyblade still probably could have a pretty decent follow-off. Are you saying these initiatives should typically see Beyblade sort of hold its own year-over-year?","Brian D. Goldner","So go to Beyblade. I mean, clearly, what we've contemplated recognizing we've had experience with Beyblade before in working with partnership with some great partners in Takara Tomy and Nelvana and d-rights, we anticipated that Beyblade could perform very well in 2011. So we took some steps to create some new innovations that we hadn't done the last time around in Beyblade when the brand was out in 2003 and 2004. So you're going to see a major new innovative line within Beyblade called Beywheels [ph], you're going to see that incorporated in the animation. So to your point, we would expect some mitigation in the decline, but we also can expect that Beyblade may decline off a very strong year in 2011. Offsetting that is the fact that there's a number of new entertainment initiatives we're very excited about. So what I'm trying to give you is a sense that given all the new entertainment initiatives to Marvel and Sony, movies and Avengers now for Marvel Studios and the Walt Disney Company backing that globally. We have a lot of excitement around our Boys business, which could lead to increases in revenue year-on-year.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay, okay. And then the licensing, still flattish you're thinking about?","Brian D. Goldner","You see licensing revenues grew but we put some people into place around the world to take advantage of our brands as we continue to grow them and put immersive experiences around them. So we made investments in licensing which is why you see the operating profit did not grow, is that this has to do with the investments we made. We would expect in out years, in future years, that you'd start to get more profitability out of those investments as you grow revenues over time.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. And the only other thing, just more of a suggestion than anything else, I think, as alluded to a little bit earlier, is it would be helpful in your press releases if you could show the growth to net adjustment, especially, I guess, challenging years. And then, on a go forward basis, as those types of things improve but done by some competitors. So it would be helpful if you guys could also.","Deborah Thomas","I think that, Tim, as we've discussed before, we look at our net revenues as actual net revenues. So we don't split out the growth to net. It's all part of gaining those revenues for us.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But, I mean, just give some color, I think, when there are some significant adjustments and then down the road when, hopefully, there won't be some significant adjustments as you have opportunities to reinvigorate growth.","Deborah Thomas","Okay. Well, I don't see us doing that, Tim, to be honest with you. Net revenues in net revenues. However, we will talk about different things as necessary. So thanks for the feedback.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Gerrick Thompson with BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I was hoping you could talk about revenue from Hasbro Studios in the quarter and the year, and then also perhaps guidance for production amortization in 2012?","Deborah Thomas","Revenue from the studios has grown in the year, Gerrick, just because we're starting to sell the program internationally. But again, it's not significant at this point from selling the programming. Most of the programming revenue comes from The Hub, and that's just within our numbers and eliminated as necessary. And from an amortization standpoint for 2012, I know we've talked about that, but the number is -- Debbie, do you have that off the top of your head?","Debbie Hancock","I believe we said $60 million to $70 million.","Deborah Thomas","Yes. $60 million to $70 million. And I apologize, I just didn't have it on the top of my head.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And on The Hub network, you said it was EBITDA positive for the year but negative contributed to earnings by $7.3 million. So I guess that will be $14 million -- $14.6 million overall. So what's that difference, what's the depreciation and the amortization difference between EBITDA and the net contribution?","Deborah Thomas","Well, it's because The Hub has goodwill on its books and as it amortizes that goodwill, that's what's creating essentially the loss. So the Hub is EBITDA positive, from an operational standpoint, it's positive. It's really that amortization that's driving it into a category at this point.","Operator","Our final question this morning is from the line of James Hardiman of Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","I was just hoping we could drill down a little bit on the profit contribution from the games business. You pointed to the underperformance of the games business as one of the primarily reasons for the gross margin on your performance for the quarter and for the year. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how much of that is a function of games gross margins coming down and how much of it is merely a function of a mix shift away from games given the historical superiority of games margins? And I guess along those same lines, you've talked about in the past, how the margins from other segments have actually improved and margins from games may have come down a little bit. So as we close out 2011 and look towards 2012, is there still a material gap between games margins and the rest of your business margins such that if games continue to underperform, there's again going to be a gross margin drag.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. I think it's really a couple things. I think first, what you saw was a growth in revenues in the fourth quarter related to entertainment properties. Therefore, royalty-bearing properties. And so as those move ahead, obviously the operating profit changes in order to pay the royalties, and you try to mitigate that a bit by pairing back a bit on your own advertising in order to allow for the properties themselves, the television or motion pictures to market those brands to a bit of an extent. Actually, if you look at a lot of our core brands that we are focused on and the core innovations we're focused on within those brands, many of those brands rival the kinds of operating profit percentage we see in our games business and we're not seeing some kind of a wholesale falloff in our games operating profit and yet, some of our toy brands are equally profitable. What we're just talking about is the mix in the quarter, in the growth in entertainment-based or royalty-bearing brands, particularly in the fourth quarter as you saw a number of those brands move ahead between Sesame Street, Beyblade, Transformers and others offset by some of the games volume. So long-term, again, we see games as a profitable category. Many of our core brands are very profitable categories. But in a year where you have more entertainment, certainly, your royalties increase, and it does have an impact on the mix in operating profit.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","That's very helpful. I guess, just along those same lines, we've seen about a 10% decline in games for 2011. I think it was down 4% in 2010. If I were to think about that, how everyone will look at it, whether it would be gross profits or operating profit, is the decline dramatically worse than that, a little worse than that, essentially in line with the -- I'm sure you're not going to give me an actual number, but how should I think about that?","Brian D. Goldner","I think that -- you're right, I'm not going to give an actual number. What would say is that our games business and even when we are putting innovation in our games business, whether it's an off-the-board game like Bop It! or Simon Flash, we can still enjoy strong operating profit percentages. So it's not just about making board games and selling those at a good operating profit percentage. We've also been able to, over time, create similar operating profit percentages in our brands by amortizing the R&D and marketing across more of the world by just expanding geographies. So whether it's a brand like My Little Pony that has some royalties related to television or a brand like Nerf or a brand like Play-Doh or PLAYSKOOL, you can grow brands with stronger operating profit percentages over time.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

Brian?","Brian Goldner","Thank you Debbie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Hasbro\u2019s record performance in 2015 reflected the strength of our global teams and the power of our brand blueprint. Through a focus on franchise brands and partner brands consumer insight led innovation and compelling story telling we are connecting with consumers more deeply and across more demographics than ever before. ","It has taken us 10 years and significant investment to be in the position of successfully executing our strategy. Today, we are beginning to unlock the full economic value of our brands. The benefits of our strategy are not only delivering revenue gains, but are also driving higher levels of gross and operating margins which we believe are sustainable for the long term.","In recognition of the strength of the year and our positive outlook, our Board recently voted to raise the quarterly dividend by 11%. This higher dividend reinforces our commitment to enhancing shareholder value over the long term. ","Demand for Hasbro initiatives was strong globally last year. Revenues increased 13% absent FX and reflected the strong demand we saw at the local level around the world. On a reported basis, revenues grew 4%, despite a significant negative impact from foreign exchange translation. Point-of-sale was very strong growing double-digits in developed economies including the US, UK, Germany, France, Spain, Mexico and Australia, as well as in many emerging markets where we receive retail data directly from our customers. ","We ended 2015 with retail inventories in very good shape, reflecting strong sell-through and high quality merchandize on shelf. Our growth drove market share gains in the 11 major countries where we have data according to NPD. In Europe, we took over the number two market share position. ","For the full year, Hasbro franchise brands\u2019 revenue grew 7% including the impact of currency translation; franchise brand revenues declined 2%. The 7% growth was led by increases in PLAY-DOH, NERF, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, MONOPOLY and MY LITTLE PONY. Our investments in innovation, storytelling and execution around the brand blueprint drove profitable revenue gains, while positioning us for future growth. ","NERF had a record year, increasing 13%, with new insight driven innovations including NERF Modulus and Rival and growth in Zombie Strike and N-Strike Elite. NERF was the largest brand across Hasbro last year. ","For the third year in a row, PLAY-DOHs delivered record revenues increasing 32%. We saw strong growth across all regions including a 49% increase in Latin America. While DOHVINCI contributed to growth in its first full year, we also experienced double-digit gains in Core PLAY-DOH Compounds and Play sets.","Growth in MONOPOLY and MAGIC: THE GATHERING, contributed to the 8% increase in the games category absent FX. MAGIC had a very good fourth quarter with the release of Battle for Zendikar which had the strongest start to a set in the brand\u2019s history. ","In addition to higher revenues, in our franchise brands and several other Hasbro gaming brands, Pie Face was a clear winner this holiday season and continues to be in high demand at retail. It was recently named toy of the year in the UK. You\u2019ll learn more about the next innovation for Pie Face later this week at Toy Fair. ","As expected TRANSFORMERS revenue declined, given the difficult comparison with the 2014 theatrical release. The decrease was at the low end of the traditional range following a movie and benefited from the success of Transformers Robots in Disguise television programing airing in markets around the world. In 2016, the second season of programing will begin airing including on Cartoon Network in the US. ","Littlest Pet Shop posted a small revenue decrease, despite growth in the US and Canada segment, as well as in the entertainment and licensing segment. Outside the US, the markets are actively re-launching the brand, and we plan to extend the success we\u2019ve seen in the US globally. ","We believe that there is an opportunity to engage girls around a more immersive franchise story, including a new approach to multi-platform entertainment, which we will be unveiling in the future. ","MY LITTLE PONY remains a vibrant and growing property. The core MY LITTLE PONY brand did extremely well in 2015 with positive revenue growth in several countries backed by strong point-of-sale and the launch of the new Friendship is Magic collectable segment. MY LITTLE PONY has established itself as a major lifestyle brand, and for 2015 was our top licensed property. ","We experience a slowdown in EQUESTRIA GIRLS that offset much of the growth we saw in other areas of the brand. In January 2016, we launched a new Mini Dolls! EQUESTRIA GIRLS line which is off to a very good start. ","Overall MY LITTLE PONY brand engagement is very high across all lines of the business. To maintain this momentum we are continuing to invest in multichannel storytelling, while evolving our entertainment strategy to more effectively deliver content. The success of our franchise brands contributed to the 11% revenue growth in our entertainment and licensing segment. Despite a difficult comparison with 2014 Transformers movie, consumer product licensing revenues increased. ","Over the past several years, we\u2019ve built a world class consumer products organization. We are driving momentum across several brands including MY LITTLE PONY, TRANSFORMERS and MONOPOLY, delivering cross category statements at retail, while making inroads in emerging markets including China and Thailand. ","The entertainment and licensing segment is benefiting from our ongoing investment and storytelling through episodic television programing including a multi-year digital streaming deal. ","With the continued growth, the entertainment and licensing segment increased to 6% of total revenues and 11% of operating profit. At a 31% operating profit margin, our ongoing investments are positively contributing to the overall operating margin for Hasbro. ","Shifting to our partner brands, several brands delivered strong growth last year. Star Wars fans around the world have embraced The Force Awakens both in theater and in merchandise. Hasbro\u2019s 2015 Star Wars revenue was on par with past movie years. Nearly half of this revenue was recorded in the fourth quarter, given the December 18 movie release. ","The next wave of Hasbro Star Wars product is on-shelf today and new product will continue to be available in 2016, supporting both the Spring Home Entertainment window for The Force Awakens as well as the December \u201916 release of Rogue One.","Given the level of entertainment and the strong global demand we\u2019re seeing, 2016 STAR WARS revenue could be on par with 2015. Earlier in 2015, JURASSIC WORLD and MARVEL\u2019s The Avengers Age of Ultron both established themselves as top grossing films at the global box office. Each property made strong revenue contributions for Hasbro. ","In total, our partner brand revenues were slightly higher than our previous expectation and totaled 28% of revenues. Strong STAR WARS results in the fourth quarter were a major contributor to the over performance of these brands. We continue to expect partner brand revenues to be 20% to 25% of total Hasbro revenues. In the near term, this number is expected to be at the higher end of this range. ","In 2016, Hasbro\u2019s line of DISNEY PRINCES and DISNEY FROZEN fashion dolls and small dolls became available. These products are already on shelves in the US and rolling our internationally. We shipped a very small amount of product in the fourth quarter, given the timing of retailer plans. Shipments are now ramping up and early consumer indications are positive. ","Great partnership with Disney and our global retailers is resulting in a smooth transition with product on-shelf beginning in January. We are closely monitoring inventory at retail to ensure this continues in 2016 as revenues grow and we build greater efficiency and profitability in to this new business. ","This growth in our franchise and partner brands portfolio drove growth in every region on a constant dollar basis. The US and Canada segment delivered double digit revenue and operating profit growth. In 2012, we reorganized our US teams and put in place a plan to drive both top and bottom line growth. ","Over the past several years this has substantially improved profit leverage and segment operating profit margin. The team has done a tremendous job working with our retail partners to build a robust growing and profitable business. The international segment revenues grew 16% absent FX and emerging markets increased 15%. ","We continue to expect modest double-digit growth in the emerging markets going forward. Our regional teams are navigating challenging economic environments, but are successfully driving our brands and positioning Hasbro for profitable growth over the long term. ","In closing, 2015 was a very good year for Hasbro. Positive momentum in Hasbro franchise brands and our partner brands positions us to capitalize on the innovation and entertainment our teams are delivering in 2016 and beyond. As Deb will discuss, Hasbro is in a very strong financial position. ","We continue to strategically invest in brands and initiatives where we see additional revenue and earnings potential, while returning excess cash to shareholders. This Friday, February 12, is our Annual Toy Fair Investor event. We look forward to seeing you in New York and sharing with you our future brand and business initiatives. ","I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deb Thomas","Thank you Brian and good morning everyone. As Brian mentioned, Hasbro\u2019s financial position is as strong as ever. We have tremendous momentum in our brands and we\u2019re driving profitable growth throughout our business. Our global teams faced an extremely challenging currency environment and delivered successful programs to manage retail, consumer and business demands while improving the profitability of Hasbro. ","In 2015, absent FX we grew revenues across all operating segments and major geographic regions as well as in both franchise and partner brands. We delivered cost savings while investing in the future growth of our business. Finally, we generated $552 million in operating cash flow, ending the year with close to $1 billion in cash from the balance sheet. We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities and investing in our business, while returning excess capital to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. ","Today\u2019s announced 11% dividend increase coupled with $479 million in available share repurchase authorizations enables us to continue on this path. Looking at our segments for the full 2015, revenues in the US and Canada segment increased 10%. Excluding a $14 million negative impact from foreign exchange, segment revenues increased 11%. ","Growth in the boys\u2019 Game and Preschool categories more than offset a decline in the girls\u2019 categories more than offset a decline in the girl\u2019s category. Hasbro franchise brand revenue increased 1% behind growth in NERF, PLAY-DOH and MAGIC: THE GATHERING and LITTLEST PET SHOP, which offset the expected decline in TRANSFORMERS. ","Partner brands STAR WARS, JURASSIC WORLD, MARVEL and DISNEY\u2019s DESCANDENTS also contributed to the segment\u2019s growth. FURBY revenue was down as expected. US point-of-sale posted double-digit growth in all categories other than girls which declined 2%. Retail inventory was at a very good quality at year-end. ","Operating profit in the US and Canada segment increased 29% for the year, reflecting higher revenues, the impact of cost saving activities and a favorable product mix. In the international segment, foreign exchange had a negative $379.4 million impact on revenues. Absent this impact, international segment grew 16% and emerging markets increased approximately 15%. ","Including the impact of FX, revenues decreased 3% and emerging market revenues decreased 9%. Internationally, as reported revenues in the boys and preschool increased, but were more than offset by declines in the games and girls categories. Franchise brand revenues declined 6% despite growth in PLAY-DOH, NERF and MONOPOLY. ","Additionally, STAR WARS, JURASSIC WORLD, MARVEL and DISNEY\u2019s DESCANDENTS were positive contributors. As expected, FURBY and TRANFORMERS each had a significant revenue decline for the year. Absent FX, operating profit in this segment increased 12%. On a reported basis, operating profit declined 6%, reflecting the negative foreign exchange impact. ","Foreign exchange is anticipated to negatively impact 2016 as well. At our current expected 2016 rates, our 2015 revenues would have been approximately $100 million less than what we reported. We anticipate approximately 15% to 20% of this impact will fall to the 2016 operating profit line. ","The Entertainment and Licensing segment revenues grew 11%. The segment benefitted from a multi-year digital streaming deal for Hasbro studios\u2019 television programing signed during the first quarter of 2015. In addition, consumer product licensing revenues increased for the year, overcoming a difficult comparison with TRANSFORMERS movie related merchandise and revenues. ","Segment operating profit increase 27% and margin grew to 31.4%. We continue to make investments in our consumer products team, digital gaming and storytelling to drive future growth in these higher profit revenue sources. ","Turning to overall expenses for Hasbro, growth and royalty bearing entertainment partner revenues and to a lesser extent, the entertainment and licensing segment revenue combined to deliver a favorable product mix. This mix in turn drove lower cost of sales, which were 37.7% in 2015 versus 39.7% in 2014. ","In conjunction with the higher partner brand revenue mix, royalties increased to 8.5% of revenues. Combined, cost of sales and royalties decreased approximately 60 basis points year-over-year. ","As Brian mentioned, the execution of our strategy and our focus on improved efficiency is creating sustainably higher levels of gross margin for Hasbro. As we look to 2016, as a percent of revenues, we anticipate cost of sales of 38% and royalties lower at 8%. ","Operating profit dollars and margin grew year-over-year. Higher revenue and operating expense leverage more than offset investments we are making. As we continue to execute our brand blueprint, we are focusing on fewer brands, expanding our licensing revenues and improving the efficiency of our operations. These changes in our business model are creating more innovative product and higher growth and operating profit margins in our business. ","To fully execute our strategy, investments and innovations are paramount to our long-term success. Product development totaled 5.5% of revenues, this includes the investment in or DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN offerings for which revenues commenced in January in a more meaningful way. We\u2019ll also continue to invest in building awareness for our brands. ","In 2015, advertising declined to 9.2% of revenues. This decline is primarily due to the higher percent of entertainment backed revenues which traditionally carry less advertising spends. Intangible amortization declined for the year, as some of our assets have been fully amortized. ","Program production cost amortization declined slightly to 1% of revenues. Storytelling is an important element of our brand building and we will continue investing in content development for television film and other mediums. ","SG&A increased 8% for the year, a number of factors contributed to the growth in expenses. As we outlined in previous calls and in our November investor day, we continue to make strategic investments in our business. This includes investing in the digital platform for MAGIC: THE GATHERING. ","This is a multiyear investment program which we believe will expand the potential market for MAGIC over the long term. In addition, our IT expense and depreciation is higher, reflecting our increased investments and improving the efficiency of Hasbro growing forward. ","As we outlined in November, these expenses increased in 2015 and will again increase in 2016 and 2017. In 2018, we anticipate they will begin to decline. Compensation expense was also higher reflecting the strength of our results. We are able to expand operating profit while making incremental investments, given the ongoing focus of our teams on managing expenses and the inherent financial advantages of executing our brand blueprint strategy.","Turning to our results for [lower] operating profits for the quarter; on an as adjusted basis other income was $2.5 million compared to an expense of 8.5 million last year. The improvement resulted from increased profits associated with our 40% share of the operating income in the Discovery Family channel as well as a lower losses from foreign exchange transactions. ","The 2015 underlying tax rate was essentially flat with last year, at 26.4% versus 26.5%. Our 2016 tax rate is anticipated to remain in the range of 26.5% to 27%. This will fluctuate to reflect the geographic mix of profits. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share for the year were $3.51 versus $3.15 in 2014. ","Our balance sheet remained strong. Of our nearly $1 billion in cash at year end almost all of it is located outside the US. We returned $310.7 million to shareholders in 2015, $225.8 million in dividends and $84.9 million in share repurchase. ","We announced today that the Board has approved an 11% of $0.05 per share increase in the quarterly dividend. The new quarterly dividend rate of $0.51 per share will be payable May 16 to shareholders of record on May 2nd. We will continue returning excess cash to shareholders through our dividend share repurchase program.","Receivable at year-end were up 11% and DSOs declined one day to 75 days. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, receivables increased approximately 23% equal to the fourth quarter revenue growth absent FX. ","Inventories increased 13% versus last year. Adjusting for a negative foreign exchange impact, inventory increased 24% in line with our growing business and entertainment schedule. Our inventory both at retail and at Hasbro is of high quality, and we are well positioned to meet demand in 2016. ","In closing 2015 was an extremely strong year for Hasbro. We continue to make important advances in the execution of our strategy and we invested in strategic initiatives to drive long term shareholder value creation. We have positive momentum in our business and we are well positioned for 2016 and beyond. ","We look forward to sharing more with you on Friday at Toy Fair. Brian and I are now happy to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our first question is from the line of Stephanie Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your questions.","Stephanie Wissink","Congratulations on a nice finish to the year. Brian, I\u2019m wondering if you can just talk a little bit more about the sales-to-cost balance. You\u2019ve seen some nice favorable increases in your gross and operating margin, should we continue to expect that trend line throughout the course of the next couple of years. And then as you\u2019re looking at some of the investment spend I think Deb you mentioned a few things that you still have on the docket. How many of those will flow through the P&L versus what would be capitalized on the balance sheet?","Brian Goldner","If you look at our gross and operating margins, we believe that they are sustainable at approximately the 2015 levels, and over time we would hope to continue to expand those. We\u2019ve talked about the points of leverage that we have in our business in order to expand them over time. ","Obviously the growth of our franchise brands that enjoy a higher than average operating profit margin, the growth of our entertainment and licensing business which as you saw has a very strong operating margin as well, and then of course as we continue to grow international markets, particularly emerging markets and we get greater economy of scale, those begin to approach the company\u2019s average operating profit margin. ","So those three levers broadly will enable us over time to continue to expand operating margins, but we do believe that our operating profit margins and gross margins are at a new place and can remain at this higher level beyond 2015. ","Deb Thomas","And some of the investments that we are making as Brian just mentioned in things like MAGIC: THE GATHERING online, investment in our development process which we expect will lead to future savings in the cost of sales line a couple of years out, and we\u2019ve got the higher level of depreciation coming through. ","We expect to see those coming through the P&L for the next \u201916 and \u201917 and starting to decline in \u201918. And we\u2019ll begin to see revenue from some of these activities like MAGIC Online beginning in 2017. So it\u2019s a little bit of a balance, but we expect to see some of those expenses begin to decline by 2018 and we\u2019ll have some charts on depreciation and amortization and some of the details behind that at Toy Fair on Friday. ","Stephanie Wissink","Great. Just one follow-up on the DISNEY PRINCESS business, I think that you had historically quantified that as about 30 to 50 basis points drag. As what you\u2019re seeing in the channel now, are you expecting to arrive at leverage a little bit sooner than you would have initially forecasted or how should we think about that drag rolling offshore over the next 12 months or so. ","Brian Goldner","Yeah Steph, if you think about revenues this year through the first quarter, we\u2019re working through the transition, and for the full year we have some strong expectations, but obviously it\u2019s a transition year. We believe we get more leverage in our business over time in 2017 and \u201918. So over time we\u2019ll build more leverage in to that business as we again grow economy of scale and create new innovations in years out. But we\u2019ve not said that we would get all that leverage this year. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Crum","Can you guys talk a little more about your expectations for royalties, 8.5% in 2015? I think you suggested that in terms of mix partner brands would be at the high end of the historical range at least over the near term. Yet you expect royalties as a percentage of sales to be at about 8% in 2016. So just want to get some additional clarity on that. ","Deb Thomas","Hi Drew it\u2019s Deb. I think it\u2019s really just a mix. I mean we have such a strong entertainment driven mix of revenue this year. As our franchise brands continue to grow, we do expect that royalty number to come in closer to our five year average which was around that 8%. ","So that\u2019s why as we look forward we believe we\u2019ve got sustainability and our gross margin as our consumers are paying for innovation in our product and we\u2019ve built some cost savings measures in there that we\u2019re realizing now and our royalties will be closer to 8% than 8.5%. ","We think this year was just -- given the strength of STAR WARS as well as JURASSIC WORLD and MARVEL they were just higher than we expected they would be. ","Drew Crum","And then Brian can you comment on the performance of MAGIC during the quarter, any quantification in terms of sales growth and any noteworthy changes or variances in terms of the content strategy in \u201916 relative to this past year. ","Brian Goldner","Yeah, MAGIC category grew for the full year. It grew very strongly in the fourth quarter; we talked about Battle for Zendikar being the most successful set launch. Just to remind everyone that MAGIC is really story-led, it\u2019s much less responsive to the quarters or holiday seasonality, it\u2019s really about the stories that we\u2019re telling and we think the transition the teams\u2019 taken the brand through this year and how we tell stories is very helpful to the brand as we go forward. So we continue to invest, improve and drive our online business. ","As Deb said, we would expect to see some revenues from the new MAGIC Next platform in 2017. But MAGIC is a long term growth driver for us and we\u2019re very happy to have a brand like that also, and we\u2019ll talk more about this on Friday that talks to and appeals to different demographic and psychographic that helps the company to expand our portfolio and deliver value and brands across a number of different demographic. ","Drew Crum","Just one last question from me, are you willing to share with the profitability or margin was for your emerging markets business in 2015. ","Brian Goldner","Emerging markets absent FX grew 15% and operating margin was a little bit lower mostly because of China as we\u2019re investing in that business and then of course impacted by FX.","Deb Thomas","The two of our biggest growth market this year absent FX continue to be Brazil and Russia, both growing over 20% absent FX. But the pressure of FX on those markets when you think the precipitous drop in their currencies that kept going on year along really put a lot of pressure on our emerging market operating profit. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please proceed with your questions.","Jaime Katz","I have a quick clarification actually, I think you guys had said that FX would be 15% to 20% of 2015 levels if those levels were at current rate. So is that right to think about as 15% to 20% of the 100 million incremental change?","Deb Thomas","Yeah, I think what we are trying to highlight Jaime is that we don\u2019t see the precipitous currency drops that we saw at the end of 2014 and into \u201915. So our expectation of what our current rates are, we think they\u2019ll continue to have an impact. Again particularly in countries like Brazil, which continue to have pressure on their currency of about a 100 million to revenue and about 15% to 20% of that would drop through the operating profit. ","Jaime Katz","And then are you willing to comment on advertising, the advertising spend outlook in the year ahead with royalties ticking up a little bit higher, what the offset might be?","Brian Goldner","2016 and \u201917 are both great entertainment years. In fact we\u2019re sitting here today with more visibility, it\u2019s a great entertainment and storytelling both from our own brands and our partners\u2019 brands than ever before. And so we think advertising will remain below the 10% range that we\u2019ve talked about historically. But it would be probably be in a range between where we ended last year and 10%. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Taposh Bari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your questions.","Taposh Bari","Brian I guess just a color on STAR WARS appreciate the color in terms of contextualizing this year versus past movie years. Last we heard you were expecting a 50-50 mix from episodes between 2015 and 2016, is that still the case? And can you remind us or can you give us an update on how the US mix versus international mix of that property is trending versus the prior movie?","Brian Goldner","Sure. So what we talked about was that in 2015 STAR WARS performed like a movie year, like other movie year, so it was very strong for us. And we also believed that STAR WARS can be equal in 2016 obviously rolling through the Force Awakens home entertainment window and then in to Rogue One. So we believe similar revenues. ","And I was looking at some of the detail of STAR WARS, and I think it\u2019s rather interesting that prior to the movie release or if you take the full year numbers for STAR WARS, the US and Canada segment if you will, 56% revenues and international was 44%. However, if you look at the fourth quarter or more of the movie related revenues, the international segment revenues as a percent go to 54% and the US is 46%. ","So what we\u2019ve said all along is that, as the brand benefits from more entertainment and benefits from more global movie releases that we would see a growth in that footprint, the global footprint of the brand, and we are in fact seeing that. ","Taposh Bari","Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then just the other question I had was on capital allocations and M&A in particular. Can you just remind us what your criteria are for M&A as you think about acquisitions, and what your appetite in terms of making a transformational deal? ","Brian Goldner","We are focused on executing our brand blueprint strategy. We obviously have looked from time to time at opportunities to help us round that out to build our capabilities and we\u2019ve spent the last 10 years doing that. So acquisitions like 70% of Backflip, our joint venture with the television network that\u2019s continuing to improve its financial position, and we continue to remain open to ideas that enhance our strategic brand blueprint and the strategy that we\u2019re executing. ","But we are very focused on executing our own strategy and really focusing in on how we build our business overtime. We have great brands in our portfolio and believe there\u2019s lots of headroom for growth in our franchise brands and you\u2019ll also see us introducing some new brands out of the box and new original brands over the next couple of years. ","So we think we are well positioned from a brand standpoint, but we do remain open to add on acquisitions that would help to enhance the strategic platform that we are running our brand blueprint strategy. ","Deb Thomas","From a capital standpoint, we also remain committed to returning our excess cash to our shareholders, and indeed we\u2019re very pleased that our Board voted and we are able to report today an 11% increase in our dividends, because we do remain very committed to getting excess cash back to our shareholders. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Felicia Hendrix, Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. ","Felicia Hendrix","Brian if you could just go back to STAR WARS for a second because I just want to make sure I\u2019m understanding what you\u2019re saying correctly. You said STAR WARS was on par with prior years, so according to our notes that\u2019s depending on how far back you look, somewhere between 500 million and 600 million and then you said half of that was in 2015. So I\u2019m just wondering when you think about the kind of blend in 2015 and 2016 together is that what\u2019s equating to the 500 million to 600 million or should be looking at the total and spreading it up. Just a little confusing to me thanks. ","Deb Thomas","What I was saying is that, just to give you a sense on an annual basis that STAR WARS for us in 2015 for the full year was comparable to prior movie years, and I might point to years like 2005 for example. And I was talking about the fact that if you took the full year number, you would see that the US was more represented in terms of the sale. ","So said differently, sales before the launch of the film were more oriented towards the US segment and less in international and as the movie entered the market in the fourth quarter, we talked about how the fourth quarter was about half of the total years revenues and that was more internationally oriented at about 54% versus the 46% for the US. ","We\u2019re also seeing in 2015 Hasbro\u2019s market share of STAR WARS growth fairly dramatically, because people are really responding to the innovation that we\u2019ve brought to the product lines, to our role play which we\u2019re selling incredibly well all lightsabers of different kinds including Kylo Ren\u2019s lighsaber and then of course 3 and 3.25 inch scale action figure and of course our black series. ","Those are some of our top sellers and we\u2019re rolling out new product and already have for 2016. We\u2019ll continue to roll out new product throughout 2016 and we\u2019ll make a transition more towards Rogue One for the back half of 2016, given the December movie release for Rogue One. And we do believe that 2016 can be comparable size to 2015. ","Felicia Hendrix","Deb just quickly, can you help us; I know it\u2019s such a moving target, but you\u2019ve given us some FX guidance in the past. Can you help us to think this through for 2016? You might have said that I might have missed it. ","Deb Thomas","Sure. We\u2019re thinking that based on our current expected rates, we would have about $100 million negative impact to 2015 revenue, if you just apply those same rates with about 15% to 20% of that flowing through your operating profit. So that\u2019s significant impact than 2015 versus 2014. ","Felicia Hendrix","And then you guys beat EPS nicely, but if you look at the reconciliation in your release your EBITDA seems to have come in lighter than consensus EBITDA. So I was just wondering how to reconcile that?","Brian Goldner","EBITDA was in line with consensus, $856 million.","Felicia Hendrix","For the quarter? ","Deb Thomas","I know we were actually pleased with our results for the quarter and for the year. So given our expectations they were in line. ","Brian Goldner","I think as we think about building our business, we really do think more annual and over three year basis than in any given --","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, but there wouldn\u2019t be like a strain like a line item or something that would make that difference right because you beat on earnings, I mean in fact it\u2019s EBIT. ","Deb Thomas","Fair enough. Not that we aware. ","Felicia Hendrix","Final question just on SG&A, looks like it grew 18% year-over-year in the quarter. So just wondering how we should think about SG&A in 2016.","Deb Thomas","On a full year basis we said we\u2019ve got a couple of these investments which I indicated earlier we\u2019ll outline a bit more on Friday at our meeting at Toy Fair. But a quite a few more of these investments that are continuing for the next few years before we start to see the revenue from it and that includes depreciation which is going to ramp down coming in \u201918 from the new systems that we\u2019ve put in. So we\u2019ll highlight more of that and any other items that impact us of significance in SG&A line with compensation because of the performance of the year. But we\u2019ll outline more about that on Friday.","Felicia Hendrix","Would you say that compensation accounted for most of the year-over-year increase in this quarter?","Deb Thomas","I would have to go back and look at the quarter, however again on a full year basis; we are in line from a percent of revenue standpoint of where we thought we would be at the beginning of the year. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Handler","Deb, what if you could walk through, sort of the puts and takes we might see in the entertainment and licensing business in 2016 and how it differs in \u201915. In the first quarter I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not going to have the Netflix bump, but sort of like-for-like how we might at the two years. ","Deb Thomas","That\u2019s very good that you picked up on that Eric, because you know it\u2019s like my favorite term and I get teased about it a bit, but it is a bit lumpy in that business because of that. And I believe having the Netflix in the first quarter would have an impact. However, we continue to invest in that business and we saw good growth not just in the studio and Netflix business but in our consumer product licensing business. And the strength of our brands and the licensing is much more stable than that entertainment driven revenue, or those large deals that you can see from time to time. ","So overall, one of the reasons why we\u2019ve expanded our operating profit is because of the expansion in our entertainment and licensing business, and we continue to invest in that business for the long term because we see not just the revenue growth but the operating profit expansion opportunities for the company as a whole. ","Brian Goldner","And on Friday we\u2019ll outline for you as well our efforts particularly in digital gaming. We\u2019re going to talk about some of the new titles that are around Hasbro brands coming from Blackfoot Studios as well as some of the other gaming efforts and that\u2019s all resident in that segment as well. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your questions.","Tim Conder","A couple here, any quantification Brian that you can give us on NERF, again that was your largest revenue producer, just any type of quantification there? And then as it relates to DISNEY PRINCESS, was a little bit of this faster than anticipated. ","Again you just touched on it a little bit earlier here, the international shipment that you did in Q4 it seemed like at the analyst meeting in November that you said, hey we are going to let the channel clear and the material shipments would start in Q2; so any additional color there? ","And then finally the capital allocation question here. You guys have executed well on the strategy over the last several years, cash flow is good and you gave a very good outline here with the partner businesses staying sustainable and then what you\u2019re doing on the licensing and your own brands. ","Can that operating cash flow number of approximating 500 million, should that expand in the not too distant future, given the visibility and sustainability?","Deb Thomas","As we look at our cash flow number, we will talk about more about that on Friday. So we look forward to seeing you then and talking more about that then. With respect to the DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN business, we began very small shipments in the fourth quarter. I think we did talk about DISNEY\u2019s DESCENDANTS being a good contributor to 2015, however we have been working very closely with Disney and our retail partners to ensure the channel\u2019s in good shape for everyone and our expectation is, we\u2019ll begin to ship that in a more meaningful way in 2016. But we only had very small shipments in 2015. ","Brian Goldner","In the first quarter we\u2019ll work through the transition on PRINCESS. So we will be shipping PRINCESS product and you\u2019re starting to see displays up and rolling the product out around the world and we\u2019re very happy with the transition in working with Disney and our retailers, they\u2019ve been incredibly supportive and we\u2019re seeing some good early indications of how a product is selling, its selling quite well. ","And then if we talk about NERF, the brand was up both in the quarter as well as full year double digits, and the sell-through was very strong and it\u2019s really around Modulus around N-Strike and around Zombie Striker, as kind of the top performers for the years and then of course NERF Rival which is launched in a couple of countries in the world that are out in a few more as we move forward that more. This is a little bit more of the paintball like paint play pattern that we\u2019re rolling out in markets around the world. ","So again the brand is our top brand at the company, and we just wanted to give that perspective because as we had created the franchise brand strategy many years ago, we believe that those brands were capable of growing to first hundreds of millions of dollars and then overtime even larger and NERF and PLAY-DOH are great examples of brands that have grown significantly over the last few years and they are among the top brands of the company.","Tim Conder","Still clearly over double digit percent of revenues this -.","Brian Goldner","Yeah, double digit percent of revenues. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital. Please go ahead with your questions. ","Gerrick Johnson","In the past you weren\u2019t shy about giving us the actual Star Wars revenue numbers, so maybe you can give us that as oppose to close to what it used to be. NERF just clarification, is that your largest owned brand or is it the largest brand in the portfolio if you include partner brands. And then lastly on entertainment and licensing, I think you commented that MY LITTLE PONY is your biggest licensed brand. So is that the largest contributor to entertainment and licensing revenue and what\u2019s the percentage of the total there?","Brian Goldner","On Star Wars I think I gave some pretty good guidance that Star Wars was very similar to 2005 last movie year. We used to give out specific percentages of revenues for a whole host of reasons; we\u2019d no longer feel that that\u2019s specifically required. So I\u2019d rather just give you some guidance up against the prior movie or NERF. ","It is the largest brand that has brought if you include all brands including franchise and partner brands, every brand. It\u2019s the largest brand in our portfolio. ","Gerrick Johnson","And MY LITTLE PONY entertainment?","Brian Goldner","On MY LITTLE PONY we\u2019re talking about the licensing income. So this is within the entertainment and licensing segment our new rebranded team consumer product personnel generated the largest amount of revenues from MY LITTLE PONY business up significantly versus a year ago and that\u2019s what we were referring to and no I\u2019m not going to give you a percent as it relates to E&L.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Chartier with Monness Crespi Hardt. Please go ahead with your question.","Jim Chartier","I just want to talk about the segment operating margins, yes indeed a really good progress in North America over the last couple of years and recognized that international\u2019s been impacting by FX. A couple of years ago at International\u2019s pretty similar to North America. Can you bridge the gap between international and North America at current exchange rates? Is the North America margin sustainable and what would the drivers be with getting international closer to North America? ","Brian Goldner","We made changes in our North American operation back in 2012 and reorganized that business in working with our retail partners. We believe that North American profitability is now at a new level and it\u2019s relatively sustainable. Obviously there\u2019ll be ups and downs overtime by bits, but overtime it can also grow as we continue to leverage our brands. ","International is just impacted by FX and may be Deb you want to talk absent FX where arte those margins because they are very healthy margins absent FX.","Deb Thomas","Yeah, absolutely. Every one of our components of our International segment were up absent FX, and operating profit was also negatively impacted because of the FX impact. But again, so much of this year in the segments as well, product mix had a big impact on operating profit for the segment as well as the cost savings and we continue to get cost savings through ongoing initiatives. ","As you know, we had a $100 million cost saving initiative a few years back which we completed in 2015, but ongoing cost savings has always been a part of our business, and many of the things you\u2019ve seen us invest and then are running through some of the lines like product development and then SG&A are ongoing investments to further decrease cost throughout our business including in our international segment.","Jim Chartier","In the past, international\u2019s been about 300 basis points lower than North America, now it\u2019s over 600 basis points lower. Again if FX break-stay where they are do you believe you can get that margin close to 300 basis points differential in the future. ","Deb Thomas","Well we continue to make investments in the business to really reflect things in the currencies and to take cost out of the business of where we are actually incurring our revenues. So overtime, our expectation is that you\u2019ll see more of our margins in the different operating segments come closer to each other. ","Now if you think about international, you\u2019re in a lot of different markets though. So just by their own nature they\u2019re going to have slightly administrative expenses. So will they ever be 100% the same? I don\u2019t know. But they\u2019ll move closer overtime based on all the initiatives are undertaken in the company. ","Brian Goldner","We\u2019ve seen some great growth in several of the emerging markets we talked about, north of 20% growth in Russia and Brazil. In China this past year, our largest brand in China continues to be TRANSFORMERS, so you\u2019re up against the movie here. I think that has more of a temporal impact in the year and overtime ","I would expect the trends that we\u2019ve seen in our emerging market business and profitability to continue continued improvement for the company average operating profit margin. And as Deb said, there\u2019s some puts and takes overtime as we continue to expand our capabilities, but we\u2019re [trending][ph], right. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lee Giardano with CRT. Please go ahead with your question.","Lee Giardano","Can you talk a little more about your expectations for Transformers and how the content cycle for that brand looks in the coming years?","Brian Goldner","The brand performed very well for us in a non-movie year coming off of 2014\u2019s movie, it was down much less than one expects. We\u2019ve talked a lot about what brands do in the years following movies and TRANSFORMERS really bucked that trend for the full year being down about one-third versus typical more closer to 50%. So the television and other entertainment has really helped to support the brand and help drive our brand globally, and I\u2019ll give you some more color on our entertainment plans, what\u2019s coming out of the writers room and plans for Transformers, theatrically by Friday.

Story led brands and innovative brand experiences drove double-digit revenue operating profit and earnings growth, brands that connect with global audiences and consumers in a meaningful way through story and informed by consumer insights are the brands that retailer support and they are the brands that our consumers engage in across our Brand Blueprint.","Quarterly revenues grew across all major regions, including growth in many developed markets such as the U.S. Canada, France, Spain, Australia and Mexico. Emerging market revenues increased 7% led by growth in China and Russia. We also began operating from our new office in India. While most countries are performing well, the U.K. and Brazil are facing challenging macroeconomic issues impacting both consumers and retailers. This is having a near term impact on our revenue and operating profit in the international segment but our full year outlook for this segment is positive.","On average, 90% of our operating profit in the international segment comes in the second half of the year and while we expect both countries to face challenges going forward, the rest of the markets have been performing well.","Global point of sale increased in the low teens for the quarter and through the first six months of the year. North America and Europe POS also increased double-digits in the second quarter and first half.","According to industry data through the month of May Hasbro remained the number one company across the G11 countries. On a reported basis Hasbro franchise brands revenues increased 21% with growth in TRANSFORMERS, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, NERF and MONOPOLY. Retailers and consumers continue to support Hasbro brands backed by stories and innovative cross category merchandise programs.","The TRANSFORMERS franchise performance was strong fuelled by robust multi screen entertainment. We are successfully executing our strategy to develop and leverage entertainment from multiple audiences and screens.","This is emblematic of how we are executing across the Brand Blueprint. In total, global point of sale for the franchise is up significantly not only versus last year but also against 2014 the last movie year.","In February we projected that MAGIC: THE GATHERING would see greater growth from the [releases] [ph] in the second and fourth quarters. MAGIC had a strong second quarter and the franchise was up in the first half. Importantly, the digital future of MAGIC: THE GATHERING is progressing and we look forward to sharing more with you in August at our Investor Day.","NERF continued to grow behind strong increases from the launch of N-Strike-Elite-with AccuStrike and continued growth in Modulus and Rival. Global POS trends remains strong. The all new NERF NITRO had a limited launch in the quarter and the full roll out is planned for August.","The MY LITTLE PONY franchise is well positioned for the October 6 release of MY LITTLE PONY the movie. Consumer engagement with the franchise remains high and global retailers are providing cross category support for our innovative new line and expansive consumer products program.","The combination of film, television, digital engagement and consumer products creates a deeply compelling 360 degree experience for both existing fans as well as fans in the making. Our partner brand portfolio is also benefitting from strong storytelling and innovation. In addition to Q2 revenue growth, global point of sale for the category is up both in the quarter and through the first six months of the year.","STAR WARS is primed for a strong second half. Merchandise for STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI hit shelves on Force Friday II September 1. We are very excited about our range of innovation that will debut at that time in advance of the theatrical release of the movie on December 15.","The STAR WARS franchise remains a top property in the industry and we have an expansive line for the film, along with a well received 40th anniversary line and the all new STAR WARS: Forces of Destiny celebrating the inspiring stories of iconic heroes from across the STAR WARS Universe.","Hasbro\u2019s Marvel portfolio is also leveraging compelling entertainment which drove higher revenues in the quarter. Hasbro\u2019s line up for both Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 2 and Spider-Man: Homecoming are delivering strong performances. We will also introduce a line supporting the November 3, theatrical release of Thor: Ragnarok. MARVEL continues to raise the bar in storytelling, each year providing tremendous stories and character supporting a bigger, more global and more sustainable level of business. Consumer take away for Disney Princess was strong and revenues increased in the quarter engaging multi platform entertainment coupled with new lines are driving this business.","In 2017, Hasbro\u2019s line has capitalized on new entertainment with product from Moana, Beauty and the Beast and in the fall will unveil new tangled items. In addition, this holiday we\u2019ll be supporting the release of Olaf's Frozen Adventure, with a global line of fashion in small dolls that are true to the story.","We are also supporting Disney Channel\u2019s original movie, Descendants 2 which aired on July 21. DREAMWORKS' TROLLS continued to connect with consumers and added to our year-over-year growth. BEYBLADE is performing well and on track with our expectations for the first year of the property. With Europe and Latin America launching in the second half, we have strong retailer support and consumer take away. This includes an engaged digital audience with more than 100 million battles to date on the BEYBLADE app.","Digital Play is contributing to the growth in brands and Gaming had another strong performance this quarter. Hasbro\u2019s unique position in gaming is increasingly differentiating our brands and play experiences. We have a rich portfolio of game brands we are activating across platforms and we continue to develop gaming insights. We have and continue to build the capabilities in-house to create compelling gaming experiences for a multitude of consumer groups as well as an extensive network of partnerships across digital platforms.","Global point of sale in gaming increased double digits in the quarter and we are launching several all new games this fall at retail and digitally. Finally, in emerging brands, BABY ALIVE global POS increased double digits in the quarter and first half. Revenues were down slightly in the quarter primarily due to Brazil, but are up over 50% in the first half and we have a strong full year outlook.","In closing, our commitment to creating expansive brand experiences with strong stories and true innovation differentiates Hasbro\u2019s diverse global portfolio across geographies, demographies and categories.","We are well positioned to execute against tremendous stories and innovation for the full year 2017 and beyond. We look forward to seeing you on August the 3rd at our Investor Day in Burbank, California. We will share our strategic approach to creating the world\u2019s best player experiences and how we continue to leverage our Blue Print to create a modern, agile play and entertainment company.","I will now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deb Thomas","Thank you, Brian and good morning, everyone. The Hasbro team delivered a strong second quarter with double digit revenue, operating profit and net earnings growth. Operating profit margin increased 60 basis points on higher revenues, favourable mix and expense leverage. The 30% growth in net earnings delivered $0.53 of earnings per share.","As forecast, Hasbro\u2019s adoption of the new accounting standard governing stock-based compensation contributed approximately $0.01 per share. Our outlook for both the third and fourth quarter is positive and we have strong consumer momentum heading into the second half.","Given the timing of entertainment this year, the rapid growth of e-commerce and our global retailers focused on just in time inventory. Our expectation for quarterly revenue is a shift to later in the year. As a result, we believe the fourth quarter could represent a greater percentage of full year revenue than historical norm and may be greater than the third quarter.","For the second quarter, revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 16%. Growth in franchise brand, Hasbro gaming and partner brand revenues offset a decline in emerging brand. In total, U.S. and Canada point of sale increased double digit through the quarter in the first six months of the year. Retail inventory is of good quality.","Operating profit in the U.S. and Canada segment increased 41% to $81.6 million or 16.5% of net revenue. The 290 basis point year-over-year improvement was the result of higher revenues, a favourable mix led by growth in MAGIC: THE GATHERING and expense leverage.","International segment revenues increased 6% including a favourable $2.4 million impact from foreign exchange. Within the international segment franchise brand and Hasbro Gaming revenue grow offset a decline in partner brand and emerging brand revenues.","Revenues increased across all three regions, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. Over the first six month, point of sale also increased in each region and grew in Europe and Asia Pacific in the second quarter.","Latin America was down slightly as the macroeconomic environment in Brazil remains challenging. As Brian mentioned both the U.K. and Brazil are facing challenging economic conditions. We are seeing this impact both retailer and consumer behaviour in both countries. Overall retailer inventories have good quality. As we\u2019ve mentioned in past calls, there are some countries with excess inventory and we took steps to move through this inventory in the second quarter, most notably in Europe.","Operating profit in the International segment declined 43% to $16.9 million or 4% of net revenues. The decrease was primarily the result of the higher level of close-outs and much favourable hedges in Europe and lower revenues in the U.K. Germany and Brazil.","Historically, the first half of the year only represents a small percentage of the segments full year operating profit, due to seasonality of the business and the launch of geographic footprint and related fixed cost.","Entertainment and licensing segment revenues declined 1%. Growth in digital gaming led by Backflip Studios was offset by a decline in entertainment related revenues. Also, Media is contributing to the top line this year but was offset by the timing of film and television revenues versus last year.","Consumer product revenues were essentially flat in the quarter. We have robust consumer product programs for both TRANSFORMERS and MY LITTLE PONY in the second half of the year. We generally record licensed revenue in the quarter after it is sold at retail by our licensing partner.","Segment operating profit declined 18% on the small decline in revenues and investments in our global consumer product team partially offset by an improvement at Backflip Studios.","Overall, Hasbro operating profit increased 18% and operating profit margin improved 60 basis points to 10.3% versus last year. Cost of sales increased 15% to 37.9% of revenues. The positive impact of the favourable product mix and growth in MAGIC: THE GATHERING was more than offset by the higher year-over-year level of close outs I mentioned earlier. These closeout sales have a lower gross margin and are part of our normal annual activity, but were more highly concentrated in the first half of this year compared to a year ago.","This higher level of activity was aligned along marketing for entertainment windows including movie released late in the second quarter and several occurring in the second half. In addition, as we said at Toy Fair, less favourable hedges also negatively impacted cost of sales.","Royalty expense increased 14% to 8.1% of revenue. Higher royalty expense was the result of higher partner brand revenues but also a strong contribution from TRANSOMERS THE LAST NIGHT movie product which carries saw a mixture of royalties.","Our investment in product development remains flat year-over-year but declined as a percentage of revenues. We continue to invest in innovation at an industry leading level. SG&A declined as a percent of sales to 26.4%. We generated leverage by higher levels of certain expenses including depreciation. We continue to expect full year SG&A to be in line with 2016 excluding the fourth quarter 2016 impairment charge as a percent of revenue.","Turning to our results below operating profit, other income was $11.1 million versus income of $6.1 million last year. Other income compared to last year was driven by higher interest income and our share of earnings from the discovery family network. Both items were in line with the first quarter of 2017.","The underlying tax rate was 24.7%, down from 26.1% last year and versus the 24.5% for the full year 2016.","The quarter included an approximately $0.01 benefit from our adoption of the new accounting standard governing stock compensation. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.53. Hasbro was in a strong financial position including a healthy balance sheet and good cash generation. We generated $877.4 million in operating cash flow over the trailing 12-month period ending the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash.","We remain committed to investing in our business to further our strategic account and drive long term profitable growth of the company. During the quarter, we paid out $71.9 million for dividends and share repurchase with dividends representing the majority. We continue to target approximately $150 million in share repurchase this year and had approximately $309 million available in our authorisation at quarter end.","Receivables increased 20%, and day sales outstanding increased six days to 78 days. The increase was a result of the timing of revenues in the quarter as well as growth in revenues with longer terms and the impact of the close outs mentioned earlier.","Our accounts receivable are in good condition and collections continue to be strong. Inventories declined 3% to $558 million and are well positioned to support our business over the remainder of the year.","We have a great deal of the year ahead of us and the Hasbro global teams are focussed on executing against strong brand innovation, robust entertainment and the dynamic market and retail environment in which we are operating.","Brian and I are now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Stephanie Wissink","Thanks, good morning everyone. Just a couple of follow up questions, and thanks Deb and Brian for the details. I\u2019m curious about Brazil or the U.K. if you can just help us diagnose a bit more about what\u2019s happening in those markets and if it seems a bit more transitory how are you expecting those markets to develop in the back half.","And then I think secondly, and this is admittedly I think an error on our part, but just understanding the entertainment and licensing related revenue timing, think Deb you mentioned there\u2019s a deferral by a quarter or so when the revenue is received at retail then you are collecting a royalty, but just remind us how we should think about the timing lag on when your major franchise brands of Ventar [ph] and then the consumer products inbound licensing and the timing on that? Thank you.","Brian Goldner","Yes, good morning Steph. The U.K. business definitely has had some macroeconomic issues, you see it in the NPD data and our business has been relatively flat in the quarter from a POS standpoint. But overall, if you look across Europe, we have double digit POS growth for both the quarter and year-to-date. So we really view the U.K. being a bit Brexit focused. We have a little bit of our retail concern out there, but again I think it\u2019s something the teams have worked through quite well and I don\u2019t see it as a long term issue.","In Brazil similarly you have a macroeconomic situation, a little bit political instability and consumer confidence that\u2019s changed a bit, but still if you look at the emerging market growth for the quarter was about 7% year-to-date emerging market growth is 12% and so we are seeing some good growth across emerging markets.","So I would say both of those are issues the teams are working through and I would expect that over time we\u2019ll work through that. Again, same thing there where Latin America, the rest of Latin America has performed quite well and we would expect that market, the region overall to perform quite strongly.","Deb Thomas","Good morning, Steph. For entertainment and licensing, typically when we have consumer products sales we work with external third-party licensees who take that product and make the T-shirts and backpacks and all the great things that are sold around our brands. Their revenue at retail for example could be in the second quarter, they wouldn\u2019t report that to us until early in the third quarter.","So generally what we see with that is it\u2019s about a quarter in arrears from when the sales actually occur at retail. With our entertainment this year with TRANSFORMERS coming out in June and we have MY LITTLE PONY movie coming in October, we would expect to see some of that revenue in the fourth quarter for example for Pony, but more of it in the first quarter. So with consumer products you tend to see a little bit of a shift that revenue can be larger in the first quarter than it typically is in other segments because of that.","Stephanie Wissink","Thank you. Just one quick follow-up on the inventory, Deb. Are you feeling that the inventory closeout situation is essentially in the rearview mirror now we can look forward? Or is there anything that we should expect in the third quarter with respect to the international margins?","Deb Thomas","We have closeouts typically throughout the year, and as we said with all the entertainment coming midyear and later in the year we really took advantage of kind of cleaning that inventory up now, and making sure that as we headed into the heavy entertainment season which typically you may see the higher closeout level in the third quarter. It doesn\u2019t have as big of an impact on margins just because of the size of the revenue and everything overall. So, we did take advantage of that. On a full-year basis we think that we will not be unusual compared to a normal year, it's just really a timing shift.","Stephanie Wissink","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Crum","Okay. Thanks. Good morning everyone.","Brian Goldner","Good morning.","Drew Crum","Guys, there seems to be this narrative that movie properties didn\u2019t performed to expectations during the quarter which seems to be at odds with your commentary on the TRANSFORMERS franchise. Could you address how you see the company position for the second half in terms of inventory levels and shelf space retailers intend to dedicate to your brands as it relates to entertainment?","Brian Goldner","Sure, entertainment continues to drive our business, Drew. And if you look at TRANSFORMERS, recognize that we now have entertainment across multiple screens and in fact our targeting and presenting stories to a infinite number of demographics around the brand, so certainly TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHT products sold very well, our POS was very strong, the brand is up considerably. Then of course we also have the Robots in Disguise product that\u2019s around the television. We have all of the universe product that\u2019s focused on our fans, that is also selling incredibly well.","And then of course preschool product, Rescue Bots product is also selling quite well. So we are seeing great sell-through around the brand, recognized that this is a brand that\u2019s become increasingly global, increasingly international. We\u2019re seeing great growth in places like China around the brand and around our international markets. So it continues to be one of the calling cards of the company. ","As you look at Spiderman, the performance was quite strong. MARVEL was up in the quarter. We continued to focus on the Spiderman brand, also Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 was quite strong and then of course you have Marvel Legends, so again we\u2019ve talked about the fan economy and Marvel Legends has performed quite strongly, that's the fan oriented product that we also see continuing very strongly throughout the year. And that will get into all of the electronic sell-through windows for those movies. And then in the fall of course we have a number of new initiatives and entertainment for the second half of the year including MY LITTLE PONY in October.","We got the new STAR WARS movie. You have the Olaf\u2019s Frozen Adventure for Disney Princess. And in fact if you look [audio break] on the Disney Channel, so what we're seeing is increases in space around our brands, our retailer commitment at the top levels from the entertainment councils at those retailers and we believe that the full-year portends very good things. And as Deb mentioned, we cleaned up the market a bit around some of the inventories that were out from some products, so that we\u2019d be in very good shape as we go toward the windows for Force Friday II September the 1st. You'll see MY LITTLE PONY product merchandising in August and September ahead of the movie, and then again, a new line of product going in time for Olaf\u2019s Frozen Adventure from Princess as we track through all of the different entertainment windows.","Drew Crum","Okay. Thanks for that color. And then separately, the EBIT margin looks like it\u2019s down just 20 bps year to-date, can you update us on your expectations for 2017 relative to last year. I think you had previously suggested operating profit margins would be lower versus the adjusted 16.4% you reported last year?","Brian Goldner","We continue to expect operating profit margins for the full-year to be up versus the adjusted number as reported number - what.","Deb Thomas","The reported number.","Brian Goldner","\u2026yeah, the as reported number, sorry. So we continue to expect operating profit margins to expand versus as reported. If you look at EBITDA for the first quarter, it was actually up 19% year-to-date, it\u2019s been up 16%, so we\u2019re getting really good strong earnings growth in the business. And again we expect operating profit margin expansion for the full-year.","Drew Crum","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Can we just go back to TRANSFORMERS for a moment Brian, because you have mentioned in your comments the strength of Global POS and that is up significantly year-over-year, and against the 2014 movie? So, I\u2019m just wondering if we could take those comments and translate those into absolute dollars. Would it be fair to assume that THE LAST KNIGHT could generate revenues higher than the 2014 movie, which I think you said at the time was kind of in line with the 2011 movie?","Brian Goldner","Yes. I think the way to think about TRANSFORMERS and in fact it's emblematic of what we\u2019re doing across the company. Over the last three years we have developed the digital capabilities for stream content and putting content on a multitude of screens, that capabilities really being born out and being seen in the TRANSFORMERS business. So, the overall brand is performing at a much higher level than it was in 2014. In part, that's because the movie product is performing at a higher level than the prior year movie product in 2014, but also because we are seeing great growth in the TRANSFORMERS generations product for the fan economy, the Robots in Disguise product that's been around the television.","Television viewership is strong. Our streaming on Netflix is a very strong. And then of course the fan-oriented stream product that goes -- our content that streams with machinima.mcn [ph]. So, I\u2019d look at it as an expansion of storytelling. And again the brand did perform quite strongly in 2014 but also performed strongly in 2015 and 2016. This is clearly more in line with the movie or performance for the brand.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. So just to make sure, I understand like movie to movie it seems like the movies better and then you layer on kind of everything you do with your brand blueprint and how you kind of expand brands and then putting it off together, the franchise in general has grown, but the movie also seems better?","Brian Goldner","Yes, it is. Its \u2013 the performance is good. Remember that movie has continued to form incredibly well globally outside the U.S. where I think we just surpassed $225 million in China. The movie has done more than $550 million so far. And also with all of our entertainment digital engagement, yes, we are up significantly in POS versus the prior movie year. And yes, it's being -- it's coming from a number of new areas for us, capabilities that we've developed over the last three years.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, great. And then, Deb this is probably a question for you. You guys touched a bit on what is going on in UK and Brazil, but just wondering specifically can you call out how much that impacted your performance in the quarter?","Deb Thomas","Well, we typically don\u2019t call out separate countries, but what I can say is if you look at in our table both Europe overall and Latin America overall did grow revenue in the quarter. So whilst individual countries are impacting us. Overall as we look at the region and how we\u2019re performing across the region, they did grow in the quarter.","Brian Goldner","Yes. I think the other thing to note in the operating profit it\u2019s a log [ph] small numbers. Typically our European profit 90% of it is around the second half of the year that has to do with the footprint that we run, size at geographies and the fixed expense that we have in the first half of the year. So I would view it as a small change that doesn't really portend anything on the full-year.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And then, just help me understand the partner brands declines internationally, if that again due to kind of timing or how much of that was related to U.K and Brazil?","Brian Goldner","That\u2019s more about timing.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay.","Brian Goldner","It just has to with coming off of a STAR WARS movie year entering into a new STAR WARS entertainment era and then MARVEL really hitting in the second quarter particularly Spiderman in the second quarter. So it\u2019s really, I view as timings because MARVEL overall was up for the quarter.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. So when we look at partner brands internationally for the second half that you shouldn\u2019t see declines?","Brian Goldner","Well, I think that you have a lot contributing in partner brands in the second half. You have Princess which grew in the quarter and it has a lot of activity in the second half. You have MARVEL which has a tremendous amount of activity. You have the new STAR WARS movie and Force Friday II that sets on September the 1st. So overall \u2013 well, of course we still have TROLLS which is contributing quite strongly year-to-date and we\u2019re very excited about the full-year on TROLLS.","BEYBLADE, some of you\u2019ve asked about BEYBLADE timing. And that of course is really just entering both Europe and Latin America in the second half of this year, really hadn\u2019t been in those markets. So I think all those elements will contribute to the second half of the year.","Felicia Hendrix","Great. Thanks for the help.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Handler","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions for you guys. First, as online becomes more and more important every year, just curious with the Amazon Prime day, did you do anything special unique with the marketing around that? And how significant -- is this day significant at all for you? Then secondly with regards to STAR WARS in terms of your orders or what you plan for ship in, how is that comparing to the movie two years ago the Force Awakens?","Brian Goldner","The Amazon Prime clearly is a very big day for them and it's a very fun day for us and opportunity to do lots of interesting and fun promotional elements run our business. It was again a strong day for the company. Our overall online POS was very strong in the quarter, stronger than our overall POS and up more than 20%. We continue to see great growth in online and omni-channel not just from Amazon but the Wal-Mart target and Toys \"R\" Us as well, very strong growth for several of those retailers. It's for us an opportunity to bring together content commerce and innovation online and it's working quite well the way we\u2019re executing around the story led brands is quite strong for us. So overall, POS was up double digits in the teens for the company and even more strongly online.","As you look at STAR WARS for the year, clearly if go back in history I'd say you have STAR WARS movie years and STAR WARS non-movie years, these categories both contribute significantly, certainly the movie years more so and this is clearly lining up to be a very good STAR WARS movie year. Obviously, as we get into Force Friday we\u2019ll know a lot more, but certainly there's nothing about our business so far this year that wouldn\u2019t indicate a very strong STAR WARS movie this holiday and the strong Toys sells for us.","Deb Thomas","As far as the timing questionnaire, one of things that we are seeing with the growth in online retailing and our retailers taking more just-in-time inventory, as Brian mentioned we\u2019ll see more when we get to Force Friday II which is on September 1st of this year. But again that\u2019s late in the third quarter and we think with everything that\u2019s kind of coming together we may actually see a bigger fourth quarter than third quarter this year just -- really just timing and some of the patterns were seeing right now.","Eric Handler","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","Hi, thanks. Could you perhaps walk us through the puts and takes for gross margins. It seems like with 94 million of incremental revenue, gross margins were big soft. And I do understand entertainment licensing being down, doesn\u2019t help margins, but then you had strong MPG [ph] and overall franchise and gaming growth which are margin accretive versus partner brand. Could you just walk through some of the puts and takes there? Thank you.","Deb Thomas","Sure. Good morning, Arpin\u00e9. Really we talked about -- the biggest impact on the gross margin line for the quarter was the level of closeouts sale. For closeouts sale typically carry a lower gross margin as they come through, and they also carry lower advertising and all other costs. So, there\u2019s not a lot of promotion around and a things like that. So why you see it in the gross margin line that\u2019s why you see our operating profit did increase from a percentage standpoint because it impacted that but not the way down. So that size-wise was the biggest impact.","The next biggest impact was less favorable hedges that we had on inventory we purchased in the second quarter this year various a year ago. And we set a Toy Fair that that was going to impact our full-year gross margin and that overall we expect our full-year gross margin to be down a bit from the full-year 2016. So those are really the two big items and they offset the positive product mix that you mentioned earlier.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","Okay. Thank you. And then a quick follow-up, Brian, you mentioned Disney Princess revenues were up in the quarter. Just wondering if it\u2019s still up if you do year to-date and move out for Easter shift, could you share how much, if that\u2019s the case if it\u2019s up year to-date? Thanks.","Brian Goldner","Yes. Disney Princess, yes, I\u2019ve looked at Disney Princess together would be up year to-date and I'm not going to size it, but its up in both the quarter and year to-date for us. And look there\u2019s a lot of great entertainment that\u2019s been supporting that brand, and Moana and the electronic sell-through and DVD windows, Beauty and the Beast. So yes, that's -- it's been up and we would expect with the kind of entertainment we have coming in the second half and Olaf's Frozen Adventure to contribute to our both Princess and Frozen business for the full-year.","Arpin\u00e9 Kocharyan","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Tim Conder","Thank you. Just a couple of here. Deb, on FX given the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar year-to-date overall and the hedges that you have in place, do you see any changes in the back half of the year here as it relates to the FX guidance that you outlined at Toy Fair?","Deb Thomas","Well, we really set our hedges, so we can put predictability in our pricing. So, based on the hedges we have we\u2019ve been able to set pricing for the year and give our retailers confident in maintaining that pricing, as well as understanding what our gross margin is. So I think about the rest of the year -- last year for a full-year we were about 74% of our total costs with hedge. This year I think we\u2019re about 73% like we\u2019re right around that range. So to the extent we haven\u2019t hedged, we should get some benefit from it, but on a full-year basis we -- again we really hedge to protect the pricing that we offer to our retailers.","Tim Conder","Okay. So maybe a little bit but not a lot here, okay. Okay. And then on the profitability of the online versus the brick-and-mortar, I think you\u2019ve said at Toy Fair that there was a little bit of difference but you anticipated that to narrow. Just maybe revisit that and a little color there? And then you\u2019re shifting from Q3 into Q4 on the revenue side that you're looking to, should we expect a proportionate shift in profitability also?","Brian Goldner","Well, I think we\u2019d expect a nominal shift in revenues between third and fourth quarter. We\u2019re not suggesting that it\u2019s seismic, but just a nominal shift as a result of all these entertainment initiatives that are happening toward the back half of the year and particularly in the fourth quarter as STAR WARS comes out in December. On online, what I\u2019d said was that our cost of business was very similar. The difference is as we develop our expertise in online we have some initial costs over the first couple years as we set ourselves up for future growth and that we would expect those costs over time to begin to diminish that has to do with the kind of packaging we use in the way we create master cartons in the way that we go-to-market, the kinds of content we\u2019re creating. But overtime we\u2019ll amortize those startup or learning curve costs and that we would expect that to continue to be over time accretive to our business, but today comparable cost of business to Omni-channel or brick-and-mortar.","Tim Conder","Okay. Okay. And then lastly I think if I\u2019ve heard you correctly you called out not only the UK and Brazil, but a little bit of weakness in Germany. Just maybe a little bit more color there?","Deb Thomas","Really Germany on which really around the quarter and we don't expect that to continue for the full-year. It\u2019s really the UK and Brazil that we\u2019re seeing most of the economic issues.","Tim Conder","Okay. Okay, great. Thank you all.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Ng","Thanks for the question. I have a question on gaming. Its look like gaming revenue, with franchise brands was up $45 million in the quarter with non-franchise brands up only eight. So it seem like a lot of the growth is driven by MAGIC and MONOPOLY. I was wondering if you just frame how much of that growth is simply from MAGIC cards at timing versus core MAGIC growth. And how much is coming from MONOPOLY? And then I have a few follow-up?","Brian Goldner","Yes. Overall the games category was up by 20% in the quarter and then if you look at \u2013 Hasbro Gaming was up 6%, but I think it\u2019s important to note that in the second quarter globally our games POS was up 27%. So we are seeing a tremendous sell-through of our games business. Similarly in U.S. our games POS was up quite considerably. So what we\u2019re seeing is really a matter of game selling very well, shipments are little bit behind the sell-through, lot of new games introductions coming later in this quarter for the second half.","Dungeons & Dragons is performing at a very high level. I think Dungeons & Dragons is back and the team has done some very expansive marketing around that. It's involved in e-sports and twitch [ph] new gaming launches coming throughout the year. And then, of course you also see our digital gaming business growing considerably. With TRANSFORMERS, EARTH WARS are performing quite well, DragonVale performing well, so Backflip Studios is really contributing as well on the quarter. So it\u2019s both digital gaming, as well as face-to-face gaming performing well in the quarter, so that's both the in the gaming segment and then overall performing quite well.","MAGIC on a full-year basis, really the business continues to resonate with making a lot of progress in the MAGIC online and our Digital Next, we\u2019re looking forward to showing you more in the Digital Next development at our Investor Day. But MAGIC online is performing very well, holding up quite well and you\u2019re seeing more concurrent launches like Amonkhet was a concurrent launch between our card set as well as our online and we continue to connect with players. We\u2019re seeing great new player engagement as well as conversion, continue to see the kinds of torment play and the e-sports play and viewership that really gives us good signals for that brand long-term.","Michael Ng","Okay. Thanks. And I just have one on Princess and one on capital allocation. I think in the past you mentioned that Princess margins are below company average? Can you talk about your outlook for those margins as you continue to scale that brand and how long you think it will take to become run rate margin? And then, on capital allocation\u2026","Brian Goldner","Yes. I\u2019m sorry, go ahead.","Michael Ng","And then just on capital allocation. You reaffirm $150 million buybacks for the year, but didn\u2019t buy back any shares in the quarter. Can you talk about how you are thinking about that and whether there were some upcoming use of the cash alleged you do not buy any shares this quarter?","Brian Goldner","Yes. So if you look at Princess, we\u2019d said from the beginning that investments would begin before the revenues spend and the investments continued in early days as we launch that brand we continue to invest in the brand and we do continue to see profit improvement over time. And we had said then and continue to reiterate that we\u2019d see profit improve over a two to three-year period and begin to approach company average operating profit margins for our partner brands over that period. And that's still the case.","Deb Thomas","And as far as capital allocation, as we said we want to return access cash to shareholders and indeed most of it was through dividends this quarter and we repurchase shares subject to market conditions and available U.S. cash. We also put [Indiscernible] five ones in place in our close windows and our stock price had quite a bit of movement in this past quarter. So, we still have about 300 million left in our share repurchase authorization and still plan right now to repurchase 150 million on a full-year basis, it will just be more back half weighted at this point.","Michael Ng","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.","Linda Bolton Weiser","Hi. I think you\u2019ve spend a lot of commentary or thought out there about the potential for the whole play industry in the U.S. to slow in growth because the growth has been pretty strong in the last few years. Do you have any thoughts on there in terms of what the drivers have been or whether those drivers can continue? And then, do you have any industry numbers to give for the quarter or year to-date in terms of growth?","Brian Goldner","Our overall industry would grew just under about 4%, obviously our growth is outstripping that growth. In the U.S. the team has done a fantastic job with double-digit growth. We continue to see the opportunity to grow that business, continue to engage in it with the number of retailers continue to expand and stretch our channel management and through that channel management strategy we\u2019re getting to new and differentiated retailers with different types of products and offerings.","The online business continues to be disintermediary for us, for example, if you look at our online sales in the quarter particularly focused on U.S. you see very strong double-digit gains for all of our franchise brands and that's quite heartening to see that the MY LITTLE PONY and little Scratch [ph] up performing well as we\u2019ve start to introduce new product where the audience can find those brands online at their liking. So, I\u2019d say overall we continue to expect that the U.S. business, the North American business can grow. We\u2019ve certainly seen that growth and expect that the retail calendar with entertainment continues to stretch to be more full-year calendar.","And we have a number of initiatives for the second half of the year that set us up quite well for a full year, and also into 2018 we\u2019re seeing a number of entertainment initiatives including our own that set us up for 2018 to be a very good year as well. So that's what I think about the U.S. business. I think you look at it our developed economies business in the first quarter grew 12% while emerging markets grew 7% and for the first half our developed the country's business grew over 5% while emerging markets grew double-digit and so I would say that we\u2019re continuing to see very good growth both in developed economies and emerging markets.","David Quezada","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Gerrick Johnson","Hey, Good morning. I have three here. First, consumer products you said it was flat. Can you tell us which of your franchise brands generated growth there and which saw declines?","Brian Goldner","In the quarter we\u2019ve seen very good performance from MONOPOLY. We\u2019ve seen good performance from TRANSFORMERS. We\u2019ve seen good performance in MAGIC. I think Pony was off just a bit the quarter. And as we set up and key [ph] up the second half around the movie again on the full-year basis we think MY LITTLE PONY will perform quite strongly. And remember what Deb said earlier was that the consumer products royalty income comes in the quarter after the sales occur. So I think that a lot of what's going on the consumer products is just related to the timing.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay, understood. You mentioned timing of shipment of the reason for accounts receivable being up. What caused that?","Brian Goldner","Well, first of all, we\u2019ve seen great growth in a set number markets where we have longer dating in Latin America for example Mexico has seen great growth and the dating there is a bit longer.","Deb Thomas","Yes. In India we just started opening our own business in India. So it's really just a function of timing for us. Then we also talked about closeouts. Some of the sales as I mentioned there are a lower rate but they don't carry any allowances or things like that that may reduce receivables further. So it really is about timing for us this quarter. Inherently our receivables are in great shape, Our collection are good and through last week we collected on the 20% of our receivables. I think I looked at it Wednesday and we were already at point. So we\u2019re in good shape on receivables. Its really just about timing.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. And you mentioned closeouts which is nice segway into my final question. Can you give us your global North American POS at retail since that way the industry measures it?","Brian Goldner","So, our POS, global POS in the second quarter was up by 13% and year to-date its up of about 14%. And then has had games POS globally was up by 27% and U.S. was even more stronger 33% and you\u2019re seeing double-digit growth across a number of categories. Where we have a breakdown franchise brands we have double-digit partner brands was up strong single-digit and gaming as I mentioned was up, online sales I talked about being up more than 20%.","And then, of course I also earlier in Europe that we saw the double-digit POS games and very strong gains in a number of markets. And as I mentioned that UK was the only place where the POS was flat and we\u2019re holding our own in industry category that\u2019s down a bit.","Gerrick Johnson","And to be clear Brian, it\u2019s all measured at retail or is that all at wholesale or were just [Indiscernible]","Brian Goldner","That\u2019s our measurement and wholesale, that\u2019s what we have as POS.","Gerrick Johnson","Right. But the question was at retail, because that\u2019s how the industry measures.","Brian Goldner","Yes we don\u2019t the retail data, we don\u2019t get that retail data by all those markets, we get wholesale data by all those markets.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay, thank you.","Brian Goldner","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the floor back to Debbie Hancock for closing remarks.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, Rob and thank you everyone for joining the call today. The replay will be available on our website in approximately two hours. Managements\u2019 prepared remarks will be posted on our website following this call.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Debbie Hancock, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter and full year earnings release was issued this afternoon and is available on our website. Additionally, also available on our website are presentation slides containing information covered in today's earnings release and call. The press release and presentation include information regarding non-GAAP financial measures included in today's call. Please note that whenever we discuss earnings per share or EPS, we are referring to earnings per diluted share.","This afternoon, Brian Goldner, Hasbro's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Deb Thomas, Hasbro's Chief Financial Officer, will review our financial results and discuss important factors impacting our performance. Following their statements, David Hargreaves, Hasbro's Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Business Development, will join Brian and Deb to field your questions.","Before we begin, please note that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management's expectations, goals, objectives and similar matter. These forward-looking statements may include comments concerning our product and entertainment plans; anticipated product performance; business opportunities, plans and strategies; costs, financial goals and expectations for our future financial performance.","There are many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. Some of those factors are set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K, our most recent 10-Q, in today's press release and in our other public disclosures. You should review such factors together with any forward-looking statements made on today's call. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.","Now I would like to introduce Brian Goldner. Brian?","Brian D. Goldner","Thank you, Debbie. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In 2012, Hasbro made significant strides toward accomplishing many objectives we set and communicated for the company. Specifically, we grew 2012 EPS to $2.81 versus $2.74 per share in 2011, including a $0.10 negative impact of foreign exchange. This excludes restructuring charges in both years and a tax benefit in 2011.","We returned the U.S. and Canada segment to historical operating profit margins despite lower revenues in the year. In turn, overall operating profit margins for Hasbro increased to 14.7% before charges.","We leveraged our international investments, growing our emerging markets revenue 16%. These are markets in which we have significantly invested over the past several years. Importantly, we delivered better than breakeven profit for all major emerging markets outside of China, 1 year ahead of plan.","We grew the Games category against an objective of stabilization and improved operating profit margins in the category. We grew revenue in our Girls category, driven by Furby and My Little Pony's brand innovation and immersive experiences.","And although we did not originally state this goal, we grew Entertainment and Licensing segment revenue and operating profit in a year following a major Transformers motion picture.","However, 2012 revenues declined $197 million. This reflects a negative $99 million impact from foreign exchange and a more than $100 million reduction in retail inventories.","As we outlined for you earlier this year, we employed a proven approach to rebuild our U.S. business much the way we have driven our international markets. It involves shipping inventory later in the year to be more in line with consumer demand, supported by increases in marketing spending.","Unfortunately, this holiday season, we saw a rapidly changing, more challenging retail environment. Lower point-of-sale trends from Thanksgiving to just before Christmas did not enable us to realize year-end shipments as strong as we had anticipated. There was a concern at retail about purchasing too much inventory later in the year given weak point-of-sale trends leading up to Christmas.","Point-of-sale did improve significantly at year end, but that demand did not result in additional shipments for Hasbro. Importantly, we ended the year with lower retail inventory in the U.S., as well as lower inventory on hand at Hasbro. This puts us in a strong position to begin 2013.","We recognize our industry is changing. In fact, to address these changes, we've been investing over the past several years to build our capabilities supporting our brands and our brand blueprint. Tomorrow at our Toy Fair event, we will walk you through the evolution of the blueprint and speak to the next stage, the Brand Blueprint 2.0.","As we continue to accelerate the transformation of our company while operating in markets with new consumer and retail dynamics, we have outlined a company-wide cost-savings initiative designed to deliver $100 million in annual savings by 2015.","Our 2012 fourth quarter results include a pretax charge of $36 million related to the initial implementation of this program, and we anticipate $20 million to $30 million in additional charges in 2013. We expect to realize 2013 net savings of $15 million to $25 million, with the remaining of the savings being fully recognized by 2015 as all aspects of the plan are implemented.","We are reviewing the organization from top to bottom to identify cost-saving opportunities. To date, these include an approximate 10% reduction in workforce, including an early retirement offering; facility consolidation, the continuation of our item and SKU count reduction programs and the implementation of process improvements.","Over the past several years, we've invested in strategic growth opportunities for Hasbro. We've added new brand-building capabilities while eliminating many historical SKU-making behaviors. We will continue investing strategically for the long term, where we anticipate strong returns on that investment. But we are accelerating our cost-saving efforts to reflect the market environment and our strategic decision to focus on fewer, more significant initiatives and working to ensure that in any environment we continue to enhance our total shareholder returns.","Now let's take a look at 2012. We had a number of successful brand initiatives for Hasbro. We had a record year with our Marvel partnership supporting 2 great films, Marvel's The Avengers and The Amazing Spider-Man, building on the tremendous brand innovation and storytelling for Marvel combined with the global scope and strong consumer-oriented approach of Disney. We are very excited about growing our partnership with Disney, and we'll spend some time tomorrow during our presentation outlining some of our 2 companies' global brand-building opportunities.","Also last year, Furby launched in English-speaking markets and delivered a great year. By November, the U.K. was entirely out of stock. Furby was supported by a strong digital marketing campaign, and on Christmas Day, the Furby app was the sixth most downloaded free app in the App Store.","In 2013, Furby goes global, and we will continue to add to the Furby line with new innovative brand experiences.","With the support of global television, product innovation, inventive licensing, a new digital app game, online experiences and a strong retail execution, My Little Pony continue to post very strong double-digit growth year-over-year. In 2013, we have exciting plans for the brand, which we'll begin to share with you tomorrow.","Our Games category grew versus our objective of stabilization. Magic: The Gathering had another tremendous year, growing more than 30% and marking the brand's fourth consecutive year of 25% growth or greater.","We also had a number of games initiatives that performed well, including Twister Dance, MONOPOLY Millionaire and Battleship. Additionally, we launched a very successful new action-battling gaming initiative across several brands, including TRANSFORMERS BOT SHOTS, Star Wars Fighter Pods, and despite launching late in the year, a strong contribution from our new partnership with Rovio Entertainment and Lucasfilm for ANGRY BIRDS STAR WARS.","We made a great deal of progress within Games this year as we continue to evolve our approach to gaming to be more in line with how consumers are playing games today. We continue to innovate gaming experiences based on consumer insights and offering gameplay, which cannot be replicated online or with an app.","Importantly, we improved profitability in our Gaming business to its highest level in several years. We reduced inventory in the U.S. retail channel and grew the Games category overall, backed by a number of these new initiatives.","Despite these successful initiatives across categories, we did face revenue headwinds in 2012 relative to the $916 million in Transformers and Beyblade sales in 2011 and a challenging retail environment in the U.S. and a number of Western European countries.","In respect to Transformers, 2012 revenue was down in line with other post-movie year performances for Boys brands. However, the brand grew 10% versus 2010, our last non-movie year, with support from global television and new brand initiatives.","Looking ahead to 2013, we are excited about the complete reinvention of Transformers across platforms, including a TV series distributed globally, online and mobile games, licensed products and a full line of new toys based on the all-new Transformers Beast Hunters.","In 2014, we anticipate the next installment of the Transformers movie franchise with an all-new cast and characters in partnership with Paramount Pictures and Michael Bay.","For Beyblade, 2012 revenues exceeded our expectations, declining less than we had planned. Beyblade remains a very popular brand globally and in the U.S., Beyblade ranked as one of our top selling items based on point-of-sale data for the year.","In 2013, we have new brand initiatives integrated with all-new animation from our partners at d-rights, Nelvana and Tomy Takara.","Looking more closely at our performance by region, our U.S. business declined, reflecting retail inventory reductions, tough comparison and a challenging market. But we generated greater earnings power from sales, increasing our operating profit margin to 15.1% versus 12.4% in 2011. In 2012, we changed our approach to the market and how we partnered with retailers. This allowed us to grow profitably and importantly positions us for profitable growth in future years.","At the beginning of 2012, we tasked the new U.S. team with returning the segment to historical operating profit margins and through a disciplined focus on quality execution and strong inventory management they were successful in 1 short year.","Internationally, revenues grew 1% absent foreign exchange, representing the largest revenue year internationally in company history. Including the impact of foreign exchange, revenues declined 4%. Latin America grew 8%, contributing to our emerging market growth of 16%. Additionally, we achieved profitability in every major emerging market except China, including Brazil, Russia and Columbia, a year ahead of plan.","I've talked today and over the past few years about the importance of supporting brands with rich digital and media content. As a result of the investments we've made in recent years, our television, film, digital and licensing strategy is firmly in place and working.","If you look at our brand performances and those across the industry, brands with a comprehensive strategy across these platforms are connecting with consumers and outperforming those operating outside of this model.","Since announcing our entry into television and television programming several years ago, we've made significant progress. Our shows are now in more than 170 countries worldwide. And in 2012, these programs drove approximately $150 million in incremental merchandising revenue.","Our television presence is also helping to build our brands in many emerging market countries. In the U.S., The Hub is now available in 72 million homes versus 56 million at launch. Advertising has grown significantly. Ratings are growing and have posted 5 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in Total Day. And in 2012, The Hub was the fastest-growing kid cable network.","While we continue to record a small annual loss after amortization in this investment, the network is cash flow positive and our overall global television strategy is on track and delivering profitable incremental revenues for Hasbro.","In 2013, we have another year with an extremely strong television slate, supported by Hasbro's and our partners' programming airing around the world. We're also supporting a number of major motion pictures in the coming year, providing additional global opportunities for Hasbro and partner's brands.","There are a number of film slated for 2013 and beyond from Hasbro and our partners. We're thrilled that our partner, Marvel, and its studio licensees, have a number of films planned, including Iron Man 3; The Wolverine; Thor: The Dark World; Captain America: The Winter Soldier; The Amazing Spider-Man 2; an Avenger sequel, as well as the launch of a new brand, Guardians of The Galaxy.","Lucasfilm is now developing new Star Wars movies, including Star Wars 7, planned for 2015 with J.J. Abrams directing. Marvel's character franchises, including Avengers and Spider-Man, along with Disney's new acquisition of Star Wars, our major franchise brands for Hasbro and our partnership with Disney is enabling us to develop these brands to be more global than ever before.","Today and in the future, consumers and retailers are increasingly looking for compelling innovation integrated with a multitude of digital experiences. At Hasbro, we work with tremendous brands and experienced global team developing innovative brand initiatives, including a strong multiyear slate of television, films and immersive digital engagements, which we believe positions us to deliver long-term profitable growth and enhance total shareholder returns.","Tomorrow, we'll speak further about the evolution of our brand blueprint at our Toy Fair presentation, as well as provide you with the first look at much of our 2013 product line.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Deb. Deb?","Deborah M. Thomas","Thank you, Brian. As Brian stated, we accomplished many of the objectives we set for the company in 2012. Through solid execution and good fiscal discipline, we increased our company's underlying operating profit margins fueled by gains in the U.S. and Canada segment margin. We drove further growth in the emerging markets and achieved our profitability target a year ahead of plan. Posting 16% growth, emerging markets now represent more than 10% of our total revenue, and our major markets, such as Brazil and Russia, are profitable.","We generated operating cash flow above our $500 million annual target, which continues to provide us with capital to both strategically deploy it back into our business and to return to our shareholders.","Today, we announced an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend.","Finally, we began the implementation of a cost-savings initiative designed to generate $100 million in annual savings by 2015. This program is wide-reaching and strategic in nature, designed not only to lower our cost basis but to drive higher levels of efficiency and effectiveness from our global teams. We have great confidence in our people and our strategy, and we believe in our ability as a team to accomplish the goals we set for Hasbro.","Turning to our 2012 results, full year net revenues were $4.09 billion compared to $4.29 billion in 2011. Excluding a $98.5 million negative impact from foreign exchange, revenues declined 2% to $4.19 billion.","Operating profit for the year as reported was $551.8 million compared to operating profit of $594 million in 2011. 2012 operating profit includes $47.2 million in restructuring charges. 2011 operating profit includes $14.4 million related to costs associated with establishing our Gaming Center of Excellence.","Excluding these charges in both years, 2012 operating profit was $599 million or 14.7% of revenues compared to $608.4 million or 14.2% of revenues last year.","Net earnings as reported for 2012 were $336 million or $2.55 per share compared with $385.4 million or $2.82 per share in 2011. Absent charges and a favorable tax benefit in 2011, 2012 EPS was $2.81 per share versus $2.74 per share in 2011. Additionally, 2012 EPS includes a negative $0.10 per share impact from foreign exchange.","Cash grew year-over-year to $849.7 million as we generated $535 million of operating cash flow. As I mentioned, we remain in a strong cash position to fund our business and to continue returning cash to shareholders.","Looking at our full year 2012 results by segment. The U.S. and Canada segment net revenues were $2.12 billion, down 6% versus $2.25 billion last year. Growth in the Girls and Games categories was more than offset by declines in the Boys and Preschool categories.","The U.S. and Canada segment reported 15% operating profit growth to $319.1 million or 15.1% of revenues compared to $278.4 million or 12.4% of revenues in 2011. The increase in operating profit came primarily from product mix, as well as improved inventory management based on the change in execution of our U.S. business and the decision to shift shipments later in the year versus last year.","The U.S. team's execution drove improved margins in the segment, a 23% reduction in our own U.S. and Canada segment inventories, and a 20% reduction in U.S. retail inventories.","In the International segment, absent a negative foreign exchange impact of $98 million, net revenues grew 1%. As reported, net revenues were $1.78 billion, down 4%, versus $1.86 billion in 2011. The results in this segment reflect 8% growth in Latin America offset by a decline in Europe and Asia Pacific. Revenues in the emerging markets grew 16%, driven by strong double-digit growth in Brazil and Russia. Internationally, the Games and Preschool categories were flat, while Boys and Girls declined.","Operating profit in the International segment decreased $55.1 million to $215.5 million or 12.1% of revenues compared to $270.6 million or 14.5% of revenues in 2011. The decline in operating profit primarily reflects our geographic mix of revenues. Our emerging markets posted strong growth, representing a higher percentage of the segment. But they currently carry lower profit margins, while our more profitable developed markets declined as a percentage of the total.","The Entertainment and Licensing segment net revenues increased $19.2 million or 12% to $181.4 million compared to $162.2 million in 2011. In 2012, the segment benefited from increased sales of television content in all formats, including global television distribution, digital distribution and home entertainment. This was offset by year-over-year declines in movie-related revenue, including lower revenues from licensed product primarily associated with the third Transformers motion picture in 2011.","For the full year 2012, the Entertainment and Licensing segment reported 24% operating profit growth to $53.2 million compared to $42.8 million in 2011. Operating profit growth was the result of higher revenues and improved expense leverage.","In 2012, we recorded $47.2 million of pretax restructuring charges. From a segment basis, substantially all of these charges are in corporate expenses. And looking at the income statement, approximately $2.8 million of these charges were recorded in cost of sales; $10.9 million in product development; and the majority, $33.5 million, is in SD&A.","2011 also included restructuring charges of $6.8 million in product development and $7.6 million in SD&A. The following discussion excludes charges for both years.","For the company overall, cost of sales for the full year was $1.67 billion or 40.8% of revenues compared to $1.84 billion or 42.8% of revenues in 2011. The year-over-year improvement came primarily from improved inventory management in our operating segments and favorable product mix. From an expense standpoint, total operating expenses were $1.82 billion or 44.5% of revenues compared to $1.84 billion or 43% of revenues last year. Full year program production amortization totaled $41.8 million versus $35.8 million last year. This was in line with our expected range of $40 million to $50 million for 2012.","Royalties declined to $302.1 million or 7.4% of revenues for the full year versus $339.2 million and 7.9% of revenues in 2011. This reflects strong global growth in Marvel during 2012 but was more than offset by lower sales of other royalty-bearing entertainment properties. In 2011, we had nearly $1 billion of sales from the third Transformers film and Beyblade.","Our advertising-to-revenue ratio increased in 2012 to 10.3% versus 9.7% in 2011, consistent with our stated plan to increase our investment in advertising in the U.S. SD&A of $813.9 million was essentially flat with last year and totaled 19.9% of revenues.","Last year's SD&A reflected approximately $30 million of lower-than-expected compensation expense. In 2012, we gained about half of that amount back, which was mostly offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange.","Looking below operating profit, other expense net was $7.2 million in 2012 versus $18.6 million in 2011. Our 50% share of The Hub is included on this line on the P&L. For 2012, our share of the earnings in The Hub was a loss of $6 million compared to a loss of $7.3 million a year ago. 2012's lower total other expense reflects investment gains versus losses in 2011 and lower foreign currency losses this year versus last. Our underlying tax rate in 2012 was 27% compared to an underlying tax rate of 26.2% last year.","Now let's turn to the balance sheet. Hasbro has generated $2.2 billion in operating cash flow over the past 5 years, and we've used that cash to strategically invest in expanding our global footprint and capabilities across several long-term growth opportunities, including the emerging markets and Entertainment and Licensing. During that time, we've also paid $731 million to shareholders through our dividend program and spent $1.6 billion in share repurchases.","In 2012, our business generated operating cash flow of $534.8 million, ahead of our annual target of $500 million. 2012 television programming spend totaled $59.3 million. And at year end, cash totaled $849.7 million compared to $641.7 million a year ago and $696.7 million at the end of the third quarter.","In 2012, we returned $225.5 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend program, including $46.6 million associated with the accelerated payment of our historical February dividend, which we paid in December. Excluding the accelerated dividend payment, our payout ratio in 2012 was approximately 53%, slightly above our stated 45% to 50% target.","In 2013, we anticipate one less dividend payment given that February 2013 payment was paid in December 2012. Today, we announced the ninth increase in our dividend in the last 10 years. The new quarterly dividend rate is $0.40 per share, up 11% or $0.04 from the previous rate. This increase continues to reflect the confidence management and our board have in Hasbro over the long term.","In 2012, we also spent $100 million on share repurchases, buying back 2.7 million shares at an average price of $37.11. At year-end, $127.3 million remained available in the current share repurchase authorization.","Receivables at year-end were $1 billion, consistent with last year. DSOs were 72 days, up 2 days versus 2011, reflecting growth in emerging markets with longer terms, in particular, Latin America.","We continue to lower inventories this past quarter, ending the year with $316 million in inventory, down from $334 million in 2011.","We ended the year with lower inventories in the U.S. and Canada, partially offset by higher levels of inventories overseas in support of our expanding emerging markets, including a new warehouse in Russia.","Depreciation for 2012 was $99.7 million and CapEx was $112.1 million.","We enter 2013 in a strong financial position, as we are leveraging recent investments across our business.","Our cost-savings initiatives will not only lower our overall cost structure but strategically align our organization's efforts with our most significant opportunities. This focus will help us drive profitable growth for Hasbro and enhance shareholder value over the long term.","I'd like to now turn the call back to Brian before we take your questions.","Brian D. Goldner","Thank you, Deb. Before we take your questions, you may have noticed we have not provided guidance for the coming year. Everyone at Hasbro globally is focused on delivering profitable growth year-in and year-out for the long term. We believe this focus will result in delivering compelling long-term total shareholder returns as we have provided over the last decade. We are not, however, going to be providing annual guidance on revenues and EPS going forward. We will, however, continue to work hard to communicate to you our strategy, our milestones and the progress we are making in our evolution towards becoming a world-class branded play company.","With that, Deb, David and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sean McGowan with Needham & Company.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Number one, could you give us a sense, more detail, on U.S. point-of-sale movement in the quarter?","David D. R. Hargreaves","So I think, Sean, one of the things that we've said is that in the U.S., our shipments were down in the fourth quarter, I think about 6%, and we're clearly -- or for the year. And one of the things that we've done is we've reduced our retailer inventory by over $100 million during the year with our big 4 U.S. accounts. So I think it's clear that our POS was, therefore, down sort of significantly below than the reduction in our shipments in the U.S.","Brian D. Goldner","It was less then.","David D. R. Hargreaves","Yes.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. The other thing in terms of the NPD data, one thing to note particularly in our Games business, Sean, is that Magic: The Gathering really doesn't appear in a lot of the NPD data because so much of that business is done through hobby shops and other channels of distribution. And so not only does NPD data get that in terms of sales, it also doesn't get that in terms of market share both for the Games business, as well as for the company.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So is that how Games was able to, so far, outperform what NPD was suggesting?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, exactly. If you look at -- frankly, if you look at both trading card game business, according to NPD, as well as the Games business, and, frankly, as well as Hasbro, that's a big difference maker because NPD doesn't track all of the sales that we get, which is the predominant amount of sales that we get, and the expanding number of sales we get for Magic: The Gathering in the hobby channel.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then you mentioned better -- I think Deb mentioned better management and a favorable product mix as gross margin drivers. Can you give us some sense of what was the most important driver there?","Deborah M. Thomas","Sean, the most important driver was really better inventory management. By having lower inventory both at retail and our own inventory, it really drove down obsolescence costs and the other things that come with that. In addition to that, we did have some favorable product mix. As you recall, we have stated earlier in the year that we had taken some price increases on carryover product, and that helped with the margin on the carryover product. And our new product was well received at the price points that they were offered.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes. The other thing, Sean, is in Games, our operating profit margin in Games is the highest that it's been in the last 8 years. So as I told you guys, as we talked about, as we were able to develop games across all these different formats with this expertise coming from the Gaming Center of Excellence, we are able to create games in any form or format and do that in a very profitable way. And so, obviously, with Games growing, that changes the mix profitably and favorably.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Last question, and I don't know if this is in any of the supplements you just provided, but can you tell us where these various charges are taken through up and down the P&L?","Deborah M. Thomas","Sure. We do have that. Is that in the -- so in the P&L, let me just find that section, if you don't mind, for a moment. We have in cost of sales, $2.8 million; in product development, $10.9 million; and in SD&A, $33.5 million, for the total of $47.2 million.","Brian D. Goldner","Sean, that's in the -- one of the charts that we put out as part of the presentation, the last chart.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up and just to clarify your answer to Sean's question. So just want to understand, was your U.S. point-of-sales down more than the 6%?","David D. R. Hargreaves","No, less than. Because our shipments were in, we're down 6%, but we reduced our inventory in the trade by over $100 million. It means that our POS decline was substantially less than that.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Okay. And then are you saying that the Games POS was up if you include Magic?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, we -- obviously, we don't get to track -- the tracking from hobby the same way we get the absolute sales and we know the sell-through. But we don't have NPD data for the Magic portion of the business. But we do know what the sales were overall, and we knew how the sellout went because we get that data in a different manner from our hobby channel.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then, Brian, in the -- you mentioned in your prepared remarks and you also showed in the slides that the retail inventories in the U.S. and Canada were down. I was just wondering if you can give us some color where they were internationally?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, the inventory in International markets and certain areas were up, frankly, because we're growing those businesses in emerging markets. We put into place and we talked to you guys about the fact that we have now our Russian warehouse where we're putting product in. The Russian business is one of our strongest growth businesses. In Brazil, we have warehousing and are shipping product direct. So those are areas where we're growing inventory. You want to comment?","David D. R. Hargreaves","Yes, but I think in the aggregate, we were certainly down in Australia, we were down in Mexico. I think we were down in Canada. Europe was a little bit of mixed, with some markets up. So in the aggregate, not only were we down $100-plus million in the U.S., but in the aggregate, I think our retail inventories were down at least $100 million.","Brian D. Goldner","Right. And then Hasbro's inventories, as you saw, were down.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Yes. And just final, maybe a bit of housekeeping. Just trying to understand, your tax rate was lower than expected despite the higher mix of U.S. sales in the quarter. So I was just wondering what drove that?","Deborah M. Thomas","We had a few discrete items, but our underlying rate was 26 point -- 27%.","Brian D. Goldner","So actually, it was up a bit versus a year ago.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar.","Jaime M. Katz - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I actually have 2 questions. First, you guys didn't talk very much about the Preschool segment, but while it's not the largest segment, it can move the needle. Can you talk about kind of your outlook for this segment? Because I think your nearest competitor maybe reported some more promising data. And then, do you guys have an outlook for when you think Hub turns positive? I think you said it was a $6 million loss that was flowing through.","Debbie Hancock","Yes, if you look at the Preschool business, we have a lot of positive elements there. The biggest difference in Preschool and why it was down was the year-on-year comparison for Sesame Street. The year prior, we had a very big Elmo program, and, this year, less so. If you look within PLAYSKOOL, the PLAYSKOOL HEROES line is among the fastest-growing action figure lines for Preschool, Boys, and with a number of brands there. Play-Doh performed quite well in the category, as well as some other PLAYSKOOL items. So the -- again, the biggest difference is Elmo. And we're looking forward to showing you the Sesame Street line for 2013 tomorrow, so we think we'll build that business back in 2013. In regard to The Hub, we made great progress. The Hub's now available in 72 million homes. Ratings are up quarter-on-quarter, the last 5 quarters. Ad sales up, affiliate fees up. So I just think it's a matter of a bit more time. But our studio, given the fact that we're selling shows both digitally, in television and as well as in home video, is profitable. And so again, it's just a matter of the amortization that drives the loss. If you took out the amortization, we'd actually be profitable. So it's just paying for the acquisition.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about the restructuring, and hoping you could help us with some of the major buckets of savings to come. And, I guess, part of the reason I ask, is the 10% reduction of the workforce could probably only account for around 1\/3 of the $100 million projected savings. So where is the rest going to come from?","Brian D. Goldner","Well, actually, Michael, the -- by 2015, on a full year basis, the reduction in workforce will account for over 1\/2 of the savings. It's about $55 million, and we think it's at least $100 million in savings. And then, Deb, you can comment on the Other category.","Deborah M. Thomas","Sure, and we will give more detail on this and more description tomorrow at our investor events. But our cost-savings initiative will come from facility consolidation with our warehousing and distribution facilities and some of our sales offices and some other process improvements that we're looking to achieve and some system enhancements as well. So like I said, we'll give more color on that tomorrow. But as Brian mentioned, the largest piece is coming from our headcount reductions.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And 10% of the workforce is something in the area of 600 people. So $55 million assumes about $100,000 per person. So that does that mean that we're going to be looking at some mid to upper-level management departures? Or is it -- or how is it that it's that much per person that you're saving?","Deborah M. Thomas","I think it's interesting when Brian made his comments today, he said that we reviewed the organization from top to bottom. So throughout the organization, we've looked at areas where, perhaps, we need to change out some skill sets from what we have today. And the 10% reduction is a reduction, but it's a net -- it will be a net number at the end of the day.","Brian D. Goldner","So, Michael, if you look over the period prior to this change from 2000 through 2012 prior to the restructuring, we've added hundreds of people around the world in all of our emerging markets, in sales and marketing organizations. We've also added the capabilities of television, licensing, digital gaming, you name it. But our headcount through the end of 2011 was flat to 2000. So, in fact, we've been redeploying resources, been changing out personnel and been very prudent about how we hire so that we're able to add skill sets, new talent, while we've also had departures of personnel. This is ensuring that we get to lower level of overall costs given the changing environment and our need to go out and get some new and additional skill sets as we continue to drive for long-term growth.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then a couple of the more senior executives, there was a press release yesterday, have switched roles. Can you maybe help us with what your intention is there?","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, one thing is that Wiebe Tinga has a 25-year history with Hasbro. He has run several of the major regions for the company. He was very instrumental, working with David in building our teams in Latin America, building our teams in Asia Pacific, has run Northern European business, and, most recently, ran the North American business and helped us to get back to the historic levels of operating profit margin and a better partnership with our retailers in a 1-year period. We also brought an executive down from Canada who had been running our Canadian business named Michael Hogg, and he's now running the U.S. business. So that -- those are the changes in the sales and marketing by regions. And now the 4 regions around the world selling will report to Wiebe, our Chief Commercial Officer. David, you want to talk about what you're doing?","David D. R. Hargreaves","Yes. I think in terms of what I'm going to be doing, clearly, Michael, as you know, our industry is changing pretty rapidly. Our industry hasn't been growing recently in the developed economies around the world. At the same time, the emerging markets are growing very rapidly. In fact, the Asia Pacific market is now larger than the U.S. market. And then we've got things like, it's an ever-increasing proportion of toys driven by entertainment. And we've got tablets, which are really in great demand by children now, which are giving both a challenge and an opportunity through our brands. So I think what we've decided we need to do is we need to -- given all this rapid change, we need to be much more focused on understanding and much more proactive in reacting to these challenges and opportunities. And that's what I'm going to spend most of my time doing.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And very lastly, I just want to ask about the inventories, which sales missed your own expectations by a decent amount in the fourth quarter, but yet you didn't end up with a large amount of inventory on the books. So, I guess, I'm just trying to understand where the extra product that you would've manufactured to meet your initial expectations, where did that product end up?","David D. R. Hargreaves","Well, I think with $316 million inventory on our books at the end of the year, we certainly could have shipped another $100 million or so if it had materialized. Obviously, we try and react as quickly as possible when we see sales aren't coming. So and I think as far as the retailer inventories, I think we've said in our first quarter call, second quarter call and third quarter call, we've repeatedly said that retailer inventories were low. So they were very low coming into the third, fourth quarter. And therefore, a bit of a shortfall in POS that we weren't expecting hasn't meant that they've ended up with excessive inventories by any regard.","Brian D. Goldner","Michael, if you go back several years, it used to be the fact that it would take in supply chain about 16 weeks to get it from the Orient. And today it's, in a just-in-time world, we're much closer to 6 weeks. And, obviously, that enables us to flex up-and-down production and to take and go after hot sellers and to dial down on things that may not be selling. And so as we said, as we saw the POS declines from about Thanksgiving to right before Christmas that, that was an area where I think retailers are increasingly concerned about the POS and about that last turn of inventory. And then we did see great POS, a very strong growth year-on-year in the last part of the year. Someone on CNBC said maybe the fiscal cliff wiped Santa Claus from the front page. And I think that's a bit of the case. And so that helped us to sell down our inventory at retail, and yet we didn't get that last turn of inventory that we might have shipped in.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Conder with Wells Fargo.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just to follow up on a couple of previous questions. Number one would be related to the restructuring charges. You outlined what you expect for '13 and then said that, obviously, there'd be quite a bit more in '14. How much did you realize in savings in the fourth quarter? Clearly, I think there was some headcount reductions going on in that. How much of the savings did -- accrued in the fourth quarter from the overall program that you just implemented?","Deborah M. Thomas","None.","Brian D. Goldner","None in 2012.","Deborah M. Thomas","None in 2012.","Brian D. Goldner","And, Tim, and so for 2013, we're saying we could save $15 million to $25 million, but we'll also have some additional costs maybe in the $20 million to $30 million range.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. Okay, that helps. And then on the Games & Puzzles POS -- and, again, not to beat this to death, but you said you -- obviously, you know what NPD is. And then you mentioned that the channel is not tracked by NPD, but you have a pretty good idea from other sources, both -- so putting those 2 together, Brian, what was U.S. Games, your -- your overall POS in the U.S.?","Brian D. Goldner","In the U.S., looking there, that's flat.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So for '12, as a whole, you were flat in Games & Puzzles?","Brian D. Goldner","No. Games was down. Games in the -- if you take the POS for the part of Games that we have POS data for, it was down a bit.","David D. R. Hargreaves","Yes. I think Brian said that the problem is that one of our highest growth Games spend this year was Magic: The Gathering. We'll talk about -- more about that tomorrow, but it's been really doing great growth for us. But the trouble is that Magic: The Gathering is sold predominantly through hobby shops. And therefore -- and we don't get the POS information from the hobby shops that we get from the likes of Walmart and Target and Toys\"R\"Us, but neither do NPD or does anyone else. So no one can really track that. I think what we're saying is that, clearly, we believe that our Games shipments worldwide have been up. We know that our Games inventories at retail are down. So, on a global basis, we clearly believe that our POS is up on Games.","Brian D. Goldner","And we know what our sellout is, Magic: The Gathering, Wizards of the Coast knows what its sellout is at the hobby shops because of reorders.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. So, globally, everything on Games up, is what you're saying?","Brian D. Goldner","That's right.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then maybe this is a better question for tomorrow. Should we anticipate anything in the new area that's been pretty hot, obviously, in the overall Games area, the infinity type of genre?","Brian D. Goldner","We're working on games across a number of different platforms. We are going to -- we'll talk about a number of different initiatives that we have in Games. This year, we're launching a number of different brands, including off-the-board games, as well as a totally different way to think about action battling, which has been a great category for us, launching a new brand there. And over time, we'll be able to show you a lot of new platforms that we have for games. But certainly tomorrow, we are going to talk about certain new Games brands and ideas that we are launching in Games.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Mike Swartz with SunTrust.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Could you maybe, just talking about your cost savings, did you say if you were reinvesting as far as the $15 million to $25 million you expect in 2013? Will that be reinvested or is that expected to fall at the bottom line?","Brian D. Goldner","That's savings. So all we were saying is we had $20 million to $30 million in additional expense as we work through this program, and then $15 million  to $25 million savings.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that would be a gross number?","Brian D. Goldner","Correct.","Deborah M. Thomas","Correct. And the reason why we have these costs is largely due to our voluntary retirement program. Depending on how many people choose certain types of payments out of that program, we could have some pension costs that come through the year. And that's predominantly why we have such a large range on the cost side. And until it happens, we can't determine exactly what that'll be.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then just maybe on your comments around SKU rationalization. Do you expect the pace of that to accelerate in 2013, or is that going to be a meaningful difference versus 2012? And then are there any categories in particular where you're focused on rationalizing?","Brian D. Goldner","Right. We're really focused on growing our brands with the most global potential. Our franchise brands and partner brands, we have a number of challenger brands and we'll talk about what those brands are tomorrow. Obviously, there are elements within our business, like we've talked the tale of the Games business that aren't key and critical to growing our business and don't have the same awareness or interest globally. And so we're focusing on those brands that have the greatest potential and the greatest opportunity to execute them across our entire brand blueprint. Year-on-year, this is 2012 versus 2011, we reduced SKUs by 16%. And our overall target, which we'll talk about certainly a lot more tomorrow, is to reduce SKUs by an additional 30% and our items by about 40%. And we'll talk about the difference between an item and a SKU tomorrow. I'll walk you through some of our development process.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","That's an additional 30 SKUs...","Brian D. Goldner","No, 30%.","Michael A. Swartz - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Sorry, an additional 30% versus what you've already cut out?","Brian D. Goldner","Correct. Our total for the period will then be a reduction of 30%.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Your cash balance, $850 million. How much of that is overseas? How much in the U.S.?","Deborah M. Thomas","The -- a significant portion is overseas. There's probably about less than $10 million in the U.S.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And Furby, was Furby a global launch back in 1998, or was that just English-speaking markets?","David D. R. Hargreaves","Ultimately, it became a global launch, so you're going to catch me out which year. I have to go back and...","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","It's okay, year doesn't matter. But people globally know Furby from the last year.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes.","David D. R. Hargreaves","Yes. We sold 40 million Furbys way back the first time, and it was probably equally as hot and -- in Europe and some other markets as it was in the U.S.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. How many of them did you sell this year?","Brian D. Goldner","We didn't really report that. But we sold it in English-speaking -- in 2012 in English-speaking countries. And this year it rolls out and will be distributed in several languages and globally.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. One more. Earlier, David said that there was $100 million worth of inventory that could have shipped in 2012 if demand had materialized. Now how much of that $100 million is sellable at full price now that we're in '12, '13?","David D. R. Hargreaves","We've got very good quality of inventory. We ended up with $316 million of inventory on our books. That's certainly down versus a year ago, and it's down versus 2 years ago. But it's probably still up versus 3 years ago. So, certainly, if our retailers had come back and said, Look, sales are robust, we need more inventory. We could have shipped it. Most of it is a good quality of inventory. As Deb said, we -- because of the quality of our inventory, we took far less in terms of markdowns, closeouts, obsolescence this year-end than we had in past year-ends. So it's predominantly very good inventory, which will sell as we go into this year.","Brian D. Goldner","Yes, and if you -- Gerrick, just talking about operating profit, if you look at the U.S. and Canada segment, the operating profit for the U.S. and Canada segment increased by 76% to nearly $90 million in the quarter. So it's really returning that business to higher levels of operating profit, spending less in shipping allowances and other markdowns and other liability inventory.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Maybe one more, if I could slip it in. One Direction, is that a worldwide license or just North America, U.S.?","Brian D. Goldner","It's worldwide but not the U.K.","Operator","There's no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Debbie Hancock for closing comments.","Debbie Hancock","Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today.
