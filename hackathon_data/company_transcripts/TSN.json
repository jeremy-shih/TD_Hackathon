Please note, this event is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jon Kathol, Vice President of Investor Relations.

On today's call are Tom Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer and Dennis Leatherby, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also with us is Stewart Glendinning, who will become our Chief Financial Officer, effective February 10, 2018. Of course, it's a little early to expect him to answer any questions.","Slides accompanying today's prepared remarks are available as a quarterly supplemental report on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.tyson.com. Tyson Foods issued an earnings release this morning, which has been furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K and is available on our website at ir.tyson.com.","Our remarks today include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections.","I encourage you to read the release issued earlier this morning and our filings with the SEC for a discussion of the risks that can affect our business.

Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","All right. Thank you very much, Jon, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us as we wrap up another record year. I want to start by acknowledging the announcement that we made last Wednesday about our CFO transition from Dennis to Stewart. We have company-wide townhall meetings after these earnings calls each quarter that we call those Team Talk. And so, we're just absolutely thrilled that Stewart can be here with us, so he has a chance to meet folks in person.","And this is Dennis' second to last earnings call, and it's bittersweet, but Tyson has had the pleasure of having Dennis on the team for many, many years. As you know, he's been the CFO since 2008 and nearly 30 years with the company, countless contributions. He's been an integral part of my first year as CEO. So, Dennis, on behalf of everybody at Tyson, let me just publicly say thank you for everything you've done for the company. And we appreciate you, we thank you, and we're going to be looking forward to having a proper sendoff in the spring.","But right now \u2013 Stewart, also welcome. Thanks for joining us today. As you know, he has some big shoes to fill, but we're happy to have you. And just thrilled that you made the decision to join the Tyson Foods family, and we're looking forward to the massive contributions we absolutely know that you'll make.","Stewart F. Glendinning - Molson Coors Brewing Company","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'm really happy I could be here today, and very excited about starting officially in December.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Excellent. So, we have some work to do, so let's get to it. So we delivered our overall goal of at least 4% operating income growth, EPS growth in the high single digits, and 3% volume growth in value-added products. Fiscal 2017 was a year of great change, and despite some challenges, our team remained focused on delivering for the long term for our shareowners, and driving demand for consumer relevant products through innovation, customer growth and through category leadership, initiating to transformation to a more agile and efficient organization structure to accelerate growth and sustainability. Not only did we deliver exceptional results, we also strengthened our ability to lead change and grow in a dynamic marketplace, while delivering ongoing financial fitness. In the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS was up 49% over last year, and full year adjusted EPS was up 21%, to $5.31.","Turning the page on a significant company milestone, we successfully completed the integration of synergy capture related to Hillshire with three-year synergies totaling $670 million. We now pivot to our ongoing Financial Fitness program in which we expect to achieve $200 million in savings in fiscal 2018 through a combination of synergies from the integration of AdvancePierre and other cost savings. As I've stated before, while the majority of the Hillshire synergies were reinvested to grow the company, Financial Fitness savings will fall directly to the bottom line.","Looking at the top 10 CPG retail food manufacturers in our fiscal 2017, our Core 9 product lines and total Tyson outperformed total food and beverage in dollar growth, and outperformed all but one company in volume growth. As expected, we saw volume decline related to pricing we decided to take in a few categories, and I'll talk more about that later.","So now let's move on to the operating segments and take a look back at Q4 and fiscal 2017. All operating income and operating margin references I will make are on an adjusted basis. In the Beef segment, in the fourth quarter, we produced operating income of $313 million with an 8.2% operating margin. Sales volume was up 3.3% on 6% higher average price. For the fiscal year, operating income was a record $885 million with a 6% operating margin. Sales volume was up 1.8% on 0.4% higher average price.","The Beef segment benefited from cattle availability, strong domestic demand, and increased exports. As we begin fiscal 2018, industry cattle supplies are projected to increase 1% to 2% this year, and we expect ample supplies in the regions where our plants are located. With strong export demand expected to continue due to increased global protein demand, we believe the Beef segment's operating margin should be above 5%.","In the Pork segment, fourth quarter operating income was $124 million with a 9.1% operating margin. Sales volume declined 1.2% as average price increased 11.7%. For the fiscal year, operating income was a record $648 million with a 12.4% operating margin. Sales volume for the year was up 0.6% on 6.1% higher average price.","In 2017, the Pork segment benefited from strong exports, and we expect this to continue into 2018. As we begin our fiscal year, we're seeing counter-seasonal margin compression as new capacity comes online. The industry is in a transition period while new facilities secure their hog supplies. This is playing out as we had expected, and the impact is built into our guidance assumptions. With hog supplies projected to increase 3% in fiscal 2018, there should be ample supply. We think our production capabilities will give us an advantage in the long term. We anticipate our Pork segment margins will be above 9% for the year, and while this doesn't reach a level of performance in 2017, it's still above the 6% to 8% normalized operating margin range.","Both our Beef and Pork segments are doing well, despite tight labor markets. We believe our efforts in increasing wages, running chain speeds efficiently, focusing on safety and staffing, have resulted in less turnover and improved efficiency now and will so over the long run. Also in the Beef and Pork segments, we saw record sales and volumes for our Open Prairie Natural brand of fresh meats.","Consumer demand is growing double digits for our no antibiotics ever and no added hormones natural fresh meats. And we intend to provide consumers and customers with the product attributes they're looking for. Favorable market fundamentals, maximizing revenue on a per head basis and operational excellence at the plant level contributed to our Beef and Pork segments' record performance this fiscal year.","In the Chicken segment in the fourth quarter, operating income was $322 million with a 10.6% operating margin. Volume was up 4.1% on 3.7% higher price. For the fiscal year, Chicken segment's operating income was more than $1.1 billion with a 9.8% margin. Sales volume was up 1.2% attributed to strong demand and incremental volume from AdvancePierre. Average price was up 3.1%.","Chicken demand remains strong. With our leading brand position, Tyson has an advantage. Strong growth in premium and branded fresh chicken products was a key driver in sales dollar growth. Converting our retail Tyson-branded chicken to no antibiotics ever was a significant accomplishment in 2017, and we've been very successful from both a production and a sales perspective.","Core Tyson frozen fully cooked chicken sales have responded well to increased advertising, highlighting the NAE attribute. And volume and share has been growing now for five consecutive quarters. In FY 2017, we increased dollar and volume share 1.2 points and 1.7 points, respectively, across channels.","We're continuing the evolution of the Tyson master brand, and we're in the process of modernizing our retail packaging and graphics. This will start showing up on shelves in early calendar year 2018. Additionally, we continue to increase our focus on Tyson-branded innovation, with 86% of our new product concepts scoring either Outstanding or Ready Now compared to only 30% in the competitive benchmark. This gives us great confidence in our pipeline of new products.","In foodservice, our chicken sales volume increased more than 10%, with value-added products outpacing the category due in part to our QSRs customers' successful limited time offers featuring chicken. Within broadline distribution, Tyson had a one-third share of total chicken and continues to gain share, driven by double-digit growth in value-added Tyson-branded chicken. To wrap up the Chicken segment, in fiscal 2018, we expect operating margin to improve to around 11%, importantly, with around a 3% volume growth.","Moving forward to Prepared Foods segment, in the fourth quarter, operating income was $152 million with a 6.7% operating margin. On our third quarter call, we said Prepared Foods margin would be between 7% and 8% for Q4. We came in just below projection due to our decision to buy out a raw material supply agreement, which sets us up well for FY 2018 and beyond. Excluding the short-term impact of that change, we were in line with our expectations. Volume for the quarter was up 9.5% with sales price up 12.5%. Incremental volume from AdvancePierre was primary contributors of the volume increase in Q4, offset by some seasonal softness in overall foodservice volume.","For the 2017 fiscal year, Prepared Foods produced $675 million in operating income with an 8.6% operating margin. Volume for the year was up 3.2% with average price up 3.6%. Based on higher input costs, we took price increases in some categories, and while there's been an expected reduction in volume and share, it was necessary to position ourselves going into fiscal 2018.","I'll also note that some of the branded volume declines in Q4 are being offset by growth in our customer branded business. Brands are very important to us, and while we're investing in our brands for long-term growth, our relationships with our customers are just as important. Customers look to us for category leadership and our ability to drive growth through our Tyson brands, in addition to being a reliable supplier for their brand. This is critical to driving relevance and total category growth.","We have some smaller emerging brands that we call our rapid growth brands, and we're pleased with how well they're doing. Aidells continues on its growth trajectory, and Hillshire Snacking and Golden Island premium jerky are gaining traction, and we expect this to continue into fiscal 2018. We're strengthening our foundation in Prepared Foods. Sally Grimes has her team in place and are hard at work setting up the business for long-term success through a simultaneous focus on innovation and efficiency.","The first quarter in Prepared Foods is off to a strong start, as we expected. Retail volume and share are likely to be down in Q1 for hotdogs, smoked sausage and breakfast sausage, but for the year, we expect growth. We expect the Prepared Foods segment to grow volume around 10% and produce returns between 11% and 12% for fiscal 2018. As we closed the sale of three non-protein businesses and further integrated AdvancePierre, we will continue to enhance margins of this great business.","And now I'd like to turn from the segment reports to our customer channels. In the broadline distribution channel, we see both volume and dollar expansion. Total broadline volume grew 1.7%, while Tyson grew 4.5% and increased share. Our Focus 5 sales grew 10% over last year, nearly six times the rate of broadline distribution in total. The Focus 5 categories represent more than half of our total foodservice volume.","In the retail channel, consumer trips were up, but the units purchased were down. This is believed to be attributed, at least in part, to the impact of the hurricanes. We continue to focus on innovation and brand building, and we have increased our total points of distribution on new products by more than 1,200 points. We're also expanding our footprint of retail stores. An IRI shelf audit showed that we gained an average of 4.3 linear feet per store in the U.S. over the previous year. That's 46 miles of additional shelf space overall.","We have a strong pipeline of retail innovation with the successful testing of meal kits, more Hillshire Snacking expansion and a stronger ingredient meats portfolio coming in fiscal 2018. Our innovation vitality index was 13% for the fiscal year, which is a best-in-class range.","In the C-Store channel, Convenience Store News recently recognized three of our products in its 21st annual Best New Products Awards: our Hillshire Farm bacon gouda premium chicken sausage, our western omelet wrap from AdvancePierre, and our ham and cheese stuffed Bosco Sticks. Bosco Sticks are stuffed breadsticks that are primarily sold to schools, but by marrying Tyson's scale and innovation expertise with the unique manufacturing capabilities of a small acquisition, we're able to develop new products for different channels. And with AdvancePierre, we're looking forward to even more of this type of innovation and growth.","Today, before announcing the acquisition of Original Philly Cheesesteak Company, one of the nation's leading producers of raw and fully-cooked Philly-style cheesesteak and components and appetizers. This is a great tuck-in acquisition of a company highly regarded in the foodservice industry and a natural, strategic fit, combining our commercial and operational resources with their product portfolio.","Original Philly is a strong, double-digit margin business with approximately $130 million of annual sales, and the transaction will be immediately accretive. Going forward, the majority of Original Philly's results will be reported in the Prepared Foods segment, with the remainder going to the Chicken segment.","So, in closing, I'm extremely pleased we delivered another record year, but even more excited about the future of Tyson Foods. We are in the early stages of a transformation to become a more modern food company. We have a hardworking and resilient team that is leading change in a dynamic marketplace. Our entire Tyson Foods family remains squarely focused on growing the business through differentiated capabilities, delivering on ongoing financial fitness through continuous improvement, and sustaining our company and the world for future generations.","That wraps up my prepared remarks, and now I'd like to turn it over to Dennis to take us through the financials. Dennis?","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We finished fiscal 2017 with a strong fourth quarter, as we delivered record EPS for our fifth consecutive year on a GAAP basis and sixth straight year on an adjusted basis. We have a lot to be excited about in fiscal 2018, and we expect another record year with more solid growth in both operating earnings and EPS.","For fiscal 2017, total company adjusted return on sales was a record 8.5%. Adjusted operating income was also a record at $3.3 billion, representing a 15% increase compared to last year. This represents our fifth consecutive year of growth in operating income and return on sales. Our record adjusted EPS of $5.31 represents a 21% increase over $4.39 reported last year. Over a five-year period, our EPS compounded annual growth rate is over 22%, a measure few companies in the food space can claim.","Our operating cash flow was $2.6 billion, and we invested $1.1 billion in capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $427 million as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC. In addition to significant CapEx investments, we deployed our cash in fiscal 2017 by returning cash to shareholders by repurchasing over 10 million shares for more than $650 million. We paid down debt by more than $600 million since the AdvancePierre acquisition, and we increased our dividend in fiscal 2017 by 50% to an annual dividend rate of $0.90 per share.","And as announced in the 10-K filed this morning, our board increased the annual dividend rate for fiscal 2018 by $0.30 to an annual rate of $1.20 per share, representing an increase of 33%. Our fiscal 2017 effective tax rate was 32.3% and, on an adjusted basis, was 33.8%.","Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.4 times on a pro forma basis, including AdvancePierre results for a full 12 months. We are committed to investment-grade ratings, and with the strong cash flows we expect to generate organically along with divestiture proceeds, we expect to bring our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to around 2 times by Q3 of fiscal 2018. When we reach this goal, we plan to resume our share buybacks at a level similar to our repurchases prior to the AdvancePierre acquisition.","Including cash of $318 million, net debt was approximately $9.9 billion. Total liquidity was just over $1 billion. Net interest expense was $92 million during the fourth quarter and $272 million during fiscal 2017. For the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were 369 million. As announced earlier this year, we anticipate completing the sale of three non-protein businesses currently included in our Prepared Foods segment by the end of calendar 2017 or early calendar 2018. And we expect to use the proceeds to pay down debt.","The net carrying value of these businesses at the end of our fourth quarter was $803 million, and we expect to record a net pre-tax gain as a result of their sale. As noted in our press release issued this morning, these businesses' results are excluded from our fiscal 2018 outlook.","In addition, during our call at the end of September, we announced our Financial Fitness program, which is expected to contribute to the company's overall strategy of financial fitness through increased operational effectiveness and overhead reduction. Through a combination of synergies from the integration of AdvancePierre and additional cost optimization, the program is expected to result in net savings of $200 million in fiscal 2018; $400 million in fiscal 2019, including incremental net savings of $200 million; and $600 million in fiscal 2020, including incremental savings of another $200 million.","The majority of these savings, which are focused on supply chain, procurement and overhead improvements, are expected to be realized in the Prepared Foods and Chicken segments. As Tom said earlier, these savings will fall to the bottom line. In the fourth quarter, we incurred $150 million of restructuring and related charges as part of this program. See our 10-K for further disclosure regarding this program.","Now looking forward, here are some thoughts on fiscal 2018. We expect top line sales growth of around 7% to approximately $41 billion, which excludes the revenue of the three non-protein businesses held for sale. The expected increase is attributed to incremental AdvancePierre sales of $1.2 billion and increases in sales volumes at each of our segments. Net interest expense should approximate $325 million. We currently estimate our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 34.5%. CapEx is expected to approximate $1.4 billion, as we focus on capacity expansion and operational improvements that create long-term shareholder value.","Based on our average share price in Q4, we expect our average diluted shares to be around 369 million. We expect to generate a tremendous amount of cash in fiscal 2018 through strong operational execution and the proceeds expected from the sale of three non-protein businesses. Our balanced capital allocation priorities are governed by a disciplined focus on driving long-term shareholder value, as we plan to use our cash to reduce debt and grow our businesses organically through operational efficiency and capital expansion projects, along with investing in innovation and brand building. Also, we still have the flexibility to acquire businesses that support our strategic objectives, along with returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend, while maintaining plenty of liquidity and investment-grade credit ratings.","We have a tremendous amount of momentum going into fiscal 2018 as we come off a year of 21% EPS growth. Our first quarter in fiscal 2018 is off to a great start, which strengthens our confidence in achieving adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 10%, to a range of $5.70 to $5.85. In closing, we have laid the foundation for success. We have the right strategy and the right team to deliver growth.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Denise, we're ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And your first question will come from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Good morning.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, maybe first digging a little bit more into Prepared Foods in the quarter, and you called out in the prepared remarks a contract buyout that impacted the quarter. Any way to quantify that? And then just thinking about next year, can you provide some of the details in going from the 8.5% to the 11% to 12%, just bridging it between AdvancePierre, lapping some of the inefficiencies you've had on pepperoni side, maybe changes in brand spend and then in product innovation, et cetera?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Hey, Adam, it's Tom. So, as it relates to the charge, I'm not going to get into a lot of detail, was the right thing to do for us. We have contracts with suppliers that prohibit us from maximizing the internal consumption of materials that we produce ourselves through the Fresh Meats group. So, it was a pill that we wanted to swallow this past quarter to make sure that we're prepared for 2018, and it was the right thing to do.","So, let me try to give you some more information, so I can bridge the 2017 to 2018. Think about we printed $675 million for the year in Prepared Foods, the base sort of APF earnings less what we're going to be divesting is about $100 million, net. Incremental D&A, $55-ish million, $56 million. The Financial Fitness that is going to hit the segment will be about $100 million.","We are making improvements in the legacy business, so what you talked about in terms of pepperoni and other things. So price, I would say, and cost improvements, that should total about $150 million for the full year. So, if you roll those up, it's about a $970 million OI, which puts us in that 11% to 12% range, with sales being about $8.3 billion for the year.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, that's very helpful color. And then maybe, on similar lines in Chicken, as you think about the improving margin outlook for 2018, you obviously called out volume growth expectations. But on the cost side, I mean, you had some pretty significant investments on the ground (27:15) and freight expenses on the cost side, just any of the bigger variances on the Chicken outlook for 2018?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah, sure. So, Chicken will improve on the cost structure by about $150 million. There's the Tyson Production System that we talked about in the past, where it's taking Lean to the next step across the entire system, that'll contribute about $150 million. The APF chicken business, we don't talk about it a lot, but it is a decent-sized business, about $50 million in EBIT.","And Financial Fitness, as we talked about, about $90 million of this total cost takeout in Financial Fitness will hit the Chicken segment. And there's some volume-mix impact, but the total gets us to about $1.4 billion for the Chicken segment.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Great. That's all very helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. And, Dennis, congrats on your pending retirement. If any CFO started his tenure with trial by fire, it was you in 2008, we remember.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Thanks Ken, appreciate it.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just curious for you, or whoever it's appropriate, Tyson's highlighting a few new tailwinds today for fiscal 2018. You're guiding now to over $200 million in synergies and savings, versus the prior $200 million. You see around $100 million less in feed costs than you did the last time you guided.","And I think, if I'm right, your EBIT guidance for the other segment is about $30 million better than last time, but you're not raising total EPS guidance, you're just maintaining it. So, what I'm really trying to get is a sense of whether this means you're just being conservative on EPS, given that it's very early in the year, or if there are maybe some tangible incremental headwinds, I guess, we should be thinking about, too?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Ken, I'll start, and then maybe Dennis can chime in here. And absolutely I agree with you that Dennis did enter the equation in a trial by fire, just done a nice job. So, yeah, it was certainly early in the year. I mean, we're just out of the box, Q1 looks good, but we have to sort of stay where we are. Absolutely, things look good. We continue to say that absent a shock to the system, we're going to be in a nice position for 2018.","And we also just want to make sure that we emphasize, we are in a growth mode. So, we're going to continue to invest and make sure that we're doing the right things for growth. But the objective is consistent, predictable, sustainable growth, top line and bottom line. So, we're not going to be getting out ahead of ourselves. And certainly, we're making investments, right? We're making investments in CapEx and we guide to that. The year looks good.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","The only thing I would add, Ken, is remember, our Q2 which ends in March is always very erratic with weather patterns and order patterns, never the same from year-to-year. So, that's why we always start out pretty measured in our approach.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you for that. Okay. And then a quick follow-up, you said that 1Q is off to a very good start. I'm paraphrasing a little bit there. But a couple of things we've noticed. And you guys talked about the Pork business and the industry margins have been weaker, you said that's in line with your guidance, but it's still weaker than it was sequentially. And Beef margins for the industry have weakened as well.","And I know, again, it may not be the same for you. But you've also seen some chicken prices drop. Now, again, you may get the offset with boneless skinless. But in general, I would have thought 1Q would have been a little, not weak at all, but maybe you wouldn't have been quite as bullish on it as what we're seeing, so I'm just trying to get a sense as we dig into the quarter, what you're seeing so far in the first half of the quarter that's been going so well, perhaps?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah. So, Ken, what's happening with Pork is just about what we expected, so that's in our guidance, right? I mean, that's \u2013 yes, things are compressing a little bit, but we had expected that and that's in our full guidance. So, new players are coming in the market, the pie gets cut up a little bit differently based on trying to find that supply of hogs. But like I said, again, all the assumptions were built into our annual outlook of greater than 9%.","What I'd say is this happens the same way every time a new entrant comes into the market, and it's done this for decades. So, being an established processor like ourselves, we like where we are, especially given the team that we have. We'll work our way through it. But on Pork, I would say that it's playing out as we expected and then built into our guidance. And our Chicken margins, I went through the bridge right for the full year, so I think maybe that speaks for itself. But if there's anything that we haven't been clear on, certainly let me know. And Prepared's made the balance that we anticipated, and we're pleased with that.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from Heather Jones of the Vertical Group. Please go ahead.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Good morning.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Good morning.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","And, Dennis, congratulations on your retirement.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Thanks, Heather.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Both my questions are pertaining to Chicken. So, first, for 2018, so you're guiding to 3% volume growth. It seems like about two-thirds of that is AdvancePierre's. And so I was wondering, is the remainder of that, should that be in your value-added segment, given the capacity that you've added there?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah, Heather. It's about half-and-half. So, half is AdvancePierre, and about half is just organic chicken growth and that is through the value-added, as you described.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Okay. And then I wanted to talk about like how you're positioned, how your Chicken business is positioned. So, when we're looking at \u2013 it's a longer-term question, but as we're looking at over the next two, three, four years, the industry is looking at increased supply, including you guys adding a plant.","But given the relative position of Tyson, how you are net short in some key items, and as you have a larger-than-average value-added business, I was wondering, is it reasonable for us to assume that your relative performance should improve over the next few years as we see that capacity grow. But you guys grow more into value-added, and you would assume that some of these inputs could come under some price pressure. Just wondering if you could speak to that. And is that a reasonable way to be thinking about this?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","It is a reasonable way to be thinking about it. What we're playing for is long-term shareholder value creation. So, as it relates to the chicken supply growth, we're squarely focused on what do we need. The USDA estimates about a 2% growth, and that's in line with consumer demand, I'd say, roughly. Our demand has been outstanding and outpacing.","So, as it relates to serving what we need, we're not going to change our approach. We're going to keep supply short of demand. But because of that demand strength, that's why we're adding on to the plant that we talked about in Tennessee, and it's why we're building another plant. We just want to continue the approach to be net short, but we are focused on value business.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thank you for the question. And, Dennis, congratulations on your retirement.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Thanks, Rob.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","You're welcome. AdvancePierre, my recollection, it's a very complicated business, especially in foodservice. It seems that their strategy was to do all things for all customers. So, I wanted to know, as you're integrating the sales forces of your business and AdvancePierre's, how have you managed to hold on to your customers and communicate to them, what product lines you're continuing to make, maybe you're going to discontinue others? How have you executed in that regard?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah. Sure, Rob. I'd say, what AdvancePierre did really well and continues to do well, is two things. One, they handle complexity very effectively, so they know how to make money and continue to meet the customers' demands. And the second thing is, they taught us how we can be really efficient and, at the same time, focusing on, I would say, the consumer branded business as an area to make money. So, that complexity is something that they're getting paid for, and that will be the expectation that we would always have. But I'd say, they have done a really nice job of managing that complexity.","As it relates to combining the efforts, our selling group has really done a nice job pulling things together. AdvancePierre is very heavily vested in the C-Store space, which was highly attractive to us. Since we combined efforts in Tyson and Hillshire, we've grown more than 75% in the last three years. Not a huge base business, but it's in the hundreds of millions of dollars range and it's a great example of one plus one equals three. We're going to take that to a new level with APF. They have a completely focused effort to make sure the integration is going to go seamlessly and really, really like how we've started the integration. Our customers are giving us positive feedback about that, in addition to the other segments that we serve through the business.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. So, your customers are giving you positive feedback. You haven't lost any business or anything like that?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","No. I mean, there's always a little bit here and there that may come and go. But on balance, we are gaining new business, so that's correct.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from Jeremy Scott of Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Scott - Mizuho Securities","Hey, good morning. And, Dennis, it's been a pleasure and congrats on the retirement.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Thanks, Jeremy.","Jeremy Scott - Mizuho Securities","Just a couple questions on the Pork and a follow-up here. Just when you say the pork capacity impact was anticipated in your guidance, what does that mean exactly? When do you expect to see the markets settle? And on the 9% plus, how does that flow front half versus back half? Do you expect to close the year above 9% or under 9%? Just maybe a little color on how that trends over the course of the fiscal year.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah. So, last year or maybe two calls ago, we talked about our front half, back half sort of discussion. That's important for us because we continue to be focused on, there are some things that can flip between quarters. It's an annual outlook. And when we say that it's playing out as we had expected, demand is so strong, I would say export demand is really strong. And we're seeing that, that compression is about what we thought. So, I don't know what more I can say to that, Jeremy, but other than like I said before, this is something that we've seen this play. It's not the first time this has happened. And, yes, there'll be a little bit of choppiness, but we feel like we'll level out to the right place. And what we're guiding to is what we think will happen.","Jeremy Scott - Mizuho Securities","Okay. And then just going through your 10-K you recently filed, so it seems strong growth in utilization rates for Beef and Pork, but a bit surprise that your capacity utilization didn't nudge you back up in Chicken. And so, how do you reconcile that with your commentary that you're hitting your ceiling on your tray pack operations? And are there underperforming plants that you're simultaneously ramping down and as you grow your mix of breast meat purchases in the year? Just walk us through maybe some of the puts and takes as to why that rate didn't nudge back up.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah. It's a buy versus grow strategy that we have. So, I think that we'll continue to play. It works to our advantage, particularly when breast meat is very low. So, that's how we play that continuously.","Jeremy Scott - Mizuho Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from Akshay Jagdale of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. And, Dennis, congratulations on your retirement.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Morning. Thank you.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","So, I wanted to ask about Chicken. How should we think about the margins? Like, when we think about overall shocks to the system, which you talked about, on the one hand, you have the grain shock, right? And on the other hand, you have any volatility in chicken commodity prices. And it seems like you've already proven out that commodity swings can be absorbed without any volatility in your margins.","So, can you just talk through the commodity chicken price swings, and how if at all, it has any impact on your margins outlook, because there is a view that potentially commodity chicken prices might be weak next year? So, in that environment, will you still be able to produce 11% margin is really the question. Thanks.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah. First, Akshay, I have to say, as everybody else has been congratulating Dennis, he's got to be here through April and so you'll hear from him again on next quarter's call. But, yeah, so the Chicken margins, like we said, we believe to be around 11%. And we expect our business to grow, especially in value-added frozen and 3% overall. We do believe that we're expecting similar feed environments. We're looking at the forward curve at this point, it seems like it's going to be benign.","So, as it relates to commodity breast meat or cheaper products, we're heavily weighted towards further processed breast meat sales. So, we tend to make more money in low commodity breast meat markets rather than high ones. We've done a nice job, as you know, diversifying our price type. So, we don't tend to be as volatile. There's some obvious economic benefit between the pure spread and buy versus grow. But the long-term value is generated by selling all the parts that we have to find a home floor (41:52), so as it relates to the commodity markets being low, that's something we see, frankly, as an opportunity.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Perfect. And one on Prepared Foods, if I can. There's been a lot of choppiness, right, quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year in a way. So, I'm really focused on the cadence of the margin and the top line delivery, especially as you sell these non-core assets. So, can you talk a little bit more about maybe, one, first quarter, if we should be expecting Prepared Foods margins to inflect back to the annual number in the first quarter? Just try to make sure expectations are in the right place short term. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Welcome. Prepared Foods is off to a good start. So, that's all I'll say, how we're going to finish the quarter. What I would say is our innovation efforts are really kicking in and paying back. I've talked in my prepared remarks about how our future innovation is scoring. And I think it's going to put us in a position where you have \u2013 not just on Prepared by the way, also on Chicken \u2013 some really strong results. We're in the right categories, we're in the right part of the store.","So, in the Prepared business, one of the things we're also certainly benefiting from is the perimeter. Certainly, there's a lot of growth there. But also, the center store, if you include frozen, frozen is growing for us in the center stores. Certainly, I know that shelf stable's having some challenges, but the frozen section is growing well. And that's heavily indexed towards Prepared. Certainly synergy capture, everything that you already know about. In terms of how it flows and the cadence, I won't give you any thoughts on that. I'd just ask you to focus on the year-end and the fact that I told you \u2013 Dennis told you that the first quarter has started really well.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. I'll pass it on.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. I just wanted to circle back a little bit more to the Pork side of the business. If you could talk a little bit about what you're doing to make sure you have enough supply procured and also your expectations for, if you think some of the new facilities are eventually going to go double shift, or how much the labor situation may or may not allow those new facilities to go double shift?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","We don't \u2013 what I'll say, Michael, is, we don't have any problem getting the hogs that we need. We're in a pretty good situation there. So, I don't know what else to say other than, the outlook includes anything that is going to happen in the Pork business. We don't find any challenges as it relates to getting what we need and, as you know, it's a spread business.","So, certainly, exports are going to continue to be supportive, and we are a big player in exports, so we like that. So, the fact that the business is doing \u2013 going through a margin compression right now, we thoroughly thought about that, analyzed it, and it's where we wound up with our guidance.","The other thing I'll say is, we are seeing some growth in NAE pork, still a really small percentage of our business, I talked about it in my prepared remarks. But we have access to the hogs if we have demand, and we're seeing demand increasing. So, that's something that is also a small, but supportive piece of our equation as it relates to margin.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Hey, Michael, we typically don't like to speculate on our competition. That's just \u2013 it's a fruitless exercise, in our opinion.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. I guess, in general, though, I mean, you guys had talked about raising wages. Maybe you could give us a little more color in terms of kind of the competitive environment, and what type of wage or cost inflation we should expect kind of going forward there?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah. Again, it's in the outlook, but I would say we have increased wages, and we started doing that about a year ago. And it's to make sure that our turnover rates are lower. We achieved lower turnover. It's been successful. We've done a nice job, I think, in all of our plants, not just on Pork, but also Beef and Prepared Foods and Chicken. And we are also doing things to make sure that we're running well within control; to the extent that we need to modify our line speeds, we're doing that. And so again, everything is in our guidance, but we have increased wages at our plants.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Benjamin M. Theurer - Barclays Capital Casa de Bolsa SA de CV","Hi. Good morning, gentlemen, and well, congratulations on the results. I just want to go back on the Prepared Foods business and your outlook into 2018. And obviously, in the fourth quarter, you had a couple of one-time charges. You had the impairment, the $45 million, the $82 million from restructuring. There was another part on the restructuring booked into Chicken.","So, if I do the math and I'll actually adjust for that, I end up with a margin that's closer to like 13% for the quarter. So, I just want to understand, with your guidance into 2018 and the outlook, 11% to 12% margin, that would be a notch below my adjusted thoughts around the fourth quarter. So, could you elaborate a little bit if there are any additional charges, restructuring-wise, et cetera, that we should take into consideration to get to that 11%, 12% margin in 2018? Thanks.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah, Ben, so nothing else that's not disclosed in the 10-K. What I'd say as it relates to more the longer-term potential for Prepared Foods margins. I've said before, we'll say again, we expect 12% to 14% is certainly within the horizon. Again, innovation is a big key to that, continuing to get the synergy capture, frankly, over-delivering to the extent that we can know we have a very diversified business. And we have a business that is very focused on making sure we're growing, both with customers and through consumer relevance, on innovation. But also the customer sees us as a partner. So, we are a category captain in Prepared Foods almost everywhere. I mean, everywhere that we would want to be, I'd say.","And we are balancing our approach with customer brands. There are certain categories that make sense for us to be focused with our customers on driving their growth, regardless of whether or not it's our brand, and we're going to make high margins on those businesses as well. So, I don't know if that scratches the itch for you, but I would say that longer term, we see those margins in that 12% to 14% range at some point in time.","Benjamin M. Theurer - Barclays Capital Casa de Bolsa SA de CV","Okay, perfect. Thanks. And then just one follow-up on Beef, I mean, clearly, the 6% full year margin was significantly better than what everybody would, I guess, expected. And now your outlook into 2018, again just above 5%, so is that going to be significantly above 5%? Or do you actually expect margins to slightly contract compared to 2017, considering that livestock supply and so on looks pretty favorable, and actually even more favorable into 2018 than it looked into 2017?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","It does, use 5% as the number, that's where we're guiding towards, so I wouldn't run away with that. What we're seeing is certainly more cattle next year, we are in the right locations, we like where we're located. And certainly, placement levels show a lot of cattle on feed. So, supplies are growing in our regions. That is why we're bullish, no pun intended. But the idea of us being properly positioned in the right regions, I'd say, is what you should focus on. And 5% is the number you should model.","Benjamin M. Theurer - Barclays Capital Casa de Bolsa SA de CV","Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from David Carlson of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","David Carlson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, thank you very much. Tom, my question relates to the Beef segment. Obviously, some very strong results during the quarter. I think you called out increased export activity in the press release.","With China recently lifting the ban on trade with the U.S., I was hoping you might be able to frame up the opportunity as it relates to export activity longer term. And also, especially given the experience the incoming CFO has with international, I guess as you look at it today, how long can export activity serve as a tailwind for the company?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah, we think it could be a multi-year phenomenon. And we like where we're positioned as a country, frankly, and certainly where Tyson Foods is positioned. We were the first company to ship beef to China after the resumption of trade, and we have a huge market share already in that market. Our brand, ibp, is actually a very well recognized brand in China. And this is great for a number of reasons, but the primary reason that we think about is that it creates domestic disappearance. So, for us, anything that is in support of exports is really helpful.","Having access to that market allows us to be in a position to have the meat cleared at a better price. There's no question. And our original assumptions on what we're including in our guidance, we are expecting strong export trade continuing. What I'd say is global supplies are relatively flat, right, and coupled with strong demand for protein overall, then it really makes a nice environment for us. And, yes, I'm fully counting on Stewart bringing his full value on international with him.","David Carlson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you, guys.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","And the next question will come from Farha Aslam of Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Hey, Farha.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Dennis, congratulations. You're leaving the balance sheet in a fortress whereas you inherited it at a challenging time.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Thanks. You're right.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Stewart is smiling ear to ear.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","It's a great balance sheet.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","My question really focuses on your NAE efforts. Could you talk about what percentage of that Chicken business is now NAE? Kind of the margin benefit you're getting from NAE, and how much additional cost do you incur by producing NAE?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah. So, Farha, certainly, the benefits are economic, but also consumer preference. I would say, to the extent that we didn't move to NAE, we'd be having a very different conversation. The consumer does expect it, and by the way, the customer expects it. So, gatekeepers within the customer are asking continuously to be NAE and so for us, we're fully NAE now, and we're actually buying meat on the outside that's NAE. So, in terms of the economics, what I would say is the cost, a little bit more on the upfront, and we've been able to swallow that cost and then remove that cost.","And I think we're in a great position today, very few of our flocks are actually treated. And so we feel like it's a competitive advantage today, whether or not it'll be for long term, who knows, but that has been a key to our growth. We feel like so far \u2013 so, I'd say the latter part of 2017, but also moving into what we've guided for 2018, which is the total (53:47) 3% which doesn't sound like a huge number, but in our business it's meaningful.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. And then, Dennis, perhaps, you could give us just some more color on that $90 million that you expect in Financial Fitness in Chicken and $100 million in Prepared Foods. Could you break it down a little bit more and kind of share with us where that $90 million roughly will come from and where the $100 million will roughly come from?","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Well, in both cases, it's going to be coming from the overhead reductions, supply chain efficiencies and procurement, are the largest categories. And so given that they both use largely the same distribution system, it's natural that they would largely both get the benefit of those synergies.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And the procurement really stems from that buyout of the contract. And I just want to make sure that internal sourcing contract buyout didn't cause this extraordinary, but rather folded them into fourth quarter earnings?","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","To be clear, the procurement \u2013 the raw material buyout was, it was in Q4, but is not a major component of the procurement savings. Think in the procurement savings, leveraging Tyson's scale with billions of pounds at some rate that's more efficient than it was at AdvancePierre.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That is helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from John Colantuoni of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","John Colantuoni - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Good morning.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Hi, John.","John Colantuoni - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. It's been about six months since Tyson completed the acquisition of AdvancePierre. Can you just walk us through some of your learnings and any practices from the company you've adopted since?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Absolutely. Let me talk about three things. One is, we talked about a few times on this call, but it's the focus on customer growth. And we, as Tyson, prior to AdvancePierre, very focused on customer growth. But I would say, AdvancePierre cranks that up a notch. They really are focused on making sure the customer gets what they need as it relates to branded products or customer brands.","Second thing I'd say is the level of accountability that the team has across the organization. We were highly accountable at Tyson. I would say, they are extremely focused on removing non-value-added costs, so things that aren't valued by the customer; and having a disciplined approach to looking at it on a weekly basis where are we running (56:36) yellow. And so we are adopting that across the system. There's some ideas that they brought to the table that, I think, are very, very exciting.","And the third is just the channel, channels that they played in predominantly in convenience stores provide us some great benefits, enthusiasm about what the program together can offer overall to customers because that is a space that is growing. And also, I would kind of throw in the retail perimeter, the products that are served either ready-to-heat or ready-to-eat. They have done a very, very nice job. So, those three things I'd point to that there's a lot of other learnings we spent a lot of time talking about it, but I'd highlight those three.","John Colantuoni - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. And in the past, you've mentioned considering raising your normalized targets for Beef and Prepared Foods, maybe even at some point Chicken. Is this something we should still expect you to update us on in the second half?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","We will update you, like I said last quarter, and give you our then current thinking. And we believe that we continue to execute taking costs out or holding costs flat, while we're growing the business we will leverage the model for expanding margins. So, absolutely, we'll talk about it again, and you should expect us to be back to you with a receipt (58:02) on that.","John Colantuoni - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great, thanks.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The final question today will come from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning everyone.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Hey, Ken.","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Dennis, congratulations, and we appreciate all your help through the years. And best of luck for sure.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Thanks, Ken.","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Tom, can I ask just two questions? One is, just to be clear, on 2018, you haven't even reported your first quarter, and you gave initial guidance a month or so ago. Is your confidence higher or lower relative to that month ago and why?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You always ask that question. It's difficult for me to say that how much confidence you should take from this other than we're very confident, and that's reflected in the outlook. We have a great year ahead of us. We're continuing to grow where we want to grow value-added versus commodities, certainly, in Chicken and Prepared Foods. We talked about the Core 9 results and our Focus 5 foodservice. The balanced portfolio in terms of the customer channels is a big deal. So, we like the traction we're getting at those customers that where we're serving the perimeter of the store and convenience.","And yeah, I don't know how to quantify, Ken, because we have guidance other than to say that I am extremely enthusiastic about everything that I'm seeing, and I think the team would chime and say the same thing. Chicken should benefit from the move to NAE. We do also, by the way, have an organic offering. Certainly, Prepared Foods is well positioned. I would say one other thing is maybe it's on the Financial Fitness, we had to lose some weight. So, that's the reason why we call it Financial Fitness. We had some weight to lose out of the box and we have to have process discipline to keep the weight off. And that's making us really confident about how we can continue to have great cost structure as we grow, as I mentioned a moment ago. So, sure, overall, I'd say very optimistic.","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And my second question is, is can you give us concrete synergy examples of what you're actually doing? Are you moving product in-house to make the sandwiches yet? Are you doing more like actual concrete anecdotes that kind of show the progress, not just high level, but like \u2013 of a couple examples of what you're actually doing on the synergy level. Are you automating the chicken process yet? What are you doing physically and concretely?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","So, I'll say two things. First is that I can't name names. As you can well imagine, that's not fair to suppliers. But we have negotiated cost out of our suppliers, right, and not small amounts, large amounts. That's number one. Number two is we are being able to look at where do we make products the least cost and maximize those plants first and so that is underway, and it's certainly something that will continue as well as there will be probably \u2013 not probably, there will be some plant rationalization at some point in the future.","The other thing is just the pricing side \u2013 it was not a cost takeout, the pricing side of things is I think there's a lot of proper focus on that. Where do we need to make sure we're taking the discipline that AdvancePierre had on pricing? And maybe the final thing on cost is as we look at our products and how they are made, we are seeing some things that AdvancePierre did that was extraordinary in terms of making sure that we're flexible on formulas, sort of utilize the raw materials that are the best for us at that point in time, given the costs, without sacrificing and in some cases, increasing the quality. So, that's a big deal, and we're seeing a lot of savings from that already that we have implied into our forecast. We're excited about that, so hopefully those will help.","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's great. Thank you very much.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to Tom Hayes for any closing remarks.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Excellent. Thank you all for the great questions. I really appreciate it. And before I go, I do want to say to Dennis and Stewart, we are both looking to you \u2013 I'm looking to you to have a great transition. I know that as we transition from one superstar to the next, it's going to be seamless. And it's very exciting.","So, also, as I've been prone to say in the last couple of quarters here, I'd like to thank the Tyson team members that are listening to the call because they are on the call and we had another record year, which is really, really good and we're all very excited about that. But I already have seen tremendous amount of work that is focused on delivering another record in 2018.","And so I appreciate in advance all the work that everybody's doing, so thank you. And then, because we're not going to talk to you between here and the end of the year, hopefully, everybody has a safe and happy holiday season. And so we're going to be kicking into holiday season shipments, which is great, but I would like to say happy holidays to everybody and certainly, please stay safe.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Jon Kathol, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.","Jon Kathol","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Tyson Foods' conference call for the third quarter of our 2012 fiscal year.","I need to remind you that some of the things we'll talk about today will include forward-looking statements. Those statements are based on our view of the world as we know it now, which could change. I encourage you to look at today's press release for a discussion of the risks that can affect our business.","On today's call is Donnie Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Lochner, Chief Operating Officer; and Dennis Leatherby, Chief Financial Officer. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Donnie Smith.","Donnie Smith","Thanks, Jon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Earnings for our fiscal third quarter were $0.21 a share, compared to $0.51 in Q3 of last year. Now keep in mind, earnings were impacted by $167 million or $0.29 a share for the early extinguishment of the 2014 notes. Adjusted EPS was $0.50 for the quarter.","I'm very pleased we were able to pay off that debt early, which strengthened an already strong balance sheet, lowered our interest expense in upcoming quarters and helped us get back to investment grade with all 3 rating agencies. This was an important milestone for our team, and I'm proud of them for accomplishing this goal.","Sales rose slightly to $8.3 billion, compared to $8.2 billion in Q3 of '11. For the quarter, Chicken sales were up 3.6%, in large part due to an 8% increase in pricing. Even though Beef pricing was up over 15% versus a year ago, sales dollars were down slightly due to a 14% decrease in volume. Both Pork and Prepared Foods sales were down by about 4.5% to 5%, driven largely by softer pricing, although let me hasten on to add that year-to-date, our pricing is higher in all segments, driving sales growth of 4.4% across the entire portfolio.","Operating income for the quarter was $336 million compared to $312 million in the same quarter last year.","","The Prepared Foods segment was above its normalized range, with a 6.2% operating margin. The Chicken segment was within its range at 5.3%. Our international Chicken operations faced significant headwinds in Q3, including start-up issues in China and Brazil. Excluding these start-up-related losses, our Chicken segment had a 6.7% return on sales.","The Pork segment came in just below its range for the first time in 10 quarters, with a 5.1% return on sales. Beef was just under its range, with a 2% return. Considering the challenges Beef and Pork faced in the third quarter, I'm pleased they were able to produce as well as they did.","And due to those challenges, along with softer demand and economic conditions, earnings for the year will come in lower than we'd previously projected. But I'll hurry on to say that 2012 will still be a strong year and fourth quarter earnings should be within the range of results reported in the first 3 quarters.","That's why we have this strategy in the business model we have: to manage through volatility. We have a few businesses that are having record years, and all of our businesses have plans in place to deal with the headwinds that we know are coming.","Looking into 2013, we believe it's prudent to enter the year with plans to pull back some on our CapEx and be a little conservative with our cash in order to keep a good supply of dry powder. That's not to say we won't buy back stock or we won't make an opportunistic acquisition. We just want to be prudent in how we handle our cash. We worked hard to get our balance sheet back in order and to get back to investment-grade ratings, and we don't want to jeopardize that.","Our pledge to grow prepared foods, value-added poultry and international are the best hedge against volatility. Providing value and getting paid for the value we create for our customers by being their go-to supplier is the key to stability and long-term growth.","Now moving on to the macro environment. After 4 months of moderate decline, consumer confidence was up in July, according to the Conference Board Consumer Research Center. Unemployment, however, was virtually unchanged, which weighs on the pace of economic recovery.","In the retail channel, according to the Perishable Group, for the 13-week period ended June 30, overall fresh sales -- overall sales of fresh meat were down 3.3% in volume versus the same period a year ago, driven by a 0.6% increase in price. Beef and pork volume were down 7% and 1.7%, respectively. Chicken was the only category that saw pounds sold increase versus a year ago, but the increase was very slight at 0.2% and demand feels sluggish to us.","The USDA forecast food prices will continue to rise in 2013, led by meat, eggs and dairy, as a result of the drought. Beef prices are expected to be up 4% to 5%; pork, up 2.5% to 3.5%; and poultry, up 3% to 4%.","In the foodservice channel, Technomic revised its 2012-2013 forecast upward to 1.7% real annual growth, up 1.1% from its previous forecast. The National Restaurant Association's Performance Index was stable for June. And while we still feel sluggish demand in foodservice and the outlook is far from robust, these indexes might indicate that perhaps the worst is over.","The NPD Group's consensus of commercial restaurant locations finds that numbers of both independent and chain restaurants have risen, with independents finally showing a slight increase for the first time since 2009, another hopeful sign.","There are specific high-growth opportunities in an overall low-growth market. According to Mantell, chicken-focused concepts have done well through the post-recession economy. And despite the heavy presence of discounting, many chains have been focusing on premium menu items like bacon and steak and will most likely continue to do so. Premium meats on burgers, chicken sandwiches and salads, and other items are helping operators increase menu prices with an enhanced value perception.","That concludes my remarks, and now Jim will give you the specifics around our segments, followed by Dennis with the financial report. And after that, we'll try to get into more detail with your questions.","James V. Lochner","Thanks, Donnie, and good morning, everyone.","With $47 million in operating income and a 6.2% return on sales in the fiscal third quarter, the Prepared Foods segment performed above its normalized operating range of 4% to 6%. I'm pleased with the continued improvement, and I see real opportunity for this segment. Prepared Foods is a key part of our company's overall growth strategy, and we are actively seeking ways to expand this business into other categories and grow existing categories in 2013 and beyond.","The Chicken segment posted $153 million in operating income and a 5.3% return on sales for the quarter, which is within the normalized range of 5% to 7%. We were able to offset the slightly higher grain cost in the quarter through price and mix improvement.","In China, our Chicken operations were negatively impacted by start-up challenges, compounded by economic and market issues. While we were pleased with the performance of our new company-owned farms, at this point, they represent less than 20% of the birds we process weekly.","We are building new biosecurity-controlled broiler farms and plan to phase out the use of uncontrolled market birds over the next 2 years. This will allow us to value up into a premium mix of branded, fresh retail trade packs and foodservice sales. But in the interim, we will have some dependency on market birds and wholesale market conditions.","In addition to normal start-up issues, our Brazilian Chicken operations saw significant market deterioration in the fiscal third quarter, stemming from a very soft market for boneless leg meat in Japan. We're in the process of bringing out second shifts at 2 of our plants, which should improve our cost structure. We will continue increasing value-added capabilities to move beyond dependency on commodity export and domestic wholesale markets.","To help you understand our expectations for the level and pace of our international expansion, I'll give you the numbers around our plans for growth over the next 2 years. In China, we currently produce about 2 million birds per week and plan to reach 3 million a week in 2014. In Brazil, we're at a 1.3 million birds, with plans for 2 million. In India, we'll grow from 280,000 to 450,000. And in Mexico, we intend to maintain production at around 2.7 million birds per week.","Turning back to domestic chicken, obviously, because of the drought, we expect grain cost -- higher grain cost in 2013. Over the past couple of years, we have substantially reduced the number of fixed-price contracts we have with customers and currently have less than 15% of our poultry volume in annual fixed-price contracts.","The vast majority of our contracts are tied to specific markets or allow for conversations above adjusting prices to move prices to offset higher inputs. And we will continue to push for even more of these types of contracts. I believe the supply will begin to rationalize as well, making it easier for us to have those pricing conversations.","The capital investments and operational improvements we've made in recent years have put us in good position to handle higher inputs through efficiencies. Based on current grain futures, we believe our Chicken segment will remain profitable in 2013.","In our Pork segment, we produced $69 million in operating income and a 5.1% return on sales, which is below the normalized range of 6% to 8%. Unfortunately, supply and demand got out of balance, but it wasn't due to a shortage of hogs, as some may think. Increased domestic availability partially due to heavier hogs, along with pricing pressure, caused the industry to get out of balance. In fact, our [ph] margins were compressed more than prior quarters.","Our Pork margins are starting to come back to normalized levels now. Supply of hogs should be 1% to 2% higher in the first 3 quarters of fiscal '13, and we do not see any material demand shifts on the horizon that would be detrimental to our Pork segment's performance next fiscal year.","Moving on to the Beef segment, we had $71 million in operating income and a 2% return on sales in the third quarter. This was just below our normalized range of 2.5% to 4.5%. Considering how difficult the month of April was for us, I'm pleased we were able to make up so much ground in May and June. And I'll go on to add that we focused on maximizing revenue through price and mix to enhance margins, not market share.","Looking to cattle supply into 2012, the calf crop was down, as expected, which will impact the late calendar 2013 and calendar 2014 fed beef supplies. Based on the last inventory report, we currently aren't seeing any definitive signs of heifer retention. Additionally, more feeder cattle were imported into the country than anticipated in the past 6 months to partially offset last year's reduced calf crop. We expect close to the same supplies for the rest of fiscal '12 and into the first half of fiscal 2013 that we experienced this year.","Similar to last year, feeder cattle are coming into feedlots earlier as a reaction to the drought. We do see a supply drop-off in the back half of '13 as a result of the lower 2012 calf crop, and slaughter capacity will likely adjust to lower volumes.","I will remind you that Tyson beef plants are located in traditionally cost-effective cattle-feeding areas, and we expect to have adequate supplies to run our plants at a profitable level. We believe the Beef segment will remain profitable in fiscal 2013 but will have challenges similar to what we experienced in 2012.","In conclusion, I'll say that we are proud of the operational and sales improvements our business units have delivered over the last couple of years. This has positioned us well to deal with the increased feed cost in the Chicken segment. We have a strong balance sheet, a diversified protein product portfolio, and we've been investing in our plants to make them extremely efficient with mix improvements. So we're in very good shape to get through the near-term challenges ahead.","With that, Dennis?","Dennis Leatherby","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Donnie mentioned in his remarks, we reported Q3 earnings of $0.21 per share, or $0.50 per share after adjusting for a charge of $167 million, or $0.29 per share, related to the extinguishment of our 2014 notes, which I will address in a moment.","Return on invested capital for the last 12 months was 14.7%. Capital expenditures were $186 million for the quarter and totaled $530 million through 3 quarters of fiscal 2012. We've continued to invest in numerous capital projects for both our domestic and foreign operations that will result in improved productive capabilities and drive labor efficiencies, improve yields and sales mix.","Our operating cash flow through the 3 quarters of fiscal 2012 remains strong at $719 million. Including cash of more than $800 million, net debt was $1.6 billion. Total liquidity was $1.8 billion, well above our targeted range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion.","Gross debt increased to $2.5 billion. The increase in gross debt was due to a successful 4.5% $1-billion note offering, which we then used the note proceeds to extinguish our 10.5% 2014 notes. We were able to tender and purchase $790 million of the $810 million principal on the 2014 notes prior to June 30.","Subsequent to the settlement of the tender offer, we called for redemption of the remaining $20 million, and we can now say the high-yield 2014 notes are fully extinguished. As a result, we incurred a charge of $167 million during the third quarter related to this early extinguishment. Going forward, this refinancing will reduce our annualized interest expense approximately $55 million, which equates to about $0.09 per share.","At the same time as we issued the new bonds, we also received an upgrade from Moody's, which means we are now back to investment grade with all 3 rating agencies. Personally, it feels really good to have a debt maturity profile and interest costs that are reflective of being an investment-grade company again.","Gross debt to EBITDA for the last 12 months was 1.6x. On a net debt to EBITDA basis, this measure was 1x.","During the third quarter, we acquired 3.9 million shares for $75 million under our share repurchase program. Since reactivating this program in 2011, we have repurchased 19 million shares for $350 million, representing a reduction of about 5% of our outstanding shares.","At this time, we believe it is prudent for us to reduce our share repurchases under this program until we get better visibility into our working capital needs. Returning to investment grade was very important to us, and we are going to be disciplined concerning our balance sheet, which we believe to be a source of competitive advantage.","Our average diluted shares outstanding for the third quarter was 369 million. This reflects the dilutive share effect totaling 5 million for options and 3 million for convertible bonds, which will fluctuate depending on our stock price performance.","Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 42.4% or 37.9% without the charge related to the early extinguishment of the 2014 notes.","Now here's an update on the outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2012 and a few items pertaining to fiscal 2013.","Revenues for fiscal 2012 are expected to approximate $33 billion, down $1 billion, as previously estimated, due to weakened domestic protein demand. Revenues for fiscal 2013 are expected to approximate $35 billion, mostly resulting from price increases associated with increased raw material costs and expected decreases in overall domestic availability of protein.","We expect 2012 net interest expense to be approximately $340 million, including the $167-million charge related to the early extinguishment of the 2014 notes. For fiscal 2013, we expect net interest expense to be in the $130-million to $140-million range.","The effective tax rate for fiscal '12 should be around 37%.","CapEx should be around $700 million. Although down from our previous estimate, the anticipated projects are moving along but will not be completed in fiscal 2012. This amount still well exceeds our depreciation and amortization levels.","Our preliminary capital expenditures plan for fiscal 2013 is in the $500-million to $550-million range, down from fiscal 2012 until we have better visibility into our working capital needs. However, as with share repurchases, if forecasted conditions change, we may increase our planned capital expenditures.","In closing, we are pleased with our Q3 results and are confident in our ability to end fiscal 2012 with another strong quarter, despite the ongoing challenges with soft protein domestic demand and high grain prices that appear to be in place for the foreseeable future. The moves we have made to strengthen our balance sheet over the past few years and recent capital restructuring will allow us to face those challenges head on and continue executing our strategy as we head into fiscal 2013.","This concludes our prepared remarks, and I'll ask Wendy to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Heather Jones with BB&T Capital Markets.","Heather L. Jones - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","First question is on your poultry business. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what your poultry profitability looks like if you take today's spot grain and market prices, as well as what you think it will look like in the September-October time frame if we get the typical seasonal decline in chicken prices.","Donnie Smith","Okay. So, Heather, let me make sure I've got the question right. So you are asking, what if our cost of goods were to immediately reflect the cost of what spot ingredient purchases would cost and there was no impact on revenue, right?","Heather L. Jones - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Yes.","Donnie Smith","Okay. So first of all, let me say we don't have that scenario. Our grain group has done a good job, and they've got us coverage out a couple of months in front of us well below the market. So this scenario is purely hypothetical, but let's think about it. At current values, spot corn is probably going to deliver something like $9 a bushel. Meal, you're probably going to be something like 5 50 delivered. So that's probably going to count to a live cost in the low 50s. Let's call that, say, $0.52 a pound. So today, our live cost is probably just a tick under $0.45 a pound, so our live cost would go up immediately $0.07 a pound. Now yielded, that's probably going to be like $0.10 on a finished pound. So we're not making $0.10 a finished pound today in chicken, so no -- in that hypothetical scenario, and I'm really glad it is hypothetical, we would not make money. Now thinking back, if I look at June, we've just baked in benchmarking services, a couple. And so looking back at June, we were top quartile in one, top tertile in the other, so we're operating across all of our businesses fairly well. And if I think back to the top spots in those surveys, probably the #1, #2 spots were around that $0.10-a-pound mark. I'd say pricing has probably softened up a little bit now versus June. We've seen breast meat prices come down and such, and obviously the live cost is probably going to be a little higher. So in your scenario, no, we wouldn't be profitable, and I don't think anybody would be, just based on what we see in those benchmarking services. Now going forward into the fall, fortunately, our cost of goods in Q4 is going to be fairly well contained. I do anticipate, and we've seen a little bit of softness in the last couple of weeks, that with the current supply, pricing is likely to soften a little bit going into Q4, as it typically does, and then into the Q1, on end of the fall, that typically is not a very strong pricing period, too. So that's kind of our view going forward.","Heather L. Jones - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And on a follow-up, let's just -- you talk about probably being below your normalized range for Beef in 2013. But if we put you at like the 1% to 1.5% range for fiscal '13, most of the industry would be losing money. And further, even if without the drought, from a long-term structural perspective, some of your peers are poorly positioned. So I guess I'm just wondering, do you think that this drought will hasten what probably needed to happen anyway and it could have some of your competitors shutter some capacity? And I just wanted to get your thoughts on that.","James V. Lochner","This is Jim. The drought definitely will have a long-term impact to the overall beef supply because I do believe that it's done a little bit what it did last year. And obviously, if it starts to make cattle come to the feedlots earlier, it changes some of the geography of where they're fed. But more importantly, this year, what it's doing, as well as the price of corn going up, caused a radical correction to the feeder cattle pricing, with that revenue dropping as much as $200 a head over that time frame. So it wasn't short run. That -- what that did is probably stopped any heifer retention that was going on or anticipated to go on. And you have to remember that those calves -- those heifer calves now won't be probably staying in the herd, will go into the feedlot. So over the next 6 months to 1 year, they would be into the feedlot numbers. But over the long run, we will have to see capacity adjust, likely either through plant closing or capacity utilization reductions. And we've always got to remind everybody that our plants have always been situated where the cost-competitive feedlots exist. And peripheral feedlots generally have a higher operating cost. And then on top of that, they have a higher freight cost to get cattle to the plant when they get outside their region. So I think that's a key component. So I agree that we'll probably have to see and we'll likely see some capacity utilization reduction. The timing of that is difficult to look at and nail down, but in general, that's correct. And then I think one other thing on cattle. We've seen dramatically a shift in the length and time cattle are fed, which has reduced those feedlot turns, probably in combination of higher grain costs and the accelerated movement, particularly last year from the drought, with cattle being in the feedlots longer. So it's a lot more difficult than it's been in prior year's to predict exactly what we think is going to happen on a timing basis for availability. So that's a fairly long answer to that question, but that's what we see.","Operator","Our next question is from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","My first question is on Chicken, just to follow up on the previous question. So you said the hypothetical is not what you are dealing with in '13. So I just wanted to be clear. So are you hedged through 2013? My guess is no. And so at some point in 2013 -- fiscal '13, you are going to see higher grain cost if they stay where they are today. So the fact that you're saying you still remain profitable tells me that 85% of your revenue base that's flexible, you believe will adjust. Is that the right way to think about it?","Donnie Smith","Yes, you're reading it correctly. We're a couple of months out in front on our grain cost, which pretty much covers us through Q4. And that's -- what we really wanted to do in our grain strategy was to get us into new crop. Frankly, I would have liked to have seen a better new crop to get into, but be that as it may, it is what it is, so -- and we are -- we're covered through the end of September. So as we get into new crop, our grain costs will likely go up, looking at today's markets. But you're exactly right. A few things are giving us the optimism about being profitable. Number one is the pricing and the opportunities there. But also we've spent a lot of money on our Chicken business in the last couple of years. We still think there's some room for operating efficiency gains, probably on the order of about another $100 million. Jim mentioned, and I think I did too, about our international operations having a really tough quarter. And we think those will improve. The environment will improve there coming into 2013. That will help some. We are going to continue to sell more value-added, and as we do, that will improve the revenue side of our business. And two, our buy-versus-grow strategy is giving us a cost advantage because we're not saddled with parts of the chicken that don't carry very high revenue, and we're able to buy the parts we need at generally below our cost and convert those into value-added items. So you add all that stuff up, and that's what gives us the optimism going into 2013. And by the way, going into 2013, our estimate as of about a week ago, and hey, this corn market is bouncing around like a yoyo, so -- but as of a week ago, we were anticipating an incremental $700 million in grain cost in 2013, just to kind of...","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That is impressive if you're able to achieve that. So the next question is, so what's the supply scenario that you're assuming as being probable for next year for the industry? And what could change that? So I mean, like, most people expect like a 2% to 3% cutback could get the commodity prices up 10% or more and offset these higher grain costs. But what are you -- I'm assuming you'll be profitable even if there is no further cutback. Please correct me if I'm wrong there. And what do you think the industry is going to do? When will it happen? And what might that do to your EBIT margins in Chicken?","Donnie Smith","Okay, I think I understood your question. So we are predicting, or in our model for 2013, we do have current slaughter pounds in the forecast. Now let me talk about what we think we're going to happen. Let's look back -- well, about a year ago, this time or so, we were talking about this. We looked back at a couple of periods now when our Chicken business has been in that 6% or so range, one, that April, May, June period of '09. And during that time, we had a 6% return on sales, and slaughter pounds were running around $8.60 a week for the industry, and that gave us the environment we needed to be able to get the pricing we needed up on top of our cost structure. Now let me hasten on to say, during that year, corn was around $5 and meal was somewhere between $325 and $350-ish. So then fast forward now, up into 2012, the third quarter just ended 2012, you've got about 800 and 80-ish million or so slaughter pounds, and you've got probably $7 corn and $360 meal. So what made the difference there? It was all those things we mentioned before: the operating efficiencies, more value-added, our buy-versus-grow strategy, all those things. And so if you look at now the impact of this $0.07-a-pound live production increase, it would just make sense to us that something south of that 860 million slaughter pounds, which by the way I think is pretty close to your math of 2% to 3%, is probably the minimum to provide the environment that we're going to need to be able to get our pricing structure up on top of this cost structure that's coming our way.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And when might that happen relative to historical norms? As you know, it usually takes 6 months of losses before the industry starts cutting back. Do you think it might happen sooner?","Donnie Smith","Yes. I can't comment on that, but I can tell you that the current situation is untenable.","James V. Lochner","I think the key is we've have a rapid run-up in grain, and with the drought and the overall supplies of grain worldwide, we don't look like we're going to see a radical correction downwards. So the optimism waiting for the grain market to correct down isn't there. So that to me shortened the potential time frames.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","One last one for Jim, on Beef. Are you assuming -- you're on, I think, around $50 a head in Beef. And my guess is April was negative. I'm assuming you're above normal range today.","James V. Lochner","Today, meaning last week or...","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes, last week, or in the month of June, I'm assuming you're above normal and that's continued.","James V. Lochner","Yes. The month of June was -- May and June corrected. We got the relationship, with the revenue increasing above the cattle cost. And our effort is always to try to run for gross margin as best as we can, and that means maximize the revenue of the beef, maximize the mix, watch our costs and really look at the forward supplies of cattle and the forward demand and try to keep those in harmony.","Operator","Our next question is from Farha Aslam with Stephens.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Do you think that there would be chicken producers who would choose not to cut production and, just because of a good balance sheet, keep their production flat and kind of power through this current negative grain environment?","Donnie Smith","Farha, I just couldn't say. I mean for us, we -- last year, we cut production 6% to 8% and we have held solid with those cuts all year long. That allows us to buy meat on the outside market. And I'll tell you, through Q3, we probably bought 60 loads of meat on the low side and over 100, maybe between 115 and 120, loads of meat a week on the upside, and then brought that -- bought it below our cost in most cases and then brought that in to further process it, which meant we didn't have parts of the bird that would be in oversupply, that would have hurt our sales revenues. So I can't speak for what somebody else may be thinking about with their balance sheet. I'm really proud of our team for doing a great job. If I look at our Chicken business, Donnie King and his group have taken over $900 million out of our cost structure since, call it, mid-'08. That's significant. They've done a great job. They've been very, very prudent in how they've spent their capital, and they've got these plants running great. And so all of those things, put together, give us the optimism. But I can tell you, we don't have any plans to increase our production at all. We don't have any plans to cut anything further. If demand erodes, we might buy a few less loads on the outside. But we're continuing with our production cutbacks. That's -- I can talk about us. That's -- I can't speak for the rest of the industry.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, on Pork, could you just share with us kind of the timing of how you see animals coming to market. Do you expect a huge fall rush of hogs? And we're hearing that potentially there might not be enough shackle space. And then do you expect to tighten up going into next year as higher grain costs hit the hog producers?","James V. Lochner","Typically, you do start to see an increase in numbers coming off of the summer heat, and usually that kind of a June time frame is from the prior year's summer heat as it affects fertility rates. So we would expect that coming into the back half of August into September, October, we'll see kind of what we used to call the normal fall run, and we'd expect numbers at this point to be in the 1% to 2%. I don't think they'll be anywhere close to pushing the maximum slaughter capacity of the industry. And then you always have to -- or just look at the whole cycle approach here and say that high-priced grain will impact production, but you still have a pipeline of about 10 months in production that's coming at you. So I'd say that the impact to producer profitability will start to feel 10 months from now. And then the summer -- this summer's heat also will have probably some issues as we get into kind of next summer's processing.","Operator","Our next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory A. Van Winkle - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Greg Van Winkle from Vincent's team. My question's related to pork. Wondering if you've seen any increase recently in hog supply as a result of breeder sows being sent to slaughter. And I guess, you addressed a little of this with the last question, but what do you expect in terms of hog reductions going forward after the runoff we've seen in feed cost?","James V. Lochner","We're not in the sow processing end of the business, but I am hearing that there are more sows being offered. And you would expect to see some early liquidation as a result of the run-up in grain prices. But that's what we're hearing, and I'll just have to monitor it week over week and month over month to look at what the projected long-range supplies are going to be.","Gregory A. Van Winkle - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then what assumptions go into your outlook for Pork margins? You seem to be pretty optimistic about fiscal 2013 even though it seems to me like we're going to need higher hog prices to make producers profitable. And it seems like maybe the domestic demand environment is still a little weak. So I was just wondering what's driving your optimism there despite what seems like kind of a challenging environment.","James V. Lochner","Oh, what drives my optimism is you've still seen really strong export demand. You've seen an industry that can flex on the live production side. It's also put down a lot of efficiencies. We'll have to just watch and see what will happen as overall protein prices increase, whether or not -- how much demand destruction there may be or won't be. One interesting thing that's going on this year with the drought, there's been so much communication out in the popular press about expecting higher prices because of a reduced corn crop. And so I do think that at least we'll start to see some acceptance and maybe a little less demand destruction. And we'll definitely have ample supplies through the majority of our fiscal '13. So the other key component that I think one always has to look at is that the high grain prices in the U.S. are affecting worldwide grain prices, and we're still the most efficient producer of pork and chicken throughout the world. So again, the U.S. should be favorably impacted from our overall efficiency in export. So those are a lot of different reasons why I don't see anything real detrimental on the horizon in Pork.","Operator","Our next question is from Christine McCracken with Cleveland Research.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Jim, you talked a little bit about liquidation maybe not happening as quickly here. But we're seeing quite a bit of liquidation, it seems, in some of the other countries that we export into, specifically into Mexico. And that's been mentioned by some of your peers. I'm wondering, could you see a slowdown in exports, you think, in the near term as some of that liquidates and then it's setting up for a really strong export outlook, maybe into 2013?","James V. Lochner","Which -- I'm not sure what species you're referencing.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Well, really, we've seen it...","James V. Lochner","Mexico is not a big pork-producing country but...","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Yes, we've heard quite a bit about pork, specifically. You've seen some liquidation in the cattle side in Oceania and then -- and in the Pork side, it's primarily the hogs in Europe which maybe create some export opportunities for us. Mexico. I'm going to think Canada is also bringing quite a few sows to slaughter. So I'm just curious, kind of universally on the red meat side, obviously, the AI situation in Mexico is also perhaps creating a near-term pull.","James V. Lochner","Well, I just -- that's -- let me just -- off my last answer, I do think that we'll continue to see demand for -- in the countries we export to, which hopefully will persist. If there are that degree of liquidation against a small base, I don't look at their liquidation putting extra pounds on the market that have to be -- that are going to materially impact their need to import product. Clearly, the AI scenario in Mexico has some issue relative to overall just chicken movement within the country, which appeared to strengthen pricing here in the last several weeks. And then in the EU, we continue to hear about pig production being curtailed from a variety of different reasons. But again, as I mentioned in the previous answer, worldwide grain prices are going up as well, so the world's protein producers are going to feel this impact, and the U.S. is the most efficient place to grow pork and chicken. So I would expect that we'll see that long-term ramification from that.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","All right. And then just, Donnie, you mentioned what sounded like an improving foodservice environment. Just curious what your customer conversations are looking like in light of this increase in protein prices and possibly higher fuel on the back of lower ethanol production. Kind of also with wing prices so high this year, how much higher can they go relatively in order to offset some of the seed [ph]? Might some of that increase have to come on the back of boneless?","Donnie Smith","Yes, I guess, the best way I would characterize foodservice demand is it's a little bit -- it's sluggish. But finally there's a little bit of optimism, so, hey, maybe this thing's quite going down as -- that's not a very -- there's a little bit of optimism there, but not a lot. So as far as the conversations are going, I think people understand. There's nobody confused about the drought and its impact on the meat industry and meat producers. Also though, they're well aware of the current supply situation, and so there's not an immediate need to make a pricing adjustment. And so the conversations are largely around, \"We understand it's coming and when it gets here, we'll participate because you guys do a great job taking care of us and service and quality and you're the innovation leader,\" and that kind of thing. So did that answer your question?","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Yes. Just on the wings, I mean I'm a little bit worried, given how high they got this year, that they'd be able to take on much more of the...","Donnie Smith","It's interesting. If you go back in just about every year, regardless of where the wing price starts, when you go into the winter wing season, wing prices escalate. So we may test that this year, but so far, every year, wing prices go up during wing season, so...","James V. Lochner","I want to add one other thing. We spend -- do spend a lot of time with customers, showing them the supply\/demand fundamentals, what's out in front of them, what the moves are. And that does help them immensely. The dialogue gives them some anticipation of what they think the supply will be relative to demand forward and their thinking about prices, so...","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you elaborate a bit -- and forgive me if you talked about this already -- on the soft domestic demand you highlighted? Is it primarily in a certain species or across the board? To what degree are consumers are trading down? Where are you seeing it? Just a little more color there would be appreciated, if you can.","Donnie Smith","Okay. Let's talk about retail first. Overall, fresh meat sales are down. Hey, as pricing increases, it does hurt volume. Sales dollars are there, but volume is down. Beef and pork are down more than chicken. Fresh chicken sales are about flat. Beef's down; pork's down. At foodservice, really, chicken has had a pretty good summer at foodservice. Demand for the other items is fair at best. Pork has actually probably been the softest between beef and pork. As we look at -- we tend to look at holiday seasons as kind of an indicator for things to come, and Memorial Day was just average at best. And then when we went into Fourth of July, chicken demand was just fair. Pork was a little bit soft. Beef did okay. Beef got a lot of feature activity in retail during the Fourth of July holiday. As we look at it now, as prices edge higher, it's probably going to hurt demand. We haven't really seen -- well, hey, you might call 4%, 5% volume down in beef and pork and flat chicken, meaning some shift into chicken. You might -- could interpret that. But really, we haven't seen what I would call wholesale movement between the proteins. They are trading down within the category from more expensive muscle cut, maybe down into grind and that kind of thing. But really haven't seen wholesale movement between the proteins.","James V. Lochner","I'd add one other thing, and that is even with the Perishable data showing down 3% in 4 weeks and 13 weeks down 1%, and the volume is down 8%, the wholesale prices of beef have been high. They've been higher than a year ago. So the balance of the cutout has still been high.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just generally, as you think about how to approach a year when input costs could be a headwind and obviously, it looks like it will be, I realize you're going to stay on target with your long-term strategies. But are there tactical moves you perhaps might make this time rather than at a time when inflation is a little bit less onerous? It sounds like some of what you're doing with capital spending and share repurchases is that. But I'm just trying to get a sense for maybe what other adjustments you can make in running your business now versus what kind of it looked like a few months ago.","Donnie Smith","Yes. I think you've mentioned the primary 2. We want to keep a little more dry powder around this and just be cautionary. And then as we get into the year and we get more visibility into what our working capital needs are going to be, I have absolutely no problem continuing to invest in the business. Obviously, there are acquisitions that are out there that may interest us in the future, buying our stock back. I think we're a great value. So all of those things are there. Other than that, no, we really don't want to change our strategy. We're on point, growing our value-added businesses, doing those things we need to do to take care of our customers and lead with quality, our service and innovation. Our guys have done a great job. Noel White and his group have done a super job with their premium programs in Beef and Pork and continue to operate their business better than the indexes that they compare themselves to. So no. That's the whole point. It was to weather the storm and get to a point like this to where we could continue down our path and have a balance sheet that would support that.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Zaslow with BMO.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I know you kind of touched on it. I'm just trying to get a little bit more hard-core answers to this. How much production cuts do you expect for the industry? And what will be your participation be?","Donnie Smith","Let me go to the latter. What we did was kind of look back into environments that happened before, when we got into an environment where we could add pricing. But in our business, we have remained cut back, the 6% or 8% or so we did back a year ago, and we're going to continue with our current production plans, is the plan now. Now, things may change depending on what grain does or something like that. But currently, we don't have any plans to change our production because we're producing well below our demand today, thus buying all the parts we're buying. So we like our production model being well short of our demand.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And what about the -- because I guess, your comment on the press release is changing crop conditions and pricing could reduce or change the USDA outlook. So I'm assuming you guys think that there is going to be some production cut. I'm just trying to figure out what extent do you think it is and how confident you are in that.","Donnie Smith","Go ahead, Jim.","James V. Lochner","Well, I think -- we look back a lot and do a lot of work looking at history, correlating live pounds and overproduction against demand. The data basically says to increase price, you've got to pull back production, and the market will have to do its job. How fast that happens under what environment is difficult for anybody to predict. And then I think as we look across the board, and we just -- again, history tells us that will happen. Who, how fast, when is virtually impossible to tell. We have thoughts, but we're certainly not going to talk about anybody specifically. We really try -- as Donnie keeps saying, we manage our own business with a lot of focus on demand forecast by part, what our production runs are going to have to be, and manage it out 13, 14 weeks in advance. And we do know what we have ahead of us with increased live production costs. So we're going to work on pricing and all the dialogue associated therein.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And my other question is if you guys are pretty updating your -- at least breakeven, if not positive, what would that be for the industry? So I'm assuming you're outperforming the industry. Can you give us a metric to which you guys are outperforming the industry?","Donnie Smith","Well, I mentioned in an earlier question that we're top quartile in one of our benchmarking services and top third in the other. So that's about as much as I could say about how we compare.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Oksenhendler with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jim, I just want to follow up, I guess, on -- I guess, Ken's previous question and your answer and some of the previous questions in terms of, is this time different, where -- historically, you said when you cut supply, pricing will go up. But is demand weak such that you actually can't pass it through this time? And looking at -- going back to Christine's question in terms of wing prices at all -- really high levels, wing or leg quarter and breast meat prices didn't really move that much higher this year in relation to where they are relative to their cold storage levels and where production levels were in general for the industry. So I guess in terms of your optimism for pricing next year, I mean, leg quarter cold storage inventories are at the lowest level in 3 years since they've changed the data, and breast meat is at the lowest level in several years. So could you comment about that and your ability to take pricing next year?","Donnie Smith","Well, you're making a good point for us, Ryan, because inventories are low and that's certainly an advantage to us. But think, I mean, we're facing today, not knowing what's in front of us, $9 corn delivered and $550 million -- I mean, $550 soybean meal, which is going to have your live cost above $0.50 a pound -- I would -- somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.52 a pound. That frankly is just untenable. So we talked about earlier, as we went back into earlier periods when there was 860 million slaughter pounds, that -- and in those environments, we had the pricing structure that we needed to get on top of our current cost. By the way, we've improved our business since then. But if you just look at that, it stands to reason to us that with this wave of feed cost coming at us, you certainly -- we need to be below that level in order to have a favorable pricing environment. Now our forecast for the year is to operate profitably in this environment, so anything that -- any time the environment improves, that should be additive to our business.","James V. Lochner","The only thing I'd add is -- in my comments previously that I'd add now would be you've seen different parts of the bird particularly carry different percentage of the overall, with breast meat being soft, wing's high, leg quarters running pretty strong prices all year. And again, we really try to manage through total revenue component and look at where the opportunity to maximize that, be it in-country, be it export. So I think the market there -- will there be demand destruction with higher prices? Generally that's normal activity and the supply generally coming down. We'll have to offset it until equilibrium again occurs. So the timing of that is very difficult to call. But I do believe people will eat protein. The world will still have the same overall demand for protein. There will be adjustments on the parts. And we'll just have to see how fast that comes up to cover increased live costs.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then can you just talk about -- have you guys been importing any corn from Brazil at all or are contracted to do so?","Donnie Smith","No, not that we wouldn't if the math worked. But we've got a lot of truck corn bought from local farmers close to our feed mills. And right now the value -- imported values out of Brazil wouldn't compete with the cost that we've got local truck grain bought for, so -- but we run the math constantly. And when it works, that's an avenue for us.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then just one last quick one. Jim, if you could talk about the volumes down 14% in Beef. How much of that -- is it lower towel [ph] purchases? Could you talk about what drove that or break down that 14% decline?","James V. Lochner","In that 14%, we did process fewer head. Carcass weight was up. Then our outside cattle purchases really related to the impact of the relationship we have with BPI, with their volume down, where we basically captured some of that towel [ph] and sold. So it was the combination of those 3 things on the line.","Operator","Our next question is from Tim Ramey with D.A. Davidson.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","First on the Brazil, China losses of $30 million. Is there any more color that you can kind of give us on that? And what did that relate to? What's the likelihood of that continuing, and so on?","Donnie Smith","Yes, we're definitely seeing the softness that you hear a little bit about in the China economy, and that's affecting the wholesale value. So basically, what the story there is, Tim, we have a young start-up business that we run today largely dependent on market birds. The premiums we will get will come when we have these biosecured company-owned houses, which that part makes up only 20% of the 2 million head that we're slaughtering today. So when you combine -- let me hasten on to say, the cost structure we see in those live production assets is great. The premiums that we see over the wholesale markets, both at retail and foodservice, is what we expected. So our business model looks right. It feels good. We're very optimistic about what we're doing there. It's just we're a young start-up, fledgling business, and today we're way too dependent on wholesale markets. And it's been soft. Pretty much the same story in Brazil as we move towards a more value-added mix. This boneless leg meat deal in Japan, when that market closed, it kind of backed up through and affected -- of course, and the problems -- economic problems in Europe have slowed down breast meat prices there. So if you take the boneless leg meat market closing in Japan and the softness in the breast meat market in Europe, a lot of that had ripple effects into other markets and ended up backing up a lot of meat into the domestic business. And again, we don't have our value-added mix sold out like we want to yet, so we were very dependent on the wholesale markets and that was just not a good place to be in Q3. We see some improvement now, and we do predict kind of steady improvement. It's liable to be a couple more quarters out, though, before we're feeling a whole lot better about that. And, hey, the story is in Brazil, get your plants double-shifted and get into that value-added mix like our business model says we have to do. And in China, we can't build chicken houses fast enough. So the model is good. We'll get there. It's just we're too dependent on export and wholesale markets today.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Got you. And just a quick one for Dennis. If we were bridging to the $0.50, Dennis, what would we plug in for the tax component of the refunding of the bonds?","Dennis Leatherby","If we're going back to $0.50, if we didn't have the extinguishment of the bonds, it would have been 37.9%.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. But do you know the dollar amount for the tax impact of the bond?","Dennis Leatherby","We can get you that, Tim.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to know what your capacity utilization levels are in Beef now, Jim. I mean, your volume was down 14% in the quarter. You still had pretty decent margins, but you're going to be down double-digit this year. You'll probably be down again next year. At what point this capacity utilization become an issue in Beef?","James V. Lochner","The issue really gets critical when you are going to average -- I've got to get my math right here, but I'll make it simple. When you think you're going to average less than $36, it's critical. We were well north of that. We always do our capacity utilization on a 6-day week, and I don't think there's -- we're not going to see volumes out there that are going to warrant much Saturday operation. But we were still in the high 70s on capacity utilization on a 6-day capacity. But you've also got to kind of look at that number because when you're adding value on your cut floors and going to more value-added mixes, you have to watch how you really run your plant. So sometimes you'll sacrifice throughput for revenue. And that's part of that overall game of trying to maximize revenue against cost, against the supply. So sometimes you'll take a capacity reduction simply to maximize your revenue to get a higher mix. That's why it's a lot less dependent than a pure number of just saying what's the capacity utilization, and we're always making those adjustments. That's why I'm a bit vague with the answer.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I remember years ago, capacity utilization was the most important thing to follow. Has your business philosophy changed since then? It's more revenue management?","James V. Lochner","Yes, let me -- I just apologize for jumping in there, but it was not only the most important thing to follow. Maximizing revenue has always been a key driver. It's just that people like to look at that relative to the supply and the adjustments. So, yes, the key is really maximizing the revenue through mix and sales and then looking forward to what that type of cattle supplies are out in front and really trying to match those. And we're not hesitant to try to drop a little bit of the daily capacity or the daily run rates to try to maximize those revenues.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And a follow-up for Donnie. Chicken pricing, looks like yours is going to be up about 9% this year. Your volume will be down pretty much in line with the industry, maybe in line. Is 9% pricing disappointing? Were you expecting a higher pickup in pricing?","Donnie Smith","Good question. No, I think at the cost level, so far for the run rate, feels okay, not -- it's going to be woefully inadequate to cover the cost structure that's coming at us, so we will definitely need to take more. But I'm proud of our guys. We won some price based on the things we'd like to win our price increase on, which is having a great quality product in the box or in the tray. Our service on time and order fill has just been phenomenal. And two, we lead with innovative capability. We've had a lot of our customers in the Discovery Center working on ways to grow their business, and so for that, we get rewarded for adding that value to their business with a pricing structure that makes sense. So no, I wouldn't say we're disappointed in where we are. I think our folks have done a good job. They do know they've got another hill to climb, and we're headed that way.","Operator","Our next question is from Tim Tiberio with Miller Tabak.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","My question is on the Prepared Food segment. Can you just give us some highlights within the quarter? What actual product categories performed well versus the other categories?","Donnie Smith","Yes, sure. Our lunchmeat business, we've talked about that a little bit before, continues to make improvement. Proud of that team. I'll tell you our Wright brand bacon has well outpaced category growth there. We've extended the Wright brand beyond bacon now, into dinner sausages, and are very pleased with that. We are seeing some movement and pretty optimistic around chicken lunchmeat. We've got some smoked meat offerings coming out. We've actually done very well in our franks business. And two, we've got a new offering coming very soon into the marketplace in the next 2 or 3 months, which -- well, it is back to a chicken offering, which will be gluten-free strips and nuggets. So adding value to the red meat items, whether it's pizza topping. Our tortilla business has done well as well. So it's really been a fairly broad-based growth in all of those Prepared Foods segments, and we see a continued bright future and a lot of growth opportunities in that segment.","James V. Lochner","The only thing I'd add is we also had a plant start-up, which actually hurt us in this, which we started our Council Bluffs pepperoni plant, which will be a very efficient process there. They're much more competitive than some of our existing pepperoni. And we'll continue to really put a lot of focus in our overall Prepared Foods, particularly the sausage and pizza topping businesses, as well as the lunchmeat. So we're very encouraged with the activity and the project list that we have on incremental improvements throughout the whole category we call prepared...","Operator","Our next question is from Diane Geissler with CLSA.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Donnie, it wasn't clear from your comments if you thought you would actually fall into a position of unprofitability in the Chicken segment. I think earlier in the call, you talked about the incremental cost of grain and that pricing was actually coming down on a seasonal basis. We always see it. And that suggested to me that maybe the December and March periods, you would be negative. But then later you said, we're managing our business; however, we kind of remain profitable. So I guess I'm just wondering, for your commentary regarding fiscal '13, is it built on we know where we are to the extent that we know where grain is today and we think we'll be profitable? Or is there a little bit of sort of optimism built into your back half of your fiscal '13, because at some point the market will start pricing and presumably that we'll have a crop in 2013?","Donnie Smith","A little bit of -- the answer to both of those questions is yes. Our optimism is based around where grains are today because that's really the only visibility we have. And we do see improvements in the back end, not so much in our costing model, but on the revenue side of the model. It's a little bit back-half loaded. But to your question, we are using current grain prices, current soybean meal, however the spot market is plus the basis freight delivered to our feed mills, in the cost structure.","Dennis Leatherby","And we see more operating efficiencies coming.","Donnie Smith","Yes. About $100 million, yes.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. Well, I guess I -- somebody touched on it earlier about the revenue side and the fact that obviously the industry is really sort of a supply-driven industry and sort of the pricing follows how much we're either short or in excess. But if you look at even the breeder flock today is now 10% below what it was in 2007, and yet pricing wasn't all that robust this year. So I guess, I'm just a little nervous that even if we get another cut next year, call it 2% to 3%, that the consumer environment is so difficult that you really won't see it. And when I talk to the restaurant companies that are following QSR, they're looking to maintain their pricing structure to their customers, which means they're going to pressure back on their supply chain. So is it the conversations you're having with your customers today that they're now giving you an idea that okay, yes, they're going to be willing to accept these price increases that you're going to need to take to cover this? Or I guess, what's making you so optimistic about pricing in 2013?","Donnie Smith","Number one, yes, we are -- as we talk to customers today, they do see that this is an unprecedented movement in grain that is likely to have an impact on the supply of meat in all 3 proteins, maybe all 4 proteins, including turkey, I guess, on the market as we move forward. Now the exact timing of when which segment will cut back and supply will decrease, we have our ideas, but I won't speculate on that. But I think everyone that we talk to realizes that the meat situation in America is going to tighten up and that's going to have an impact on pricing. USDA has got their figures. We kind of pencil in ours. But hey, our Chicken business has done -- the domestic Chicken business did very well, I think, in Q3. We continue to add not only operating efficiencies, but we continue to grow our value-added. And we're getting paid for the value that we're adding to our customers' businesses. And so that's what keeps us optimistic, is the fact that this situation is untenable. It's going to change. And we're in a position because we've so dramatically reduced the amount of fixed cost -- fixed price -- long-term annual fixed-price agreements that we have to be able to take advantage of helping a customer ensure supply by being in an arrangement with a great supplier.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one follow-up question, if I have a minute. I realize you're over schedule here. On the international business, you had talked about pulling in all of that production internally and building out farms, et cetera, in China. Is that -- what's the timeline on that again? Is that 2 years?","Donnie Smith","A couple of years, 2014, yes. We should grow steadily in company-controlled biosecure houses between now and 2014.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And at that time, you don't expect to take any meat from the outside market.","Donnie Smith","Correct.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what would your run rate be in 2014 in terms of total production?","Dennis Leatherby","In China, about 3 million head.","James V. Lochner","Per week, yes.","Operator","Our final question today is from Colin Guheen with Cowen and Company.","Colin Guheen - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just real quickly, I guess, bigger picture and playing off of some of the Diane's questions. There's been such demand destruction over the last couple of years in beef. Are we getting to a level of more latent demand here where people become more agnostic on price? Or do we see more species substitution if we continue to have above your forecasted pricing in beef and continued demand destruction?","James V. Lochner","When I hear that, and I tend to think that until I go look at the numbers, and then I see that the cutout has ran a very high level, and currently is running a much higher number relative to last year. When I look at the Perishable data, you'll see the volumes being down and the prices being down. But the reality is the market's absorbing. It did absorb a choice cutout in the 190s through the bulk of May. It came off after the Fourth of July. It's a very difficult thing to answer other than looking at history, but we do know that the supplies will continue to come down. The prices probably will continue to rise. And the export demand, I think even though it's down year-over-year, January through May, about 11%, now we expect to see probably exports continue -- or will strengthen in the back half and potentially into '13. Again, that overall available worldwide supply keeps dropping, and so I think there are a number of consumers that are really -- the price isn't the primary driver. So it's a long answer to say, I'm not sure. I can't predict the future very well. But I can look at the supply dynamic going down. And history tells me that as supplies come down, prices will continue to inflate.","Donnie Smith","Okay. Well, that wraps up our call for today. We obviously have some challenging months ahead, but we've got the right team in place and the right plan to handle what comes our way. So thanks for joining us today, and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for joining.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. And now I'll turn today's conference over to Jon Kathol, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Sir, you may begin.","Jon Kathol","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Tyson Foods' conference call for the third quarter of our 2013 fiscal year. On today's call is Donnie Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Leatherby, Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Lochner, Chief Operating Officer.","I need to remind you that our remarks today include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. I encourage you to read today's press release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of the risks that can affect our business. Today's presentations may also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliations of these measurements are provided on our website.","As you saw on our press release and Form 10-Q this morning, we sold our Weifang operation in China, and it is reflected as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in our financial statements. Today, we will speak to our results from continuing operations. Please refer to our website for a supplemental schedule reconciling this change.","[Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Donnie Smith.","Donnie Smith","Thanks, Jon. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. Q3 was a great quarter for us, with earnings of $0.69 a share. It was our second-best ever quarter for EPS, along with record sales of $8.7 billion. The Chicken segment had record earnings, and both Chicken and Beef segments had their highest sales of any quarter. Prepared Foods had its highest Q3 sales.","We continue to see macroeconomic indicators pointing to a steady but modest recovery. We aren't relying on a better economy to grow our business, but I think Tyson Foods is uniquely positioned to capitalize on those opportunities as they occur. According to the Nielsen data, retail sales of fresh meat were up about 4% versus the same quarter a year ago, with volume up a little over 1%. Beef dollar sales were up 2.2%, along with pounds -- although pounds declined 2.5%.","Pork sales and pounds were both up 1.3% and 5.9%, respectively. Chicken pricing was up, on average, $0.10 a pound versus a year ago, but consumers continued their move to the relative value of Chicken, which was up 8.5% in dollars and 2.6% in pounds.","In foodservice, restaurant traffic has been rebounding in recent months after a slow start to the year. Chains are holding their own, while independent operators continue to struggle. For 2014, we're expecting foodservice growth to be flat to up maybe 1%, which means innovation and service will continue to be key to our growth. QSR is expected to lead foodservice growth again next year, and we have a very strong share of the QSR category and expect good volume around promotional activity.","We're accelerating the sales of value-added products with a goal of 6% to 8% annual increase. We're at 5% after 3 quarters and gaining momentum from an aggressive new product launch schedule. Frozen value-added poultry at retail is the focus of many of these new products, and Tyson is driving growth in this category, which, in the past year, has seen about 3.5% growth. Fresh and IQF chicken, along with case-ready beef and pork, are all performing very well.","Many of the food categories showing year-over-year growth at foodservice are in alignment with Tyson's key competencies, particularly chicken items, breakfast sandwiches and soups. Sales of high-carb foods are declining, which may be part of consumers' move towards healthier food products that we're seeing.","Tyson has been out front in the health and wellness trend for several years by providing nutritionally responsible choices for consumers. We've been working towards cleaner labels and sodium reduction, sometimes by as much as 30%, while still making food that tastes great. This is evidenced by a double-digit growth in our retail Grilled & Ready line and solid growth with other Better For You innovations as well.","Foodservice customers are coming to us to help them improve the nutritionals on their products. This is especially true of the products made for schools, as new dietary guidelines with calorie and sodium limits have gone into effect. As we enter this back-to-school season, practically our entire product line has been reformulated to meet the new standards, which I think is a testament to the strength of our R&D team and the innovation resources of the Discovery Center.","In addition to value-added products, another part of our growth strategy is to accelerate international poultry production, and we're making good progress. Strong results by Tyson de Mexico and Tyson do Brasil more than compensated for the losses in our China operations exacerbated by the avian influenza outbreak. Demand has begun improving since the AI outbreak slowed, and experience tells us that it will return to previous levels within about 3 months after the end of the event.","We're moving forward in China, and in this morning's press release, you probably noticed the reference to a discontinued operation. That refers to our Weifang operation, which is no longer core to the execution of our strategy, given the capital investment it would have required. Consequently, in the second quarter, we took an impairment test -- conducted an impairment test and recorded a $56 million impairment charge. In the third quarter, we entered into an agreement to sell Weifang, which resulted in reporting it as a discontinued operation.","I'd like to wrap up my thoughts by saying that we expect the fourth quarter to look pretty close to the third quarter, and we expect that performance to continue, on average, through 2014. It took us a few years to turn this business around, but I like where we are and I like the momentum we have. I'm confident we're going to take it into the next year and well beyond.","So that concludes my remarks. Dennis will now give a financial update, followed by Jim, who will discuss our segment results. Dennis?","Dennis Leatherby","Thank you, Donnie, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported Q3 earnings from continuing operations of $0.69 per share, up 35% compared to $0.51 last year on an adjusted basis. As you may recall, last year's adjustment included a charge of $167 million or $0.29 per share for the early extinguishment of our high-yield notes. I'm also pleased to report our last 12 months EPS from continuing operations is $2.13 per share on an adjusted basis, which is a strong indicator that we will deliver more than $2 per share for the full fiscal year, as we have indicated on the last few earnings calls. Pretax return on invested capital for the past 12 months was 17.3%. Capital expenditures were $135 million for the quarter and $425 million through 3 quarters of fiscal '13. Operating cash flow was strong in the third quarter at $542 million, bringing the total to $772 million through 3 quarters, up over $50 million from last year.","In the third quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for $100 million under our share repurchase program. This brings our total repurchases under this program to 33.4 million shares for $650 million since May 2011. Including cash of $943 million and short-term investments of $81 million, net debt was $1.4 billion. Total liquidity was just under $2 billion, remaining well above the upper end of our targeted range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Gross debt remained at $2.4 billion, with our sights set on paying off the convertible notes due in October with cash on hand.","Net debt-to-EBITDA for the last 12 months was 0.8x. On a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis, this measure was 1.4x. Excluding last year's charge for the early extinguishment of debt, net interest expense is down 26% compared to a year ago at $104 million through June. Our effective tax rate for continuing operations in Q3 was 35.4%.","Our average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter was 369 million, or flat versus last year. Basic weighted average shares decreased by 8 million, primarily due to our share repurchase program. This decrease was completely offset by a dilution increase from our convertible notes and warrants.","With the majority of the convertible notes coming in mid-October, let's take a moment to discuss the impact of their dilution. Of the dilution this quarter driven by our stock -- increased stock price, 8 million shares relates directly to the convertible notes and 3 million relates to warrants. At the beginning of this transaction, however, we purchased call options that will allow us to offset the shares issued at maturity at the convertible notes, in effect canceling them, but accounting rules prohibit us from reducing our diluted shares from these call options until after the convertible notes are paid off. In other words, these shares will ultimately go away from our share count, but investors will not see this occur until we report Q1 '14 earnings. The ultimate dilution we experience from this transaction will only be from the warrants, which have an exercise price of $22.17 per share.","Hypothetically, at a stock price of $28.51, which was our closing price last Friday, we would be required to issue 6.1 million shares at their maturity, which is not until April 2014, and would be fully reflected in our Q3 '14 financial statements. As stated earlier, we have repurchased more than 33.4 million shares since we began this program in Q3 '11, and we expect to continue it in the future, as it has well more than offset the potential impact of any ultimate dilution from these warrants.","Now here's an update on the remainder of fiscal '13 and some thoughts on fiscal '14. We expect revenues of approximately $34.5 billion for fiscal '13, or just over 4% growth over 2012. Revenues for fiscal '14 are expected to approximate $36 billion, as we look to continue to deliver on our annual top line growth target of 3% to 4%.","Net interest expense should approximate $140 million for fiscal '13 and $100 million in fiscal '14, with the decrease primarily driven by the payoff of our convertible notes in the first few weeks of the fiscal year. The effective tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal '13 should be around 34% and around 35% for fiscal '14.","CapEx is on pace to finish somewhere between $550 million and $600 million for fiscal '13. Our preliminary plan for fiscal '14 is in the $650 million to $700 million range compared to projected depreciation and amortization of approximately $500 million. As in recent years, this reflects our continued emphasis on growing our value-added and international businesses to enhance our productive capabilities, drive operating efficiencies and grow with our customers in both of these key areas.","In closing, we are very pleased with our Q3 results and look forward to the fourth quarter, which should be almost as strong. In addition, we have a good chance to finish the fiscal year with our best EPS results ever despite $500 million in incremental feed cost and numerous other challenges affecting our Beef, Pork and Chinese operations, which is quite an accomplishment all our team members should be proud of for their continued efforts to make our company even better. And as Donnie said, we are poised for an even stronger fiscal 2014 and believe we can deliver annualized results similar to the back half of 2013, well ahead of our annual goal to deliver at least 10% EPS growth.","I'll now turn it over to Jim for a closer look into our operating segments.","James V. Lochner","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning. Let's begin with our Chicken segment, which reported a record $20 million in operating income and a 7% return on sales in the third fiscal quarter. Volume was up 4.4%, while pricing was up 6% over Q3 of '12, driven by strong demand and favorable domestic markets. Through operational mix and price improvements, we more than offset the $105 million impact of increased feed cost for the quarter. Consumer demand for chicken is expected to remain strong, driven by foodservice promotions along with the value of chicken relative to beef.","Meanwhile, analysts project chicken production to be up 2% to 3% next year. We plan to continue our buy-versus-grow strategy for Chicken, meaning we won't overproduce our demand and we'll buy meat on the open market when it's cheaper than we can produce it. We'll then turn that meat into higher-margin, value-added products for our retail and foodservice customers.","Turning to the Pork segment, we had a 5% return on sales and $67 million in operating income. Volume was down 4.7%, and our average sales price per pound was up 4% compared to Q3 last year. Our Pork results were down slightly, as we adjusted our volumes to our supply and positioned our sales accordingly. Domestic availability of pork was up, predominantly from an estimated 6% decline in exports year-over-year. We focused our attention on mix, yields and position in the marketplace for pricing.","Looking into 2014, we assume the industry hog supplies will be flat to this year and sufficient for our needs. And we expect another solid performance from our Pork segment next year.","Moving on to the Beef segment. We had a 3.1% return on record sales of $3.7 billion, with an operating income of $114 million. Volume was up 3.8%, and price per pound was up 2.9% over the same quarter last year. Beef demand was good despite higher pricing.","Although the first half of the third quarter was more difficult, our performance began to rebound in May due to our improved execution, which included product mix and yield. Our performance relative to the industry improved as well. Additionally, our export market share increased. Industry-wide exports are down 6% year-to-date, while ours are up substantially, led by Japan. In 2014, we're expecting fed cattle supplies to continue their decline by another 2% to 3%. We have put our focus on export market share to improve our mix realization.","The Prepared Foods segment had a 3% return on sales and $24 million in operating income. Our volume was up 1.3%, while average sales price per pound was up 3% over Q3 of '12. We are investing in Prepared Foods through consumer and promotional spending and staffing support to build the business in several new product categories in 2014 and beyond.","Now we're making good progress on our efforts to grow value-added sales by 6% to 8% annually. We acquired Circle Foods in the third quarter to expand on our tortilla and Mexican handheld snack food businesses. This is in addition to the Don Julio acquisition in the second quarter that is adding retail distribution to our tortilla and chip businesses. We will continue to explore Prepared Food acquisitions while improving execution in our existing businesses to grow that segment.","Also, as I mentioned on our previous call, our lunchmeat business is negatively impacting the Prepared Foods segment as we undergo an extensive renovation in our Houston plant, which is temporarily causing us to incur higher operating costs to maintain service to our customers. That project is now scheduled for completion in mid fiscal 2014.","In conclusion, I'm pleased with our performance overall, but our expectations will continue to increase. We have to stay focused on driving results, and there's more to be achieved.","That is the end of our prepared remarks. We're ready to begin Q&A.","Jon Kathol","Operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from Christine McCracken of Cleveland Research.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","I just wanted to touch -- you've had a number of challenges here over the past year, with record feed costs and some of the trade-related issues. Can you talk on the outlook for '14 and maybe the 2 to 3 big catalysts that you see as potential drivers for the next 12 months? It's a pretty complicated outlook. If you go through some of the drivers, maybe you can start there.","Donnie Smith","Sure, so here's the way I look at it. We'll kind of start with the top line. We do expect our top line sales growth to be at 3% to 4% and our value-added sales growth to be, again, at 6% to 8%. By segment, Chicken's having a good year this year. We've got some tailwinds from the environment we're operating in, but we will continue to grow our value-added there. And as our sales increase there, that will improve our earnings with what I'd call a relatively modest supply growth, particularly in the first half of FY '14. Solid demand and Chicken's relative low pricing compared to the other proteins, should be a very, very good year for Chicken. By the way, probably layer on top of that international improvements as well. So if you look at Beef and Pork, the current supply's set up next year to be as good as this year and maybe even a little bit better. In Prepared Foods, we're investing in growth platforms. We're investing in the businesses that we bought this year, and they should be contributing to our earnings in both the latter part of '14 and then -- mid to latter part of '14 and well on into '15, by the way. And of course, you would expect international to continue to improve in '15 as well. So if you look at that from the segment view, then you layer on top of that we got $40 million in interest expense reduction in '14; we're obviously going to throw off a lot of cash, and we'll be paying off the converts; we'll have the cash we need to invest in growth, whether it's through CapEx or more value-added acquisitions, of course, continuing to return cash to shareholders by buying back and dividends -- and so when you add all those things up, it looks like '14 is going to be a very strong year.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","So why stick with such a, I guess, on a historic basis, a relatively conservative \"normalized range\" on Chicken if you've got the benefit of lower feed, you've got a really tight supply for Beef, you've got what now looks like it could be a very tight supply of Pork, at least for part of the year? Why is it that you stick with a range that's below kind of what you've hit during kind of the upswing in Chicken?","Donnie Smith","Well, we talked about it in our written comments in the Q. I don't know if all that has been seen yet. I suppose it has. But we talked about in or above. And certainly, if you look at grain cost going down, a lot of work that we've done in the last year around shifting our pricing profiles to be more reflective of grain inputs while sharing risk with our customers, they get an insured supply of quality, service and innovative capability and we certainly get more stable returns. We do have a portion of our portfolio that's supply-driven, but we continue to minimize that. Again, as Jim mentioned, our buy-versus-grow strategy. We continue to grow our value-added mix, which gives us some insulation. So you add all that stuff up, Chicken ought to have a very good year next year.","Operator","Our next question, Tim Ramey of Davidson.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","It sounds like -- I mean, we've seen the other side of this trade, but you should just generate enormous amounts of cash over the next couple of quarters as we think about the relative input costs rolling down. Have you -- I assume you have -- thought through what that might look like for just working capital requirements?","Dennis Leatherby","Good question, Tim. We have seen that. Remember, We do have $458 million of converts to pay in early October. But we do see good cash flow. We're going to use it wisely. We're investing heavily in CapEx over and above depreciation and amortization. We'll continue to look at acquisitions and continue to return cash to shareholders. So we're really excited about what's ahead of us.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Great. And just on China, Donnie, you've given us some very bullish thoughts over time about the opportunity there to grow your own and to provide a high-quality, food-safe product. Should we read anything into the -- I don't think so. I think the impairment charge related to kind of the old way of doing business in China. But anything different in kind of what you're thoughts are on the opportunity in China?","Donnie Smith","No, not at all. As a matter of fact, you're absolutely right in the way you're thinking. And the AI outbreak obviously set us back from where we thought our profitability would be. It shoved it out front a couple more months. But the one thing it did do was absolutely validate our business model. From a long-term perspective, our bio-secure facilities and our controlled supply chain are the level of protection that Chinese customer base desires, and that really bodes well for us out in the future. What we've got in -- by the way, we're on target on our build-out plans, and so we're getting a little better at acquiring land, which makes me feel optimistic that we'll continue to stay on target with building out our own houses. And so that's really the key to our future is the plants are running well and getting those houses built and getting this company-controlled production through our plants as quickly as possible. So we feel really good about the future.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next, we have Ken Goldman of JPMorgan Chase.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This was the first time, if my numbers are right, that your Beef volumes were up in nearly 3 years, and they rose by a substantial amount. Can you talk how sustainable that trend might be? And is Beef the main reason you're guiding to a total company revenue number that's well above what the street was maybe looking for?","James V. Lochner","Let me -- this is Jim. I'll start with that. If you recall, we did have a plant that was shut down in around -- I guess it was February or March when it was announced. That did take about 4.5% of the daily slaughter capacity and about 10% of the slaughter capacity in that 300-mile region out. And we do have a couple of plants in that region, and we did benefit from an increased flow of cattle to our plants in that particular period, which did change the balance. In the north, it really wasn't much different. Let me remind you, we really look at what that forward supply of cattle's going to be 2, 4 and 8 weeks out. We really run our plants with that thought process in mind, always trying to position ourselves accordingly and to manage gross margin. So if it gives it to us, fine, but that isn't the primary goal that we look at the Beef division to generally look at a volume or capacity utilization. So it's really much more micro than that, the way we look at it plant to plant.","Dennis Leatherby","In terms of where the sales growth is coming from -- Ken, this is Dennis. It's coming principally from 2 areas, and that's Chicken and Prepared Foods. And that's a function of the value-added sales growth kicking in and international sales growth kicking in.","James V. Lochner","So hopefully, that answers your question.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's helpful.","Operator","Next question is Farha Aslam from Stephens.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","So again, on that theme of international, China recently had a WTO case where they have to possibly take off the tariff they put on U.S. chicken. Any impact to your business in China or in the U.S. as a result of that?","Donnie Smith","Farha, our estimate would be that the proceedings -- and let me just say all the things that would happen from this ruling and before a likely appeal, et cetera, et cetera, it could take a year or so for there to be any potential for actual tariff reductions, and then we'll have to see what happens. So yes, if and when all that happens, it would have a positive impact on our business. But that will likely be a '14 event and could be a little longer.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","So a general positive, long term, supportive to exporters in the U.S.?","Donnie Smith","Yes.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just 2 other quick follow-ups. First one is your volumes, overall, seem to be more flexible quarter-to-quarter than they have been historically. Could you just share with us how you're possibly managing those businesses differently today than you have in the past and kind of what that means for gross margins and kind of how steady gross margins are going forward?","Donnie Smith","Farha, help me a little bit. Give me a little bit more detail about your question to respond to.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Because we noticed that your volume in Chicken was up quite nicely, as in Beef, and that's where you had the strongest profitability. And Pork, where it was a little bit kind of more choppy of a market, your volumes were down significantly. And so we were wondering if you're managing your plants differently and if there's anything in your plants that's changed that's allowed you to kind of respond to the market faster.","Donnie Smith","Got it. Okay, now I understand. So as Jim has often said in his prepared remarks and in lots of investor communications, we manage for margin, not market share. And so when the environment needs us to make adjustments in how we manage through our business, we have the flexibility to do that. And obviously, we think it's incumbent on us to do a good job at that. In poultry, this year, the market dynamics helped a bit in that chicken is relatively low priced compared to the other proteins, and so it just made sense for us to push the poultry volume. We had a great year -- or we are having a great year at retail and fresh. We're having a great year at foodservice. We have a good market share of the QSR volume at foodservice, which is clearly winning in foodservice today. So when you add all that up, it gives us an opportunity to push volume where it's meaningful to the customer and us. If you look at our Beef plants -- I'll wrap this up, but if you look at our Beef plants, we continue to stay surrounded -- I mean, our Beef plants are where there's a good supply of cattle, so we have the opportunity to grow our business there because we have a good supply of cattle around us. So Jim, would you add anything?","James V. Lochner","The only thing I'd add is, on your observation on the Pork, again, much like I said earlier on Beef, we really pay a lot of attention to what that forward supply looks like it's giving us relative to the consumption. Now you've got to remember that we had less exports in this quarter, and we anticipated some pricing pressure and some supply constriction. So basically, we set our hours up to not try to press that and push the live cost up relative to the revenue, put our attention on the mix and positioning our revenue on the product that we have to sell so we weren't long. And so we gave up market share or didn't really -- I don't look at it that way. We looked at managing for margin at a greater priority than just trying to fill the hours. We had plenty to run the hours we anticipated, so that was really the play.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. And just one last question on wings. Your outlook on wings prices, because those prices have been a bit volatile? And your thoughts on QSR promotions for wings going into the fall?","Donnie Smith","Sure. We would look at incremental demand from QSR promotions as a good thing. And I think we're seeing a bit more inelasticity in wing pricing. It looks to us like the wing prices are starting to creep back up, and I think what you'll see this fall and winter is a seasonal increase in wing prices, much like we see every season.","Operator","Next question, Ryan Oksenhendler, Bank of America.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Donnie, I just wanted to talk, I guess, about -- get your thoughts on the industry's ability to increase production next year. It sounded like -- I think you said you're expecting a modest increase in the first half of next year. But when I look at the USDA data, you see pullet placements up 3% in June, egg sets and chicks placed have been up recently: egg sets up like 3% to 4% over last several weeks; chicks placed were up 4%, I think, last week. Even eggs per layer have been up despite talk about the hen life being extended or holding those birds on longer. I guess, what is the industry's ability to increase production? Because I think there's been a lot of talk about the lack of eggs out there.","Donnie Smith","Yes. I'll get to that in just a second, but a quick comment about -- I think it's important to bear in mind that, as Beef prices and, to some extent, Pork continue to stay high, that really provides a bit of a halo effect around poultry pricing and poultry consumption, really. And so we think that next year will be a year that you will continue to see good, robust demand for Chicken. So back to the supply question. So if we just look at our ability, just Tyson's ability to get our pullet orders filled, really, the only way that we can see a meaningful increase in supply is to hold our hens longer. And frankly, Ryan, we just don't have enough housing to hold our hens much longer than 69 weeks. So we see that for a few more months out in front of us, I don't see that the industry -- I don't see that we would have the ability to push it, and that's kind of how we view the outlook.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I guess -- and then in terms of when you see the outlook for production up next year, 2%, 3%, I guess, what does that mean in terms of pricing for Chicken? I mean, is there still going to be higher prices next year, or do you think pricing might come down next year?","Donnie Smith","It could, but what we've done -- we worked real hard, and I'm real proud of our folks that we've shifted a lot of our pricing profiles to be a little more reflective of grain input. So today, about -- I'd say about half of our pricing contracts are either cost-plus or have some kind of grain cost adjustment in them. And it works really well for us and our customers sharing the commodity risk because they get an insured supply of quality, service and innovation, and we get more stable returns. We do have some of our portfolio that's supply based, but we continue to minimize that. Only -- we're less than 8% of our total sales now that are 1-year fixed-price agreements. So we've done a great job of continuing to change that pricing strategy. And if production's up a little bit, our buy-versus-grow strategy will work very well for us because we'll just buy excess breast meat or whatever we need on the market and then convert that and grow our value-added mix with it. And of course, we continue to grow our value-added sales, and that provides us some commodity insulation there, too. So even if there is a market that might have overall lower prices, we still feel comfortable with our earnings potential because of the way we've structured our pricing arrangements.","James V. Lochner","I would also add one thing. Keep in mind that fiscal '12 was a very, very steep pullback, and so you always got to look at your percentage year-over-year over a longer time frame than 1 year, just as a cautionary note, and look at that total practical supply.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then just a follow-up, just one last follow-up on that. Like, in terms of -- in the press release, when you say $500 million of lower feed cost next year, given the change in contracts where the grain escalator closes up and down, is that $500 million net to Tyson, or is that $500 million of lower cost, and some of that may get passed through to your customers?","Donnie Smith","You're correct in the last way you said that. And of course, our intention would be for us to capture as much of that as we possibly can. That's been the focus of working with our customers on these pricing strategies.","Operator","Next question, Brett Hundley from BB&T Capital Markets.","Brett M. Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Actually, I want to stay on Chicken first. And I think Christine asked it, but I want to go back to your normalized range in Chicken. And Donnie, everything you just said regarding your outlook for Chicken, it's then very hard to not be above your historical normalized range. And so maybe -- I'm wondering if you would maybe go through some of the drivers, as you see them, as to what lands you inside that normalized Chicken range versus what puts you above.","Donnie Smith","Well, I'm not going to try to focus on anything to land me inside of it. I'm just focused on everything to land me above it, right? I continue to be very optimistic about our poultry business. Obviously, grain looks like it will do -- will have a good year, but it's not at the end yet, and so you don't really know there. But yes, if you look at our outlook for growing our value-added sales, those are higher-sales items and higher-margin items and very valuable, by the way, both to consumers and to the customers. The guys have done a great job on our pricing strategies. They continue to do a great job on their operational efficiencies, and we'll never lose focus of that. We're in a good position relative to the other proteins. Our international business is making good improvements, so that will layer on, on top of good operational performance domestically in '14. So yes, there's every reason to feel really good about our poultry business.","Brett M. Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then I wanted to rotate back over to red meat and talk about Beef, in particular, from an industry standpoint. So we talked about how Chicken and Pork might see some expansion in 2014. And then, of course, where cattle supplies could tighten. And so I'm curious to get your opinion on how high-priced beef works its way back through the system. Do you expect the industry to trim capacity in 2014? Are there regions of the U.S. that present more of an opportunity as opposed to a concern, in your view? If you could just talk to that, I'd appreciate it.","James V. Lochner","Let me add some detail to that. We expect, as we said, to see fed cattle supplies drop 2% to 3%, and that's nothing more than what we think the '13 calf crop estimate will be, and the '12, because that's our future supply chain. Cattle will be fed where the lowest cost to produce -- or the lowest cost of gain is, which centers around the Corn Belt and the High Plains, which means there'll be fewer cattle fed, probably, out into the Eastern Plains, et cetera. And again, that overall supply will continue to come down. Whether we see carcass weights come back up to offset that, I don't know. I mean, I've been thinking carcass weights have topped out for a number of years, and I don't expect to see a radical increase in weight to offset that. And therefore, if you look at purely the elasticity, you're going to see a reduction in supply generally increase the cutout, like it has over time. And we're seeing a stronger interest in, particularly, Japanese importation of U.S. beef, which is gaining back its share. So all of that tells me beef's going to continue to increase in price. We continue to put our focus on our own operations, which is managing the mix; getting our international share up, which we've done an excellent job of doing, particularly in Japan; and focusing on our controllables, which are yields, cost, quality, service, et cetera. So that's the overall play.","Brett M. Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I mean, outside of Japan, do you see...","James V. Lochner","That's how we run it.","Brett M. Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Outside of Japan, do you see other export market opportunities in 2014 that aren't being talked about?","James V. Lochner","We've since continued -- our market share in Mexico's gone up, even though the country per se has dropped relative to year-over-year. I expect to see Asia as a whole continue to have an increase. And the reality is, though, with the 2% to 3% down in fed supplies, you're not going to see overall exports increase just because we'll have a limited supply. But there'll be a strong interest in acquiring high-quality grain-fed beef around the world. I don't see that really going backwards.","Operator","Next question, Tim Tiberio of Miller Tabak.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","My question is on the outlook. Should we expect that the international segment could be broadly profitable for 2014?","Donnie Smith","Oh, yes.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's a short and sweet answer. And as far as the M&A outlook, you've seen some tuck-in acquisitions over the last few quarters. Are there any regions that you see, I guess, increased opportunity since the last 3 to 6 months? And if there's opportunities on the horizon, what size of transactions are you willing to look at? I'm just trying to get a sense of, when you look at your overall capital allocation, whether that's a top priority going into 2014.","Donnie Smith","Sure. So this year -- well, this upcoming year, '14, we have opportunity in our business to overspend versus our depreciation, so we'll be doing that. And then -- because we've got some good organic opportunities as well. Now looking at acquisitions, continue to expect us -- we would call them bolt-ons, continue to expect us to look at bolt-on acquisitions. A sweet spot acquisition for us is probably sub-$100 million that fits an important gap that we see in assuring that our consumers and customers have their needs met in the marketplace. So as we've talked about before, value-added, whether it's poultry or in a broad -- our very broad range of Prepared Foods items continues to be a great focus in the future. Not only that type -- those types of products, but also, we've talked about the c-store channel and alternative channels and those and good opportunities we have there. So we have both product growth opportunities and gaps we need to fill and channel growth opportunities and gaps we need to fill, and we'll continue to be very focused on layering in acquisitions that help us meet those needs.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","And are there any regions that you're particularly focused on, or you're pretty agnostic in filling the product and channel...","Donnie Smith","Yes, we've got -- sorry, I jumped in a little quick. But we've got a great -- number one, we have great customer penetration. We have great service, great quality that our customers have come to expect, and we don't ever expect to let them down. So good, good customer relationships. And plus, we've got a very, very broad and a very efficient national refrigerated distribution network that lends itself to moving products around the country very efficiently. And so that helps us to have a national view of acquisitions.","Operator","Next question, Robert Moskow, Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Donnie, I wanted to ask a follow-up to Ryan's question about Chicken supply and how quickly the industry might increase. You talked about your own, I guess, limitations as to your capacity to house more hens, but you didn't really talk about the rest of the industry. And my understanding is that a lot of the breeding flock has moved to Mexico. And maybe if you can kind of start there and talk about how you think that's influencing the industry's ability to -- or inability to increase supplies, and then what you're seeing outside of your own 4 walls.","Donnie Smith","All right. So no doubt that with the AI issue in Mexico that there was a lot of hatching eggs that went down to Mexico. What we see today is that the supply on the Mexican market, particularly in the live markets but also in the New York dressed, is back up to a level now that would indicate that, that supply is -- maybe not has been, but is well along in being restored. And so the price of a dozen hatching eggs has gone down in the U.S., and then here in the last 4 to 6 weeks, you've seen industry sets be up a little bit. But I think their ability to increase is limited. I know our ability to increase is limited to the -- our inability to hold a hen past 65 weeks because we simply just don't have the housing. I don't know how prevalent that same issue would have across the industry, and I can only speak for ourselves, but I don't expect that the supply -- I expect the supply to be in a similar range for a few more months out front, and I get that basically from the constraint on our business, before an increase in the actual pullet supply could increase, which is likely to happen towards the end of the calendar year. So that's how we see it. I can only use our business as a proxy for what might be happening, but that's the way we look at it. Now you've got to watch weights, too. I mean, everybody get -- we talk a lot about egg sets and chicks placed, but slaughter pounds is what ultimately matters. And as we look forward, though, we see a relatively modest supply growth.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And just a follow-up on that. Pricing in Chicken, it probably will come down at some point. When do you think you'll start to see it? If nothing else, based on your grain contracts, you said there's a lag with customers. So should it be by the end of the year or the beginning of calendar next year or maybe not at all?","Donnie Smith","I think if you looked at typical seasonal patterns adjusted for where we are today, you would expect that late in the fall, November, December, pricing would be lower than what it is today, I mean, just looking at the seasonal impacts. Now I hasten on to say we'll take seasonal cuts like we have in the last 2 years because we are just not going to get long on supply. And as we look out at our forward demand, we're going to take a seasonal cut. And then if there's meat out on the market, we'll buy. And what we've been able to do is, by working with our customers and sharing some of the commodity risk, we get a stable return in up or down grain markets. And that feels good not only to us, but it feels good to our customers. And so I like where we are. Our folks have done a great job in the last 12 to 15 months or so of changing our pricing portfolio to give us greater stability. And that's what we're constantly looking for is more consistent and stable earnings growth, and our business model is structured to be less volatile than the pure commodity players.","Operator","Next question, Diane Geissler, CLSA.","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I wanted to ask about your comments on the restaurant expectation, flat to up of 1% in fiscal '14. It's been a while since we've been in a deflationary mode. And every day, I watch corn prices come off. And at some point, lower grain prices have to leak into the broader market, I would think. So I guess in sort of a broadly deflationary environment, isn't -- is it -- I don't know, I guess. How do I word this? Is it unrealistic to expect that there's a little bit of pent-up demand out there from the consumer perspective, given that we've just been in sort of the economic doldrums for 5 or 6 years now, that you wouldn't expect traffic in the restaurant channel to be a little bit better than flat to up 1%?","Donnie Smith","Yes, as we canvass the marketplace with our customers, our comments are reflecting what we're hearing back from them. And hey, we look at Technomic and all kinds of industry sources to try to get a read on what is going on out in front of us. I do feel like there's pent-up demand. Demand has moved from foodservice to retail. Demand has moved, maybe, from casual to QSR. And as it moves around, we have the flexibility to move around with it. And so what we really look at is what we think the overall tonnage growth will be, and that keeps landing on about 0.5% to maybe up 1%. And if there is pent-up demand, that's good news for us. If it's not, still got a great year ahead of us. And if it moves around between the different parts of foodservice or different aspects of retail, we've got a lot of flexibility built into our production model and our distribution model to be able to reach that demand wherever it is.","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. Well, I appreciate those comments. Can I just ask about this sentence in your press release about the short-term -- rates are shorter-term in nature and that there's a time delay? Am I to read that as grain prices are coming down, and we hold our price to the foodservice channel at the higher level? And eventually, we reset those contracts lower as grain prices come down, so there'll be a quarter or 2 where you maintain a slightly higher margin than the cash market would reflect?","Donnie Smith","Well, first of all, our grain prices, just for perspective -- we pretty much know what our cost of goods are going to be in Q4. And then you take your cost of goods in Q4 and then move that forward into Q1, and then the receipts in Q1 really help impact Q2. And so there is some of that, I think, related in that comment. And again, if it's related to the Prepared Foods remarks, those are -- there's generally, with the way those pricing structures were set up, there's generally a lag, a quarterly lag going forward. So as raw material prices go down, then we get the benefit of that in the subsequent quarter. And I think -- I'm guessing that is probably more likely to be what that comment was -- is.","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. It was really in the outlook section on Chicken where you say, \"Sales contracts are formula based or shorter term. It allows you to adjust pricing when input costs fluctuate. May be a lag time for price changes.\" I just read that as the margins will be a little bit richer in the early periods of deflation because you'll be holding prices constant with prior period grain prices.","James V. Lochner","There certainly was, as grain ran up, because you won't -- this is Jim. You don't bill them over the real short term, week to week, so they tend to be over a quarterly trend. So that's the basis behind that comment.","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay, I appreciate that clarification. Can I just, ask where do you stand in your China Chicken operations in terms of vertical integration? You said that your were getting -- I think the quote was you're getting a little bit better at getting the land to build the houses on. But where do you stand in terms of vertical integration? Are you still going to hit that by the end of fiscal '14?","Donnie Smith","Well, we're at 50% -- we'll be at 50% company-owned birds at the end of this fiscal year. And then our goal is to be nearing 100% in company-owned birds at the end of FY '14. And so that should help, certainly, in the profitability of those complexes.","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Have all of the meat scares and scandals that China had over the winter helped the dialogue with the government there?","Donnie Smith","Yes, no doubt about it.","Operator","Next question, Akshay Jagdale of KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So I just wanted to talk about Chicken. First question is on your Chicken -- U.S. Chicken performance relative to peers. So before I ask the question, can you tell us what your U.S. Chicken EBIT margin was for the quarter?","Donnie Smith","We don't break those out, Akshay.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Was it higher than 7%?","Donnie Smith","Well, yes.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. So what I'm trying to get at there is in the past, we've talked a little bit about, when spot margins are peaking, what will Tyson's Chicken P&L look like? And one of your largest competitors just posted sort of a 9% EBIT margin in the U.S. business. So you guys are lagging that. And when I look at my numbers, the revenue per pound was up 5%, according to my estimates, but came in below sort of what I was expecting and seems like was somewhat softer. But how would you rank your U.S. Chicken performance relative to your peers? Would you have moved down a little bit, a couple of ranking points in Agri Stats because these commodity guys are doing better in this environment? Or how do you rank your performance relative to your peers this quarter?","Donnie Smith","So we are involved in a couple of benchmarking services. And what we typically look at is our rolling 12-month performance, and our goal is to always be in the top quartile. And so we are there, so we feel good about that. In the last month or 2, we don't compare as favorably on the operating margins because the commodity players are getting the benefit of the peak of the commodity markets. Our goal is to have more consistent and more stable earnings, and so our margin -- our model is structured so that we're less volatile than just the pure commodity players. But we feel very good -- as we look at the cost components and the pricing components relative to our expectations, we feel very good that our poultry business is operating very well. Now Jim made a comment earlier that we continue to have things that we strive for and continue to push for improvements, and so we can get better, but we're operating very well.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the next question, then, is what can -- I mean, first of all, have margins in Chicken peaked for you, quarterly margins?","Donnie Smith","For Tyson?","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Donnie Smith","No.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the rough math I'm doing is you had $0.10 per pound in EBIT this quarter, and that was with a $0.05 year-over-year increase in cost per pound. So you're guiding to, if you lock all your needs and corn stays where it is, a $0.05 decrease year-over-year in feed cost. So all else equal, that would be a $0.20 EBIT. Now I know all else is never equal, but what I'm really trying to get to here is I think you can get to your 7% EBIT margin next year, even if prices decrease by 8%. So roughly, I mean, am I thinking about this correctly? I mean, I think a lot of people are asking the same question in a different way, but it seems like next year should be above your normal range.","Donnie Smith","I think you're thinking about it right. I would -- the pricing being down 8% or whatever, I'm not going to go to those kind of details. But I think you're thinking about it right.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And I think I heard -- did I hear this correctly that you are expecting an increase in revenues in the Chicken segment next year? Can you just get into a little bit more details on what's driving that? I mean, how much -- what kind of percentage increase are we expecting, and now much of that is international? And what's your general expectations for U.S. Chicken revenues right now?","Donnie Smith","Okay, so I'll give you as much detail as I can. Yes, we do expect Chicken revenues to increase. And just like our strategy says, we will be doing that by driving value-added Chicken and our international Chicken business. And so we have every expectation of growing that business and leading it with 6% to 8% growth in our value-added and 12% to 16% growth in our international business. So those are the key drivers. We remain focused on that, and that's going to be what drives revenue growth.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So what kind of underlying commodity market price are you expecting for the remaining part of your business? I mean, is the remaining part of Chicken expected in your numbers to be down right now or flattish? Or just any guidance there would be helpful.","Donnie Smith","Yes, down a little bit. Yes, we look at the same industry sources for pricing, whether it's Informa or EMI or whoever folks might use as the industry and market expectations. And so we look at those and then apply a little bit of our own internal intelligence to that to come to our expectations for our plan. But we think those folks are directionally correct.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just one last one for Jim on Beef. So can you just help us understand what, on the Beef side, what's the underlying assumption for industry economics? I mean, you're saying you're going to have a similar year, as compared to this year, next year in Beef. What does that assume for the industry margin, if I may? Because I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about how the industry is playing out because obviously, we came -- we're coming from a very bad year for the industry last year. There seems to be a major improvement that's happened in the last 5 months. I don't know how much of that is seasonal. I would love to get your perspective. But what is the underlying industry margin assumption for you guys to have a similar year compared to this year?","James V. Lochner","You're not probably going to like my answer, but, again, the industry margin is the relative greater change of revenue all-in, cut out, drop, et cetera, to the cattle price and the adjustment week-to-week and month-to-month relative to the revenue to the supply. So we did see the slaughter capacity change. I actually -- we don't place as much emphasis watching the industry margin as you might think. We really always just pay very close attention to what the forward supply is going to give us, what we think the pricing and positioning needs to be, what the export markets are and then a whole lot more attention onto what we have under our own control, which is mix change, international mix change, yields, term yields, et cetera. So my view is the industry margin should be very -- it should be similar simply because we've seen the adjustment that I mentioned. But the margin that we focus on is within our control. So I can't give you any more perspective than that.","Operator","Next question, Ken Zaslow, Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just 2 questions. One is a housekeeping question. One is more a bigger picture. In terms of your corn estimate, does that include basis or exclude basis?","Donnie Smith","It includes basis. That's all-in. And we always talk about cost of good -- what the grain impact in cost of goods sold. Not receipts, not purchased. It's always cost of goods sold.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great. And then takeaway from Prepared Foods -- look, you made a couple of smaller acquisitions. You're on the kind of reviewing or restructuring your business. What is the cadence to which we should start to see the improvement in that business through 2014, and when will we see it kind of hit? I'm assuming in the first half, it will be lower margin. By the back half, we may see more representative of what the real margins are. Can you just walk us through that?","Donnie Smith","You're exactly right, Ken. The lunchmeat deal has been pushed out another quarter or so to get to the full run rate. And so the front half is a little bit like what we're seeing now, but then a lot of this stuff starts really kicking in, in the back half. And then you get to layer on what you would expect is a good year on '15. So some help in '14, more help is coming in '15 and beyond.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Would you think that, that cadence for 2014 is representative of the entire company as well? It sounds like that -- just how you're talking about the corn and the feed cost getting better as we go into the back half of the year, it almost seems like you're going to be building through the 2014 as well because you said, on average, this quarter is representative, you times it by 4 or whatever, that's kind of the guidance you've given us as an outlay. But it seems like it's more like you're going to be growing your momentum through the year, and you can expect to see the growth continuing into 2015.","Donnie Smith","Yes, that's a good way to look at it.","Operator","Our final question comes from Ann Gurkin of Davenport.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted -- one more question. If you could talk a little bit about Prepared Foods and what it takes to get back into the normalized margin range for that business.","Donnie Smith","So we're investing in our Prepared Foods business in a lot of ways. Some staffing. We're doing some consumer spend. We're doing some customer spend. We obviously have a big operational spend in that business. And recall that Prepared Foods, for us, is a broad range of not only products but different businesses at different stages of maturity. We've got some businesses in Prepared Foods that are mature and that generate great returns and others that we're building, and they will begin contributing significantly as we move out front. So we've got some gas in our portfolio: ethnic, handheld, snacks. And we're going to continue to invest in these businesses. I like to look -- I like to think of Prepared Foods a lot like our Chicken business a couple of years ago. And we've made steady progress on not only the operational side of that but now driving the value-added sales mix and incorporating more market talent and more map spend into that business to drive it. And that's the exact same thing that we'll use in Prepared Foods. We've got great customer penetration. We've got great distribution capabilities. We've just got to broaden the portfolio, improve the operating efficiencies and then spend against some demand that we feel like we can generate.","So that concludes our call.

This team is empowered to accelerate growth and deliver results while maintaining our commitment to sustainability.","Our algorithm for growth continues to be 3% value-added sales growth and high single-digit EPS growth annually over time. Our 2018 value-added growth of 4.2% exceeded our goal. EPS was $6.16, an increase of 16% over last year, including $0.78 from tax reform. We exceeded our revised guidance due to strong finish in the fourth quarter in the Beef and Pork segments. We faced several hurdles in fiscal 2018, including freight costs, trade disputes, market volatility, pricing pressures and demand shifts. It's worth noting that despite trade disruptions, U.S. beef and pork volumes were up 12% and 7%, respectively, versus last year as global demand for U.S. protein remained strong. In 2018, Tyson's overall return on sales was 8.2% as we drove results with our strong team, differentiated portfolio and diversified business model. ","Our Beef and Prepared Foods segments performed very well, both on an operating income and return on sales metrics. We integrated AdvancePierre Foods while acquiring Original Philly; Tecumseh Poultry; and Smart Chicken brand; American Proteins, which is a rendering and blending business; and pending regulatory approval, Keystone foods. With protein at the center of our strategy, we divested several nonprotein businesses, including Sara Lee Bakery, Kettle, Van\u2019s and TNT Crust. Safety is one of our key metrics, and we reduced OSHA recordable incidents by 20% this year. We see a direct link between safety and our low turnover rates. And given the tight labor markets we're in, it's important to be the employer of choice in our plant communities as we focus on continuous improvement in safety and productivity.","We achieved $253 million in Financial Fitness savings in 2018 versus a goal of $200 million. Going forward, Financial Fitness savings will be included in our base earnings and return on sales guidance rather than reported separately. We'll continue to track savings internally, but we've decided to eliminate the expense and considerable staff time required to report audited figures. This decision aligns with our commitment to control costs while allowing us to focus on delivering growth.","2018 was a challenging but productive year as we executed our strategy and built on the solid foundation of our diversified model and growth strategy. And now I'll give you some details about our execution at the segment level. The Beef segment generated record operating income of $348 million and an 8.9% operating margin in the fourth quarter. Compared to Q4 of last year, sales volumes increased 3.4%, while average price decreased less than 1%. For the fiscal year, Beef produced just over $1 billion in operating income, also a record, with a 6.7% margin. Volume was up 3.1%, while average price was up 1.2% for the year. Beef results were stronger than expected, driven by good cattle supplies, strong domestic demand and increased global demand. In addition, we have improved our performance relative to USDA benchmarks. ","Our goal is to grow value-added beef through Case Ready and premium programs to help de-commoditize more of our business and reduce some of the volatility. With cattle supplies looking good next year and into 2021, we expect the Beef segment to produce an operating margin above 6% again in fiscal 2019. In the Pork segment, for the fourth quarter, we generated operating income of $76 million with a 6.7% margin. Revenue was down due to a 2.7% decline in volume and 14.5% lower average sales price. For the year, operating income was $374 million with a 7.7% margin. Revenue was down as volumes declined 2.1% with price down 4.8%. The supply-demand imbalance of hogs that we spoke of last quarter continued the first several weeks of our fourth quarter but improved with the seasonal increase in hog supplies. And according to publicly available data, we clearly outperformed the industry on a revenue-per-head basis.","As with Beef, we're growing -- we're working to grow our value-added Pork business through Case Ready and premium programs. We'll continue moving more of our pork into Prepared Foods to reduce volatility, which is a key advantage of our diversified business model. As we look to fiscal 2019, we expect the operating for Pork segment to be around 6%. The Chicken segment generated operating income of $182 million in the fourth quarter and a 5.8% operating margin. Sales volume was up 10.4%, driven by acquisitions, while average price decreased 7%, resulting from the changing product mix from acquisitions, increased domestic protein supplies and lower export prices. For the year, the Chicken segment's operating income was $947 million with a 7.9% margin. Volume was up nearly 5%, again mostly due to acquisitions, while the average price was roughly flat for the year.","With a product mix that's diversified across sales channels and bird sizes and more value-added than our competitive set, our Chicken business is well positioned for the difficult pricing environment has continued into fiscal 2019. We'll continue working to improve our mix and our cost structure, which are the focus of many of our capital projects. In fiscal 2019, as we integrate several businesses, we expect an operating margin near 8% in the Chicken segment. Our outlook doesn't include the Keystone acquisition, which should close sooner than originally expected. ","Our Prepared Foods segment continues to perform well and, in the fourth quarter, produced a record $235 million in operating income with an 11.2% margin. Average sale of price was relatively flat, while revenue and volume decreased following the sale of noncore businesses. For the year, operating income was $979 million with an 11.3% margin. Volume was up 4.1% due to acquisitions, net of divestitures, with average price up 6.1%. We're excited about the performance of our Prepared Foods businesses as innovation continues to deliver sales growth. Jimmy Dean Simple Scrambles, for example, is maintaining its strong performance in its second year with consumer repeat purchases that are best-in-class. Hillshire Snacking delivered a 32% increase in sales dollars. We have a very strong pipeline of Prepared Foods innovation planned for 2019, and I encourage you to take a look at our slide presentation to see some of those new products. ","As we continue to grow volume through our base business, in addition to innovation, we expect Prepared Foods operating margin to exceed 11% again in fiscal 2019. ","I'll now ask Stewart to take us through the financials.","Stewart Glendinning","Thanks, Noel, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter EPS of $1.58, which includes a $0.20 tax reform benefit, was up 10% compared to Q4 last year. Revenues in the quarter were down slightly to just under $10 billion as average price was impacted by trade disputes and increased protein supplies. Sales volumes were up 2.7%, driven by acquisitions. Operating income was $831 million, down about 8% versus Q4 last year. And total company return on sales was 8.3% for the quarter. ","For the fiscal year, earnings were $6.16, up 16%, including $0.78 from tax reform. Sales were $40 billion with volumes up 2.5% and price up 2.1%, while operating income was approximately $3.3 billion with an operating margin of 8.2%. Operating cash flows for the year were just under $3 billion, up approximately 14% over last year. Capital expenditures were $1.2 billion as we invested in growth and efficiency projects with expected returns greater than our cost of capital. Depreciation and amortization were $943 million in fiscal 2018. ","We repurchased approximately 5.9 million shares for $427 million in 2018. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 23.5% and 23.6% for the year. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 2.3x. Including cash of $270 million, net debt was $9.6 billion, and total liquidity was $1.4 billion as of year-end. Net interest expense was $86 million in the fourth quarter and $343 million for the full year. We received around $275 million of incremental cash flow in fiscal '18 as a result of tax reform. ","Now turning to fiscal 2019. Our capital allocation priorities will continue to focus on driving shareholder value and growing the business. We are committed to our investment-grade credit rating and will work to pay down debt as we deploy cash to grow our business organically and through acquisitions. We'll continue to return cash to shareholders through share buybacks and dividend growth. In fact, the Board of Directors has increased the quarterly dividend payable on December 14 to $0.375 per share on our Class A common stock. We anticipate the annual dividend rate in fiscal 2019 will be $1.50 for Class A shareholders, a 25% increase over 2018. ","In fiscal '19, we expect top line sales of approximately $41 billion, an increase of about $1 billion over 2018. Cash generation should remain very strong. We're planning approximately $1.5 billion of capital expenditures in fiscal '19 with spending focused on growing our business. We expect these investments to deliver substantially more than the cost of capital.","Net interest expense should approximate $350 million in fiscal '19 before any impacts from financing the Keystone acquisition. As Noel mentioned, closing of the Keystone acquisition is likely to be sooner than previously expected. We are confident in our ability to finance the transaction, and we'll be ready to focus on integrating the business. We expect liquidity to remain above our minimum target of $1 billion in 2019. ","Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 23.5% in fiscal 2019. Based on our average share price in Q4, we expect our average diluted shares to be around 367 million before any share repurchases. As Noel said in the news release this morning, based on current assumptions, we believe fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings will be $5.75 to $6.10 per share. That's comparable to fiscal 2018 results if you exclude the $0.13 in earnings per share generated by the businesses divested in 2018. ","Now some of the assumptions we're making in our guidance are that there's no further movement in the grain markets, the chicken price deterioration and that we're able to continue recovering increased freight costs through pricing and that there are no extraordinary labor pressures. Although not in our current outlook, we also expect the Keystone acquisition will have financing and integration costs in 2019 as well as recognition of intangible assets, and therefore, we anticipate Keystone's accretion on an adjusted EPS basis to begin in fiscal 2021. However, we expect Keystone, as with our other recent acquisitions, to be immediately accretive on a cash basis. 2019 is going to be another great year focused on driving growth as we integrate businesses, carry out CapEx projects, drive cost savings and generate cash to create shareholder value. ","That concludes my remarks. Now back to Noel.","Noel White","Thank you, Stewart. 2018 was challenging, but it was a good year. Looking at publicly available data, we're outperforming the competition in all segments. We made three acquisitions and completed four divestitures to better position us for long-term growth. We're actively integrating the new businesses, and we're ready to hit the ground running with Keystone. We're excited about the platform for global growth that Keystone will provide in addition to its strong domestic operations. ","Based on current assumptions, our outlook for fiscal 2019 is comparable to 2018. We expect another good year but not without challenges. However, we remain confident in our ability to execute and deliver growth over time because of our diversified business model, our broad product portfolio, our strong innovation pipeline, our differentiated capabilities, our tremendous financial position and the expertise and experience of our team members. These are advantages and how we will generate growth, both organically and through acquisitions, both domestically and internationally. ","This concludes our prepared remarks. Phil, we're ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays.","Benjamin Theurer","Now one of the questions I was having and looking at your guidance 2019, would you describe the outlook as somewhat conservative? Because it -- basically, I mean, midpoint, adjusting for the one-timers and so on, it's like kind of calling for zero growth in earnings. So just to understand why you came up with somewhat a conservative guidance here, and then I have a follow-up.","Noel White","Yes, Ben. This is Noel. I'll take the question. The outlook is, as we see it today, Ben, so there's a lot of variables are in place, and it's really consistent with the past approach that we've taken based on everything as it stands today. If, however, that changes, our outlook could change. And at this point, it looks like some of the headwinds and tailwinds that we face are in relative balance. Again, profitability -- profitable growth is a key focus for this team as we look into 2019.","Stewart Glendinning","The only thing I'd add, Ben, is just to say if you looked at last year, of course, the first half of the year was better for Pork than the second half of the year, we're going to have to overcome that comparison as we enter the first part of the year. So I'd say, underscoring what Noel's emphasized here, this is the best estimate we have for the moment, okay?","Benjamin Theurer","Okay. And as you said, actually, Stewart, on Pork would be my follow-up question. So late July, early August, when you updated your guidance for 2018, the implications post and what we saw in Q3 was basically for a much worse environment on the Pork side. I mean, implicitly, it was basically guiding to a 0% margin in the fourth quarter. Now you actually reported an almost 7%. Could you elaborate a little bit on what had changed, actually, through the quarter than what you were expecting late July, early August, which triggered some sort of a meaningful reduction on that specific segment? So what has been better? And what do you think, how is this going to evolve into 2019 fiscal for you?","Noel White","Yes, Ben, this is Noel. I'll take the question. In July and August, there's a large number of variables have that were in the markets. We had a number of trade disputes that were taking place. We had some planned expansion in production capacities that didn't happen as quick as what we anticipated. And frankly, our exports continued to be very strong, very robust in light of all of the trade disputes that you're reading about. So that's, frankly, continued as not only through Q4 but into Q1 as well. October was a little bit lighter than what we expected, but November has been a solid month for us.","Benjamin Theurer","Okay. So basically, actual was just -- it was -- it never got as bad as you initially expected?","Stewart Glendinning","I think when you look at the stats, Ben, you'd see, and to Noel's point, June and July the margin was really, really compressed. We had all of the trade noise. And it just wasn't clear to us what was going to happen. And if you look with the data after that, the spread got much, much wider, and we wanted to make sure we were in a place where we gave a range that we felt was a good estimate at that time.","Operator","The next question comes from Heather Jones with The Vertical Group.","Heather Jones","So my first question is on Chicken. You guys mentioned that one of your key assumptions is that chicken price deterioration ends. So I don't know if the answer is linked to that, but just wondering, given where your margin came in for the -- for Q4, sub-6%, wondering what gives you confidence that you can get close to 8% in fiscal '19.","Noel White","Yes, Heather, this is Noel. I'll take the questions. A couple of things, Heather. As we came through 2018, there was a number of somewhat extraordinary events that we encountered. The freight increase that we talked about last quarter, at that point in time, we had not fully recovered the freight. We're still working on doing that. We recovered a large portion of it. That's work in process. We had some live production issues that, I think, that we spoke about as well as in the rest of the industry. We had a fire in one of our large complexes that we had to overcome. And frankly, we had some production-related issues that we had to address as well. We feel good about where we're at right now as we look into 2019. There are some headwinds, you've mentioned one of those, being pricing. Grain is better than what it was when we put our plan together. It's still higher than it was a year ago. But based on what we have for visibility right now, Heather, it looks like we should be someplace close to that 8% number.","Stewart Glendinning","The only other thing to add, Heather, is we'll have the benefit, of course, of a full year of API this year. And of course, to a lesser extent Tecumseh, but that's where we are from an estimate standpoint.","Heather Jones","And for my follow-up, I was just wondering if you could share with us your view of -- on African swine fever. Just wondering if you could give us a sense on what your view is right now of the severity of the break in China and the potential implications for Tyson, the entire business at Tyson.","Noel White","Yes, Heather. This is Noel again. I'd say that the effect at this point is unknown. It has the potential to be a significant event. As you're well aware, African swine fever has existed in parts of Eastern Europe for a number of years. The fact that it's now in China and appears to be fairly widespread has the potential to make a significant impact. We've not seen that at this point. So unless it would become much wider spread than what it is today or if it would move into other global markets, then it could have a significant impact.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Piken with Cleveland Research.","Michael Piken","Yes. Just wanted to touch a little bit on the Beef side. And you guys obviously had an extraordinary quarter. And just getting your outlook, normally, the first half of the year is seasonally weaker. But how sustainable are some of the improvement in margins? And then as a follow-up, how do you see the 2019 features playing out between Beef and Chicken? Seems like Beef got a lot last year. How does 2019 seem to be shaping up?","Noel White","Yes, Michael, this is Noel. I'll take the question. You know, as we look at 2019, 2020, even in 2021 we frankly we don't see a lot of change. The supply appears to be relatively stable. We have a good sense of what that looks like just due to the calf crop that gives us good visibility for at least a couple of years. We're not seeing liquidation at this point of the cowherd, which is an early indicator of what can affect us 3 or 4 years from now. It looks like it's plateaued, or at least stable. Beef demand through 2018 was strong, both domestically and in the export markets. U.S. industry exports were up 12% year-over-year. Ours exceeded the 12%. So global demand for beef continues to be very strong. So it is unusual the fact that volumes go up and pricing go up at the same time. We don't see anything at this point that is going to be any different in 2019.","Operator","The next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson","Maybe continuing on Chicken and going back to the pricing comment. Can you talk a little bit about your actual exposures to pricing changes from here in the business? You participate in so many segments, you have the Prepared for the processed chicken as well -- and the buy versus grow. So sometimes we struggle to -- where -- can you talk about the commodity price sensitivity in the Chicken segment and how you see it lining out through the next 12 months?","Noel White","Yes, Adam, it's difficult to give you a specific answer because we do have a great number of pricing scenarios with many different types of customers. And the pricing pressure that I spoke about is -- was not -- is not necessarily across the board on all products. As an example, in some of the different channels that we participate in, we don't see the pricing pressure. Same thing would be true in our value-added products. We're not seeing that type of pressure. However, in some segments of our business, there is pressure. I think others have spoken about that. We're seeing the same thing. And it doesn't -- I mean, it doesn't happen all at once. Our pricing agreements are varied throughout the year. So we have some agreements that are coming to now. We have others in the spring and others in the summer. So when I talk about pricing pressure, that's not necessarily for our full fiscal 2019, and it's not in all segments.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. Adam, I think Noel's absolutely right on this one. It's one of the reasons why we give guidance just so that we can help to try to sort through the impacts for you. I would say that the best you could do probably is to look back at pricing over time and then model that against our earnings. That's going to -- or against our top line. That's going to give you some sense of the sensitivity.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. So maybe I'll just take this a different way. And it's again a continuation, sort of Heather's question a little bit different light. In the second half of this fiscal year, your Chicken margins were a little bit over 6%. You're expecting them to get to around 8% in fiscal '19, and in the first half, second half, breakup of the comps are very different. How much of it is simply the absence of some of the negative one-timers that you had in the last couple of quarters versus fundamental improvement in your net margin or net price realization, underlying productivity, kind of net cost recovery from some of the inflationary pressures you had? Just help give us some of the pieces that get us from where you were in the second half of this year to where you expect to be for the full year of 2019.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes, got it. Okay. Well, Adam, I'm a little reluctant to sort of break out our P&L for next year. But I'll just point to some of the bigger items. And I think if you just looked at the impact to us last year, from a freight perspective, that's one of the largest impacts in our Chicken business. You think about the live costs that Noel talked about, those are probably the two biggest areas that we don't expect to repeat for this year outside of the impact of pricing. And that's probably the easiest way to look at the business. ","I'm sorry, I'm just going to go back and just -- I just want to make sure, Adam. I know you've sort of come out of the queue. But specifically, remember that as we took those big pricing -- took the big freight increases last year, it took us until the back part of the year until we had pricing in place to start to overcome the increases in freight. We are expecting to see some amelioration of that freight increase in this year. You've seen fuel prices coming down. But our run right now looks a lot better than it looked in the first half of last year.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jacob Nivasch","This is actually Jake Nivasch on for Rob. One of my questions was actually kind of answered regarding freight. But I just have one quick one. Last call, you guys mentioned that you were guiding to $42 billion in sales for '19, and now we're looking at $41 billion. So I'm just -- if you guys can just provide any color as to why the specific guide down there. I know you guys kind of regarded -- you covered some of the headwinds, but just any additional information would be great.","Stewart Glendinning","I'd probably say that the biggest impact is going to be meat pricing. And what really matters for us, of course, is the margin. And you're going to see those meat prices sort of varying. We're very focused on making sure that managing the margin is where we're focused. So I'd look for the margin line, not to the top line.","Operator","Okay. The next question comes from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies.","Lubi Kutua","This is Lubi filling in for Akshay. Just a quick follow-up on Chicken. I know your guidance assumes no further price deterioration, and you're also cycling some of those extraordinary items that you mentioned, which gives you the confidence of reaching that 8% margin target. But are you concerned at all about a possible acceleration in domestic supply growth, which could further upset the balance between supply and demand? I mean, from our perspective, it seems like there are quite a few factors like new capacity, sort of a growing breeder flock and potential improvements in bird productivity that could potentially lead to faster supply growth, so just curious to get your thoughts on that.","Noel White","Yes, Lubi, this is Noel. Yes, we agree that we are, in fact, expecting increase in production over the course of the next couple of years. Our projected domestic disappearance is in the 1% to 2% range, right? And that's fairly consistent with the demand growth that we have seen in the United States over the course of the last 20 years. So yes, production's increasing. It does depend on the timing of when the plants open, when they come online. But over the course of the next 2 or 3 years, which is kind of the timeframe that these facilities are being built and coming online, we're projecting demand to grow at about the same pace as production increases.","Lubi Kutua","Got it. That's helpful. If I could ask another question on M&A. So there have been a few news articles recently, and I know you can't comment on those, but that have suggested that Tyson is placing an increased focus or emphasis on international growth. Can you just comment on how you're thinking about international growth longer term? I mean, it seems to us that most companies have had some challenges in international, given the volatility in FX and geopolitical uncertainty and also your own challenges in international. So just any thoughts about how you're thinking about international growth longer term.","Noel White","Yes. I can take the question. The -- we're forecasting about 90% of the growth in global protein demand will take place outside the United States. We do plan to participate in that demand growth as we see economies grow and develop. I think you saw the first step, which is Keystone, which gives us a solid base to build from. My priority is no different than what Tom or my predecessors have been is to grow our business in Prepared Foods, value-added products and in the international market, simultaneously working to provide stability with more of the commodity portions of our business being segments of our Chicken, Beef and Pork businesses.","Stewart Glendinning","And the only add, I would say two things. One, acquisition or expansion of any business comes with risk. And I don't think if you looked at any of the large CPG companies in the world that are global that you would add advocate that they shrink away from this global market. So we think we're going to pursue that growth, and we're going to do it in a sensible, a financial way. And that's my second point. This is a company that's using a very return-focused lens as we look at opportunities to expand our business, and it will be no different internationally than domestically.","Operator","The next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Jihan [ph] on for Alexia. Just a quick question in terms of the current trade [indiscernible], in terms of how the ongoing trade negotiations are kind of affecting your outlook on the industry. So overall, it seems like the North American trade disputes have been largely resolved by now, but the U.S.-China negotiation's still going on. I know China is not a big market for you, but how do you expect the uncertainties to expect the overall supply-demand?","Noel White","Yes, you cut out in the first part of your question, so I'm not sure I caught all of it. If I understand correctly the question is with NAFTA.","Unidentified Analyst","With NAFTA somewhat resolved, yes.","Noel White","How does the trade issues China -- how is that expected to impact us? Is that...","Unidentified Analyst","Exactly.","Noel White","Okay. I'd say that with China, there's nothing but upside at this point. We're not currently shipping product to China, beef, pork or poultry. So if there is any change, I would say that, that would provide upside export potential for us.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Just a quick follow-up on China. So understanding China is not a big market for you, but how does that affect the overall supply-demand? Is there still kind of an increased domestic protein supply because of the trade issue with China?","Noel White","Yes. To answer your question, Jihan. We think that as we look into fiscal 2019, in total, domestic available protein is going to be up about 1.8%. On a per-capita base because of population growth, that's up a little over 1%. So yes, some growth in per-capita protein available. However, I mentioned the export numbers, I think, specifically on Beef, which was up right at 12%. On Pork, it was up 7% as an industry. Again, our numbers exceeded both the industry benchmarks. So despite all of the trade disputes, global protein demand, our exports continue to grow and increase. So part of the equation with domestic disappearance is exports. There is upside potential to the current forecast of what's in, plugged in, for exports.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets.","Kenneth Zaslow","With that, what do you think your biggest contribution will be in 2019 and beyond?","Noel White","Good question, Ken. It's really the continuity of what Tom had put in place. It is, in fact, to profitably grow our value-added businesses. There was a question earlier on International expansion. That's certainly a component. It's growing this business in a profitable, sensible way while containing some of the costs that have crept in as well. So we have an extraordinarily strong team. We have a really solid base. We have great cash flow. So all of the initiatives that have started with sustainability, adding and growing our business, that's my focus, Ken.","Kenneth Zaslow","Okay. And let me just ask. So do you think that total promotional dollars across foodservice and retailer has changed? And if the promotional dollars were actually not shifted to Chicken -- or not shifted to Beef and Pork, do you think your overall possibility would have been any different? So just said differently, does it really matter where the promotional dollars are spent, if it's spent on Beef, Chicken or Pork? And does it affect your overall Tyson profitability?","Noel White","No, I really don't think it does, Ken, because some of the features that we saw in 2018 where it, seemingly, beef was promoted more heavily at foodservice than poultry. If the promotions would have been on poultry rather than on beef, we would've gained on the poultry side. And that's truly advantage of the portfolio that we have between Beef, Pork, Poultry and Prepared Foods, that we play in all sectors. So it really didn't make a difference to us if Beef was promoted more heavily than Chicken. And if that would happen to switch in 2019, we'll benefit on the poultry side to the detriment of potentially on the Beef side.","Kenneth Zaslow","Okay. And just my last follow-up is, when you think about Beef for 2019, is there any reason why you shouldn't be at the same levels as 2018, particularly given that you had one quarter that was kind of particularly weak? And given that we've had, call it, two decades of a down cycle, why would we not have at least 2 to 3 years of an up cycle? And I'll leave it there.","Noel White","Yes. Ken, as we look into 2019, no, our results are not expected to be much different than they were in 2018. The fundamentals are very similar looking into 2019, as to what we just had. So now we're really not expecting any sizable changes. And in the Beef business, it can vary from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. Cattle can be pulled ahead, they can be pushed back. So what we may fall short in one quarter, typically, we'll make up in the next quarter or vice versa.","Operator","Okay. The next question comes from Jeremy Scott with Mizuho.","Jeremy Scott","So you mentioned that you maintain the Financial Fitness commitment, but you're no longer reporting the synergy targets separately. I guess, how do we square that with the fact that your Prepared Foods margin outlook doesn't seem to be meaningfully different than fiscal '18? I appreciate that's an open-ended target, but given that you're removing that disclosure, maybe you can elaborate on some of the headwinds and tailwinds there. And just will you be rethinking those targets post-Keystone? Should we be waiting for that to close? I guess, I'm struggling with why it's an arduous task to track cost savings versus your targets.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. So Jeremy, let me handle that. The issue, actually, in reporting is that every project needs to be audited. And there's a huge administrative effort with a lot of paperwork that, frankly, isn't giving investors any return. Having said that, I mean, the savings programs are absolutely vital to our performance as a business. And we remain fully committed to ensuring that we continue to save those dollars, and our teams are actively working on all of the same projects. When you think -- one of the questions we get all the time is how much drops to the bottom line and, as you rightly point out, there are a number of factors at play. And so when you look at the Prepared Foods business for this coming year, we know, for example, that there will be a fairly good chunk of increased meat costs in that business. How do we pay for some of that? Well, obviously, we'll look to get some pricing. How do we grow our bottom line, is that we need to continue to drive cost savings.","So easiest thing for us to do is to continue drive hard at the cost savings and to bake that into the return on sales guidance that we give to you.","Jeremy Scott","All right. And just maybe a follow-up on the M&A, open to more international opportunities as a way to diversify against some of the softness domestically. So I guess, first, are you seeing that there is an oversupply of meat and meat products as a structural issue and not a cyclical one? And if so, why the step-up in growth CapEx? And then second, given some of the stops and starts that may give investors pause, what's different about your approach to driving returns in international? And is Keystone the springboard here to a new demand-led strategy? And of course, why is anything better than buying back when your stock at 10x the low end of your guidance?","Stewart Glendinning","Okay, well there was about eight questions in there, but let me see if I can get a some of them, and if I leave any out, you can come back to me. So look, let's start with a buy back and say that we have, as a company, used an approach, which has pulled all of the capital -- all of the capital allocation levers, right? We just announced a terrific increase in the dividend that is great for shareholders. We bought back almost $500 million worth of stock last year. We've invested in M&A, and we've invested in really strong CapEx projects. So we're going to continue to use all the levers, and I think that, that is a good approach for our business. ","Relative to International, Noel's point is that when you look at growth in the world, where is the growth going to be in the world? 90% of the increase in protein consumption is going to come from outside the U.S. So we want to participate as a global food player, and remember, we sell almost $5 billion worth of product overseas already. That's a big number. If we want to participate in that growth. We are going to need to sort of a broaden our platform. That doesn't mean that we will do that any way that we can. It means that we'll bring a great deal of financial discipline to that expansion. You're right, Keystone is a platform, and Keystone is a powerful platform, a well-run organization that drives good margins with good customers in good geographies. And we certainly should expect to leverage that platform as we grow our international business. That said, we aren't going to ignore opportunities at home. There are lots of opportunities domestically, and we'll bring the same kind of M&A lens that we've used historically to focus on opportunities that are here. So if I've left any of your questions out, let me know.","Jeremy Scott","That's good. If I could just squeeze in one more. It seems like you talked about the promotional activity picking up here. And you mentioned that you're starting to see it maybe in both the foodservice and retail space. Certainly, tracking the QSR space, seems like there is momentum all of a sudden. But can you clarify where that strength is emanating? And I wonder if Chicken pulls a little margin back from the Beef segment in the upcoming quarters.","Noel White","No. I don't think it'd be appropriate to comment if it's coming in Beef or Chicken. And we don't have the degree of visibility until, in many cases, the promotions are -- have already put in place. So I'm going to avoid the question.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes, look, sorry, I'll just go back to that. We shouldn't forget, and I've been in this role now almost a year. But one of the questions I got pretty aggressively when I first joined the company was how did I see Beef, and beef was such a laggard. And actually, the point that was -- has been made before I arrived and will continue to be made is that this is a bit of a three-legged stool, and so things work together. And so in terms of the promotions, if you're not promoting Beef, you're going to be promoting one of the others. And the good news is since we're playing in all of the areas of protein, we're going to be able to take advantage of promotions are in play.","Operator","The next question is a follow-up from Heather Jones with The Vertical Group.","Heather Jones","So I wanted to follow up on your answer to Ken's question. I'm a little confused because in my years of covering Tyson, the Beef business has been characterized as more of you guys managing spread, and you've done a great job of managing spreads. And things can get squeezed there when liquidation's going -- ongoing or whatever, whereas the Chicken business is more of you valuing up and less of a spread business. And so when you get less feature activity at retail and thus less demand at retail, and then that product has to be sold into more commodity-type market, so to me, the way I've always understood this company is that you have a better ability to manage the spreads in Beef business, but you -- demand is much more critical to Chicken. And if you got the demand there, you're going to be able to extract higher margins from that demand than you would from Beef demand. So it would seem like to me, you would prefer an environment where Chicken is getting the preponderance of the features. And so -- but based upon your answer to Ken, I think I've, like, been misunderstanding this all these years. So I'm hoping to get some clarification.","Stewart Glendinning","So I mean, historically, of course, you're right that Beef margins have not been as powerful as Chicken. And it's true, we would like to see Chicken performing well. The point that we were making is that it's not disastrous when product shifts from one of the proteins to the other. It's the benefit of having a diversified portfolio. So I hope that answers your question. I don't think you're misinterpreting the business. It is worth noting, and you will have seen in our slides this morning that there is a great deal of focus in our Chicken business in our value-added products. And you will see that in terms of the kinds of new products that we are rolling out. All of that innovation is focused at the higher end of the margin. That doesn't leave Beef out. In fact, in Noel's comments, he purposely pointed out that we were focusing very heavily on developing our Case Ready business. We have previously commented in our earnings releases about attribute-based products that we are driving from a Beef prospective. So, it's not only in Chicken that we're looking to value up. We're doing the same things in Beef although coming from a -- obviously that base of value-added is smaller as we grow it. Does that help?","Heather Jones","It does. And just a quick follow-up on Keystone. So you made the comments in your prepared comments that it would be accretive by 2021. Excluding deal-related costs, but just looking at it on a GAAP EPS basis with incremental D&A, et cetera, financing costs, but excluding any nonrecurring transaction costs, what kind of impact are you anticipating for '19 and '20? Neutral, dilutive or how should we be thinking about that?","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. I mean, I think we've made it clear that we expect it to be dilutive. The biggest driver there is increased D&A as we revalue the assets and pick up the various amortizable intangibles, that will have an impact. The reason I pointed to the cash number is because we are very focused on what those cash returns are doing, and that will be immediately accretive as soon as the deal closes. And by the way, sorry, Heather, one other thing. Obviously, as that deal closes, we will give you more that's a better picture of the business when the deal closes.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Noel White for any closing remarks.","Noel White","First of all, thanks for joining us this morning. Thanks for your interest in Tyson Foods.

Mr. Kathol, the floor is yours, sir.","Jon Kathol","Good morning, and welcome to the Tyson Foods, Inc. earnings conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2019.

For reconciliations to our GAAP results, please refer to this morning's press release.","I'll now turn the call over to Noel White.","Noel White","Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Our earnings of $1.20 per share and a 6.3% operating margin demonstrate the strength of our diversified business model. The Prepared Foods segment's results were a Q2 record, and the Beef and Pork segments executed well despite several significant weather events. Although parts of our Chicken segment have challenges, we are past what is typically our toughest quarter, and we're driving changes to improve our results.","As we move ahead with the integration of Keystone Foods, I continue to be encouraged by the opportunities we see both domestically and internationally. The integration process has gone well, and we're leveraging the international operation and the team's expertise as they strengthen our capabilities. We're confident in our ability to achieve our announced synergies as we improve efficiencies and optimize supply chain and production resources. Pending regulatory approvals, our acquisition of BRF Thai and European poultry operations is expected to close in our fiscal third quarter, and we're looking forward to this addition to our growing international business. ","Moving to our segments. In the second quarter, Prepared Foods continued to perform very well with the $249 million in operating income and a 12.3% return on sales, which is yet another record. Prepared Foods was up 16% in operating income and relatively flat on volume and average price when excluding the divestitures of several noncore businesses last year. Our year-over-year increase in MAP spending and innovations investments have resulted in volume growth and net share gains. Our Core 9 categories are up an impressive 5.3% in volume over the last 13 weeks, and all categories are showing year-over-year increases. An example of this growth is Jimmy Dean frozen breakfast foods, which continues to grow at impressive rates with volume and dollars up over 6%. ","We expect our Prepared Foods input cost to increase in the third and fourth quarters as beef and pork prices rise on concerns of the African swine fever outbreak in China. Our plan is to recover these additional costs through pricing, but it will take some time. As a result, we're adjusting our annual outlook for this segment to be between 10% and 12% return on sales. A key advantage of our end-to-end supply chain is that we can supply raw materials for value-added divisions and our customers when supplies are tight. ","As we previously announced, we are launching our full-scale initiative to enter the alternative proteins space. We'll be introducing products this summer and early in the next fiscal year, and we're well positioned to capture growth in this space. We have a deep understanding of how to develop new products, brands and categories, and our distribution reach will allow us to move quickly into the marketplace.","I'll move on to the Beef segment, which is performing well, having operating income of $156 million and a 4% margin in what is typically our most volatile quarter. Average price was up 2.3% and volume increased 3.2% compared to the second quarter last year on improved cattle availability and strong demand.","The herd rebuilding continues, and we see ample cattle supplies into 2021. The quality of cattle has improved with record choice and certified Angus rating indicating improved genetics, which aligns with our growing premium beef programs. ","We recently announced that we'll be using DNA technology to trace beef back to the individual animal of origin for our Open Prairie Natural brand of Angus beef. The process will assure customers that their Open Prairie beef was sourced from ranches where cattle were raised to specific requirements such as No Antibiotics Ever and no added hormones. Global demand for high-quality beef continues to be strong, and we expect our international beef sales to grow in the second half of the fiscal year, contributing to the Beef segment's margins of approximately 7% for the year.","Turning to the Pork segment. Operating income was $100 million with an 8.5% margin. Average price was down 8.3%, while volume was up 1% due to the improved availability of live parts. News of African swine fever in China, along with the increased slaughter capacity in the United States and the near-term impact of driving up hog costs, initially outpaced the value of pork. We are achieving reasonable returns despite the headwinds while improving our spread to the USDA industry benchmarks versus a year ago. Our ability to execute well is due in large part to record high retention of our frontline team members, which has improved both safety and performance. ","We currently project the Pork segment's operating margin for the fiscal year to exceed 6%. It is difficult to predict when ASF might positively impact our Pork business. However, we believe any financial benefit will likely occur in late 2019 or later. We are well positioned to be agile and meet customer and consumer needs internationally and domestically. In the Chicken segment, operating income was $150 million with a 4.4% margin. Volume was up 26.2%, and average price was down 11% primarily attributable to the acquisition of the American Proteins rendering business last year that added considerable volume at relatively low prices. ","In the second quarter, pricing began to improve as AFS news drove incremental demand for chicken. We are in a solid position to improve pricing as we talk to customers about contracts in 2019 and into 2020. The big and small bird businesses performed well, offsetting some of the tray pack underperformance and earlier market weaknesses. In addition to the benefit of moderating grain prices, we have identified opportunities and several initiatives are underway to significantly strengthen the Chicken segment's results. Led by the iconic Tyson brand, our Chicken business has a great foundation, great products and robust pipeline of innovation. The Chicken segment is improving, and we're expecting an operating margin of around 6% for the year and continued improvement into 2020. ","That concludes my commentary on the business segments. Now Stewart will take us through the financials.","Stewart Glendinning","Thanks, Noel, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter EPS of $1.20 was down 6% compared to Q2 2018. Revenues were up $670 million to $10.44 billion. Volume was up 11.6%, and average price was down 4.8% as acquisitions and divestitures affected sales volume and changes in product mix affected pricing in what is typically our most challenging quarter. Operating income was $654 million, down 5.4% compared to the second quarter last year. Total company return on sales was 6.3% for the quarter driven by continued headwinds in parts of our Chicken segment partially offset by growth in Beef, Pork, Prepared Foods and other. ","The Keystone acquisition has performed as expected in the short time we've owned it. It is right at breakeven on a cash accretion and income basis. As a reminder, we successfully secured our permanent funding for the acquisition during the second quarter through issuance of senior notes with an average maturity of approximately 16 years.","Our operating cash flows for the quarter was $71 million, which were about what we expected due to deferred capital and hog payments and two tax payments that are typical to our second quarter. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $63 million. We also directed $338 million toward capital expenditures as we continue investing in growth and efficiency projects with expected returns greater than the cost of capital. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 18.5%. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 2.9x. Including cash of $360 million, net debt was $12 billion, and total liquidity was $1.9 billion at the end of Q2. Net interest expense was $114 million. Weighted average shares outstanding in Q2 were approximately 366 million. ","For the remainder of the fiscal year, our primary capital allocation priority will be our debt. We have $300 million coming due at the end of this month and $1 billion in August. We expect to address those with our cash flows as well as existing or new short-term liquidity as needed to align with the timing of the maturities. In addition, we will continue to deploy capital for organic growth through CapEx in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion for the year. We plan to scale back our spending to the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion range in fiscal 2020 while spending at a rate higher than depreciation. ","And finally, I'll update our outlook for 2019, which includes Keystone but doesn't yet include the BRF operations as that transaction has not yet closed. We expect sales to grow to approximately $43 billion with the addition of Keystone. Keystone is expected to be accretive on a cash basis for the year and breakeven on a pretax basis when excluding transaction and integration costs. The additional amortization for Keystone will be about $26 million for the 10 months of fiscal 2019 and approximately $35 million per year in fiscal 2020. Net interest expense should approximate $450 million. Liquidity is expected to remain above our $1 billion minimum target. Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 22.5% for the year. And we're maintaining our earnings guidance of $5.75 to $6.10 per share. ","The potential financial impacts of ASF have not been included due to the uncertainty of the timing. Much is uncertain where ASF is concerned, but we are proactive in our preparedness as a global business and in a strong financial position that affords us the agility and opportunities that few other companies have. Broadly speaking, we expect the impact of ASF to be positive for Tyson. ","Now we'll return to Noel for additional commentary. Noel?","Noel White","Thank you, Stewart. This is an unusual, perhaps unprecedented time for the protein industry. In my 39 years in the business, I've never seen an event that has the potential to change global protein production and consumption patterns as African swine fever does. The situation is fluid and fast-moving, but we're working with others in the industry, government agencies and producers to prepare in the event ASF spreads to North America.","A worldwide decrease in pork supply could put pressure on our Prepared Foods business by increasing raw material costs while offering significant upside to our Pork, Chicken and Beef businesses. The power of our diversified business model and broad product portfolio across more world geographies will be even more important under these circumstances. ","Thinking back to similar instance like PEBB in 2013 and BSE in 2003, we've been able to manage through difficult situation and maximize opportunities when continuity of supply becomes even more important. I believe there is no company better positioned than Tyson Foods to handle what lies ahead. ","That concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question we have will come from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens Inc.","Benjamin Bienvenu","Noel, I wanted to follow up on your concluding comments that you made on African swine fever. So you've decided not to update your guidance this morning with respect to ASF, which is understandable given the timing is -- of the impact is tough to gauge. But the comments you did provide were pretty constructive. So I'd love to hear any comments that you can make about what you guys are doing operationally and strategically to position yourselves for the event. And then if you could provide any more detailed thoughts on each of the major segments with respect to ASF, that would be helpful for us.","Noel White","Okay. Ben, it is a matter of timing and how that impacts both 2019 as well as 2020. And I do think that Tyson Foods is uniquely positioned in all of our proteins, in our Beef business, our Pork business, our Chicken business because you don't have an incident like this where there's some place in the vicinity of 150 million to 200 million hogs that have died in China that there's not a significant impact. That correlates to about 10 million metric tons of product that has come out of the marketplace. And from a total protein global supply, that's something in the area of 5%. So it's an event that I've never seen happen before, that we are well positioned to deal with that in all 3 proteins. ","There's a couple of things that we're doing, Ben, in reaction to that. First and foremost, we want to make sure that this disease doesn't reach the United States. So there has been activity with the industry and the U.S. government to ensure that we're doing everything possible to keep the disease out of the United States and then react to that if, in fact, it does hit the United States. So it is an opportunity, I would tell you, for not just our Pork business but all 3 species.","Benjamin Bienvenu","Great. That's helpful commentary. And my second question is related to the Prepared Foods business. Obviously, a strong first half with respect to operating margins. But you've maintained your full year guidance range of 10% to 12%. In light of the strong results that we've seen in the first half of the year, I think to get to the bottom end of that range, we would have to see in the ballpark of 8% margins. So I'm curious particularly given that the full year guidance doesn't yet reflect ASF, which you noted put pressure on profitability, just any commentary you can provide on the Prepared Foods business as we move through the rest of the year would be helpful.","Noel White","Yes. Ben, I'll go back to my original comment on timing. Really, we have seen pork prices start to move in reaction to ASF, but the hog prices have risen faster than what product prices have. When product is in fact produced on a large scale for China, that product will come out of the U.S. market and prices are expected to escalate fairly rapidly. So it's a matter of predicting when that might take place, whether that's Q3, Q4 of our fiscal year or into calendar 2020. So the 10% to 12% range that we've given, that is down slightly from where we're at and it is an anticipation that pork prices will begin rising through Q3 and Q4.","Operator","Next, we have Alexia Howard of Bernstein.","Alexia Howard","So my first question is about the Walmart announcement of plans to backward integrate on the Angus beef supply. And I'm just wondering, this tendency for the retailers to make those kinds of backward integration moves, we've had Costco doing something in chicken as well, how do you think about that? And how do you make sure that, strategically, Tyson can continue to win even as the retailers start to think about those kinds of moves?","Noel White","I think we win by continuing to service them to the greatest extent possible with great product and service. And I hate to comment on any specific customer, but Walmart has been a very strong customer of ours for many, many years. It is a segment that is extremely complex. We will work with them to the extent that we can in assisting in any way. But our business is strong with Walmart, and they've been a great partner for many years.","Alexia Howard","And then just as a follow-up. The plant-based, you talked about an upcoming launch in, I guess, a second generation of plant-based, I'm assuming, burgers or something similar. Do you have -- do you already have an idea of how quickly you'll be able to scale distribution on most products? And what's the kind of feedback that you're getting from the retailers on that front?","Noel White","The product will enter the market yet this summer, Alexia, on a fairly limited basis and on a much larger scale later this fall. So we will be introducing the product this summer in a fairly limited basis and then on a much larger basis once we get into October and November.","Operator","The next question we have will come from Heather Jones of The Vertical Group.","Heather Jones","So I had a quick question on your Pork business. I was honestly a little surprised to see you raise your guidance there. And you mentioned something about improving your spread to USDA benchmarks because Q3 to date, margins have been contracting also. Just wondering, have you reworked some of your hog contracts? Or can you help us understand how you've been able to improve your relative performance and have that confidence? Because you made a comment in your release about hog prices running faster than the cutout, but then you raised your guidance for the year. So just could you help us understand the thought process behind that?","Noel White","Yes. The Pork business continues to operate extremely well, Heather, that as I mentioned, our turnover numbers are down. Our safety numbers are greatly improved. Productivity is much, much better. So operationally, we're performing exceedingly strong. However, the markets, they have risen substantially, both the hog markets as well as product markets. We saw the effect of that in Q2. We're seeing that in the beginning of Q3, that according to public information, margins are less than what we would like right now. However, we do believe that as we move through Q3 into Q4 and particularly in Q1 of next year, margins will become much, much stronger.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. Heather, it's Stewart here. One other quick comment that's worth noting is that, obviously, as we project the back half of the year, we have the benefit of knowing what came in the first half of the year. We had a strong Q2. We came in at better than 8% in Q2. So that factors into our confidence for the full year despite the pressure that we're seeing in Q3.","Heather Jones","Okay. And then my follow-up is on the Chicken business. So this is I think the second time that guidance has been tweaked. And it's also the second time that Tyson's -- second quarter that Tyson's margins have sort of moved in the opposite direction of the industry. So I was wondering if you could help us understand what is going on there and what is being done to address it. Did the demand catch you off-guard and you had to buy more product on the outside market? Or just help us understand what's going on and how that's going to reverse course into late '19 and 2020.","Noel White","Yes. Heather, no, there wasn't anything specific that affected the Chicken business. I would tell you that as we came through Q2, that was seemingly the low end of the market as it often is. Prices have strengthened as we've moved through Q3 and -- for Q2 and into Q3. And I alluded to the fact that there are a couple of issues in one specific segment in our business that is in the process of being addressed. But it's purely driven by market factors primarily as well as, to a lesser degree, some performance issues.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. One other thing I'd just throw in there, Heather, you saw in Q3 -- and we don't normally get into sort of our -- all of our mark-to-market. But in this quarter versus last year, last year, we had a gain in our mark-to-market hedging on grains. We had a loss this year, and the delta between those 2 had the impact of a couple of percent on our number. So that's worth noting as you consider what went on in the quarter.","Heather Jones","A couple of percent, like on the percentage marks, is it like 200 basis points in margins or a couple of percent on the absolute dollar amount?","Stewart Glendinning","On the margins. But it's meaningful.","Operator","Next, we have Ben Theurer of Barclays.","Benjamin Theurer","So just quickly following up on Howard's question in regards to the Chicken segment. So clearly, you've done the acquisition with Keystone pending Brazil Foods. I'd say timing was very good on those acquisitions. Now looking on how things evolve, and obviously now you getting this more international footprint, could you elaborate a little bit on your expectations for that Chicken segment once you start integrating further the businesses and the opportunities you're seeing in terms of be it margin stability or just growth opportunities in the Chicken segment also in the light of most likely people or some customers switching from pork into chicken? So just a little bit of an update on what you're seeing with Keystone and then later at this stage with Brazil Foods, that will be my first question.","Noel White","Yes. Ben, the integration work has gone extremely well through both the domestic as well as the international parts of our business. There have been nothing disruptive, I would say, that it is exactly on plan. Domestically, it's a very stable business for us. The margin structure is relatively stable. It complements some of the other business that we currently have. On the international basis, it solidifies the position that we have in China. It gives us a strong foothold in Thailand as well as other parts of Southeast Asia. So it's been no surprises so far and has delivered according to plan.","Benjamin Theurer","Okay. Perfect. And then a follow-up would be on Beef. I mean, clearly, there's been a little bit of short-term volatility in cattle pricing because of the weather disruption we had at the beginning of the year. It was just too cold and all those kind of things. So it was surprisingly strong still, the margin throughout the quarter. So what have you done in terms of securing some of the live supply? And how do you feel in terms of the third and particularly then also the fourth quarter in terms of input costs? And if you look for a route, how do you think the whole Beef business is going to turn out? Because that's been one of the very strong segments lately, so I would assume that it's going to continue to be the case. But is there anything you've been doing in terms of contract hedging and so on just in order to secure some of the supply here? And what have you done particularly in the quarter to maintain margins at that relatively strong 4% level?","Noel White","Okay. From a supply standpoint, Ben, there is nothing unique that we have done most recently. Many of our source and supply are long term in nature. So either we have normal contracts or informal. So the Beef business has evolved to a large extent over the course of the last 10 years or so, where there is a greater knowledge of where the cattle are going to come from as well as, from a producer side, the fact that they know that we're looking for unique characteristics in some of the cattle. So the evolution has been that we have a number of customer agreements and we have to source the cattle that aligns with the type of product that they're looking for. So to do that, we have long-term supply agreements. ","So with that, I don't see any substantial change as we look at our Beef business. Q3 and Q4 are typically strong quarters for us, and I would expect the same thing this year. So as we came through Q2, as you said, it's often the most volatile quarter. There was weather disruption. But as we look into Q3, Q4, it looks like there's both good supply of cattle in the regions in which we operate as well as strong demand going into Q3 and Q4. And I would say the same outlook for 2020, that there's nothing on the horizon at this point that would change that. If anything, it could be stronger than what 2019 has been.","Operator","And the next question we have will come from Robert Moskow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jacob Nivasch","This is Jake Nivasch on for Rob. Just a couple of quick questions. So several years ago, I think you guys reduced your exposure to the chicken export market to reduce commodity volatility. And I guess going forward, do you guys need to operate differently in order to capitalize on the rising export demand related to ASF? And then I have a follow-up.","Noel White","I think when we talk about chicken exports, historically, that's largely been chicken leg quarters. And you are correct, that we have decreased the amount of total products that we are exporting, specifically leg quarters that we are deboning many of those today and adding more value to those products. So it has been done intentionally. And no, there is no plan to switch back to producing more leg quarters and exporting them in the market. There's greater value in satisfying domestic demand than producing leg quarters for export.","Jacob Nivasch","Got it. That's helpful. And then just one other quick one. So how quickly can the Prepared Foods division raise prices? And I guess, specifically, are there any product lines or channels that can raise price faster than others?","Noel White","I think it's going to be somewhat across the board. It's -- whether it's beef prices, pork prices, really all input prices are expected to increase. So don't think in terms of one specific type of product in prepared. With the increase in export demand, it will affect all proteins not only in the United States but on a global basis. So as you look at export information of what countries are shipping to what destinations, as an example, you'll see Australia has increased beef exports to China. With that, United States has historically been an importer of particularly lean beef firm from Australia. Prices have gone up significantly. So it's affecting not only our markets and not only the pork markets but global markets in all species.","Operator","The next question we have will come from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson","Maybe first I wanted to continue just in the Chicken business a little bit and just understand the performance in the quarter and the reduction on -- or the tempering of the margin outlook there. I'm presuming, Noel and Stewart, that you're alluding to market pressures in the tray pack segment. And just maybe can you give a little bit more color on the market pressures you're facing there and then as well just a little more color on the operational challenges that you faced?","Noel White","Well, the markets are trending up, Adam. So as we came into Q2, that was probably the low end of the market. So as we came through January, February, that was the low. They've improved since then. So that's a bit of a tailwind. So I think the worst is behind us, Adam. We're seeing demand improve a year ago. We saw lot of beef features planned for grilling season. This year, there seems to be more poultry plan than what there was a year ago. So from a demand perspective, it seems to be in a very different position than we were a year ago. ","On the operational side, I would tell you that there's nothing that is profound that's -- with the number of facilities that we operate. There are always some unique challenges and there just happens to be a couple of challenges in one segment of the poultry business right now.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. So just to be clear then, the tempering on the margin expectations for fiscal '19, is that more a reflection of the actual first half performance? Or did your expectations on margins in the second half of the year come down at all?","Noel White","No. It's really the first half.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. That's helpful. And then just thinking about ASF and the impact -- the potential impact in Chicken where this is the segment you're vertically integrated in. And so one would naturally think there's the most operating leverage to an inflationary environment, but you also operate in a lot of different segments. So maybe just help us think about where -- size kind of how we should think about inflation benefiting the Chicken business given the offsets in the prepared poultry business, some of the grain -- or the cost-plus contracts that you have in different market segments as well and just frame kind of what that opportunity would be.","Noel White","Yes. Adam, it's going to benefit all 3 species, beef, pork and poultry. And it will be to the detriment of prepared on a short-term basis. Now in time, those increase in costs will be passed along, but there is a timing issue. So that is the reason that we tempered the Prepared Foods earnings outlook and the reason that we are, in fact, a little more bullish than what we were on Beef, Pork and Chicken not only through the balance of 2019 but into 2020.","Operator","Next, we have Michael Piken of Cleveland Research.","Michael Piken","Yes. Had a couple of questions. The first one is if you could provide us an update on the status of your new chicken plant. And then the second question is if you could provide us an update on the status of the financial fitness cost savings. Just I know you're not specifically tracking it, but just if things are still on track and if it's still right to put in $200 million a year in savings.","Noel White","Yes. Michael, both are on track. There's the plant that we announced in Tennessee. Construction is proceeding as planned. There's -- not being delayed. It's on budget. So no change there. And then the financial fitness, that's just part of our business today, Michael, that we are not breaking that out specifically. However, I would tell you that is part of our fabric. We do track that internally. We don't talk about it externally. But yes, I think it's fair for you to build that into your model.","Stewart Glendinning","The only thing I'd add, Michael, is just on the cost front, I think Noel mentioned it earlier, but all of the acquisitions, as we integrate those, the synergies are coming in as planned as well so cost coming out on a number of fronts.","Operator","The next question we have will come from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman","Two questions for me. First, regarding ASF, I'm curious, what do we know as an industry? And what is still up in the air? Obviously, we know that hundreds of millions of hogs are gone, but I'm curious what your research is telling you about, A, I guess, whether China has been able to slow down the spread of the disease at all; and B, to what extent China is maybe building out some chicken production to offset the gap in hogs.","Noel White","Ken, that would be speculation on my part because there's nobody that knows the exact situation in China. I think the reports that we all read, that you have to accept those at face value. There's quite a range, as you know, that's -- it's being quoted anywhere from 20% of the herd to 30-plus percent. So on an equivalent basis, that's more than the entire hog production in the United States on an annualized basis, but there's nobody that knows exactly how many hogs are affected. ","And are they increasing poultry production? I would say probably to the extent possible. However, as you know, there's been some limitations within China on the breeding flocks. So it's not as easy. It's just saying that we're going to start raising more chickens. And you have the factor that the predominant form of chicken that's consumed in China is a yellow bird. It's not the white bird that we produce here. So it's a different type of product than what we're accustomed to. So it's not as though you can turn off pork and turn on poultry. It will be multiple years before the supply balance comes back into equilibrium.","Kenneth Goldman","No. That's helpful. I do appreciate the candor. I don't think anyone does, though, but I figured if anyone might, it might be Tyson. But it's hard to know, I'm sure. And then my second question is I just wanted a clarification. When you are talking about pricing catching up a little bit later as a result of higher hog costs, are you talking about pricing in your Pork segment as well as your Prepared Foods segment? Because I understand the delay, the inevitable pricing on the Prepared Foods side. But in Pork, at least historically, there just hasn't been much of a lag ever in the timing on pork and hog prices. So I wanted to get a little bit of a sense of what you were forecasting there.","Noel White","Yes. It would be some of each. It would be both in our Pork business as well as our prepared business. And if I move just specifically to the Pork business, as news of ASF became a little more widespread, the futures market made significant gains so futures were higher, and as a result, hog prices went up as well even though product prices didn't. So there can be periods of time that the live markets can leave product markets or vice versa. In this particular case, the live market did get ahead of the product market so there is a lag that is taking place right now. ","And then on the product market, I think you clearly understand that as right -- as prices rapidly rise on the input side, the price recovery, there's a lag in capturing it. So by the end of Q3, Q4, it should be pretty well priced into the market. On the prepared side, it might change slightly lower.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. It's worth noting maybe that on the prepared side, the team has already started to go out to the market with some price increases. So that team is well prepared and already taking action.","Operator","Next is Jeremy Scott of Mizuho.","Jeremy Scott","Just back on the Chicken margin. I think the key thing I have been wrestling with since the Keystone acquisition or probably even before that is the weighted average duration of your chicken contracts or how your customer-centric model limits your ability to pass through pricing. So I guess, in other words, if commodity chicken prices were to rise by 10% tomorrow, say, by government decree, how long would that take to roll through your model? And to what extent would your business mix inhibit your realization of that price?","Noel White","Jeremy, there's not an exact way to answer that question because we have many, many different types of pricing models. So it's not as though we have fixed-price models, that we have priceless models, that we have a model that allows immediate pass-through. We do sell some on a spot basis, but we have many different models. So it's not as though we sell one way and the lag is going to be 2 months or 12 months. So there's -- I can't give you a specific answer to that. It will take time to pass on through. But that's been done intentionally, Jeremy. That we have set up various pricing models with many different types of customers to provide stability in our earnings so we don't have the volatility that more of the commodity-oriented players have. ","So we will not reach the highs in the market when commodity prices go high nor will we reach the lows. We're looking for a more stable earnings stream, and that's the way that our pricing model has been set.","Stewart Glendinning","And one of the reasons why I think it's best, we have the benefit obviously of pretty detailed models internally to be able to see where things are going. And it's why we -- it's one of the reasons why we prepare a detailed financial forecast for you in terms of giving you that heads up. I would also say it's worth noting that in the quarter, whilst you saw some weakness in Chicken, just reflect on where the return on sales were for all of the other businesses, and they look really good.","Jeremy Scott","All right. Just on the Pork side, I think there's maybe some -- it's difficult to think that I don't know how your plants would -- how much of your plants will be able to export pork to China if it were to come to that. Would you be willing to work with your hog suppliers to remove ractopamine from your supply? And can you describe how that would impact your product from a yield and quality perspective?","Noel White","The answer, yes. Yes. Definitely, Jeremy. We would be working and have worked with our supply. We do produce ractopamine-free product today, and it's an offering that we make into the market both for domestic as well as international use. And we do work with groups of producers for us to do that. We can expand that program. So the answer would be yes. We have the capability on a large-scale basis to meet those international demand. However, I would tell you, we will balance that with the domestic customer base that we've serviced for many years and plan to continue to service. So some companies might view this as opportunistic. We don't. We view this as a mobile, long-term event. And we will structure our business to service not only the international markets as though we have in the past but continue to service our domestic customers as well.","Jeremy Scott","Got it. Okay. Can I just ask, to the extent that you can, can you give any update on the class action case? It seems, from your disclosure in the Q, it looks like the DOJ has issued a grand jury subpoena on discovery document. So this has been a civil matter here for three years. Was there anything that precipitated the government's involvement recently?","Noel White","No. All I can say, Jeremy, is that we're disappointed that it went this far. But I'm not going to make any comments on any pending lawsuits.","Operator","Next, we have Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.","Michael Lavery","Could you just give a little more color, when you said that you're not factoring ASF into your outlook, but then I think you're also trying to be -- to account for some of that in a little more cautious view on costs in Prepared Foods, would it be right to characterize your guidance as trying to capture at least the cost increases you have the visibility on without the pricing benefits? Is that the right way to think about that context you're working in?","Noel White","I think that would be accurate, Michael, because it is a matter of timing, right, because we have seen raw material prices that have moved higher. It has had an impact on Prepared Foods, but we've not seen the corresponding reaction in the livestock prices. So we do think that there will be an expansion that will take place in beef, pork and poultry. It's a matter of if it's in fiscal 2019 or if that moves into 2020.","Michael Lavery","Okay. That's helpful. And just back to your comments about the U.S. And obviously, if it came here, I think it's been very clear that would be a major problem. But there hasn't seem to be a lot of talk about that. Do you have any reason to believe -- that has seemed to me very unlikely. Is that a fair characterization? Or how would you quantify the risk around that?","Noel White","I think there's a real risk that, that could take place. African swine fever has been -- we've been aware of circumstances globally for a number of years, 10 years, 15 years. But it has spread rapidly in the course of the last 12 months not only in China but throughout other parts of Asia as well as Europe. So I think the threat is real. And I do think there is a distinct possibility it could come to the United States, and we need to be prepared for that. We need to be prepared from a regulatory standpoint. ","When we had high path AI in this country a few years ago, the industry and the government quickly mobilized. We need to take that as a lesson and use that in the case that it does come here as well as from a trade standpoint in trade -- in talking with our trade partners about regionalization and the fact that it doesn't matter if it's in the United States or within Europe or any other country, that it should be on a regionalized basis.","And we do have meetings that have and continue to take place with industry associations, with the government as well as those in the pork business. So there is a coordinated effort that has been underway for the last 60 days or so.","Operator","And next, we have Eric Larson of Buckingham Research Group.","Eric Larson","I just want to follow up on the grain impact on your margins in the chicken sector for the second quarter, 200 basis points down. But when you now look forward, maybe it's not going -- it would not be a positive yet for your third quarter, but we're going to start anniversary-ing some of these high grain costs. They started coming down in June last year pretty sharply. I would think that grain, particularly meal, could start becoming a tailwind maybe fourth quarter. I mean that assumes the prices stay where they are on the spot market and whatever your hedging practices or purchase forward practices have been. But maybe this is more of a 2020 positive event. I mean how should we look at the forward structure of your grain input cost as opposed to what happened in Q2?","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. Look, so a couple of comments on Q2, and then we'll talk about the future. So looking back at Q2, just pure grain prices in Q2 were slightly higher than the same quarter last year. And then, of course, you had the impact of this timing gain in the first quarter last year and the loss this quarter -- this year. How those play out into the future, of course, will depend a little bit on the grain prices themselves. I think actually, the key answer to your question lies in your point at the end, which is the assumption around price. When we gave you the expected return on sales for the business, we're making assumptions both around our hedging, the price of grains that we expect to pay and then the commensurate prices that we're getting in the marketplace. So there's no sort of easy answer to just say, well, price of corn will be down and therefore, we'll be making a lot more money. We've sort of woven all of that price and cost of corn into the forecast that we've given you.","Eric Larson","Okay. So if you just take the price of corn and soybeans today, which translates into the meal, et cetera, we're at really historical lows. We still got a lot of supply coming in globally. But I would suspect, at some point, there's maybe more upside risks, maybe not near term, than it is more downside. So would this be an environment where you'd get more aggressive? It seems like the market is short -- pretty short on both the commercial side as well -- we know the noncommercial is very short. So wouldn't it seem that there might be more upside risk to that pricing outlook? And then I'll pass it on.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. Look, potentially, I think the real thing about grains is it's an input that we have to take. We take that into account in our pricing, and our hedging is not in any way speculative. It is designed to take the volatility out of the grains that we use in our business. And so over time, you will see our hedging in a rising market will slow that impact, and in a falling market will delay the benefits. But I don't think that you will see any sort of dramatic change in action. Otherwise, we're just entering a sort of trading game, which is not our business.","Operator","And next, we have Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal.","Kenneth Zaslow","Just a couple questions, I'm sorry. First, are there any structural issues with your Chicken business that you would not be able to get back to 2016 levels if the market permitted?","Noel White","No. There is not, Ken. No structural issues. We do have a few specific plants that are not performing at levels that we would want, but nothing on a structural basis. The team knows where the opportunities are, and they are after those opportunities.","Kenneth Zaslow","Okay. And then I think you said last quarter that you would expect profit to grow in 2020. And obviously, we did not have African swine flu back then. And you didn't say exactly the number, but you said that you'd expect it to grow given all the things you're doing. Is that still a fair comment, excluding African swine flu fever?","Noel White","Yes. It would. Even excluding African swine fever, Ken, I think the outlook as we look into 2020 would be positive for several reasons. One, the cattle herd is at least stable, if not still slightly growing, but the growth has leveled off. However, global demand continues to be extraordinarily strong. So exports have been good. Domestic demand has been very strong as well. ","Moving over to Pork. We -- as we came through 2019, there was several new plants that came in line. So capacity increased at a greater rate than what hog production did. We are seeing growth in hog production. So I think that, that delta that we saw change in 2019 will come back in closer balance. So I think that's a positive on the Pork side. ","And on poultry, as I mentioned, we started the year -- Q2 was not a particularly strong quarter for us. But for the year, we're going to end up at about 6%. And it looks like as we move into 2020, it has the possibility of being something stronger than that. ","So all three businesses in addition to our prepared, which has had several record quarters, continues to perform exceedingly well. So no, all parts of our business look good at this point, the last component being our International business. Our legacy International business continues to strengthen. It's -- we are at breakeven or better at this point. And historically, that was a segment that did not make money. It cost us money. So that is a change in our business as well.","Kenneth Zaslow","Just on International, I know it's a very small part, but I have a lot of questions. But International, you will be at a run rate of a profit by the fourth quarter. Is that a fair assessment? Or -- yes. Is that fair?","Noel White","Yes. Yes, that's fair, Ken. And that is excluding Keystone. That would be our legacy business that we would be on a run rate to make money.","Kenneth Zaslow","Okay. And my very last question is promotional spending. You have seen that change in the industry towards chicken. Is that one of the reasons that you think that the Chicken margins have improved from current levels absent any sort of African swine fever impact? Is that a fair assessment? And can you give some anecdotes? And I'll leave it there.","Noel White","I think that it's because of the alternative protein. Well, proteins other than chicken. So as an example, beef prices are significantly higher than what they were a year ago. So as an alternative, I think they've chosen to promote more chicken this year than what they did a year ago simply because of the price of beef. I mean, the beef cut-out is something, let's say, $2.30. So it's extraordinarily strong. So as they look at what they want to feature, chicken is a great value right now. So I think that's the primary reason more so than the MAP spend that's going against it.","Operator","At this time, we will go ahead and conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Noel White, President and Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks.

If you object, you may disconnect now.","I will now turn the call over to Jon Kathol, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jon Kathol - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Tyson Foods' conference call for the third quarter of the 2015 fiscal year. On today's call are Donnie Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer and Dennis Leatherby, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our remarks today include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. I encourage you to read the news release issued earlier this morning and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of the risks that can affect our business.","This morning, we will be referring to our third quarter adjusted operating income and EPS. The company uses non-GAAP results such as adjusted EPS, adjusted operating margin and adjusted operating income to provide investors with a better understanding of the company's operating performance by excluding the impact of certain nonrecurring items affecting comparability.","Please refer to today's news release for a full reconciliation of our GAAP to adjusted results. As always, we'll have a Q&A session following our prepared remarks. To ensure we get to as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, and then get back in the queue for any additional questions.","I'll now turn the call over to Donnie Smith.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Well, by now you've seen the results in our press release, so I'll start by saying that there were four areas where we over delivered and one that was a negative. The four positives are that synergies are ahead of expectations, Prepared Foods exceeded forecast, the Chicken segment exceeded forecast, and cash flow was $864 million allowing us to reduce net debt by $688 million. The one negative was that Beef under-delivered our expectations by $84 million. We could not offset the quick and substantial impact of Beef in the quarter despite the significant progress across the rest of the portfolio, and I'll talk more about that in my commentary on the operating segment.","Synergy capture from the integration of Hillshire Brands is going extremely well. We have raised our estimates last quarter to more than $250 million this fiscal year, and now we're on track for about $300 million, largely driven by operational improvements in the Tyson legacy Prepared Foods operations. The majority of the synergies, $79 million for the quarter, fell within the Prepared Foods segment, where we continue to rewrite the cost structure of the business.","In the third quarter, Prepared Foods produced record adjusted operating income of $197 million, with an adjusted 10.9% return on sales. Volume was up 77% reflecting the addition of Hillshire Brands, and average sales price was up 13%.","The fundamentals in this segment remains strong and we continue to focus on a long-term growth and brand building. We anticipate our retail margins will moderate a bit in the fourth quarter as we spend against the national launches of Hillshire Snacking and Ball Park jerky, as well as increased MAP spending behind innovation and the base business. We'll also see an impact from price reductions in some product lines to respond to commodity declines, particularly in pork raw materials.","Our strategy is to protect margins over the long-term while maintaining competitive price premiums versus the competition in the market. Our actions will set us up for a strong 2016 when we should reach the low end of our new range of 10% to 12% a full year earlier than originally planned.","Moving on to the Chicken segment, operating income was $313 million with an 11.4% return on sales. Operating income for the last 12 months exceeded $1.2 billion. Volume was up 3%, while average sales price was down 5% versus Q3 of 2014. The Chicken segment should finish strong with an operating margin of around 12% for the year. And despite disruptions caused by export bans and predicted supply increases, we expect our Chicken segment to perform at or above the top end of its normalized range of 7% to 9% again next year.","We're pulling innovation projects forward and adding new ideas to the pipeline that include dark meat utilization. Most of these products will fall into our Prepared Foods segment for branded items like Aidells Sausage, Ball Park Flame Grilled Chicken Patties, and a host of foodservice applications. So, we're excited about the opportunities there, not just for the short term, but for the longer term as well.","Turning to the Pork segment, operating income was $64 million with a return on sales of 5.3%. Volume was down 5% due to the sale of our Heinold business in Q1 and average sales price was down 28%. Excluding the divestiture, volumes were up 3% versus Q3 of 2014.","Exports continue to be a challenge. A strong dollar, lower prices from the EU and Canada, and the West Coast port slowdown have been contributing factors. Despite all of this, we still came close to being in our normalized range for the quarter.","Expansion of the hog herd has been taking place as expected, and it should continue into 2016. With productivity improvement, we expect 3% to 4% more hogs and more pork on the domestic market, which should be a positive for our Prepared Foods segment. Demand for pork is strong, especially when consumers compare it to the price of beef. So, we expect our Pork segment to continue to do well and be in its normalized range for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016.","Our Beef segment continue to struggle this quarter, resulting in an operating loss of $7 million. Sales volume was down 4%, while average sales price was up 7% versus Q3 of last year.","There were two issues in the Beef segment that caused the loss. First was the West Coast port situation. There was a significant amount of meat in the pipeline and we sold it at lower values in alternative markets rather than building inventory and tighten up our working capital. This cost us about $84 million in the third quarter.","The second issue began in late May, early June when feedlot margin erosion accelerated. Feedlot slowed the pace of their cattle marketings from the normal 150 days to about 180 days. As a result, we haven't seen the anticipated summer push of cattle. However, the most recent cattle on feed report indicates that there are more cattle on feed than a year ago. Because we run for margin and not for market share, we're not willing to overpay for cattle and we've had to cut back on our hours at our plants resulting in inefficiencies and added costs. In the short term, we are negatively impacted, but markets will equilibrate and conditions are expected to improve for the long term.","Pasture conditions have recovered dramatically and are supporting the rebuilding of the cattle herd. The USDA cattle inventory report released July 24 indicated that beef heifer retention is at 106.5% of a year ago, the largest percent since 1986. Only 32.5% of the cattle on feed were heifers, a record low. The beef cattle herd should have the largest percentage increase since 1980 at 3% or 750,000 head year-over-year. When those cattle come to market, we'll be ready with the plants positioned close to high-density feeding areas, the most efficient operations in the industry and the most knowledgeable experienced team in the business to run them. So while the current headwinds in our Beef segment don't have a quick fix and challenges will continue into 2016, we still believe in the long-term viability of our Beef business.","And for the final segment report, International was positive in Q3 with $1 million in operating income. Average sales price was down 10.5%. Volume was down 25% due to the sale of our Brazilian operation and weak demand in China, partially offset by stronger demand in Mexico. We're still in a holding pattern in China and the sale of our Mexico business closed on June 29, following the end of the third quarter.","Now, let's move from the segments to consumer demand. At foodservice, dollar sales were up 3% for all commercial restaurants, for both the latest year and the latest quarter. The largest growth was in QSR Mexican with QSR chicken showing the second highest growth rate. We expect consumption to continue growing at foodservice.","In the retail channel, fresh chicken and pork remained highly advantage categories. For the most recent year-over-year comparison, fresh chicken volume was up 2% behind 4% higher pricing and fresh pork volume was up 1% with pricing up nearly 6%. But it's important to note that in the near term, the pork situation has changed dramatically.","In the last 13 weeks, pork volume was up 18% with pricing down 12%. The lower fresh pork pricing could translate into slower growth in fresh chicken as the gap in price per pound has narrowed nearly 50% with chicken having a $0.55 a pound advantage to the consumer today versus $1 a year ago. Both ground and whole-muscle beef volume were down behind higher pricing.","Tyson Foods has retail expertise in fresh meats, as well as numerous Prepared Foods and frozen value-added categories. Retailers have recognized our capabilities by trusting us with an additional 30-category captaincies versus a year ago for a total of 95. And they continue to rely on us to provide the insight and leadership to grow their categories. Eight of our non-core business lines are showing positive dollar sales growth in the latest 52 weeks. Five of the nine have realized dollar share growth over that same period.","Jimmy Dean Frozen Breakfast is a notable performer and grew at more than two times the category growth rate, up 15% in the most recent 13-week period. Additionally, our retail value-added poultry business continues to improve and at a $0.55 (10:00) share, is back to category growth levels that's set up well for long term growth. I feel good about the strength of our brands moving into Q4 and 2016, and expect a continued share growth across the majority of our brands, supported by our brands, spend, and closed management of fundamentals.","I'm also excited about our innovation and product pipeline. We judge our success on a vitality index of the percentage of sales from products launched in the last three years. And we're in the best-in-class range in both retail and foodservice. We've got a great line-up of innovation coming in the next several months, and in the next few years, and I expect this to stay best-in-class.","One of the largest platform launches in Q4 is the national expansion of Hillshire Snacking. This platform is highly incremental to the portfolio, leverages one of our strongest brand equity, and will drive category growth by bringing new consumers into the snacking section. Consumer response has been very strong and will accelerate our support for this launch through Q4 as we drive consumer trail with targeted advertising.","Our second major platform launch in Q4 will take the Ball Park brand, America's number one hotdog brand into the jerky category with a point of difference. Our flame-grilled process delivers a uniquely tender jerky that both consumers and customers are enthusiastic about. We have many more new products, new platforms and innovations in the pipeline. And I look forward to sharing those with you in the coming quarters.","As a wrap-up on my comment, I'll say that in the near term, we continue managing the acute issues of beef supply in exports while accelerating momentum in Chicken and Prepared Foods. I think it's important to expand the lens and bring into view some things that are going our way in the year ahead. We have leading brands in growing categories, and we're supporting our brands to maintain our leadership position. Prepared Foods should benefit from favorable raw material prices. We have the number brands of fresh and frozen value-added chicken, and we now have additional tray pack and fully-cooked capacity to help grow these businesses and build on recent market share trends.","Synergy capture is going very well. We're on track for about $300 million this year and expect more than $400 million in 2016 and more than $600 million in FY2017. We generated strong cash flow that we've used to pay down debt, and we expect to reach our leverage ratios ahead of schedule. We think our stock is a great value, so we plan to start buying back shares in the fourth quarter, again, ahead of schedule.","Although we never expected perfect operating environment, most things are going very well and we're positioned for long-term growth. We're excited about what's ahead and we're confident in our ability to achieve at least 10% EPS growth next year and average at least 10% over time.","Dennis?","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Donnie, and good morning, everyone. With record third quarter earnings at $0.80 per share on an adjusted basis, this was our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year EPS growth. Adjusted operated income of $568 million was a 40% improvement over Q3 last year. Our results were in line with our projections, but how we got there was different than we expected.","Revenues grew 4% to $10.1 billion compared to the same quarter a year ago with adjusted return on sales of 5.6%. Year-to-date adjusted EPS is $2.32 or a 12% increase compared to the prior year of $2.07. Operating cash flow through three quarters was approximately $1.7 billion and we spent $636 million on capital expenditures which was $189 million greater than depreciation as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 33.6%.","Subsequent to quarter-end, we completed the sale of our Mexico operation and received $400 million in proceeds, subject to a working capital true-up in Q4. We used the proceeds to retire the 2015 notes last week.","Net debt to EBITDA for the past 12 months was 2.6 times. Net debt to EBITDA was 2.2 times on a pro forma basis when including Hillshire's results for the past 12 months and adjusting net debt for the $400 million in proceeds related to the sale of our Mexico operation. Net interest expense was $70 million during the third quarter. Including cash of $471 million, net debt was $6.8 billion, down $688 million from Q2. Total liquidity was $1.7 billion, remaining above our goal of $1.2 billion. For the quarter, our average diluted shares outstanding were $414 million.","Now, here are some thoughts on the full year of fiscal 2015 and some early thoughts on fiscal 2016. Please note that although our accounting cycle results in a 53-week year in fiscal 2015, our outlook is based on a 52-week year.","We expect revenues of approximately $41 billion for fiscal 2015, which is over 9% growth compared to fiscal 2014. This is driven primarily by a full year of Hillshire Brands results offset by reductions in our International operations. We believe 2016 revenues should be similar to fiscal 2015 as we grow our current businesses to offset the impact of fiscal 2015 divestitures. We expect to capture approximately $300 million from our Prepared Foods profit improvement initiatives and Hillshire Brands synergies in fiscal 2015 and more than $400 million in fiscal 2016.","Net interest expense should approximate $280 million for fiscal 2015 and $260 million in fiscal 2016. We currently estimate our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 34.5% for fiscal 2015 and to be around 36% for fiscal 2016. CapEx is expected to be $900 million for fiscal 2015, and between $900 million to $950 million in fiscal 2016 as we continue to focus on projects that will create long-term shareholder value.","We expect net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of approximately two times by the end of fiscal 2015. Prior to adjusting for any future share repurchases as well as changes in our stock price, which will impact the dilution from our tangible equity units, we expect our fiscal 2015 and 2016 diluted shares to approximate $413 million based on our share price at the end of Q3.","As we have demonstrated over the past several years, our capital allocation decisions are governed by our disciplined focus on driving long-term shareholder value. Our priorities for deploying the significant cash flows that our operations generate are for growing our businesses through organic growth and operation, efficiency capital projects with attractive returns, acquiring businesses that support our strategic growth objectives and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends all while maintaining plenty of liquidity and investment-grade ratings.","Following the Hillshire acquisition, we shifted our priority for deploying discretionary cash toward debt reduction. Strong cash flows have allowed us to make great progress toward fulfilling our deleveraging commitment, and including the notes we paid off last week, we have paid down more than $1.6 billion in debt since the acquisition. Now that the balance sheet has been appropriately strengthened, we're in a position to begin buying back our stock in Q4, which is a full quarter earlier than we had originally anticipated.","As Donnie mentioned, we see compelling value in our shares. Buying back our stock now is a great way to return cash to shareholders while enhancing long-term shareholder returns.","Our Chicken and Prepared Foods segments have driven great results so far in fiscal 2015. However, as a result of the unanticipated export disruptions experienced in our Beef segment in Q3 and its continued margin pressure, we have modified our guidance to $3.10 to $3.20 adjusted EPS for fiscal 2015. While not what we previously anticipated, it still represents growth of 5% to 9% over fiscal 2014 despite the headwinds we faced.","Fiscal 2016 is poised for continued growth in operating income and EPS, and we expect Chicken margins should be at or above the top end of its normalized range of 7% to 9%. Prepared Foods should reach the low end of our new range of 10% to 12% which is a four year earlier than originally planned. Pork margins should be in its normalized range of 6% to 8%. Beef margins should be profitable but below its normalized range of 2.5% to 4.5%. And we expect adjusted EPS growth of 10% plus compared to fiscal 2015.","In closing, we are very focused on finishing the year strong. Our team has been remarkable in coming together and successfully integrating the largest acquisition in our history to deliver another record year for Tyson 2.0. Overall, I am personally proud of the results our team has accomplished to propel us into 2016 and beyond.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, speakers. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is now open.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. I have one quick one and then a longer follow-up if I can. So, first one, are you still looking for, just to confirm, 10% plus earnings growth next year? I was a little confused by the phrasing in the printed document.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Ken, we are. So, here's the way I'm looking at it. So, even if we're a tick or two off this year, when you look at our 2016, nothing has really fundamentally changed and, hey, while it's early, I really expect that anything that we've given up this year would come back to us again next year as we deal with this acute issue in Beef. So that's where we're thinking about it.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, thinking of Beef, if the main issues were marketing delays by feedlots, which we can see in the data, right, and nonrecurring, I guess, port issues if we can, doesn't that suggest the problems are more temporary in nature? Not the Beef doesn't have longer-term issues, but you're getting cattle back next year. The port issues will be cleaned up, so I'm just curious, is that the right way to look at it? Is it really a temporary issue? At this point next year you should be back to slightly below normal, I guess.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Certainly, we're looking at it. I mean, if you look at the most recent cattle on feed data, we're going to have more cattle next year, the calf crop's up. Looks like it's going to be up about 1.2% this year, which portends a fed slaughter of about 1.2% to 1.5% next year. So more cattle are going to show up. The way we're looking at it is, once we get past and get through the \u2013 now what we're lingering \u2013 what's lingering are the supply issue now that we've dealt with the export issues. While it's still a little bit too early to tell, it feels like that if we go back and look at FY 2012 through FY 2014, our margins in Beef were about 1.5%, 2%, something like that, and it feels like, to me, that 2016 is setting up to be about like that range. And so, again, too early to say for sure, but it feels like to us today that these issues are temporary and that next year will be about like what we saw in 2012 through 2014, something like that.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I'm just confused about one thing. It's very helpful. But we knew that the feedlot issue, we kind of thought that marketing delays would be happening, you can see that build up. You still have price mix in Beef up 7% in the quarter. So when these issues, especially the port one that cropped up, was that at the very end of the period? Or was that more evenly spaced throughout the three months?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So let me give you more detail on exactly what happened. So late in May, several of our export customers began telling us that they could not take delivery on their orders. So if you'll remember about that time the cutout was at about $2.60-ish or so, and it felt really toppy to us. And so feeling weakness in the cutout, we made the decision frankly to just resell that product and not take a chance. So we sold it into other markets. And when we look at the price differential between what we had expected to receive and what we ultimately resold it for, it costs us about $84 million.","Now I hasten on to say, I'm really glad we did it because looking back, pricing continued to deteriorate all through the month of June and has continued to deteriorate. You saw a little bump at 4th of July, but we didn't have very good sell-through at all at the 4th of July holiday, so the cutout has continued to erode. So I'm glad we don't have an inventory problem to deal with. Our inventory is in great shape. And as soon as these markets can respond, we'll be ready to do that. Maybe even a finer point, so you've got some items \u2013 I'll give you like a beef short rib or rib short rib or something like that, they command quite a premium in some of the export markets. And so these items today, though, we're having to roll those into our grinds. And so you can't really see it in the cutout, but that's a significant value decline on items like that. So that's what we're dealing with now. Again, we think this issue is acute and hopefully we'll get on through it throughout this quarter.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Donnie.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, Donnie, maybe just continuing on the last point \u2013 upon questioning on Beef, it sounds like the forward view for next year and beyond has not really changed. Is that actually...","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That is correct.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. So I wanted to just clear that up. In Prepared Foods, I mean, the margin performance in the quarter was very strong, well above our expectations and I believe the company's, can you help us think about the outlook where you're guiding? It seems like pretty healthy sequential margin decline in the fiscal fourth quarter and next year only at the low end of the range \u2013 of the 10% to 12% range despite about $100 million incremental year-over-year synergies. It looks like some healthy year-over-year cost tailwinds. Just help us think through what the spending environment in Prepared Foods that's only getting to low end of that margin range.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. So let's start with Q4. So we're launching two new platforms, the Hillshire Snacking and the Ball Park jerky, and we're fully supporting those launches. We're also going to have somewhere between $25 million and $30 million worth of AI impact lingering into Q4, so we'll deal with that. We are increasing net spending for back-to-school in two, three of our categories there. And then we're going to be lower in the price in a couple of categories to make sure that we've managed our price gaps versus our competition to make sure that we stabilize or sustain our growth rates going into 2016. So that's \u2013 Dennis?","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Adam, I'd just add one fine point at Donnie's comment about AI. That's related to the turkey part of our business.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. That's correct. Yeah. Yeah. No leg quarter in Chicken impact there at all, just in Prepared Foods. So that's our Q4. As we go into the fall, we expect to see very good growth in our categories. The categories are very solid. We want to regain some share in a couple, three of our major categories and feel very good about \u2013 if you look at this year's average, we'll probably average around 8% on sales in Prepared Foods for the year and then seeing a 200-basis-points-maybe-plus increase next year while growing that business. That feels really good to us.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then maybe just a quick one for Dennis, if I could. Dennis, can you walk us through how to think about the pace of share repurchases and planning just go into the market, no ASRs or anything like that?","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So the way we're thinking about it is we expect to break through our leverage target of 2 times. So we see that as kind of a sweet spot for us to be in the 1.5 times to 2 times net debt-to-EBITDA. So that being said, that allows us to start buying back stocks, so we're going to start this quarter as opposed to next. And we're going to kind of watch that ratio. So that's really kind of govern how much we do each quarter as we go forward, but should be a fairly significant amount.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Farha Aslam of Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Could we just switch to Chicken for a moment? You've had a very strong quarter guided up for this year. And going into next year, there's a fair degree of confidence in your guidance despite the weak pricing in dark meat. But your guidance is \u2013 previously was at least 9.5%. Is your guidance today a change or pretty consistent with what you were saying before?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, we've tried to stay really consistent at being at or above the top end of the range.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. So your guidance hasn't really changed?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's correct.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","So we could expect next year to be another strong year in Chicken?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We think so. Farha, if you think back over the last two years, three years in our Chicken business, we like the way that we balanced our portfolio across the various bird classes. We spend a lot of time adjusting our pricing strategies to be able to reduce volatility and stabilize our margins. We've been able to grow our value-added mix. Our tray pack business is just doing great. We've spent a lot of work and a lot of time and improved our cost structure.","I think I said on the last call, we reduced our export exposure on leg quarters by 50% over the last five years and we'll continue to do that in the upcoming year. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we've got an opportunity inside some of our Prepared Foods category to move some dark meat there. So the CapEx that we spend against our business is really paying off and making our plants very efficient. So when you combine all that up, it gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to stay at or above the top end of that range next year.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's really helpful. And then in Prepared Foods, this is a bigger, larger business for Tyson. So could you help us understand kind of your amount of marketing spend, you MAP spend, kind of how you're thinking about this for this year and next year, because clearly this is just not a commodity-related margin that we need to just look at. We need to understand how you market these products.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Could you share with us how much your marketing expenditures are for this year and going into next year?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Farha, we target a spend about 5% on sales on MAP in our retail brands. That can fluctuate a little bit depending on the timing of innovation, if we're making some price changes and that type of thing. Well, a notable example of that would be this Q4. We're launching two new product lines. We're supporting those with MAP. We're increasing our MAP spend a bit this quarter for back-to-school. So, it'll fluctuate a little bit, but over the year, our target is 5%. And I think it's really important for investors to know that we're going to maintain our investment in brand building.","And when a brand is ready for MAP spend we're not going to pull back from the brand-building commitment. And that's why going into 2016, we feel very good about moving from 8% return on sales in Prepared Foods this year up to about 10% plus or so next year, while maintaining a very good growth posture from that point forward. We've got a great innovation pipeline behind these brands that we'll continue to deliver to the marketplace over time. So that's kind of our whole view.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. A question on Pork. Obviously you \u2013 the Street had your percentage margin in fiscal 3Q higher than where you came out. That shortfall might have been higher for the Street than what you're internally budgeting. But why was that margin down sequentially and from a year ago and you're saying 6% to 8% for 2016, how quickly can you get back within that range? Thanks.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think the real change for us we saw more imported pork into the U.S., and frankly into other markets where we ship products. A bit more than we expected, and that caused our Pork margins to be a tad lower than what we thought. As we look at domestic disappearance though, when we look at the availability, you got quite a bit of availability on the domestic market. We think you got a lot of hogs coming to us as we move on into the fall, so we expect that margin to expand a bit. But I'd say the biggest impact on Q3 was probably AU or Canadian or other countries that export into pork markets had a little bit more pork on the market than what we expected.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And how much was Pork, just the input benefit to the Prepared Foods segment itself? Obviously, that's a big segment for the synergies, but if you sort of tease out the implied Pork downstream benefit, how much was that do you think?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","David, repeat that question again? I want to make sure I got it right.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","There's a lot \u2013 there's presumably one of the benefits of a pressured pork market might be on the margins you get on Prepared Foods, was that a benefit there?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. We did see improvements in Prepared Foods due to lower raw material costs. However, just a quick reminder, so far our Prepared Foods business still has long-term commitments with other pork producers for our pork raw material. So, we did see a market \u2013 pork raw materials are down. It's a benefit through our Prepared Foods business. There's really not been any synergy capture yet from an end-to-end basis, because we'll maintain our commitment to the previous suppliers until those contracts run out and then we'll be able to have an additional synergy coming up. I hope that helps.","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","But as we say in the earnings release in the Q, it's $170 million for Q3, $200 million year-to-date.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Thank you. Just wanted to talk a little bit about within your Chicken business, maybe the profitability of some of the various businesses and kind of \u2013 with the pressure on leg quarters and maybe even kind of the big-bird deboning, if you could just sort of talk about the profitability of your various businesses and how you sort of see retail versus foodservice? That would be helpful.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So, the foodservice demand \u2013 if you look at traffic, traffic is flat to up slightly. But we do feel right now that with gas prices moderating, that will continue through the rest of the year. So, feel better about improved demand at foodservice. In retail, fresh chicken is still a clear winner against very, very high beef prices. Certainly, the increase of pork on the market recently has tamed a little bit of Chicken's growth, but it still feels really good at around 2% or so. At one point, we saw about 3% or so demand growth in Chicken. But the retail growth still feels good. It's relatively priced. It's a very cheap protein for consumers.","When we look at our business, we don't \u2013 we tried over time to build some internal hedges within our business to where \u2013 if we have pricing exposure to parts markets like breast meat or whatever, we try to build into our production plans the ability to offset a good portion of that through purchases on the outside market. That way we don't succumb to the movement of those markets.","If you look at our pricing versus the parts market, we don't correlate very well to the breast meat and that type thing. Probably the whole bird market is a better pricing indication of how our business will perform. So, if you look at our small bird business, business is doing great. We've moved to a lot more, what we would call whole body form sales, whether it's eight-piece cut up, at foodservice or at retail rotisserie. Those types of things continue to move the business forward there, it feels good.","Tray pack, of course, is doing great. Our big bird business is fine. A lot of what we do is supply raw material through our big bird business into the value-added further processed items at both foodservice and at retail. As I mentioned in my script, in the last four weeks, our retail frozen business is now back up to a 55 share which is where we were before we had our production problems. So, we feel great being able to grow that business. Hopefully, that's a pretty good recap of how we view our segments inside Chicken.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, I mean, have you done any buy versus grow up with the weakness in leg quarters or is it still a cheaper feed cost more profitable for you to run your plants full out?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely. A big part of our \u2013 I'm going to say that this past quarter, we probably bought something on the order of 90 loads of breast meat a week. And what that does is, it allows us, of course, to fulfill the demand in our value-added further processing lines without having a leg quarter to sell. So, it's key to stabilizing our margins. When we build our production plans, we look at forward demand and then balance to the nearest whole bird increment and back that back in to our production plan. Might hasten on to say too that this year our production will be flat. And next year, we do not have a production increase in the plan. And so, we will continue to be able to buy raw material on the market and add value to it without the exposure to the leg quarter. Next question?","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Diane Geissler from CLSA. Your line is open.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","I wanted to ask on the Beef division, if you could give us an idea about where you were in terms of capacity utilization. And then, I think you've quantified the resale of the product that was expected to go to a certain export customers that had to be redirected due to the divergence, export, the pork issue, but could you just \u2013 is there a way to quantify the lower run rate within your plant in terms of what that might have done to the margin overall?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. If I look at the industry capacity utilization, we're probably on the low 70s and I think that's about where we are. We tend to have our plants in areas where there's a little bit higher concentration in the cattle, so we may be a point or two above that. In terms of quantifying the impact, I can't say \u2013 we know when we're running 34s and 36s a week in our plants that does cost us in \u2013 it raises the cost in our plant, makes us a lot less efficient. So it does have a cost to us. I don't know that I can quantify that right off the bat, but it does impact margin.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. So you would say it's fair to say it's not only the diversion of this product into a less lucrative market, but the lower run rate within your plants that caused the headwind?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Diane, (40:50)","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Both of those came into play in the quarter?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're right. That does have an impact.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And then, just as a quick follow-up. I mean, looking at the inventory report that came out, I guess, two weeks ago, it looks like 2016 is going to be more back-end loaded so as we look to model 2016, you've given some data in terms of like what you think you will be for the full year, but I would guess that the numbers are going to come on stronger in the second half and then really ramp into fiscal 2017, the numbers would indicate sort of mid-single digit increase in fiscal 2017 in terms of cattle supplies. Is that how \u2013 are you reading it the same way we are?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, very much so. When we look at the cattle on feed now, the feedlots have slowed turns down, but the cattle are still there. So, they're going to be coming into the market later on this fall, but when you look at calf crop that's building, that's really a latter part of 2016 and then on into 2017 issue.","So I think we're modeling it exactly the same way. I would think that if you look out over time and so I'm going to go 2016 over 2015, you're probably looking at 1.5% or so increase in supply. Based on heifer retention we're seeing today kind of feels like something like a 1.5%, 2%, I feel a little bit better than that 2017 over 2016, but it's a little bit early to make that call. But, I certainly think you're right. You've got \u2013 it's going to be in the back half of 2016 and then incrementally better in 2017 in terms of beef supply.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. Hey, Donnie, there's a lot of commentary today on the call and in the press release about bigger supplies, you're talking about it in Beef, particularly more cattle in 2017. And then, in the press release in Chicken, I sensed a little more conservatism or caution regarding supplies maybe exceeding demand.","And then, in Pork you're talking about greater hog supplies too, and all this in a context of a much stronger dollar, which I think has kind of a more of a permanent impact on exports. So, I understand all of the benefits of the capacity utilization for Beef and Pork, but is there a concern that a year from now, you might be looking at an environment with a lot of backup of domestic supply because of weaker export and maybe just a much weaker domestic pricing as a result. Is that a concern?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, what we see in 2016, we look at protein availability or the per capita consumption, if you will, of protein up about 2.3%. We think that supplies are backing up here near term. But as we look forward, you've got increased demand for protein on a global basis. As we look at Pork, for example, in 2016, you're probably going to see less pressure from outside markets next year than you saw this year, which should improve Pork demand.","If you look at what's happened in China, China has significantly reduced their sow herd. If you look at what day old pigs and pig replacement prices are doing and what Pork is doing, for example, at retail, pork prices and hog prices are increasing in China, which tells us that there's likely to be more demand for pork in China next year than this year. Again, this Beef deal, you've got very record high-price spreads at retail. And I think with the slow growth in the beef herd that we're projecting and call that 1.5%, 2% or so, we think Beef is going to maintain an umbrella, if you will, at premium price, if you will, to the other proteins.","By the way, more pork on the domestic market is good news for our Prepared Foods business certainly. And so, the real key is Chicken. And when you look at Chicken, we plan to use our buy versus grow strategy to make sure that the 2% or so in domestic availability that we expect next year that we can buy a lot of that raw material and be able to add value to it and protect our margins and stabilize our margins like we talked about a little earlier in Q&A. So that's really the way we look at the landscape in front of it. And that's what gives us a lot of cause to think. Fundamentally nothing in our 2016 view has changed.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right. Okay. One follow-up, the pipeline that you said backed up in Beef and then kind of flow through at a lower price, is that all done or is there still a pipeline, so to speak a product that needs to clear for export?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, the clearing part is over and we basically resold that product into other markets where we could move it. Now the one issue that still lingers which and by the way you wouldn't be able to necessarily see this in the cutout is some of these items like beef plates and rib short ribs, and short ribs, and flap tails, and those kinds of things that normally we have a good sale for into export markets that while demand is down, particularly in Asia, these markets are getting rolled into grind \u2013 these items are getting rolled in the grinds. So, that still has an impact on our price realization.","The supply situation has continued to linger as feedlots. We looked at the cattle on feed numbers in June to understand they were stretching out their turns. The cattle on feed report in July indicated they continue to stretch out turns. So, there's a near-term squeeze there, if you will, on the supply. But a lot of the demand issues that were very acute are behind us and we think we'll be able to see our price realization increase a little bit over time as some of these export markets begin to equilibrate a bit. Now, the flow off the coast is much improved. Port of LA is great. We're still seeing a little bit of difficulties down in Oakland, but the flow is beginning to get much more normal, if you will, to what we're seeing before these port disruptions.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And drop credits? How are those trending right now?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Drop credit is down and that does affect our margins and a lot of that has to do with \u2013 if you want to call the economic impact of the economy slowing down, if you will, a bit in Asia. That will correct over time. We think that \u2013 if you look at \u2013 and I don't want to get into a whole bunch of detail on drop credit items, but you've got two big categories, your variety meats and then your hides in both of those prices are weak. So we should see that come back over time. I suspect that would be a fairly slow climb out of the hole.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Thank you, Donnie.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. Can you hear me?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, a couple of questions. One, just semantics, if you're seeing that nothing changed in 2016 and your language was previous to this \u2013 that you'd say at least 10% on 2015 numbers. Why not change your language to indicate that 2016 nothing has changed, because you're keeping the same thing of at least 10% growth on top of your long-term growth. Is there something to read into this? I just want to be perfectly clear here.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. It's just early, Ken. I mean, frankly, the situation in Beef has not changed through July. I want to spend a little bit more time looking at that. Hey, I'd like to get this crop in the bin. And so, we typically wait until this next quarter in Q4, before we get more clarity on that. It's just early.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And what are the signs that you can point to over the next 36 months that would either give you more confidence or less confidence in the 2016 outlook?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, I feel great about Prepared Foods. And we are lowering prices in a couple of categories and I'm sure looking for the volume response to that. That would continue to give us \u2013 that would be the confidence we need there. So, I feel great about that. I feel good about Chicken. We obviously would love to see some of these export bans removed which \u2013 third quarter has particularly hurt us a bit in Arkansas. So, I'd love to see that improve. But there, again, that doesn't necessarily change the outlook for 2016. So, it really is this unexpected acute issue in Beef and getting a little bit more clarity on how that's going to turn out. That's the one.","Synergy is still great. If you look at the things coming up, we've got, again, great brands and great categories. We're going to have a full year of our new tray pack operation in South Georgia. We've got plenty of fully-cook capacity now to be able to grow both foodservice and retail and fully-cooked. We're going to have plenty of hogs around us. That feels good. Certainly, it will help the raw materials in Prepared Foods. I think beef prices are going to continue to provide an umbrella. I mentioned synergies, we're generating a lot of cash, which gives us a lot of opportunity to pay, buyback stock or invest in the business. So, we've got a lot of things going for us. We just really want to see this beef thing play itself out for another month or two.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And philosophically, as you shift away from commodities and take more of a valuated approach, what would it take for you to just put Beef and Pork on the market, and just say I'd rather just focus on Prepare Foods and Chicken, and that's what we're really trying to shift that portfolio towards.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, if you look at over the very, very long term, we still feel good certainly about Pork in our portfolio. We feel good about having Beef as a long-term business. So, we really look at this thing with a very, very long-term view, and so it still feels good to us for them to be in the portfolio.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So no indication that you'd even think about that?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And my last, very last question. Again as you said, we would buy a fairly significant amount of stock. How do I quantify that?","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, Ken, the way we're looking at it is we're trying to keep net debt to EBITDA around that 2 times level. So, we de-levered to the point where we're pretty comfortable looking at first and foremost growth through CapEx, organic type of growth expenditures. But then, think about free cash flow. It's $1 billion. It's going to grow over time. So, that's going to \u2013 so to the extent we don't do much more deleveraging then it gives us more options in terms of buying back stock and working on dividends too.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.","Timothy S. Ramey - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks. We've talked a lot about the export demand, and I assume that some of these specialty items were big into Korea. Are you just seeing weak economic activity in Korea and so that's backing up through the system for these otherwise high-price, high-value-added items that are now going into grind?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","By and large, that's right. I wouldn't necessarily limit the softness in demand we're seeing just to Korea. There is softness across broader Asia. And as you know, those are great markets for a lot of those items. So, a little bit broader than just Korea.","Timothy S. Ramey - Pivotal Research Group LLC","And, Donnie, was any of this attributable to kind of the restart of Dakota City or did that really occurred just as expected?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It has occurred as expected. I think we mentioned in our last call that we had some start-up issues that we were working through. That did not \u2013 the start-up issues that we worked through in Q3 did not impact earnings beyond what we would have expected them to. All that came as planned. It really was this acute issue of making the decision to get that moving off the West Coast so we wouldn't have to deal with it in even softer markets.","Timothy S. Ramey - Pivotal Research Group LLC","And just finally on \u2013 always good to hear you managed for margin not market share. We love that. But does that mean that at least in maybe the 12 months' outlook there might be an opportunity to kind of trim back capacity utilization or improved capacity utilization by shutting a line here or there?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Tim, we look at a lot of those things constantly in our efforts to manage margins. Too early to say about any potential moves we might have inside the system but certainly we're working through the math on a lot of those issues. And as you know, we get that down to about the fourth decimal point to make that call. So, we're looking at all that, don't see the opportunity yet.","Timothy S. Ramey - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","The next one is coming from the line of Akshay Jagdale of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning.","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So, first on Beef, I just want to be clear. So, we all calculate industry margin and based on, obviously, publicly available data, your Beef results underperformed that significantly, I think the first time in like seven or eight years. So, I understand the issue that you explained clearly but what I'm \u2013 I just want to understand if it's a company-specific issue like it looks like from the outside. And maybe if you can give us a little more color on what's company-specific, right? So, everything you were saying, the way you were saying it so far, seemed like the rest of the industry should be dealing with those issues too but the numbers that I'm looking at for the industry point to your performance being way worse. So, can you just help me clarify that? What could we be missing? I mean, maybe it's just that the cut out doesn't reflect some of these issues yet, perhaps?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think large \u2013 what you just said, Akshay, is largely correct. It's that you wouldn't be able to look at cut out and see the price differences between the revenue that we get from some of these export items and what we then get for it when we roll it into $50s (57:04). So that's part of the issue. I don't know \u2013 I don't want to comment on what the industry says or what they may show. But we felt like the right thing to do was to make sure that we didn't have an inventory problem because it felt like to us that going into Memorial Day to feel the cutout getting toppy like we did in Memorial Day, it felt like the right thing for us to do was to resell all that product.","Now, that may have hurt us worse than what the cutout or what the industry indices would have indicated but it was the right thing to do for our business. We don't have excess inventory. If you look at Beef inventories, I don't what they're up 20%, 30% or so, ours is not and that feels really good because we'll be able to immediately respond when the market conditions give us an opportunity.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So, overall, you'd characterize the beef issue as something impacting the industry equally, right? You've taken some strategic actions which you believe are putting you in a better position but overall this is an issue that everybody in the industry is dealing with. You're not dealing with it more so than anybody else, correct?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Akshay, I don't know what other people are doing in the industry or how they're dealing with it. I think I can safely say that our market share in Asia is historically pretty large. And so, maybe we were impacted greater because of this issue based on that. But I don't have any comment about how it may be impacting us versus the rest of the industry or whatever. I'm just telling you what happened to our business.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then moving to Prepared Foods, is there any way you can give us a sense of how the businesses are doing on an organic basis. Obviously, you're still going through the first year of the deal. The numbers look good this quarter, but just help me, the way I'm thinking about it is you have $300 million in synergies, right, this year that is going to help in that business. You have now what you've quantified, which is very helpful, $320 million in lower raw material cost. That's a positive $600 million tailwind. And on my numbers your EBIT is increasing couple of hundred million. Now, you're investing a lot. So, can you give me a sense of, one, what's the base business doing like from a growth perspective, market share overall just broadly? And two, can you quantify some of these MAP investments? Give us some sense. Is it $50 million, $100 million, a couple hundred million, and what do you expect from a growth perspective next year to get a return on these investments you're making? Thanks.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, hopefully, this perspective will help, Akshay. So, if you look at our categories at retail \u2013 by the way, our foodservice business is great. If you look at QSR Mexican and some of the other growth in foodservice, that plays very well into our portfolio. So, we feel great about foodservice demand and our ability to continue to grow that part of our Prepared Foods business.","At retail, if you look back over this last quarter, we grew sales in eight of our nine categories and grew share in five of nine. So, if you just look at the category growth, that gives you a good indication of where we are.","Now, I can't tell you that in Q3 we lost share in a couple of categories that are meaningful to us. And so in Q4, we're going to reduce the price gap between us and the competition to regain that volume. There's always a balance between managing new gross margin and managing new market share. And so, we're going to reduce those price gaps to maintain our market share because we \u2013 or to get some market share back, because we want to go into the fall with a position in the \u2013 well positioned in the categories for growth into 2016.","So, again, on the Prepared Foods synergies, about 90% of those, so I think you're seeing that right about 90% of those or so are in \u2013 of the total synergies are in Prepared Foods. And really what we're doing is just re-rating our cost structure for that business down, and then we'll take advantage of the raw material improvements over next year to have plenty of firepower on our map and to make sure we keep our pricing gap right, so we'll continue to grow the business, all the while, expanding our margins by a couple of hundred basis points over what we did this year. So we feel really good about that.","Operator","And our last question is coming from the line of Brett Hundley from BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Brett Michael Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets","Hey, guys. Good morning. And thanks for fitting me in.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Sure.","Brett Michael Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets","I wanted to ask you a question on Chicken, and get a more \u2013 maybe a more definitive sense, Donnie, of where things can fall out for you guys in that business next year, and maybe just how good Chicken can be? You've given a lot of talking points, but I want to understand, is there \u2013 in your mind really is a definitive floor at 7% if you can do another 12% next year, I want to understand that range of outcomes just given everything that you talked about, about maybe being a little bit more supply on the market relative to demand, Pork continuing to be an incremental competitor to Chicken at retail, but then your guys instituting buy versus grow, reducing your exposure to leg quarters. I thought it was really interesting. Your comment on dark meat utilization and Prepared Foods and maybe you can give us a sense of whether that can be sizeable or not for you? But anyway, just wanted to understand those different talking points.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Brett, I think you've absolutely got the right list. I'll tell you and I'm probably going to frustrate you a little bit with my answer, I'm sorry, but it's just a little bit too early for us. Really, I'd like to get the crop in the bin before we can get more definitive. But I'm very comfortable saying that in FY 2016, we're going to be at or above the top end of our new 7% to 9% range.","For all the reasons you mentioned, reducing our exposure to leg quarters, we've done a great job in balancing and changing our pricing structures to be able to balance our margins and stabilize our margins, while growing the business. We feel great that we've got the portfolio inside of Chicken appropriately sized across all the bird classes. That feels good.","And a key component to making 2016 a great year is we're going to have a full year of our new tray pack plant in South Georgia and we got plenty of capacity to be able to grow our retail value-added fully-cooked business and our fully-cooked foodservice business. And we see opportunities for demand to increase there.","So, we've got a lot of components that are in our favor. And it's really the combination of the work over the last three or four years to put all of the pieces together to be able to stabilize our margins and then grow the business with that new stabilized margin structure. So, I think you're all there. I feel great about 2016. More details to come on our next call.","Brett Michael Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then, just lastly, either Donnie or Dennis. Does your M&A desires act as a governor at all on your share repurchase plans? And can you go back over kind of what your landscape looks like across M&A? You've talked about branded before you talked about value-added chicken. I want to be sure, does your M&A plan, do they extend in the packaged foods or is it \u2013 are you just looking at protein? So, M&A as the governor on share repo and then just looking at what your landscape is specifically for M&A.","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll start with the M&A as the governor. What we're trying to do is design our capital structure and cash flow and capital allocation in a way that allows us to have kind of the best of both worlds. So, think about generating a billion or more in free cash flow, while investing heavy in organic growth in our existing businesses, but also maintaining a solid investment grade rating and good liquidity and then just as importantly, having quite a bit of incremental debt capacity to make acquisitions. So, with that, I'll turn it over to Donnie to talk about strategy a little bit.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, the M&A strategy is very consistent; value-added poultry, Prepared Foods and at some point, International. And that's our focus. And obviously, we want to continue to grow the branded value-added part of our portfolio to continue to de-risk and de-commoditize our portfolio and make sure that our businesses is very, very consumer centric. So, that's the plan forward. I think Dennis did a great job on the \u2013 whether or not that's a governor or not. We don't think of either\/or, we think of and.","Brett Michael Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets","Thanks, guys.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, thanks \u2013 okay. I think that's all the time we have for today. Hey, listen, we're going to stay focused on our long-term growth of delivering at least 10% annual EPS growth over time by growing our value-added in Prepared Foods businesses and supporting our brands to maintain a leadership position.

First, I\u2019d like to welcome Dean Banks as President of Tyson Foods. I\u2019m delighted Dean is joining our team. He brings extensive experience as a leader, an entrepreneur, and has a background in innovation technology. I\u2019ve served on the Board with Dean since I became CEO and know him as a thoughtful leader who respects and truly values Tyson Foods\u2019 heritage and is an excellent cultural fit with our company. I will remain CEO and Dean will report directly to me and will be based here in Springdale.","Now onto a review of our fiscal 2019, which was a year highlighted by record sales and significant progress in delivering our strategy for long term growth. We remain focused on ways to grow, deliver and sustain our business. This includes growing our prepared foods and value-added chicken business; secondly, growing our international business, and reducing earnings and volatility across our business.","Here are some examples of our fiscal 2019 accomplishments. We expanded our global business with operations in Asia and Europe. We continue to innovate our iconic brands, which outpace the industry. We launched alternative protein products into the marketplace. We\u2019re improving efficiencies by opening new distribution centers. We\u2019re positioning ourselves for the future by integrating our business through a new enterprise technology platform. We continue to invest in advanced analytics as well as the development of automation and robotics with a new technology center here in northwest Arkansas, and we\u2019re making strides in our sustainability initiatives. For example, earlier this year we announced a new partnership with the Environmental Defense Fund. We\u2019ve also partnered with Proforest to help conduct a deforestation risk assessment across our supply chain. We\u2019re leading innovation in animal welfare research and we also continue efforts to expand the progressive beef program where certified cattle feed lot operators are following best practices. ","Here are some additional highlights as we look back on fiscal 2019. Sales dollars grew 6% to a record $42.4 billion, driven mostly by chicken-related acquisitions and increased pricing in the beef and prepared food segments. We achieved record beef operating income. Tyson\u2019s retail core business lines outpaced the top 10 retail food manufacturers in the 52-week period. Core volume was up 4.1% and total Tyson retail volume was up 2.7%. Both the business lines and total Tyson retail have posted five consecutive quarters of growth with total Tyson\u2019s showing its highest retail growth in the last two years. In the fourth quarter, Tyson\u2019s core business lines outpaced category growth with overall share up almost a full share point. ","Turning to food service, Tyson\u2019s Focus 6 product lines continue to double the broad line sector with a 2.5% volume increase over the prior year. In addition, we see growth opportunities in other areas of food service beyond broad line. Digital marketing and mobile ordering accelerated growth in major QSR and convenience store chains with [foodservice] [ph] traffic from digital ordering up 25%. Tyson is leveraging new digital and social platforms within the K-12, convenience, and broad line distribution channels and we\u2019re investing in building new digital capabilities in fiscal 2020.","We\u2019re also continuing to move forward with plans to grow our value-added fresh meats business to better meet consumer demands in the western United States. Two weeks ago, we broke ground on our new facility in Eagle Mountain City, Utah. The plant will convert fresh beef and pork into steaks, chops, roasts, and ground beef for grocery meat cases. This additional production will allow us to increase our already growing value-added fresh meat sales. Our growth is enabled by an ongoing financial fitness mindset and we are more focused than ever to drive out costs across the enterprise to enable future investments.","I\u2019d like to highlight some of our progress our operations team made in fiscal 2019 towards making Tyson the employer of choice. We experienced record low turnover in many of our operations over the past year. In addition, we improved our safety record again this year by reducing OSHA recordable incidents by 18% versus our goal of 10%. This is on top of the 20% reduction we experienced in fiscal 2018. We continue to expand our program that offers onsite life skill training classes for frontline team members. ","A significant part of our focus in fiscal 2019 was on building for the future. As a result, we\u2019re optimistic about fiscal 2020 results as we drive for constant improvement. Currently, we expect to meet or exceed our long-term target of high single digit adjusted earnings per share growth. We also continue to drive innovation, deliver on our customer promise, and meet global consumer expectations. We\u2019ll do this while controlling costs and increasing efficiencies. ","As I transition to the segments, I want to remind everyone that in our press release this morning we provide guidance for our segments. Stewart will provide more clarity on other guidance items in his remarks. ","Now turning to our segments, prepared foods continues to perform well at retail with strong growth supported by increased map spending. Volumes of Jimmy Dean frozen breakfast were up 6.6% in the most recent 52-week Nielsen data on the strength of new product launches, including Simple Scrambles, Egg\u2019wiches, and Breakfast Bowls. We continue to innovate and will build on the success of these breakfast-on-the-go products by expanding the Jimmy Dean line into biscuit roll-ups and morning combos. ","We drove volume across retail with sales of Hillshire Farm smoked sausage and lunch meat both up 5% while sales of Ballpark hot dogs increased nearly 3% and Hillshire snacking was up 15% in the last 52 weeks. We\u2019re excited about the momentum we\u2019re seeing in our new alternative protein products and the power that Tyson sales, culinary and supply chain bring to this category. ","We introduced Adele\u2019s Whole Blends as our first offering earlier this year. Since our last earnings call, we\u2019ve nearly doubled our retail distribution of Raised & Rooted nuggets to more than 7,000 stores and expanded into food service. This month, we began shipping our new Raised & Rooted blended burger made with Angus beef and plant protein. We have a deliberate go-to-market strategy for our alternative protein products. They must taste good and they must be healthier alternatives to other products already in the marketplace. ","In 2020, we continue to expand with new products in both the retail frozen and fresh space as well as in food service. Alternative protein projections remain strong and we\u2019re well positioned to lead in this growing space. Last year, sale of our non-protein food service businesses improved our product mix and pricing while reducing sales volume for the prepared foods segment. ","Operating income for the year was relatively flat as strong demand and improved mix was offset by increased raw material and operating costs. Looking ahead to 2020 for prepared foods, we expect continued growth in retail consumption as well as food service channels like convenience, K-12, and non-commercial. As African swine fever reduces global pork supplies, we could see increased raw material costs, but keep in mind a large portion of our business is price list and direct pass-through pricing. This allows us to act quickly to recover costs when we see a sustained raw material price movement. ","Moving onto the beef segment, we experienced strong demand and favorable domestic market conditions in the fourth quarter offset by increased costs associated with a fire at our Finney County, Kansas plant in August. We recorded $31 million of fire-related expenses in Q4 net of primary insurance recoveries for a portion of the claim. I\u2019m pleased to say our team members whose jobs were affected by the fire are still being paid. There have been tremendous steps taken by the entire beef team, our contractors and the community to rebuild the plant and get us back to full operations as quickly as possible, and we currently believe the plant will be up and running in the next 60 days. ","The beef segment\u2019s operating income for the year was a record $1.1 billion despite logistical challenge and lost volume resulting from the fire. Our premium beef programs contributed to the overall success with a record year for sales volumes and value-added margins. Looking ahead, we expect market fundamentals to be similar to fiscal 2019. ","Now turning to the pork segment, our revenue enhancement strategy continued to boost our performance, driving wider spreads relative to the industry benchmarks. This includes our premium programs, which experienced 27% category growth year-over-year as well as increases in exports and food service penetration. Our workspace initiatives are helping our pork plants be the employer of choice and keeping them fully staffed with record low turnover. Exports to Mexico, Japan and China are picking up and we\u2019ve started seeing the improved pricing because of supply shortages in China and other Asian countries affected by ASF. We\u2019ll be in a better position to compete for these export opportunities as we move to buying only ractopamine-free hogs. ","Overall, we expect industry hog supplies to increase about 3% year-over-year. We also expect increased livestock costs, record export volumes, and pricing improvement.","Now turning to the chicken segment, as I said in September, we have a solid chicken business and we fully expect to see operational improvement in 2020. We\u2019re doing so by streamlining processes, improving operations, and lowering costs. Sales volume for the year increased with incremental volume from acquisitions. The additional rendering volume from these acquisitions lower our average sales price. Operating income decreased due to higher costs and the challenging pricing environment. Additionally, operating income was impacted by net feed ingredient and derivative losses of approximately $55 million in the quarter. On a run rate basis, this is nearly $100 million more than Q3. We now have the right people in the right roles and we\u2019re seeing improvement, although we\u2019re not satisfied with the pace.","In addition to achieving operational improvements, we also expect to improve pricing in select products and categories, continued performance gains, and synergy capture from our Keystone and American proteins. ","We continue growing our flagship Tyson brand. Our core retail frozen and value-added poultry sales volume was up 1.2% in the fiscal year according to Nielsen. We plan continued branded growth with new products like Tyson air fried chicken and Tyson Smokehouse case-ready chicken, and we\u2019re accelerating food service growth through innovation and limited time offers. ","In international and other, the acquisitions of Keystone and our new Thai and European operations led to increased sales. Along with Keystone in China, we\u2019re closing the gap through better performance by our legacy Tyson operations. In fact, legacy China business had a record fourth quarter and was profitable after breaking even through the first three quarters of the year, and our China retail business continues to see strong volume growth. ","Our international operations along with exports are an important part of our growth strategy. That\u2019s why we continue to advocate for trade agreements that will benefit our industry and farmers. For example, we\u2019re working with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to ratify the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement. The U.S. and Japan recently signed a trade deal that will benefit our beef and pork businesses by putting them on equal basis with other export countries. Two weeks ago, it was reported that China is planning to lift its four-year ban on U.S. poultry. We welcome these positive developments and the more stable operating environment they provide.","I\u2019ll now ask Stewart to take us through the financials. ","Stewart Glendinning","Thanks Noel, and good morning everyone. Fourth quarter and fiscal year results were in line with our revised expectations with earnings of $1.21 and $5.46 per share respectively. Operating income was $686 million with a 6.3% return on sales in the fourth quarter and just under $3 billion with a 7% return on sales for the fiscal year. Revenues were a record $42.4 billion and volume was up nearly 9% for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year primarily due to acquisitions. Average sales price was flat in the fourth quarter and down 3% for the year primarily due to the product mix from the acquisition of the American proteins rendering business.","We are very diligent with our capital allocation strategies and last quarter I mentioned we were focused on debt reduction. We paid off the $1 billion of senior notes that matured in the fourth quarter mostly with cash generated in the quarter. We also were able to repurchase 300,000 shares for $27 million. For fiscal 2019 in total, we repurchased 3.7 million shares for $252 million. Our operating cash flows at year-end were $2.5 billion and liquidity was $1.2 billion.","Including cash of $484 million, net debt was $11.4 billion. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.8 times for the 12 months ending September 28. With net debt coming down and cash up, we are well positioned to have all of our capital levers available in 2020. ","Net interest expense was $121 million in Q4 and $451 million for the full year. Capital expenditures were $288 million in the quarter and $1.3 billion in the fiscal year, and we continue to see strong returns on these investments. ","In 2019, two new distribution centers were brought online and we invested in new processing capacity for chicken and value-added fresh meats. We also invested in additional enterprise technology as well as our new Tyson manufacturing automation center. These investments will provide long-term benefits and support our growth strategy. We continue to target and overall capex return of approximately twice our cost of capital.","Our effective tax rate was 20.5% in the fourth quarter and 20.7% for the fiscal year. Depreciation and amortization was $289 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $1.1 billion for the full year. Weighted average shares outstanding in Q4 were approximately 367 million. ","As I mentioned on our last call, we faced hurdles integrating new information technology that resulted in short-term increases to our working capital. Within the fourth quarter, we also had increased distressed inventory sales in parts of our prepared foods and chicken segments. This negatively impacted operating income by approximately $40 million. Our metrics are improving each month and our on-time customer service is nearing our historical targets, but some amounts may carry into our first quarter. ","Now I\u2019d like to provide our thoughts on the 2020 fiscal year. As I\u2019m sure you noticed in our release this morning, we did not provide specific EPS or sales guidance. The timing and magnitude of potential impacts resulting from African swine fever are still hard to quantify. Additionally, there are continuing developments in trade negotiations which can create uncertainties in our external environment. While these factors alone did not drive our decision, they do significantly compound the difficulty of accurately forecasting EPS and sales. To be clear, we believe we\u2019re positioned to deliver our long-term earning algorithm of high single digit adjusted EPS growth and there is potential for profound upside depending on how events materialize.","There are a number of additional metrics I will provide on 2020, which will be a 53rd week; however, take note we\u2019ve adjusted our outlook to be comparable to 52 weeks. Net interest expense should approximate $450 million. We plan for capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion as we continue construction on the Tennessee chicken plant and begin construction on the Utah case ready plant. We expect liquidity to remain above our $1 billion target. Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 23.5%.","You\u2019ve seen our segment return on sales guidance in our press release this morning. Our capital allocation in 2020 will continue to prioritize debt reduction while reinvesting in our business for organic growth, buying back stock, and increasing our dividend. ","In the case of inorganic opportunities, we will be very disciplined and return-focused in our approach to any acquisition. Our track record on acquisitions continues to be very encouraging. Consistent with my comments last quarter, we are already exceeding our cost of capital on an after-tax basis in 2019 for our most recent four acquisitions: Smart Chicken, American Protein, Keystone, and the poultry operations in Europe and Thailand. As we start to realize the full benefit of synergies while driving further growth, we expect strong returns on these acquisitions. ","Finally, yesterday the board of directors increased the previously declared quarterly dividend to $0.42 per share on Class A stock. We anticipate the remaining quarterly dividends in fiscal 2020 will be $0.42, resulting in an annual dividend rate of $1.68 per Class A share.","That concludes my remarks, and now we\u2019ll go back to Noel for additional commentary. Noel?","Noel White","As Stewart said, the positive impacts we anticipate from African swine fever are still hard to quantify, but here\u2019s what we do know. It\u2019s likely to improve export markets and change protein consumption dynamics for a number of years. We also saw a return on sales expectations for the segments in our press release. We\u2019re well positioned to benefit from ASF, but our long term success is not dependent on ASF or any other one-time events. Tyson Foods is a strong company with a sound strategy and a unique diversified business model. ","In summary, we\u2019re optimistic about fiscal 2020. Our outlook is based on our diverse portfolio, the strength of our brands, our willingness to enter adjacent categories, partnerships with customers, and ongoing focus on financial fitness. We have opportunities not to only grow but to thrive while creating long-term shareholder value.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","The first question comes from Peter Galbo of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Peter Galbo","Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess taking into account that you didn\u2019t put out a range for the EPS guidance, even if we just take the midpoint of each of your segment guides, you can kind of come up with a number that meets more of that exceeds end of the guidance that you did give, something in the low double digits to low teens EPS growth. Can you help us reconcile that in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about each of those margins, whether we should be thinking about the lower end of that range at least coming out of the gate, or if it\u2019s really maybe just some conservatism on your part? I have a follow-up as well.","Noel White","Yes Peter, let me say we are very optimistic about 2020 and what we can deliver through the fiscal year. Each segment is a little bit different. I would say that as we enter 2020, beef is off to a very strong start and we view 2020 as another exceedingly strong year. Pork started a little slow, however has come on very strong in the month of November, as you can probably see in public reports. Chicken was off to a bit of a slow start but it\u2019s improving as well.","The reason that we didn\u2019t give the guidance is that we have a very good outlook of what we think we would earn in 2020 without the impact of ASF. The difficulty was actually in predicting what the top could be. We have a good sense of the base, it\u2019s the top that becomes the problem. That\u2019s the reason we didn\u2019t give the guidance. ","Peter Galbo","Got it, okay. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe just on prepared foods, I think that\u2019s kind of what caught investors by surprise in terms of the raw material inflation being, I think you called out $60 million year-over-year in 4Q. What does the timing lag look like in terms of the price increases? When might we actually start to see that roll through, and how should we think about demand deterioration if there is a large step up in pricing?","Noel White","The impact in Q4, Peter, wasn\u2019t necessarily on the increase in price and raw materials, there were some other factors. Stewart mentioned the inventory levels, the write-offs that occurred. That situation is largely under control. There is going to be a little bit rolling into Q1, but it was basically the issues that we talked about at the end of our Q3 call on an SAP installation, some inventory levels, and we did take a pretty sizeable adjustment in fourth quarter. So much improved, but not quite where we want to be here as we enter Q1.","Peter Galbo","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Piken","Yes, good morning. Just wanted to get a little bit of an update on where you are in some of the chicken plants that were struggling operationally. Are you back to the normal line speed, and how much of an impact or headwind might we see in 1Q fiscal 2020 from any operational issues that took place last quarter?","Noel White","Yes, sure Michael. We have made progress. As I mentioned, we\u2019re not satisfied with the pace. Over the course of the last couple of months, I would say operationally we are improved in performance, still not at the standard that we would expect. However, there has been some other pressures within the poultry segment. You can see public reports that margins have been compressed just to market dynamics. So operationally we are performing better, still not where we need to be, but there have been some other pressures that have affected poultry as well as we enter Q1.","Now from a pricing perspective, it\u2019s still early in the pricing season. There\u2019s been no surprises and, as I said in my remarks, there are pricing opportunities on specific products, so we are optimistic as we enter 2020, and we do think that the range that we provided in poultry is achievable throughout the year.","Michael Piken","Okay, great. As a follow-up, I know you mentioned that the contracting was underway and no surprises. How do you think about the contracting fees and knowing there\u2019s a potential opportunity from ASF? Is that changing the duration of the contracts or how they\u2019re structured in terms of how much you would have as a fixed price versus cost-plus versus index? Any color there would be helpful.","Noel White","Yes Michael, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t talk about pricing scenarios just from an anti-trust standpoint, so I can\u2019t go there.","Michael Piken","Okay. ","Operator","Was there a follow-up, Mr. Piken?","Michael Piken","Sure, yes. In that case, I guess maybe we could just go within the chicken segment, if you could just provide any color in terms of the mix maybe of your business going forward, in terms of can you at least provide some color in terms of how much is spot sales versus more indexed? Anything that could kind of help us model things out would be helpful. ","Noel White","Michael, the pricing really doesn\u2019t change that much year to year with us. It\u2019s fairly consistent, and as I\u2019ve mentioned before, we have a wide variety of pricing mechanisms which does in fact help stabilize earnings to a certain extent. There is not the sizeable shifts that take place with most of our customers. They\u2019re on a variety of different pricing mechanisms, so those customers as we enter pricing season, you don\u2019t necessarily change from a fixed price to a grain-based or vice versa. Most of the pricing scenarios are pretty consistent as we move from year to year.","Obviously the markets will move, but no surprises yet this year. ","Michael Piken","All right, thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman","Good morning and thank you. I wanted to just follow up on the distressed inventory sales. It\u2019s probably not that big a deal because, as you said, it\u2019s mostly behind you, but were you hinting at that as SAP related? I just didn\u2019t quite understand exactly what the dynamics were there and wanted to get a little bit of color.","Noel White","Yes, Ken, to a large extent it was SAP related. We had some issues, if you remember I talked about last quarter, in Q3 with accurate inventory levels and ultimately that ended up with an increase in distressed product as we closed out the year, so it was related to SAP, inventory levels and the visibility that we had into the accuracy of our inventory. So largely corrected, not completely, but feeling much better about where we\u2019re at today than where we were even 30 days ago.","Ken Goldman","Send that stuff to me next time, I\u2019ll take it! It\u2019s good stuff. I just wanted a clarification, another one from something that was said in the press release, or written in the press release. You said that the pork segment operating margin or income, rather, decreased because of compressed margins, and that was in part driven by increased livestock supplies. I wasn\u2019t quite sure how increased or higher livestock supplies hurt your margin. You may have mentioned this or clarified this, but I didn\u2019t quite pick up on that.","Noel White","Ken, to be honest with you, I\u2019ll need to look back as well because that intuitively doesn\u2019t make sense to me either. If that was the case, it\u2019s not completely accurate. Let me tell you what the scenario has been, though, throughout calendar 2019. I think that by and large, most people were expecting an increase in exports, whether it\u2019s to China or other countries. Now with that, both the futures market and the cash price of hogs has moved higher, and it\u2019s moved higher in anticipation of those exports. Now, as we finish calendar 2019, those exports have materialized. Though we saw the run-up in hog prices, we didn\u2019t necessarily see the corresponding increase in pork prices which led to the compression in 2019. ","Now, since the product is being produced for export today, we are seeing product prices move higher, as publicly reported, and it\u2019s extremely unusual. It\u2019s counter-seasonal for us as an industry to be processing 2.7 million-plus hogs per week and seeing product move higher, so we are seeing the impact, particularly over the course of the last several weeks. ","Ken Goldman","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Heather Jones of Heather Jones Research LLC. Please go ahead.","Heather Jones","Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Quickly on a trade question, late Friday, I think it was, there was a final rule published in the Federal Register about the U.S. setting up terms for us to be able to start the importation of Chinese cooked poultry. I was wondering, is it your reading that that is done and there will be no way to undo that, and what are your thoughts about the implications of that for China lifting the ban on U.S. poultry?","Noel White","Yes Heather, since it was published in the Federal Register, we do think that it is in fact on, and it would take a Congressional act to change it at this point. We saw it, we understood, we somewhat anticipated it, and the comment I would make, Heather, is that we are pro trade and whether other countries allow export access to their country or to ours, we\u2019re pro trade so it was actually encouraging to see the agreement that was made and we would fully expect that there\u2019d be some type of trade agreement reciprocity with access to China from U.S. poultry.","So no surprise, and the fact that there has been seemingly some type of an agreement, not been made completely public yet, but we view it as encouraging. ","Heather Jones","Okay, thank you for that. Then my follow-up is on chicken. You mentioned operational improvements, you mentioned select price increases in certain segments. You said you\u2019re still not where you want to be operationally, but basically from your Q4 run rate, you\u2019re projecting a pretty sizeable jump in EBIT margins and, like you said, excluding any benefit from ASF. I was just wondering if you could flesh that out some to give us comfort as to how you go from a Q4 run to 6 to 8% without ASF. Just help us understand more how you\u2019re thinking about that. ","Noel White","Well it\u2019s not going to happen overnight, Heather, but it will be a process and we are in the middle of that process. The plan that was laid out as we came into fiscal 2020, our team is executing on, so the operational improvements, and whether it\u2019s labor efficiency, costs, yields, we are on track with where we expected to be.","Now, I did talk about some of the pricing pressure on some specific items, and that\u2019s in USDA data, it\u2019s visible. On the other hand, there are select items that are in strong demand, and I\u2019m not going to necessarily talk about specific items but that creates pricing opportunities for us. In some cases, there is surplus product in the market; in other cases, there is somewhat of a shortage, so you take the pricing opportunity where in fact there\u2019s strong demand, and in the case where there\u2019s excess supply, then there\u2019s some pricing pressure, so the market does its job.","Stewart Glendinning","Heather, one additional item just for you to note, that in the quarter if you adjusted for the hedging that we saw at the end of the quarter, there was a $55 million loss there in chicken. If you adjust for that, you pick up about 1.5 extra percentage points on the operating margin, and I think that will help you reconcile when you add Noel\u2019s comments about how we get to the year end.","Heather Jones","Excellent, thank you so much.","Operator","The next question comes from Rob Moscow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Jake Nivasch","Hi, thank you. This is actually Jake Nivasch on for Rob. Just one quick one. It\u2019s about pricing, which I know we kind of spoke about, but if I can ask it in another way. The persistent problems at your plants, is that a risk going forward in terms of losing customers or any sort of negotiation, I guess loss of negotiating power?","Noel White","No.","Jake Nivasch","No? Okay. ","Noel White","No, no. Don\u2019t view it that way at all, Jake. Now, through the course of 2019 with the new platform that we installed, there were challenges. That\u2019s largely behind us, but it has nothing to do with the operational challenges. It was more so the visibility that we had of inventories, timely shipments, shipments in full, but as Stewart said in his script, that is largely behind us. We are back very close to the historical standards that we would expect, so two completely unrelated topics.","Jake Nivasch","Got it, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson","Yes, thank you. Good morning everyone. I was hoping, I don\u2019t know if you could help maybe just frame within the individual segments what would drive you margin-wise to the low end versus the high end? I know that you framed the guidance excluding any ASF impacts, but it seems like it\u2019s hard to separate that out from the state of the world today, so maybe help us understand prepared foods, what gets you to 10% versus 12% margins, chicken 6% versus 8%, and maybe any comments around how you\u2019d see the bigger ASF impacts in each of the businesses. ","Noel White","Right, right. That\u2019s difficult to answer, Adam, because we don\u2019t view it as being at the low end of those ranges. In prepared, I would say the risk would be if there was a rapid rise in raw material prices and we didn\u2019t timely reflect that in the pricing of our products. Now, you\u2019ve heard me say before that we\u2019ve already had conversations with many of our customers about the potential of prices rapidly increasing, and you also heard me say that there is a large portion of our business that is in fact somewhat of a--it\u2019s a pass through. I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably the risk on the prepared side, but I can tell you our prepared foods segment is in really strong shape. We are capturing share gain, our volumes are strong, so we are very encouraged where our prepared foods business is at.","In the other segments, I\u2019d say the only risk would be in, as we stated, the ranges. It was absent ASF. The only risk I can see is if we had a similar occurrence in 2020 that people were anticipating exports, hog prices stayed high, and exports don\u2019t develop. Other than that, I think beef is headed for a very similar year, if not better in 2020 than what they delivered in 2019.","Obviously in the industries in which we compete, there\u2019s always risk, we deal with that every single year, but there\u2019s nothing stands out that is of particular concern right now.","Adam Samuelson","That\u2019s helpful color. Specifically in the chicken business, I wonder if you can provide any comments on the demand environment domestically that you\u2019re seeing. It seems like especially on the food service side, this increased promotional activity on poultry could be a nice opportunity for you moving forward, but just how you\u2019re seeing that demand environment on your poultry side would be helpful.","Noel White","I think poultry is a great value right now, Adam. You look at the price spreads that exist between each one of the proteins, in the course of the last three or four weeks it has continued to widen, so I think poultry presents a great opportunity for stronger promotion, both at food service as well as retail levels through 2020. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the full impact of that. We\u2019ve seen some of the chicken sandwich promotions that have been rolled out at the QSR level, that\u2019s been helpful, I would say, but as we move through 2020, I think chicken will continue to be a great value. As I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s extremely unusual to see the pork cut-out moving higher at this time of year. Beef, it\u2019s not that unusual, but it has been extraordinarily strong. ","Net disappearance, domestic disappearance, we\u2019re encouraged by. We\u2019re actually projecting per capital consumption to be down this year, and that\u2019s despite the fact that total production is going to be up, so obviously exports are significant help to us.","Adam Samuelson","All right, I appreciate that color. I\u2019ll pass it on, thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Howard","Good morning everyone. I know that you\u2019re not giving guidance numerically around the impact of ASF, but could you possibly walk through the segments and just talk about the risks and opportunities relating to ASF? I imagine that in pork, it\u2019s really the question of what happens with the lean hog prices, there may be a big opportunity in chicken because you\u2019re backward integrated in there and demand might come up, probably not much would go wrong on supply in beef. But could you just give us an idea of qualitatively how you\u2019re thinking about the puts and takes around ASF, because obviously being within the company, you probably have better insight into what all the moving pieces are here than we do on the outside. And then I have a follow-up. ","Noel White","Okay Alexia, let me speak in terms of what\u2019s happening from a global perspective rather than talking about each one of the proteins. From a global perspective, if we take just China, and the public reports would say that there\u2019s somewhere around half the hogs have died in China - it might be a little more, might be a little less, nobody knows the actual number, and China produces half of the hogs in the entire world. So there\u2019s somewhere around 25% reduction that\u2019s taking place on a global basis, which translates to a total protein supply globally of someplace between 5% and 6% decrease in global protein supplies, and that\u2019s everything else being equal.","Now at the same time, we have trade patterns that are shifting as well, so with those shortages as an example, we see increase in exports from Australia, from New Zealand, countries like that, that\u2019s moving into China. We\u2019re seeing less imports into the United States .We\u2019re seeing more beef and pork move from South America into China and Southeast Asia, so the global dynamics are changing, they\u2019re evolving, and any time that the world loses that amount of protein supply and demand is growing, prices are impacted. That\u2019s the difficulty in forecasting what that impact is going to be for us in 2020, because of those market dynamics that continue to shift.","They\u2019re all favorable, they\u2019re all positive, and we can all run different economic models of what we think the impact is going to be, and that\u2019s one of the reasons I think you see the range that is EPS on our stock. There\u2019s basically a $2 range as we look into 2020, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s responsible for Stewart and I to put forth a number where the visibility that we have, we\u2019re very encouraged but we don\u2019t want to put forth a number that we think could in fact be low. ","Alexia Howard","Great, thank you. Then as a quick follow-up at a very different topic, want to welcome Dean Banks on board. Just curious, I can understand that his experience in innovation and technology brings something that\u2019s very timely and very needed. What does that mean for the CEO role, and how is your personal agenda changing here, Noel, as that transition occurs? Thank you, and I\u2019ll pass it on.","Noel White","Sure. Dean and I, we\u2019ve worked together in the past. I have a tremendous amount of respect for Dean, his capabilities. He\u2019s going to be a great addition to the Tyson team. As you saw, he\u2019s been on our board for several years, so we\u2019ve had the opportunity to work together. ","Technology is a growth platform for us. As you saw in my statement, we have put in place several initiatives and we have a lot more to go. Dean is a great cultural fit with the company and with the leadership team. A","As far as my role, Dean and I will be working very closely together over the course of time. It\u2019s an opportunity for Dean just to have a much deeper understanding of our business and at the same time, I can tell you I\u2019ll be learning from him as well. ","Alexia Howard","Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.","Ken Zaslow","Hey, good morning everyone. A couple of follow-ups. How much of the chicken margin improvement is operational versus environmental? I guess that\u2019s my first question and then I have a follow-up on that.","Noel White","Okay. Ken, the operational improvements, there is a minimum of 200 basis points that\u2019s built into that from an operational improvement standpoint. You heard us talk about that at the end of our third quarter, so there\u2019s a minimum of 200 basis points that\u2019s built into this.","Ken Zaslow","So you\u2019re not looking for a material improvement in the chicken environment year-on-year if you take your full year numbers versus 2020 outlook? Then assuming that doesn\u2019t also include the potential of China actually--a trade agreement with China, this whole reciprocity--I think you had discussed the reciprocity between the U.S. accepting Chinese chicken but the U.S. potentially being able to export to China, that does not include that as well? And what products can actually move to China, do you think?","Noel White","The answer to both questions is yes. As I spoke about earlier, there is some pricing improvement that\u2019s built in on specific items, and that is in fact independent of ASF, so regardless if we had AS or we didn\u2019t, we would expect to see some pricing improvement. There is some that\u2019s built in.","Now the significant impact of ASF is not built into it. It\u2019s true in both cases that there is some pricing improvement that\u2019s there, there\u2019s operational improvements, but we\u2019re not taking into consideration if there was significant quantities of poultry that moved to China. ","What specifically that would move to China, I can\u2019t really answer since we\u2019ve not had access for quite some time. However, it\u2019s like going to be some form of dark meat, including wings, so wings are, as you know, in strong demand in China as well as the dark meat from poultry, so those are probably the two most--the two specific items, as well as the paws that are also in very strong demand.","Ken Zaslow","Great. Then just on beef, your outlook does not include the insurance proceeds. I\u2019m assuming that the insurance proceeds are what lost profitability you\u2019ll have, so when you\u2019re getting that 6.5% to 7.5% margin for beef, how much does that exclude for the potential recovery of lost profits, lost logistics costs? How do we think about that, because that 6.5% to 7.5% is probably not the real margin, right, it\u2019s understated by whatever you would have earned prior to the fire? Is that not the way to think about it, and can you put some parameters to that? ","Stewart Glendinning","Yes, let\u2019s keep it simple, Ken. We\u2019ve sort of looked at the year, we\u2019ve looked at when the plant has come online, our costs, etc., and we\u2019ve estimated that and given you that number. Know that on the insurance side, we\u2019ve adjusted that out, and when we get those proceeds, we\u2019ll adjust those out as well. We\u2019re holding that to the side.","Ken Zaslow","So it does not include the insurance proceeds--","Stewart Glendinning","It does not take any benefit from the insurance proceeds.","Ken Zaslow","There\u2019s actual real cash and real margins, right? You\u2019ll actually be able to take that to the bank, right?","Stewart Glendinning","We will be able to take that to the bank, but remember of course that we took a $31 million hit in this past quarter, so.","Ken Zaslow","Great, I appreciate it, guys. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Michael Lavery","Good morning. Thank you. On the prepared foods guidance, you didn\u2019t qualify it with excluding an ASF impact. You mentioned how most of the pricing passes through. Is that really the biggest factor? Is it just that you\u2019ve got some range there to allow for cost pressures if it comes? Obviously there could be an ASF impact. How do you factor that in, what offsets it, and just how should we think about risks or sensitivities on that segment? ","Noel White","Yes, the prepared foods is probably the most difficult to forecast what we think the impact might be. Our other segments, obviously there is a positive impact, potentially significantly positive. In the case of prepared, it\u2019s on the risk side, so it is a matter of how quickly those increases in costs are captured. We\u2019re very confident that we\u2019ll continue to grow our business as we have over the course of the last several years, so the team that\u2019s in place running our prepared foods business is very focused on delivering growth and volume, and I can tell you if it comes down to a choice of selling a lot more at 10% or not much more at 12%, I\u2019ll take the money on the bottom line that\u2019s growing our business at 10%. ","Michael Lavery","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Just on the alternative proteins, can you give us a sense--you mentioned you prefer to launch the ones that are positioned at healthier. How do you define that, and how incremental do you expect some of those products to be? What kind of sourcing assumptions do you make around those?","Noel White","Yes, so it is incremental, Michael. We don\u2019t see cannibalization of any of our other products, so it is in fact incremental. When we say healthier, that\u2019s the reason that we\u2019re been a little bit slower to launch, is that we view the alternative protein--when we go to market, those products not only need to taste great, but they have to be healthier than whatever the alternative is. That\u2019s where we think we can compete and win in the marketplace.","Michael Lavery","Do you measure that on things like sodium or calories? How do you define what healthier means?","Noel White","All of the above, Michael.","Michael Lavery","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Ben Theurer","Yes, good morning everyone. Thanks. Just two follow-ups actually on what\u2019s been discussed. One on beef, if we take a look at the operating income versus the adjusted operating income, basically the increase on the adjusted one is because of the loss that is related to the plant fire and that\u2019s how we should have to think of that going into next year, it\u2019s [indiscernible] follow-up to understand what one you adjust, and you get the insurance, you\u2019re going to take it out, but then your reported operating income might be higher just because you recover it back then. Is that fair to assume? ","Stewart Glendinning","Yes, that\u2019s the right way to look at it. If you look in our press release, you\u2019ll see a reconciliation that shows you the amount [indiscernible] and that\u2019s exactly the way you should think about it going forward. ","Ben Theurer ","Okay, perfect. Then we\u2019ve talked about, and I remember we talked about during the third quarter conference call, the improvement you think you can achieve of roughly 200 basis points in the chicken segment once you\u2019ve accomplished all the initiatives you\u2019ve been aiming for. If we take that roughly 5% operating income margin for full year and then you assume you do get the 200 basis points into next year would bring us to the 7%, which is right at the midpoint of your guidance anyway. The question is how advanced are you currently going into--being right in the first fiscal quarter, and how much of that d you think will be delivered in the first half versus the second half of your fiscal year, just to get a little bit of a sense of what the ramp-up of those operational improvements is going to look like.","Noel White","Yes. Ben, I would say that it\u2019s going to be just a gradual, steady improvement. It\u2019s difficult to exactly quantify that for you by quarter, but there will be a gradual improvement throughout the year.","Stewart Glendinning","And Ben, as you know, we don\u2019t break those numbers out quarter by quarter. Each quarter we\u2019ll update our forecast as we go, so you\u2019ll see that, but as Noel mentioned earlier, he\u2019s got the right people in the right place and we\u2019re starting to see some of those metrics improving. ","Ben Theurer","Okay. Then just maybe one last one, when do you think the beef plant that was impacted by the fire is going to be back on? How much lead time do you still need to be basically back operational there?","Noel White","It will be within the next 60 days, Ben, but we think that\u2019s probably on the long end. We think it could be potentially quicker than that. There is still some contractors that are finishing up, but the team\u2019s done a remarkable job to get back where it needs to be. ","Ben Theurer","Okay, perfect - well, surprisingly possible. Thank you very much for giving me the chance to ask some questions. Have a good one, thanks. ","Operator","Our last question today will be a follow-up from Heather Jones from Heather Jones Research LLC. Please go ahead.","Heather Jones","Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. Just wanted to delve in, you made the comment, the right people in the right place a few times, I think, on the chicken business. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on that, any management changes there have been or whatever. Just was curious about that. ","Noel White","Yes, there has been, Heather, some management changes. We changed the leadership of poultry at the end of January of this past year. There\u2019s been a number of changes that have taken place over the course of 2019, so Chad Martin leads our poultry business and then within the business segments, there\u2019s been changes that have taken place, as well as at the plant level. There are a number of changes been made, and we have complete confidence in the team that\u2019s in place today.","Heather Jones","Okay, so besides the one that we knew about at the end of January, the changes since then have been more at the plant level?","Noel White","No, it\u2019s been throughout the organization, Heather, so not just at the plant level but there has been a number of changes directly underneath Chad, and keep in mind Chad has a fairly sizeable team, so he chose his team, he put them in place, and we think we have the right team.","Heather Jones","Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Noel White for any closing remarks.","Noel White","Okay, thank you for joining us today, and from all of us at Tyson, we wish you a happy holiday season. Thank you. ","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jon Kathol, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jon Kathol","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Tyson Foods' conference call for the fourth quarter and 2012 fiscal year. I need to remind you that some of the things we'll talk about today will include forward-looking statements. Those statements are based on our view of the world as we know it now, which could change. I encourage you to look at today's press release for a discussion of the risks that can affect our business.","On today's call is Donnie Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Leatherby, Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Lochner, Chief Operating Officer. [Operator Instructions]","I'll now turn the call over to Donnie Smith.","Donnie Smith","Thanks, Jon. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today.","Before we get to our results, I want to say that our hearts go out to everyone in the Northeast affected by Superstorm Sandy, and I'd like to thank the Tyson team members who traveled from 9 different locations, some as far away as Oklahoma, Arkansas, Virginia and Tennessee, to prepare and serve meals at our Meals That Matter feeding sites in Bayonne, New Jersey and Staten Island. Our teams have worked with local volunteers to feed more than 60,000 meals to first responders and storm victims. These team members have it in their hearts to make a difference, and I'm proud to be associated with them.","As you saw in our press release this morning, we had a strong fourth quarter and another very good year. In the past 3 years, our EPS has averaged around the $2 mark on an adjusted basis. That's a new base level of performance when you look at this company's EPS over time. I'm very proud of our management team and all our team members.","Thinking about what we've accomplished over the last 3 years in a sluggish economy with unfavorable market dynamics and staggering input cost increases, it really is impressive. So I'm going to take a minute and list what I see as many of the important accomplishments:","We've produced consecutive record sales 3 years in a row with an 8% compounded annual growth rate.","We generated $3.7 billion in operating cash flows, and this is after funding $600 million in working capital increases.","We invested nearly $2 billion back in our company through CapEx.","We paid down debt by $1.1 billion.","We reduced net debt to cap from 34% to 18.4%. That's the lowest level since the IBP acquisition.","We reduced net debt to EBITDA from 2.8x to 0.8x.","We got our debt rating back to investment grade with all 3 rating agencies.","We improved our liquidity position to over $2 billion at the end of fiscal '12.","We bought back $400 million of our stock, or over 22 million shares.","We improved production efficiencies throughout our operations and achieved $715 million in operating efficiencies in our poultry segment alone in the past 3 years and over $1 billion in total in that segment.","We developed a cohesive strategy and a plan for growth around our multi-protein, multi-channel, multinational business model.","We stepped up our international growth efforts, especially in China.","We diversified export sales so that we aren't overly dependent on any one country or region.","And as I've said earlier, and I think it bears repeating, we averaged around $2 a share in adjusted EPS over the last 3 years, and we did all this with nearly $1 billion in additional feed ingredient cost in the past 2 years.","We're establishing a culture of lean thinking, operational excellence and continuous improvement. We're a better, safer, more dependable company.","But while it's good to look back and remind ourselves of how far we've come, our destiny is not to become a low-cost commodity protein company. Our customers and our stakeholders need us to grow into a solution-providing food company. We've laid the foundation, and we can never forget what got us to this point. But what got us here, won't get us there. So today, we'd like to share with you where we'll be taking the company.","Let's start with sales growth. Over the next 3 years, Tyson will accelerate our growth in value-added poultry and Prepared Foods and in our international business. And as a result, you should expect to see our top line sales grow between 3% and 4% annually. Our value-added sales should grow at twice that rate, or at 6% to 8%, and the sales from international production should grow at twice that rate, or 12% to 16% a year. We will grow our existing domestic businesses as our customers' go-to supplier by providing quality, service and innovation. We'll make headway into other channels like convenience stores. We'll focus on developing new value-added products. And of course, we'll grow our international business. Our intention is to grow that business aggressively.","Now let's look at our earnings expectations. We're anticipating an incremental $600 million in feed ingredient cost in fiscal '13, and we'll need to offset that through pricing and other measures. I should hurry on to say that I think fiscal '13 EPS will be similar to the last couple of years. And it's encouraging to note that we're off to a great start in Q1.","So how will we accomplish that? Well, for perspective, our start-up operations in Brazil and China lost a little over $100 million in FY '12. In China, as we bring on more company-owned housing in 2013, allowing us to move more of our mix away from wholesale and into more desirable channels, we will reduce our losses substantially. We're also executing better in Brazil, and we'll benefit from the progress we're making there in moving our mix to include more value-added offerings. And frankly, in FY '12, we made some missteps in parts of our domestic business that cost us too. But even with these missteps, we still had very strong results in 2012. We learned from our mistakes. We won't be making them again, which gives us a head start on 2013.","We're planning to gain another $100 million in operating efficiencies in our poultry and Prepared Foods businesses this year. We also expect to earn price increases based on our quality of service and innovation. We're going to upgrade our product mix with more value-added items throughout our segments, and we're poised to make significant strides in growing our Prepared Foods businesses. Jim will add a few more details about this in his remarks.","There's a lot to be excited about because we've positioned ourselves well for fiscal '13. Yes, there will be challenging fundamentals, but that's always the case in our industry. It's our job to manage them, and we think we've proven we can do that. Our team figures it out and finds a way to get it done. Therefore, we expect EPS in FY '13 to be flat to the previous 2 years, and fiscal '14 and '15 should grow at a rate of around 10%. Our cash flow will continue to be strong and, combined with our strong balance sheet, we'll have several options to deliver value to our shareholders. We'll continue repurchasing our shares, investing in our business and seeking the right acquisition to fill gaps and unmet consumer needs.","That concludes my remarks. Dennis will now give you the financial update, followed by Jim, who will talk about our operating segments. Dennis?","Dennis Leatherby","Thank you, Donnie, and good morning, everyone.","We reported fourth quarter earnings of $0.51 per share, or $0.55 after adjusting for a $15-million impairment charge on noncore assets. This compares to $0.26 per share a year ago. Reported fiscal 2012 earnings was $1.58 per share, or $1.91 after adjusting for the fourth quarter impairment and a third quarter charge of $167 million related to the early extinguishment of our 2014 notes. The $1.91 adjusted EPS compares to $1.89 adjusted EPS in fiscal 2011.","Pretax return on invested capital for the past 12 months was 17.1%. Over the past 3 years, pretax ROIC has averaged just over 19%. Capital expenditures were $160 million for the quarter, bringing the fiscal 2012 total to a record $690 million. These investments reflect numerous capital projects for both our domestic and foreign operations that result in improved productive capabilities, labor efficiencies, yields and sales mix.","Our operating cash flow for fiscal 2012 was above $1 billion for a third consecutive year at $1.2 billion. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 39.9%, or 38% excluding the impairment of noncore assets, which had no tax benefit.","For fiscal 2012, our effective tax rate was 37.9%, or 36.7% on an adjusted basis. Including cash of more than $1 billion, net debt was just under $1.4 billion. Total liquidity was $2 billion, well above our targeted range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Gross debt was just over $2.4 billion, in line with the end of last quarter. As Donnie mentioned, net debt to EBITDA for the last 12 months was 0.8x. On a gross debt to EBITDA basis, this measure was 1.4x.","During the fourth quarter, we acquired 3.2 million shares for $50 million under our share repurchase program. On our last call, we said that we expected to reduce share repurchases until we had better visibility into our cash needs and market conditions. Due to the strong earnings in the latter part of the fourth quarter, we were able to purchase near previous levels while continuing to maintain our leverage and liquidity targets.","Our average diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter was 363 million and 370 million for fiscal 2012. This reflects the dilutive share effect of options and convertible notes of $5 million for the fourth quarter, and $7 million for fiscal 2012.","Before moving on to fiscal 2013, I would also like to take a brief moment to discuss the improvements we've made to our balance sheet over the past few years. On this call, 4 years ago, we discussed the convertible notes and follow-on equity offerings that we did in September 2008 to shore up our balance sheet. Then 4 months later, in March 2009, we issued $810 million of 10.5%, 5-year, high-yield notes and converted our revolver to a secured asset-backed loan facility. Following 3 years of considerable improvements in our operating results and deleveraging, we have returned to investment grade with all 3 rating agencies.","With these improved ratings, we have been able to replace the asset-backed facility with an unsecured revolver and issue $1 billion of 4.5%, 10-year, investment-grade notes to replace the high-yield notes. Additionally, we have repurchased nearly all of the 22.4 million shares we issued in 2008, and we have cash in excess of our liquidity target already on the balance sheet to retire the converts when they mature in 11 months.","In summary, we have put the extensive capital raises of 2008 and 2009 behind us, and that feels great.","Now looking forward, here are some thoughts on fiscal 2013. We expect revenues of approximately $35 billion, up 5% over 2012. Net interest expense should approximate $140 million, down approximately $37 million from 2012 when adjusting for the premiums paid to extinguish the high-yield notes early. The effective tax rate should be around 36%. Our preliminary CapEx plan is around $550 million, which may increase as we gain further visibility into the year ahead.","The improvements that we've made over the past 3 years have provided us with a balance sheet that is a competitive advantage and a solid foundation for our strategic plan. This morning we reported our Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $0.10 per share for our Class A stock and $0.09 per share for our Class B stock. The board also increased our regular dividend by 25%. Our sustained new level of performance, combined with the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity, has given us the opportunity to increase our dividends to return cash to shareholders. Our priorities for excess cash in the coming year include additional capital spending to improve and grow our existing businesses, acquisitions to fulfill our growth strategies around value-added products in our international footprint, and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, all while ensuring we will maintain plenty of liquidity at our disposal. Accomplishing these priorities will position us well to meet our objective of at least 10% annual EPS growth beyond 2013.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jim for a closer look into our operating segments.","James V. Lochner","Thanks, Dennis, and good morning, everyone.","I'll begin with the Prepared Foods segment, which produced $39 million in operating income in the fourth quarter and a 4.8% return on sales. For the year, Prepared Foods had $181 million in operating income and a 5.6% return on sales. Average sales price was up 1.6% on 0.9% lower volume.","We are focused on growing this segment, and we recently launched several new products, including frozen handheld snack items, Tyson brand luncheon meats, chicken luncheon meat and hotdogs. We have invested in our Houston plant to improve efficiencies and increase our flexibility for lunchmeat production, which will allow us to grow that business. In addition, we're following the success of Wright Brand Bacon with Wright Brand Fully Cooked Ribs and sliced beef brisket. Wright is a premium brand, and these products are exceptional in quality and flavor. Our R&D, culinary, consumer insight, sales and marketing teams are working closely with our customer base to provide new products and category solutions.","In the deli channel, Tyson continues to solidify our position as a leader in consumer and shopper research. For the second year in a row, Progressive Grocer Magazine recognized Tyson Deli as a category captain for deli-prepared foods. This is -- this award is a validation that Tyson Deli excels in the tools and knowledge that grow our customer businesses.","Looking ahead in 2013 fiscal year for Prepared Foods segment, we expect our growth to include building on our position as the country's leading foodservice pepperoni producer. And earlier this year, we completed a state-of-the-art expansion of our Council Bluffs, Iowa pepperoni plant. We are also exploring growth opportunities in tortillas and ethnic foods and developing greater presence in the convenience store channel, in addition to our improvements in luncheon meat.","Now turning to Pork. The segment posted $68 million in operating income and a 5.2% return on sales in the fourth quarter. Margins were squeezed early in the quarter, carrying over from the supply\/demand imbalance experienced in our fiscal third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we continued to perform well against our internal index goal using the reported USDA prices for the cut-out, drop credit and regional hog cost. We have continuously improved against this index every year, and we achieved this by managing mix, yields, value-added premium programs and pricing analytics.","For the fiscal year, Pork had $417 million in operating income and a 7.6% return on sales. Average sales price was down 1.5% on 2.4% higher volumes. In fiscal '13, we expect industry hog supplies to be relatively flat. We expect pork exports in 2013 to remain similar to 2012, and overall margin should be strong.","Turning to our Chicken segment. In the fourth quarter, we had $116 million in operating income and a 3.8% return on sales, or a 4.3% return excluding the impairment of our noncore China assets. Excluding losses from our international start-up operations, Q4 return on sales was 5.7%.","For the year, the Chicken segment produced $446 million in operating income and a 3.8% return on sales. Excluding the international start-up losses, return on sales in fiscal '12 was 5.1%. Average sales price was up 9.2% on 3.6% lower volume.","I think we should be pleased with these results, considering we overcame $320 million year-over-year in additional feed cost, aided in large part by the $115 million in operating efficiencies we achieved, which was short of our $125-million target. This proves we have the pricing and operational leverage that allow us to deliver strong results in periods of high input costs.","Sales volume decreases in the quarter were due to our buy-versus-grow strategy, which resulted in fewer parts we didn't have to sell at reduced prices. Growth in our international operations offset some of the domestic volume decreases in our Chicken segment. We will continue to focus on aggressive growth of value-added domestic retail and international chicken sales, and we anticipate heavy chicken features at foodservice national accounts throughout the year.","We have maintained the production cuts we've put in place in 2011 and will supplement our needs with the purchases on the open market. We will be pushing for price increases for our chicken products across the board, and we expect our international start-up operations to improve substantially as we continue building company-owned chicken farms, reducing our exposure to the market birds and benefiting from strong customer acceptance in the retail and foodservice channels.","Our overall outlook for the Chicken segment is positive. We believe we can adjust to the current grain forecasts with our focus on value-added, price, overall mix and operational improvements.","The Beef segment produced $117 million operating income in the fourth quarter and a 3.4% return on sales. For the fiscal year, operating income was $218 million with 1.6% margin. Average sales price was up 14.4% on 11.3% lower volumes.","Our Beef business has been profitable through this point in Q1. While the reported USDA cut-out and drop credit versus average cattle costs has been showing a negative margin for quite some time, we consistently outperformed this reported relationship with our focus on merchandising premium programs, primal mix and ground beef upgrades and yields.","Currently, we're optimistic fiscal '13 Beef earnings should be similar to fiscal '12, with upside for more emphasis on value-added beef in the overall mix and fewer market issues like LFTB that we experienced in '12. We anticipate a reduction of fed cattle supply of 2% to 3% in fiscal '13, with the largest decline beginning in Q3. However, we expect to have adequate cattle supplies in all our plant locations.","The last Cattle on Feed report showed increased placements in Iowa, Nebraska, Idaho and Washington. Also, keep in mind, there have been subtle structural changes over time in the beef complex. Carcass weights are up, requiring fewer head to produce the same number of pounds, and we focus on our selling strategy to maximize the cut-out and optimize premium programs.","Our Beef business is extremely efficient. We maximize revenue through numerous value-added programs like retail case-readies, specially trimmed and portioned sub-primals and foodservice steak-cutting operations. We're able to differentiate from the commodity categories through multiple value-added offerings.","To wrap up my thoughts, I'd say that we have some near-term challenges. But I'm not worried. We have demonstrated the ability to deliver results in adverse grain or supply\/demand conditions, as that has become the norm for our businesses. I have confidence in our team's ability to understand these conditions, adjust their plans and stay committed to adding value to our products with customer and consumer needs in mind.","All our business units clearly understand the market fundamentals and what they need to do to continue to be successful. We are all dedicated to accelerating growth, stepping up innovation of products and services, and cultivating talent to prepare for the future.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question from Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I'm just kind of curious. When you guys laid out your plan of 10% growth for the next 2 years and kind of 2013 numbers, can you talk about -- how much of the industry-specific fundamentals matter, particularly on the Chicken side, versus how much clarity do you have on those, 2013 to 2015?","Donnie Smith","The underlying fundamentals that would go into our plan would basically be the numbers you see USDA putting out. We look at various different analysts and then kind of average all that. So, yes, if you -- anyways -- so we just use the average of what those analysts were, and it's really, for us, Ken, about pulling the levers that we know we can pull in our business. We mentioned increased operating efficiencies, but -- growing our value-added. We are being successful in price increases. Our customers seem to understand that these higher grain prices are going to require higher prices. We continue to change the structure of a lot of our pricing agreements. Our fixed-price exposure -- annual fixed-price exposure is going to be single digits after the first of the year. So you combine those kind of things and, Ken, that's how we can be so confident about getting better in 2013.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So if the chicken production levels kind of are modestly lower, I'm assuming -- I mean, call it 0% to 1%, you don't -- you see that, that -- your ability to get to normalized numbers over a 2-year period is high or low, I guess, is kind of my question. It doesn't seem like the chicken guys are cutting, and if we stay in this higher feed environment, like, what gets you to the normal level over the next, call it, 12 to 18 months?","Donnie Smith","Yes. I mean -- well, first of all, if you look at the last couple of quarters, you've had corn in excess of $7 delivered; you've had soybean $450 plus, close to $500 delivered; and our domestic Chicken business had a 5.7% return on sales in Q4 and a 5.1% for the year. So yes. I mean, I think if you look at our 1%, 1.5% down in production, whatever the USDA number is on 2013, and our current view of grain prices, sure. We should be very comfortable, very high confidence level in our ability to deliver these results.","Operator","Our next question from Ken Goldman, JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So thanks for giving the 2014 guidance, and now you get everyone asking about 2014, and I'll do the same. But I have a little bit of a different tack. I'm curious because you have a situation where corn futures are suggesting much lower corn prices for your fiscal 14. I can't see a situation where chicken production really goes up a huge amount in that time. So I'm having a very difficult time modeling your Chicken margin in a year like that, where chicken production doesn't go up and corn goes down, modeling anything below your normalized range at all. I'm getting above it. And I know everyone's numbers are different, and I'm not asking for guidance on my model, but why should we expect only 10% that year? Why shouldn't 2014 be a pretty darn good year when it comes to your Chicken margin?","Donnie Smith","It could be, Ken. For us -- hey, 2014 is a long -- pretty far out there to be talking about. But, yes, I mean, I think at least 10% ought to be in everyone's mind across all of our business. Remember, you -- we got to keep remembering we're a $33-billion multi-protein company, not a $33-billion chicken company, right? But yes, I can't argue with you.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right. And then one question just on -- when I hear Tyson talking about focusing more on value-added, focusing more on international, I go back to hearing Tyson talk about this 5, 10 years ago. And obviously, there were some good things that came out of that push, but there were some not-so-good things also, right, where the company arguably took its eye off the ball in terms of efficiency in its commodity chicken, beef and pork. And I'm just curious how we as outsiders gain comfort. Obviously, you're a different company now and, Donnie, you've done a great job bringing cost efficiency back to the company. But how do we get comfort that as you start to focus on value-added in international again, that perhaps you don't take your eye off the ball elsewhere?","Donnie Smith","Ken, that's a great question, and frankly, it's one that we spend a lot of time talking about around here. I think the difference is the foundation that's been built. When we talk about our strategy of accelerate, innovate, cultivate, we always do so based on a platform of fundamental execution -- fundamental executional excellence, operating efficiencies, lean thinking, continuous improvement, that type of thing and leveraging a strong balance sheet. It's taken 3 long, hard years to get our balance sheet back in order. During those 3 years, we knew that we needed to build a strong platform of functional excellence. And we've done that. I mean -- hey, there's always room to improve, and we embrace lean thinking and continuous improvement. So we will never say we're there. But I can tell you that every person at Tyson Foods understands that we cannot ever take our eye off the ball, and we've got to keep that firm foundation in place as we now build on it new platforms, new product offerings. And the thing that gives us, it's an idea of the proper cost structure of that new platform because now, we know what good looks like. So great question. And all I could draw you to is notice the difference in the last 3 years and then layer upon that good cost structure growth in value-added, not only in poultry, but also in our Prepared Foods business. And I think we can start seeing a pretty bright future.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then one very quick one. I assume, when you talk about 2013 EPS looking similar to 2012, you're talking about a $1.91 base, not the $1.58 GAAP base, right?","Donnie Smith","Yes, yes, yes.","Operator","Our next question from Farha Aslam, Stephens Inc.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And just kind of closer in, in terms of your Beef business, your results were surprisingly good in this quarter, and your guidance is quite strong despite the fact that you've lowered your cattle number outlook. Could you share with us maybe some things that you're doing differently in your Beef business that's allowing you to deliver very solid earnings and provide a very solid outlook despite a contracting cattle supply?","Donnie Smith","Jim?","James V. Lochner","Yes. The key is, I had in my prepared remarks, we've put a tremendous amount of effort and focus behind trying to beat the wholesale prices through added value. So it's a combination of specialty trimmed sub-primals, it's in steak cutting, it's in case-ready, it's in pricing analytics, and we spend a lot of time focused on what that forward short-term supply is so we can keep ourselves in balance. And then we also really put a tremendous amount of effort on a lot of metrics driven towards revenue-to-efficiency metrics. So the combination is just running what I'd call a very smart business, knowing that the supply has come down. Ironically, if you look over the last 5 years -- the last 5-year average, by the way, is almost like 1.8%. There's only been 1 year it's been up in 5 years. So that 2% to 3% is about what we've been experiencing the last 5 years. So it's a tremendous amount of detail on a whole bunch of issues and continuing to have that value-added above the wholesale market prices.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then, Donnie, when you think about your CapEx investments versus acquisitions, what kind of ROIC are you using on CapEx versus acquisitions? And where do you see the most attractive acquisition strategies? And what size of acquisitions are in your target range now?","Donnie Smith","Okay. So we have a very similar outlook for CapEx as acquisitions, because we kind of look at our capital the same way in both. Typically, and it depends on the project, Farha, internally, we're going to have a couple of hundred, 250 or so that's going to be in basic M&R [ph]. And so above that, in order to keep our capital in line -- once you factor in your weighted average cost of capital, we need to be in that 20% to 25% range on income-producing or cost-savings CapEx. Let me give you a quick example. Down in Houston, we've got a couple of important customers that depend on us in that -- out of that plant for our lunchmeat business. So we're putting about $30 million into that plant now to increase our cooking and slicing technology in order to take care of that business. So that project has a very good return on capital. But then on the acquisition side, I'd tell you that our sweet spot is -- probably, today, in an acquisition that would be $50 million or less. It would be somebody that makes great food in maybe a regional area that we can capitalize on our strengths as we build that business out. Now that's not to say that an acquisition sub-$500 million, $200 plus, whatever, might not be in the mix. But the sweet spot for us right now would probably be in that $50-million range. Does that help?","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Yes. So you're not looking for kind of larger, kind of transformational, kind of maybe -- let me take a look -- 2 to like -- more like $4 billion to $5 billion-type transactions, those kind of larger, big moves?","Donnie Smith","No.","Operator","Our next question from Heather Jones, BB&T Capital Markets.","Heather L. Jones - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Is it a fair assumption that your fiscal '14 and '15 commentary assumes, for at least fiscal '14, another challenging year in Beef given that you're expecting the tight supplies to become more pronounced in Q3 of '13?","James V. Lochner","We think that we can continue to navigate through the margins. We do expect the supply -- the calf crop projection for '12 continues to tell us that we'll continue to see that supply reduction. And again, as I answered earlier, that's the continued emphasis on trying to add value across the board, and we did drop our market share. We really worked hard at adding the value and working on overall gross margin. I can't project what will happen across the board in the industry, but our plants do sit where the better feedlots appear to be. And we've seen the last Cattle on Feed flow back kind of into that Nebraska, Iowa region.","Heather L. Jones - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","But when I'm looking at '14, and you all are talking about 10% growth, I guess, first of all, Donnie said previously, it does seem like Chicken should be better. You're cutting interest expense and your international business is improving. So you're not assuming any meaningful improvement in Beef in '14 versus '13 to get to that 10% growth.","James V. Lochner","That's right. Correct.","Donnie Smith","Correct. Yes.","Heather L. Jones - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And on Chicken, you all talk about your national breadth, your value-added offering, your customer service. Just wondering, though, if you could give us some sector specifics. Because if you listen to the commentary out there from some large end users, but there's also some commentary from some competitors, it's been fairly subdued on the amount of pricing that people have been able to get on fixed contracts, it seems like, whereas you all sound fairly confident. So was wondering if you could give us some more specifics as to why you're confident and why you may have fared better than others in securing price increases.","Donnie Smith","Okay. Good question. So a couple of things. We think we have 3 things to leverage: raw materials; resources; and very importantly, relationships. Over the last 3 years, we've rebuilt a lot of customer relationships that were suffering. And frankly, we've done that by providing the kind of quality, service and the innovative capability that our customers need to grow their business. One thing, too, that we've not done is we've not cut our R&D expense. So we've been working on new packaging, new cooking technologies, new ingredient technologies. And these kind of things, as our customers see them, they see us as a supply partner that they definitely need to keep in the mix. And based on the fact we're not giving them any excuses not to do business with us, we like the fact that we're getting the kind of price that we need commensurate to the value that we're adding to their business. In terms of new platforms, as we move forward, we'll be adding products in our Better For You line. Some of those may be using whole grain breading, gluten-free type products. I think you'll also see us making some strides in ethnic -- in our ethnic offerings in Mexican food, in Asian. Jim mentioned in his call or in his script our handheld category, and we're adding some innovation into our handheld category. So several different lines of products that we'll be introducing this year or upgrading our product mix or adding some incremental innovation to -- that will continue to drive value. And our focus is on adding value to our customers' business. And as we do that, they pay us for the value we add. So we stay focused on that. So I think those are a few of the reasons that might give us some confidence in our ability to cover that incremental cost of, say, round numbers, $600 million that's coming at us this year.","Operator","Our next question from Ryan Oksenhendler, Bank of America.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess just a follow-up on -- to Heather's question. It seems like protein per capita consumption has been declining in the U.S. over the last several years. So in order to grow your value-added business, it seems like you'd have to take some market share. So I guess, what gives you the confidence that you can do that and continue to take the pricing? And it seems like over the last few decades, that every time you've seen the incremental margins in this industry, you've always been priced away by competitors. And what gives you the -- so what give you the confidence that over the next few years your value-added business, you won't see that margin erosion from competitors taking pricing?","Donnie Smith","Sure. It comes down to the customers' choice, and customers typically choose those who can bring the type of innovation into their business that they need in order to grow their business. So like I mentioned before, we've not cut our R&D expense. As a matter of fact, we've added to it a little bit. We've added to the ranks of our marketing teams. And so we're in front of customers, helping them with solutions that will grow their business. And so when there's a choice of who to use as your supply partner, as long as you don't have quality and service issues, most will choose that innovative partner that can help them grow their business. That seems to be the case with us. Also, let's not minimize the value of our buy-versus-grow strategy. Because in a pricing discussion, we're not selling any excess on the market today. And frankly, there's been a few opportunities toward an RFP, although we would have liked to have continued to be that customer's supply partner, we've walked out of the RFP just because the pricing got too cheap. And as long as you're buying your raw material, in our case, primarily breast meat, although not exclusively breast meat -- as long as you're buying that raw material and you're not excess product, then you're able to hold on to your price stream. So I think the value of our buy-versus-grow strategy also allows us to be more effective in a pricing discussion.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And could you just -- a quick follow-up then. Can you give us an idea of how much of your business is currently value-added versus commodity and what the difference in margins are -- look like?","Donnie Smith","Yes. So what we've done, in Donnie King's business, primarily, our poultry and Prepared Foods business, we've actually -- as we look at our segments, we have some business units inside those segments. And we've kind of called certain business units commodity business units because a lot of their mix is commodity. Not all, but a lot. And then other business units are in the more value-added category. And I'd say, today, in Donnie King's business, and that's probably around a $15-billion business or so, your 60 -- low 60s percent is the value-added piece of that. Now our task over time is to have more and more of the sales in his business as being value-added. Now let me hasten on to say that we also have value-added categories in Beef and Pork as well, and then our international business will continue to grow. And as we get those -- more and more company-owned birds and away from these wholesale markets that we're so dependent on today, our margins will improve substantially in our international business, too. So when you put all that together, Ryan, I think that's how you get to that, call it, 3.5% growth for the total, is that you're really growing your value-added segments and your international segment a lot faster.","Operator","Our next question from Tim Ramey, D.A. Davidson.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Donnie, I was interested in the comment where you talked about the spread between your domestic margin and your consolidated poultry margin. If I did the math right, and that's always suspect, it looks like you might have lost somewhere in the range of $40 million in the quarter and maybe $120 million plus for the year, and they're in the start-up operations in China and Brazil. Is that -- am I getting to that correctly?","Donnie Smith","Directionally, you're right. It was about $105 million for the year, and about $15 million of that was the write-off that we mentioned. So call it right at $90 million on an operating basis, end of the year.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","So that's bullish from the standpoint of \"Hopefully, we can minimize those losses over time.\" Do you have a sense of how that looks in fiscal '13? And also, I assume that would be bullish for your tax rate over time as you perhaps get to utilize some of those losses down the road. Can you comment on that?","Donnie Smith","Yes. Tim, you're dead on. Our current plan calls for us to reduce those losses by 80% in FY '13 and then for the business to continue at that growth rate and be positive in '14 and beyond. As we look at our international business, about 25% of the chicken that's going to market today is out of company-owned housing. And so the product offering we have and the price spread between that product offering and the wholesale offering, which our wholesale offering is based on market birds, that spread is at or above what our pro forma was when we began our international approach. So the bottom line is we just can't get there fast enough, and it's all about getting chicken houses built. We've got a great quality offering. The food safety is there that we're looking for. So all the pieces are in place; it really is just a matter of getting as much of that production into company-owned housing as we can, as fast as we can. So take 80% of that $90 million this year and add that, and then keep that growth rate going into '14 and '15. And you'll -- the math you'll probably see out there that you might question is, \"Wait a minute. That kind of looks like you're in maybe low double-digit earnings in your poultry business in China,\" and that's right. We don't -- Brazil is a little bit more mature and frankly, we've got more work to do to get into more of a value-added mix in Brazil. But we have added a new sales leader in our Brazilian poultry business, and we continue to back them up with great R&D resources there and out of the U.S. So we feel comfortable we're going to get there, but our margin expectations would be a little better in -- well, would be better in China than in Brazil.","Dennis Leatherby","Tim, on your tax rate question, you're right. Our effective tax rate will go down over time because of the jurisdictions that we're in, and the foreign markets have substantially lower tax rates. So that would favorably affect our overall effective tax rate.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Great. And -- I mean, that all is terrific, and I can see that making positive momentum in '13, but -- I mean, it is a big step function from $330 million to $600 million of incremental costs. Can you break down kind of how you see that flowing through the P&L, in terms of you would recover x% of that through pricing and x% through cost reductions and x% through mix? Or -- is there a way to kind of help us think about how you could recover some or all of that?","Donnie Smith","Yes, sure. Let me give you an idea of the categories first. And so number one, we mentioned another incremental $100 million in poultry and Prepared Foods operational improvements. We got -- was it $113 million or $115 million this year, guys?","Dennis Leatherby","$115 million.","Donnie Smith","$115 million this year, which was short of our $125-million target. But our team worked hard, and so we see another $100 million coming there. The international improvements, that's going to be, what, $70 million, $80 million, something like that. That's a big number. Hey, reduced interest expense is going to help on the EPS basis. We are getting price and mix improvements. We've got a lunchmeat that we will be fixing this year, and I mentioned a little earlier in the call some CapEx going into an important part of that business. We will probably see, we think, less market disruption issues this year, for example. I don't have in the plan another LFTB issue, and that cost us some money. And also, we probably could have done a better job in Q1 and the very, very early stages of Q2 last year on our managing of the choice select spread. I mentioned some other missteps in our domestic business, frankly, in Q1 and Q2. We left quite a bit of money on the table in our wing business, followed by, by the way, an encore presentation in Q3 with messing up on our buy-versus-grow and being a little too dependent on the outside markets, which got us above the law of diminishing returns on our breast meat trim. And that cost us quite a bit of money. So -- and then again, coming to the new market -- coming to the market with these new platforms. So there are quite a few levers to pull there, Tim. And you add all that up and we bridge the gap. So that's how we're seeing the year.","Operator","Our next question from Akshay Jagdale, KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So starting with Chicken, just wanted to focus on the short term first. So can you give us your latest thoughts on what your view is on production levels and the industry's ability to pass on higher feed costs?","Donnie Smith","So for our planned years, we have like a 1%, 1.5% decrease in production. Whatever the USDA's showing, that's what we're using. Now on our ability to be able to pass along that increased cost, our buy-versus-grow strategy really does reduce our exposure to the volatility in the commodity pricing, the commodity pieces of this business. So when you take that and you combine that with our mix changes and our ability to take price increases, I don't -- we're not going to be dependent on the market necessarily for our future. It really is about reducing our exposure to the commodity side with our buy-versus-grow strategy and improving our value-added mix.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. So if I was to -- I'm interpreting your commentary on fiscal '13 as being previously, you just said you were going to be profitable. Now you're saying profitable, but could be below normalized range. So I'm viewing that as previously, you were saying 0% to 1%, and now you're saying maybe 0% to 7%. I don't -- is that the right way to think about it?","Donnie Smith","Yes, yes, yes. You're thinking about it right. Absolutely.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just longer term -- again, I appreciate all the color. So first of all, when you talked about a new base, is the right way to think about it, as Tyson's going to earn $1.90 despite any challenges thrown their way? So is that sort of a bottom EPS number? Because you did have some significant challenges that you dealt with in the last 2 years: higher grain cost, LFTB. I mean, I could go on and on. So is that a better way to think about it? Is that sort of a baseline that you feel comfortable you can do in any environment?","Donnie Smith","Yes.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then in terms of growth, you talked about 2 major levers on your top line. And I'm just looking at 10% growth off of whatever EBIT you had this year, and it's $120 million-ish, I think, for fiscal '14. I could get that number just out of your China business, and so it seems like the growth that you're modeling is going to come, even if the rest of your business, other than international and value-added, doesn't grow at all. Is that sort of a good way to think about it as well?","Donnie Smith","Yes. There's always a few things that happen that are unexpected in any given year. And as I said here today, it's hard to tell what unexpected things are going to hit us in '14. But we feel comfortable that with the foundation we've laid and the balance sheet we've got and the team we have in place, that we're going to be able to not just overcome the hills and the challenges that come, but also be able to grow our business and grow our EPS with all the levers we have to pull, and with the innovation that we can bring to the market. So yes, I think you're thinking about it right.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And just on China, I think, previously -- I may be wrong, but previously, you had said China should be within sort of a normal range of earnings by fiscal '14. Is that now pushed back to '15, if I'm reading it correctly? Or still...","Donnie Smith","Yes, we meant -- I'm sorry, we meant by the end '14, which you would see fully in the '15 year. Now, Akshay, that is dependent on us staying on track with our current housing plan, but I see no reason to believe we won't do that. So yes.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one last one. So why did you -- again, I appreciate you giving us this guidance, but I'm just trying to get into your head here. Why did you feel there was a need to make these positive sort of long-term comments now? Like, why now? And what's the biggest risk to Tyson sort of not being able to grow from here on, from an earnings perspective, in your opinion?","Donnie Smith","Okay. Good question. So number one is we felt like -- that we needed to build some credibility. Because as we go out and talk to investors, '08 and '09 continues to come up. Well, I think 3 years of solid results in the face of, gosh, in the last 2 years, $1 billion of incremental grain cost and all of the things that we mentioned on our list in the script prove that we have laid a solid foundation. But it's not about just having a solid foundation; it's about building a house, right? And so the way -- what we got to do is we've got to accelerate our growth, and we've talked about doing that in value-added, we've talked about doing that in the Prepared Foods segment and in our international. And a big component of that is having the right innovative capability, not just in new products, but also in processes and analytics and packaging and ingredients and those kinds of things. We have those resources, and now it's time to put them to use. So we think we have the credibility because we've built a 3-year foundation, and part of our culture says we're going to do what we say we're going to do. Well, you got to say you're going to do something in order to do what you say you're going to do. So now we've said what we're going to do and, over the next 3 years in this horizon, then we'll do what we say we're going to do. So that's really what it's been about, Akshay.","Operator","Our next question from Christine McCracken, Cleveland Research.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Jim, you mentioned that we're going to see these tighter beef supplies over the next year. That doesn't come as a huge shock, I don't think, to anyone. But where we're -- we seem to be hitting a bit of a wall is on prices, both here in the U.S. and in export markets, from a demand perspective. Seems to be some pushback by consumers, and I'm wondering -- as it relates to your strategy as you sell into the market, you have a strong premium program here in the U.S., for example, and now you've got the expanded access to Japan coming. It seems like -- can you talk about how you think about recouping some of that pricing with cattle costs moving higher in the next year?","James V. Lochner","Well, first of all, generally, if you look back in history, cattle cost and revenue are very highly related. So as the cut-out and drop credit moves up and down, the cattle cost over time will get fairly correlated back to that. So I always remind people that we make money in a spread business like beef packing and the slope could change. And then on top of that -- and that USDA reported cut-out is the strongest relationship; thus, our whole thrust to always try to beat that relationship through value-added pricing, timing, et cetera. I don't know that the price -- we've heard repeated years that we're going to hit the ceiling, and we seem to break through it into higher overall cut-out every year, which simply says to me that even though we've had some demand destruction, what we're seeing is that the supply reduction really is at a slightly faster rate than the demand destruction because we keep moving to higher prices. At what point that hits a true ceiling, I don't know. My theory is simply that people who want to buy beef, buy beef, and the price point isn't the major deterrent. And ground beef is a staple, and ground beef pricing has continued to go up year-over-year. So the short answer is, I don't know that we're going to see a true price ceiling, and our job is to navigate through that in the spread business.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Is -- expanded access to Japan and better export pricing, is that in your outlook for '13?","James V. Lochner","Actually, we do think that, that will be supportive to pricing, but it's not necessarily built into our -- in how we look at fiscal '13's operating income. Just like cost access, we don't really look at that as anything other than it affects the slope of the change, so...","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Any impact from plant closures anticipated over the next year?","James V. Lochner","No, other than we continue to see and we continue to operate our plants at fewer hours. So we're just focused on really what our immediate supply base is, and we try to make sure that we plan our work according to what that forward supply looks like it's going to be out in the 4- to 8-week zone.","Operator","Our next question from Diane Geissler, CLSA.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about the open-market purchases of product and what you think that provided in terms of earnings this year. And then to the extent that you're looking at next year being total industry production flat to down slightly, what you think the availability will be next year on the open market. And then also, kind of part 2 of that question, is you cited in your release that there were incremental grow-out operating costs of $50 million for the full year. I just wanted to know what those were. And also, what's the outlook on -- are you just going to see those reverse? Or is that higher labor or higher energy? Or what really that encompassed?","Donnie Smith","Okay. I think I got it. So first of all, on the outside purchases, we were running around 60 loads a week or so, give or take 5, something like that. It's hard to say what the true dollar value of that is other than this: we don't have excess to sell, which always sells a whole -- well, frankly, it sells at what we buy this outside meat for, and I'd a lot rather be buying it because we're buying below cost and selling it. And then number two is you get incremental price courage because you've already adjusted your cost -- plant cost footprint to a couple of complexes of breast meat below where you are, and by the way, we have a good cost structure even though we run it at below -- well below plated capacity. So that's how we look at the outside purchases. As far as going forward, I see no reason to believe that the meat won't be out there. And again, it's a buy-versus-grow strategy. If meat starts drying up and we need more, we can adjust. But I see no reason to believe that the amount of meat that we'll be looking for on the outside market won't still be there. As to the other costs in our grow-out cost, it's primarily 2 things: grower cost, which went up; and our chick cost, which went up. Now I'll hasten on to say there were fairly good improvements in a lot of the other costs like feed conversion and our -- some of the other aspects of our live production. Our live production team in poultry has done a fabulous job, but those 2 cost factors did go up. So I hope that helps.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, terrific. And then I wanted to ask one question on the balance sheet. To the extent that -- I think you're fairly well termed out in kind of where you want to be, so I know you've got incremental working capital needs this year, but to the extent that you're sort of done with the debt paydown, what is your priority in terms of cash usage? Is it -- I know you increased your dividend and you have a special dividend and you bought in shares, but can you just prioritize?","Dennis Leatherby","Sure. It's Dennis. As always, it's growth focused, so that's going to be for CapEx around our existing businesses. And then it's going to be acquisitions, potentially around value-added and international. And then it would be around returning cash to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividends.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what's left on your share authorization?","Dennis Leatherby","Over 30 million shares.","Operator","Our next question from Robert Moskow, Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the definition of value-added. As you extend more and more into it or grow value-added more, I think that there is a risk that you get distracted from your core mission of being a low-cost or a very efficient commodity processor. Can you give us a bit more clarity on how much of that value-added is what I would describe as like consumer packaged goods-type of product? You mentioned lunchmeat and hotdogs and even frozen handheld items. Can you give us a sense of like, what are the sales of those types of items that are maybe -- that maybe require a different skill set, like a consumer marketing skill set versus the rest of value add that might be more of a -- more commoditized?","Donnie Smith","Sure. In poultry, you need to be thinking of further processed; value-added; cooked, whether it's breaded or not; or fire fried, whether it's breaded or not, type items. In the other Prepared Foods segment, certainly, our lunchmeat offerings, pizza toppings, soup, sausage and side dishes, items that either have -- contain bread or are in a tortilla. For example, we're the nation's second-largest tortilla manufacturer. So those type of items. Sandwich meats -- movement in all of those type areas and be thinking, too, of meat as an ingredient, not necessarily just a meat item. So it's really a lot more around a packaged food-type offering. And let me hasten on to say we have added complement in our marketing ranks, in our poultry and Prepared Foods businesses, and we've got a great talented group that understands the value they need to add and how they need to position it in the marketplace under multiple brands. We do have the Tyson brand, Jim mentioned the Wright brand in his script, and we have several other brands that we use in our value-added offering. So, Jim, you want to add anything to that?","James V. Lochner","Yes. The only thing I'd add is we're very attentive to not losing focus on the basics, and we really preach very hard about the 40-60 rule. You got to be looking forward, but you can't spend all your time looking forward and not take care of your basics. But on the contrary, you can't spend all your time in your basics and not look forward. So we call it the management balance rule, which is the 40-60 rule, because I think your point is well taken, and we certainly have read enough history and know our own history that you can never lose sight of that basic balance. And so we will keep our focus on the basics. Don't -- you can be assured of that.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Donnie, can you help me understand, like with Hormel and Oscar and Hillshire all kind of slugging it out in sandwich meats and hotdogs, what's the role of the Tyson brand for the retailer? Like what gap is that filling in the merchandising set?","Donnie Smith","Yes. We typically, in the Tyson brand, have a mid-tier offering. By the way, 5, 6 lines of chicken lunchmeat, which are doing very well where they're offered today, and then we complement that of course with other traditional lunchmeat items. So a mid-tier offering typically on the Tyson brand. And we're also a large private label lunchmeat supplier. So as you hear a bit about the share battle between the brands and private label, we pack a lot of private label lunchmeat.","James V. Lochner","The only thing I'd add to that is the raw material inflation we've seen over time has been our opportunity to diversify that portfolio with chicken as a base material and to add more value to our raw materials.","Operator","Our final question from Tim Tiberio, Miller Tabak.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","If I could go back to the comments around acquisitions, are you currently seeing more attractive opportunities in the international versus domestic markets? And then my second question, going back to your comments on the value-added growth in the international markets, do you think that you will need to make more acquisitions, especially on the distribution side, to really make a real dent in those markets over the next few years?","Donnie Smith","Tim, those are great questions. But I tell you, I'm a little uncomfortable talking very much about the opportunities. We -- I can tell you this. We do have a bit of activity in both international and domestic markets. But as far as getting very specific about those, I just don't feel comfortable commenting about that.","I want to thank everyone for joining us today, and I hope everybody has a very happy Thanksgiving.

I'd like to thank everyone who joined our recent Investor Day. We appreciate the opportunity to share our growth strategy, take your questions, and receive feedback. In case you missed it a replay is available on our Investor Relations page. ","Our strategy remains focused on growing Prepared Foods, International and value-added chicken while reducing the volatility of earnings across our business and we're making progress. Let me give you some examples from our third quarter. We continued to expand our global business with newly acquired operations in Asia and Europe. We've launched two alternative protein products into the marketplace and we continue to grow our case ready beef and pork business with plans for new plants in Utah. ","Now let's talk about our third quarter performance. Our Prepared Foods and beef Segments generated strong results. Chicken results were mixed but are improving and the Pork segment was under pressure due to market conditions related to African Swine Fever. Overall we remain on track for a strong year and expect earnings per share in the range of $5.75 to $6.10. Innovation and marketing support are driving velocity and share growth at retail. Total Tyson and the core business lines have posted four straight quarters of growth. In fact this growth is the highest in two years. When you look at the last 52 weeks our core has outperformed the food and beverage category by more than 12 times and Total Tyson retail has outperformed the key -- the category by more than five times. ","In the most recent quarter our sales volume trends have been even more robust with core business lines up 6% and Total Tyson retail up 3%. In broad line foodservice Tyson's Focus 6 is up 3% in volume compared to a year ago. That's two times the growth of the total broadline distribution channel. Broadline accounts for nearly half of Tyson's foodservice volume and the Focus 6 is more than 20% of our total foodservice sales volume. ","Turning to our segments, Prepared Foods remains on track for a record year. Through the first nine months it's produced a record operating margin of 12%. Retail volume growth has been outstanding as we gained incremental distribution from innovations such as Jimmy Dean's simple scrambles breakfast bowls and eggwiches. We're excited that our alternative protein products are hitting the market. We introduced Adele's Whole Blends as our first offering earlier this year. Last month we started shipping Raised & Rooted nuggets made with plants. We're pleased to report the nuggets will be in 4000 retail stores and available in broad line food service distribution by the end of September. This kind of quick start demonstrates the capabilities of scale and national reach of Tyson Foods. ","We're engaged with customers across channels and expect additional nationwide rollouts in retail and food service over the next 12 months. This will involve both plant and blended protein options under the Raised & Rooted brand and our flagship brands. We're in early discussions with partners to introduce these products outside the U.S. but for now our primary focus is a powerful domestic launch. As we build Prepared Foods innovation and enter new categories we expect this segment will continue performing well with an operating margin near 12% for fiscal 2019. And we expect similar results or better next year assuming current expectations for raw material cost. ","Our Beef segment grew sales and volume in the third quarter. Global beef demand was strong and our beef business is executing well. Pasture conditions are the best that we've seen in several years and cattle supplies are expected to be good through at least 2021. So far this year our beef segment has produced a record operating margin of 6.1%. We are pleased the European Union has agreed to new beef quota arrangements with the United States. It's an opportunity for Tyson's beef business to continue serving customers in Europe and potentially grow our business there. We also remain hopeful new trade deals will be reached soon with Japan and China and that Congress will approve the pending trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. For the fiscal year we expect beef segments operating margin to be approximately 7% with ample supplies of high quality cattle we expect similar or better results next year. ","Moving on to pork, African Swine Fever impacted the segment on the cost side. However, we did not see the benefit in pricing due to a 5% increase in domestic availability and low cutout values. We see this beginning to change as USDA weekly export data indicated that shipments of U.S. pork to China began accelerating in mid July and we're optimistic this will lead to a positive impact on our pork business. We are staying focused on execution and are benchmarking well versus USDA metrics. We've differentiated both our beef and pork businesses by valuing up, investing in premium programs. Our Chairman's Reserve and Open Prairie Natural programs are growing quickly and increasing revenue. This fiscal year volume is up 40% in Open Prairie Natural Pork, the Chairman's Reserve Prime Pork is up 84% compared to last year. In fiscal 2019 we expect the pork segments operating margin to exceed 6% and we expect similar or better results next year. ","In our Chicken segment we're not where we want to be. We're still working to improve our operational execution in our tray-packed business. In addition we experienced a slow start to the grilling season because of cool wet weather but we're expecting to finish the summer strong especially back to school season and Labor Day weekend. We're seeing increased levels of chicken promotions at both retail and food service. We expect chicken demand in future to remain strong or accelerate into next year. This includes demand for boneless dark meat. For fiscal 2019 the operating margin for the chicken segment should be around 6% and we expect improved results for fiscal 2020. Over the next five years it's estimated that nearly 98% of protein consumption growth will occur outside the United States and about 70% of that growth will be in Asia. As global protein consumption continues to grow Tyson's business will grow with it. ","We're driving profitable growth in key markets with strategic customers through locally relevant products. We've completed the acquisition of Thai and European poultry assets in the third quarter. We're creating a new international business model that focuses on consumer demand. We're pleased with the initial results and have identified significant synergy potential in these businesses. For example we've been contacted by major customers in new geographies to discuss strategic relationships. These are customers we know well in other parts of our business and we're excited about expanding these relationships. We expect better results in fiscal 2020 from substantial improvements in our legacy international operations as well as the impact of a full year of ownership in Keystone's international business as well as our new Thai and European operations. That concludes my comments on segments and channels. Now I'll ask Stewart to take us through the financials.","Stewart Glendinning","Thanks Noel and good morning everyone. The third quarter results were in line with our expectations with earnings of $1.47 per share. Our operating margin was 7.3% on operating income of 796 million. Revenues were $10.9 billion up 834 million compared to Q3 last year on an 11.8% volume increase. Average sales price declined 3.5% due to product mix changes resulting from acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the acquisition of American Proteins. We're very pleased with our acquisitions and we are even more optimistic about the potential for growth and the pace of synergy capture. Across our last four acquisitions to Tecumseh, American Proteins, Keystone, and most recently the poultry operations in Europe and Thailand, we spent a little under $4 billion and we're on time and on budget integrating these businesses. ","We're already covering our cost to capital on an off to tax basis in 2019 and as we deliver the full benefit of our synergies we will drive impressive returns on these acquisitions while expanding our scale and enabling additional long-term growth. To facilitate our organic and acquisition growth we require more robust analytic capabilities and standardized processes across a common platform. In the third quarter we implemented a new information technology system to meet these needs. And while we did experience some disruptions the vast majority of the transactions went according to plan. Our people have been working diligently to resolve the delayed order and billing transactions and we expect to be back to business as usual shortly. We haven't defined a dollar impact but it has increased our working capital days. ","During the third quarter we repurchased 1 million shares for $79 million. Year-to-date we've bought back a total of 3.4 million shares for $225 million as part of our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 20.4% in the third quarter and 20.8% year-to-date including cash of $406 million, net debt was 12.2 billion. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.9 times for the 12 months ending June 29. Net interest expense was $119 million in Q3. Capital expenditures were $315 million in the quarter and $971 million year-to-date as we focus on growth and efficiency projects with expected returns greater than the cost of capital. ","Depreciation and amortization was $286 million in the third quarter and $809 million year-to-date. Weighted average outstanding shares in Q3 were approximately 367 million. Our operating cash flows year-to-date are over 1.5 billion and liquidity at the end of Q3 was also 1.5 billion. In Q4 we will focus our capital allocation on debt reduction as we have $1 billion coming due and we expect to address with cash flows and existing or new short-term liquidity. As we near the end of fiscal 2019 I'll provide a final outlook for the year and some initial thoughts on next year. These figures include Keystone and the recently acquired operations in Europe and Thailand. Note that also 2020 will be a 53 week year, we've adjusted our outlook to be comparable to 52 weeks. ","Sales are expected to be approximately $43 billion in fiscal 2019 and grow 6% to 7% to around $45 billion to $46 billion dollars in fiscal 2020. Net interest expense should approximate $450 million both this year and next. We're projecting capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion this year with a similar amount in fiscal 2020. We expect liquidity to remain above our $1 billion target. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21% this year and 23% to 24% in 2020. We're maintaining our earnings guidance for fiscal 2019 at $5.75 to $6.10 cents per share. We'll provide earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2020 on our fourth quarter call in November but next year we expect all segment results to be similar or better than this year while producing top line and bottom line growth. That concludes my remarks and now we'll return to Noel for additional commentary. Noel.","Noel White","Thank you, Stewart. As African Swine Fever impacts the global protein landscape Tyson is well positioned to meet consumer needs with our diversified portfolio. At this time it remains difficult to know the size of those opportunities or when they'll happen. We estimate increased exports of pork to China may happen late in the calendar year. There could be volatility in the early stages as global exports begin to backfill protein needs in the countries affected by ASF. Tariffs and trade restrictions add another layer of uncertainty while rumors of tariffs being lifted have created volatility. Tyson Foods continues to support efforts for new trade deals to bring stability to export markets. If the tariffs are removed, the U.S. pork industry will likely benefit directly. If they are not we will benefit from backfill and real allocation opportunities. ","Regardless of the market dynamics we are prepared to capitalize on all opportunities through great execution, cost control, and most importantly by meeting our customer's needs and expectations. We're excited about the direction of our company. We're leveraging our $7 billion international business, we are matching priority supply markets with priority demand markets across more and more proteins to deliver what we believe will be a very effective model to reach key markets and customers. Domestically our core retail and food service product lines continue to experience growth. Tyson is aligned with customers and channels that are growing. We also continue to innovate creating new products including some outsider traditional meat offerings and more are in the pipeline. That concludes our remarks and we're ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And today's first question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Theurer","Yes, good morning Noel and Stewart. Thank you very much for taking my question. I have -- my question is around your assumptions for next year and in my view relatively cautious 2020 outlook considering all the potential benefits from African Swine Fever, could you lay out a little bit what you think the direct benefit to pork could be in your segment reporting considering that maybe trade restrictions might be lifted and how does this compare to the indirect opportunity from markets tightening in general and the backfill, so just to understand a little bit the drivers, pork specific and then obviously like the second, third derivatives on your other businesses in the U.S. as it comes to ASF that would be my question? Thank you.","Noel White","Yeah, sure Ben. I think that it's not only going to be pork that's benefited. I think that all of the proteins will benefit. In total they are somewhere around 5% of global protein that's disappeared. So whether it's a direct benefit or indirect benefit regardless it'll be beneficiary to us. So I think that both pork, beef, chicken all three primary proteins could benefit from that. The degree Ben it really depends on the timing of when these shipments might begin, whether it's from the United States or from other countries in a much more significant way. So I mean the guidance that we've provided is that we think that the earnings that we've generated so far and in 2019 there's upward potential and in some cases I believe a sizable upward potential and in some of our segments. ","The other thing that I'd like to point out is that if we assume that ASF, if we completely discount ASF, the 6 to 7 top line growth that we are projecting for next year which will take us from the $43 billion to the $46 billion to $47 billion with current return on sales that generates an incremental $200 million. Additionally I talked about the fact that we are not happy with where our Poultry Group is at and we think that they're somewhere around 200 basis points yet to improve. So there is another $200 million. So some of that we will give up by a higher tax rate but we still are in position to gain significantly. ","Benjamin Theurer","Alright, very clear and then just as a follow-up and you have it nicely actually laid out in your supplementary information, with all the opportunities now to not only source from the U.S. to basically ship but you also having now access to South America, Australia, Europe to the different markets, any way you could quantify or try or at least have some qualitative commentary on what you think that could give you as an advantage compared to where you've been prior to the acquisitions, just considering the global spectrum of animal based protein?","Noel White","Right, well Ben it really provides a platform for us. We have a reasonable supply base and we also have operations now in the primary demand markets that we've identified. So both from a supply standpoint, demand standpoint we feel good about where we're at right now but that's not to say that we're done and we'll continue to look at other opportunities that present themselves. So over the course of time we'll continue to build out that space just as we intend to do in our Prepared Foods and value-added food space. So continued growth but not in one specific market. ","Benjamin Theurer","Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. I'll leave it here and congrats.","Noel White","Thank you Ben. ","Operator","And our next question today comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","Alexia Howard","Good morning everyone. So there's obviously a lot of anticipation of the ASF impact as we get into fiscal 2020. Are there things that you can be doing to ramp up your chicken business in terms of the amount of processing capacity, the breeding cycle, if meat prices are going up next year that's the one area that could actually be accelerated potentially. Are there preparations that you're doing in that part of the business to take advantage of the situation?","Noel White","We do not plan on incremental production coming online. However we have as -- acquire some assets from Keystone just recently. So that will obviously expand our numbers and our volume as we report them. But as far as actually increasing chicken production itself, right now actually we're more focused on getting our business to run as we would expect it to which is it's not where we want right now and it's fairly isolated. It's within a handful of plants that are not performing at the levels that they need to. So we need to get our business running as we would expect before we would think about growing and expanding our current volumes.","Alexia Howard","Right. A super quick follow up, are there leading indicators we should be looking at to assess when the U.S. pork packers are going to start benefiting from ASF?","Noel White","Yeah, I would say nobody knows. My expectation is it does look like there is -- at least has been some sizable freeze inventories in China that they will work through the inventories that are on hand and it appears like that could be someplace in fourth quarter of the calendar year. So you would expect shipments from production to start sometime later this year whether that's October, November, December nobody knows, but that's my expectations.","Alexia if I go back to your chicken question I was talking in terms of just raw chicken being produced. However we have added capacities, capabilities on the further processing side. So we do have lines that we've increased some capacities, we have a new plant that we opened a little over a year ago, a new processing plant in Green Forest, Arkansas. So it's not as though we don't have production capacities, we have capacities to take the chicken that we either produce or buy and add more value to it.","Alexia Howard","Great, thank you very much. I'll pass it on. ","Operator","And our next question today comes from Ken Goldman of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. ","Kenneth Goldman","Hi, good morning. Thank you. Noel and Stewart I wanted to ask you still have a relatively wide range of EPS expectations for this year, there's only one quarter left. Can you walk us through when you think what the key factors are that would drive that EPS in the fourth quarter towards the higher or maybe towards the lower end of the range, what are those that come to mind?","Stewart Glendinning","Yeah, look I -- thanks for that Ken. Clearly there are probably two things there that will influence the quarter. Number one will be meat prices, that always has a large impact on our results. The other will be the movement in grain prices and as you've seen in the last few weeks a lot of movement in corn. We came in through the fourth quarter -- through the third quarter with a pretty big mark to market in chicken that was about 40 million bucks. And as you can see in the last couple weeks a lot of that has reversed. So those are the two big items that I would point to. ","Kenneth Goldman","Okay, thank you. And then can I just ask a housekeeping question, I just want to make sure the 6% to 7% sales outlook for next year that does not include the extra week right, which would add some couple of percent?","Stewart Glendinning","Yeah, that's correct. It's 52 to 52.","Kenneth Goldman","Great, thank you very much. ","Noel White","Thank you Ken.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.","Ben Bienvenu","Yeah, thanks so much, good morning. So, I wanted to follow up on your comments on the chicken business. You talked about the 200 basis points of segment margin underperformance and you touched on that at the Investor Day. Sounds like the issue is isolated in a few different facilities but I'd just be curious to hear a little bit more about the critical path to unlocking that 200 basis points and then it also sounded like in your comments that a realistic expectation is for that to occur in 2020. But I just want to clarify our expectation on the timing of that recoup of 200 basis points?","Noel White","Yeah. Ben you're right, that is about the number that we're expecting to come through and we do expect that to occur in 2020. We know specifically which plants are opportunities for us. We know what the causes are and they are in the process of being addressed. You know we have some turnover numbers that are higher than what we expect which generates yields that are less than we expect, productivity and throughput is not where we expect it to be. So we know specifically where the opportunities are at, we know the root cause, and we have a team that is fully dedicated to get them corrected as quickly as possible.","Ben Bienvenu","Okay, great. And then switching to the Prepared Foods business, just given the volatility in prices that we've seen in pork and beef over the last several months can you just help us think about how you all think about managing a list price on that business, are you looking for sustained cost increases before you raise prices and has the volatility in prices changed your thought process on the timing of pricing increases you might take as you look to 2020?","Noel White","Sure, well if I go back to last spring Ben that's when a lot of the rumors and discussion about shipments to Asia have started to affect the futures markets. Hog futures escalated rapidly and with that some of the pork prices started to go up. Now as we got into May and June that subsided, so as we were having conversation with customers back in the March-April time period we were talking about price increases and said that this is an unprecedented event and we've been selective on where we have taken price increases and in other cases we've not. It's really dependent on the product and the product category but all of our customers are fully aware of what's in front of us with African Swine Fever and what the potential price impacts could be. So as we start to see prices escalate all the conversations that have already taken place and I think it's at that point in time where you see products move up because of the increased disappearance and you'll see the Prepared Foods price changes implemented.","Ben Bienvenu","Thanks very much. Good luck for the rest of the year. ","Noel White","Yup, thank you Ben. ","Operator","And our next questions today comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson","Yes, thanks, good morning everyone. So I guess I want to continue to remain in the Prepared Foods business and here I mean going back to some of the raw material volatility which maybe was less pronounced than you might have thought three months ago and caused you to bring back up the guidance for the full year a little bit. Maybe just as we think about margins here for the next quarter and then into next year, just a little more color on pricing kind of the underlying volume traction you're seeing by some of the different categories that you participate in and just visibility and I know there's been some challenges in some of the food legacy, food service businesses that you've kind of been overcoming, just how are those progressing as we think about the margin progression prospectively?","Noel White","Yeah, sure Adam. First of all we are pleased with our volume that we are significantly outpacing the industry and in our volume growth. We have over the course of the last 12 to 18 months invested in that business and we're seeing the dividends from those investments. So some of the product categories that that I mentioned in our prepared remarks those were just a few examples of where we're seeing the type of growth in the marketplace. So we expect that to continue, the growth in our Prepared Foods space. We continue to invest in the category both from a map standpoint as well as from an innovation standpoint. So we have a very robust pipeline of products that we'll be introducing in 2020. So we're very positive, very optimistic on the outlook for Prepared Foods. The ability to manage the raw material price increases, that's our business, that's what we get paid to do. We know that it is likely to occur at some point in time. We've done a lot of preparation and with the expectation that the prices will at some point in time start to go up. So we feel good about our position in the marketplace, our volumes is strong and we believe that we can generate the 12% plus margins that you were expecting for this year.","Adam Samuelson","Great, and then just on the follow-up on the forward outlook and on chicken specifically, the kind of improved results you expect next year especially relative to the 200 basis points of margin kind of opportunity that you see, kind of from internal initiatives, what -- as you thought about chicken margins in excess of 6% is that just assuming kind of the corn strip kind of where it is today and\/or how much of the margin improvement especially on the tray packed side do you think you can capture in 2020 versus 2021 or 2022?","Noel White","Yeah, the most recent, I mean grain prices are expected to be higher as we go into 2020 Adam so we are expecting some price increases at the tune of a couple of $100 million at this point in time. Obviously it changes on a day to day basis but that's basically where it's at right now. So the numbers that I talked about the under-performance, the 2200 basis points or 2% return on sales it's very achievable despite the fact that grain prices are expected to go up.","Adam Samuelson","Okay, that's very helpful, I will pass it on, thanks. ","Noel White","Okay, thanks Adam. ","Operator","And our next question today comes from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ","Robert Moskow","Thank you. I know I was a bit surprised about the guidance for the Prepared Foods division margin to be as high as it was and raised and then into fiscal 2020 as well. You say it assumes current expectations for raw material costs, what are those expectations, are you expecting a lot of inflation or not? ","Noel White","In most categories I'd say yes Rob, we are expecting inflation on the raw material cost whether it's beef, raw material inputs or whether it's pork and\/or poultry for that matter. So we are expecting raw material costs to go up for next year and we do expect to capture that back through pricing. As always there are some laggards involved but as I mentioned earlier those conversations have taken place and I think that there's a keen awareness throughout the industry of what the industry is likely to be faced in the next six months or so.","Robert Moskow","I got you, so unlike in prior years the customers are fully aware of what's coming so it should be easier to get the pricing through and the lag might be shorter than it has in the past? ","Noel White","I think that would be fair, yes. Those conversations have taken place, it looked like prices were going to go up across the board, late spring, early summer. To a large extent that didn't happen, we've backed away from those. Not entirely but for the most part. But those conversations have taken place and the fact that once we do see raw material costs start to go up then price is going to have to change. ","Stewart Glendinning","And maybe Rob one other thing just to keep in mind and that is that on the -- in the Food Service business there is a large chunk of business that is where pricing is tied to the cost of the materials. So that benefits our customers when prices go down and of course it costs them more when prices go up. That's automatic right. ","Robert Moskow","Okay, in the retail data for the quarter I noticed that your market shares went up in a lot of prepared food segments like bacon and sliced meats and it looked like your competition raised prices faster than you did in some of these segments, is that a fair way to characterize the quarter?","Noel White","No, I don't think that's the reason that we captured incremental volume Rob. It might have played a part but for the most part we've been executing very well in the Prepared Food space. I talked about the innovation, the product launches, the support that we provided at retail levels. So no, I don't think it was primarily attributable to price at all.","Robert Moskow","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research LLC. Please go ahead. ","Heather Jones","Good morning. I have a couple of questions, first was on poultry business. So you said that there's about 200 bps of margin improvements that left to get related to Tyson operations. And when I look at where your margins are relative to say 2015-2016 the delta is bigger so I'm just wondering would you attribute the remainder of that delta to industry specific issues like market dynamics and then the 200 bps is the Tyson specific issue? ","Noel White","Yes, yeah Heather I think you're exactly right. I think that the margin structure if we go back several years ago I think that as an industry we were all enjoying some higher margins than what we currently have. And then our performance relative to that is not where we expect to be. So yes, I think first of all I think the margin structure is somewhat lower than what it was, but secondly there is money on the table for us to capture.","Heather Jones","Okay, thank you. And then I want to go back to ASF, so your commentary regarding the likelihood of it benefiting U.S. exports sounded fairly confident. I'm sure you've seen the headlines out today about the escalation of U.S. China tensions and so I was just wondering if you could flush out what about the supply disruption gives you comfort that the U.S. is going to benefit either way whether that China comes to us directly or you mentioned backfilling, just like I said you sounded confident and I was wondering if you could flesh out your thinking on that, why you have such confidence? ","Noel White","Sure, because through the course of time Heather and whether it's with the current dispute with China or other historic disputes that we've had with different countries the product ends up finding its way to other markets and whether it's to China or whether it's to markets that -- whether it's South America or Australia or others that they've been servicing, the supply is somewhat fixed outside of where ASF has occurred. So it's not fit, all of a sudden there's going to be a rapid escalation in production globally that those production numbers are primarily fixed, demand is growing over the course of time which means that it may not ship directly to China but it will ship to other market that that somebody has been buying from another country in the past. But the reason I'm optimistic is because over the course of time it has always worked out that way. And there's always going to be noise in the market about trade disputes and non-tariff trade barriers and over the course of time it all sorts itself out.","Heather Jones","Thank you for that, very helpful. ","Noel White","Great, thank you Heather. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Piken","Yeah, good morning. Just wanted to ask a little bit about how you're thinking about your pork business and specifically are you guys shifting any more of your pork production to a product that doesn't contain ractopamine so that you're able to export to China if that opens up? ","Noel White","Sure Michael, yes, we have we have the capability to do that that we have supply lines currently that does and can produce ractopamine-free products and we produce a lot more. It's a matter of demand in the marketplace so we have the option of flipping fairly quickly to ractopamine-free. So that is not a primary concern of ours now.","Michael Piken","Okay, great and then as a follow up I guess just in Prepared Foods, I know you guys for fiscal 2020 said that there is a potential for margins to go even higher than the 12%, what gets you there, is it a combination of like mix, new products, like maybe if you can just walk us through what type of margin upside and not only going into 2020 but just looking out several years what is the opportunity there? ","Noel White","Sure, a lot of it is in mix Michael. But keep in mind that 12%, that's a composite number of all of our Prepared Foods number. So within that there's multiple businesses that generate many different types of margin structures. So it's in fact taking those businesses that have a lower margin structure and getting them to improve based on where they've been. So it might be through volumes, it might be distribution, it might be through new product introduction. There's a multitude of ways for us to do that and secondly to take our higher margin product categories and expand and grow those businesses which is what we fully intend to do. So it would be both, it would be the innovation, new product categories that come in as well as upgrading some of the mix of some of our lower margin structure businesses.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Jeremy Scott of Mizuho. Please go ahead. ","Jeremy Scott","Thank you. Just following along on the Prepared Foods question I think this wasn\u2019t explicitly said at the Investor Day but it was implied by the cautiousness on the Prepared Foods margin outlook at the time that because that would be so beneficial to your chicken and fresh meat segments that it may present an opportunity for you to take market share in some of the key Prepared Foods categories. In other words you're able to leverage the balance and the vertical integration of your model to win business from others that were less balanced and less integrated by not taking price at the same magnitude or working with your customers at a vulnerable time. So what does your Prepared Foods margin guidance on 2020 imply about your competitive strategy if it's changed and how do you think about the balance of profit between segments particularly in volatile times like these, I asked that because just looking at your 2020 guidance I don't think I remember a time in the past decade where all segments moved in unison? ","Noel White","No, you're right it doesn't happen very often but that is in fact the value of the diversified portfolio of products and categories that we have and I think that's one of the primary factors that's misunderstood is it's not very often where all beef, pork, poultry and Prepared all deliver at the same time but it does help stabilize earnings throughout the course of time. And I think that it's that value that we provide in the marketplace with that diversified portfolio, a lot of investors are missing. So as we look at our Prepared Foods space I mean it's not that we're going to make a decision to advantage one business or another because our Prepared Foods business has been growing with product that's been transferred internally at market. So it's not the fact that we're giving an advantage to one business or to another, it's because they're earning in the marketplace and they're doing it through diligent work of how we innovate, how we go to market, how we service our customers, and that's the expectation for 2020 is that we're not going to gain share specifically through some mechanism of pricing that's going to disadvantage one and then vantage another. We are going to earn it with our innovation, our marketing, and how we service our customers.","Jeremy Scott","Got it and then on the chicken side some of your larger customers appear to be exploring and expanding upgraded chicken sandwich line up and let's just say that's true, can you talk a little bit about the potential implications here and if you need to make any production adjustments and then can you update on the Tecumseh plant, where are you on the opening timeline there?","Noel White","Yeah, first of all the first part of the question is really on the food service side, about chicken sandwiches and I do think that chicken is attractively priced right now and there does seem to be a fair amount of interest in featuring more chicken products as opposed to a year ago where we saw much more beef in the marketplace and what we do right now. So I do think that that's a realistic expectation with chicken breast meat prices in particular as low as they are it is attractive to feature. The second part of the question was I think you mentioned Tecumseh, I don't know -- ","Jeremy Scott","Gentleman the humble plan?","Noel White","Yes, so construction remains on schedule and I would say on budget as well equally as important. So, no, no surprises, no delays, nothing sooner than what we originally projected so on schedule with humble. ","Jeremy Scott","Got it, thank you. ","Operator","And our next question today comes from Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. ","Michael Lavery","Good morning. You touched on how there should be some benefit from what's likely shorter lags in passing on pricing with customers, can you talk a little bit about your thinking on the consumer side and what some of your assumptions are for elasticities. Obviously I know you said the timing and some of how it plays out especially all the way into the fiscal 2020 is unclear. But when you expect the pricing and some of those actions to take place, what's your expectations for the volume impact and how the trajectory that evolves over the course of the year? ","Noel White","Yes, certainly Michael. The elasticity, it really depends on the price levels that these products get to and that's the unknown and that's the difficulty in forecast what the impact might be into 2020 which is the reason it makes it so difficult to quantify EPS expectations for next year and it will continue to be a challenge even as we finish out this fiscal year and our fourth quarter earnings call. Just because it does make a significant difference on what type of price levels that these parts move to. Because at some price point consumers will look for different alternatives and it doesn't matter if it's beef, if it is pork, if it is poultry, or if it's Prepared Foods. They'll look for those alternatives in the marketplace. So there is an expectation that at some price point that there will be some demand destruction. However there is room in the marketplace for some price increase without seeing significant demand destruction.","Michael Lavery","So would it be fair to say that if you have already identified a margin expectation for Prepared Foods and it's based on your current inflation expectations that you don't expect yet for the inflation level to be beyond what the consumer could bear? ","Noel White","No, I think that's fair Michael. I think that with current expectations we're not expecting to see the demand destruction in the market those type of price levels.","Michael Lavery","Okay, and then just one quick one on Adelle, can you talk about where that's shelved or some of how you communicate to the consumer just what the product is and how to think about its value proposition, it's obviously got some elements that are unique and new. It's maybe a little bit to explain, how do you approach just connecting to the consumer with that proposition?","Noel White","Yeah, the go to market with Adelle was slightly different Michael and some of our other products but it is a product that we use a fair amount of demos in stores as opposed to advertising, promotion, social media but much more to sample in-store consumers have the opportunity to taste the product and understand how true -- how good it truly is. So, the go to market strategy a slightly different in Adelle and some of our other products.","Michael Lavery","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Eric Larson of Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead. ","Eric Larson","Yes, thank you everyone. Just a quick question on kind of capital allocation year to 2.9%, excuse me, 2.9 times leverage ratio and I guess the one piece of the 2020 guidance that caught me a little bit by surprise was that your interest expense is going to be flat year-over-year which was kind of flat rates maybe declining a little bit, who knows what happens with that. I would have thought that maybe some of your capital allocation would have gone toward debt reduction, if you had a lower interest expense number for next year can you just give us a quick walk through of how the capital allocation is looking for the next 12 months? ","Stewart Glendinning","Yes, so certainly the focus as you rightly point out is going to be on debt reduction. The answer to your question around why no change in the total interest is just because of the timing that we took on for the debt of Keystone. The mix of some of that debt, the relative interest rates I actually just looked at that on Friday and can confirm that we feel confident in our number. The only other thing I would say is that we are focused on debt reduction. let's also be well aware of the fact that we are pulling all of the other capital leaders at the same time. We have had a 38% CAGR on our dividend rate and that is paying out at a good level now. We have had a couple of successful years of higher than average CAPEX investment as we have invested behind new plants, new capabilities in our business and we've also as I pointed out on the call today have spent $4 billion in the last year buying businesses which on a cumulative basis now are performing in excess of their cost of capital on an after tax basis. So I would say our capital allocation strategy is broad and effective.","Eric Larson","Okay, and then just one final question and I think ASF has kind of have been beaten to death but we know that China is going everywhere around the world trying to find protein and a number or several of the U.S. protein companies have said that China has contacted them directly about muscle meat exports or imports to China which we don't really do. We never have -- with primary muscle meat products have gone directly to China, have you guys actually received inquiries from China and are you doing anything to prepare to ship to them? ","Noel White","Yeah, certainly, yes we have. I mean we have had relationships, we had office in China for a number of years so we are very familiar with the marketplace, we have regular interaction, daily interaction with a large number of the primary users within China. So we know the market and we have had discussions particularly over the course of the last three or four months that I can't get too specific on what and who but yes there is discussions taking place. ","Eric Larson","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. ","Kenneth Zaslow","Hey, good morning everyone. Just some questions, one is after all these years we've had this discussion about Prepared Foods and how the margins can go up and you guys have to always try to temper the expectations keeping in that 10 to 12 it seems like you're kind of letting it a little loose here with Prepared Foods going up, what change gives you the confidence to change almost the Prepared Foods margin structure, almost like moving up and then not that you moved it all the way up to 13% to 14% but you moved it definitely up from that like lower 10 to 12 to now at least 12 or around 12, what changed and are you not spending as much, do you not need to spend as much, do you feel like there's more synergies, what was the precipice for changing? ","Noel White","Sure Ken. Well first of all our spending has not gone down but we continue to invest in that business. And we're investing more in 2019 than we did in 2018. But really the confidence is just based on the growth that they have demonstrated and the fact that they have generated fairly strong returns and we could -- probably margin is up some more. However I would much rather have a business that's growing at 3%, 4%, or 5% with 12% margin than not growing at a 14% to 15% margin. But we still intend to grow the business and believe that we can do that with margins that are similar to where they're at today.","Kenneth Zaslow","Okay, then my next question is just for clarification, on the chicken business were you implying that if market conditions stayed exactly the same for 2019 to 2020 the operational improvements are just at literally 200 basis points year-over-year based on you guys just fixing things, is that the -- I just want to make sure that was a clarification? ","Noel White","Well, if you assume -- if you've excluded all the factors that we've talked about Ken so the mark to market we talked about and grain cost increases was a question earlier, we expect to capture that over the course of time. But it's purely just operational performance. Yes, is the answer that we would expect to capture approximately $200 million or 200 basis points.","Kenneth Zaslow","And then my last question is shorter term, so I know there's a mismatch in the pork side between capacity and hogs, can you talk about how that would change in August, September, October going forward and what is your lever on Saturday kills to just ensure that the margin so even if you don't get a benefit from African Swine fever is there a change in the pork packer margin structure going forward and what are your levers that you can pull on that?","Noel White","Yeah, I can answer -- its a rather complicated question because I do think that the capacities are going to be somewhat tested this fall. We are expecting a typical increase in numbers as we come into late September, October, November and that's on a six day basis. And I would tell you Ken that there's been somewhat of a change within the industry with the labor supply being as tight as it is most plants would prefer to only run five days rather than six days that when you run six days week after week after week there's a price that you pay in doing that from a team member standpoint, where people simply don't want to work six days on an ongoing basis. But even at six days if the industry did run six days I think that we're going to be somewhat stretched in what the capacities, current capacities are despite the fact that the capacities are greater today than they were a year ago.","Kenneth Zaslow","So your jobs will be enough to supply the pork so you would expect to see a reversal of the pork back in margin, just make sure I understood what you saying? ","Noel White","I think you know typically as we go into the fourth quarter calendar year, margins typically do expand and I do believe there's been some contraction in margin everything else being held equal because squatter capacity has gone up and hog production rates are not at the same rate. So if -- as we see hard production numbers continue to increase which we do over the cap course the next two to three years and numbers grow at a 2% to 3% rate year-over-year. That by the end of 2021 or so we will be back in closer equilibrium to what we saw two years ago with squatter capacity relative to our production numbers. But I do think there's been some contraction and over the course of the next couple years it will equilibrate back to where it was a couple of years ago.","Kenneth Zaslow","I really appreciate, thank you guys. ","Operator","And our next question today is a follow up from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ","Robert Moskow","Hi, thanks. Just a couple of clarifications, the mark-to-market benefit you had in third quarter in chicken from the corn does that roll over in for us like how should we think about your positioning commodities on that? And then one just general follow up like why not give kind of an EPS range for 2020 at this point, you've given us growth for each of the segments why not give it EPS range too? ","Stewart Glendinning","Okay, let me give you the answer to both of those questions. So first of all on the mark-to-market on corn the $40 million benefit in the fourth quarter for chicken yes, you should expect that to come back. It depends a little bit of course on the prices of where the futures market goes but I think you've seen in the last couple weeks some of the benefit we ended up with in the third quarter as a lot of its unwound. But either way you took the benefit in last quarter and you need to buy the corn in this quarter. So, you will see an impact, that's the answer to your first question. The second piece on the guidance for next year is we would prefer to get closer to the end of our year so we've got a better perspective on next year before giving you that guidance. It's consistent with what we did last year. There are a lot of factors that are moving around, Noel pointed to the fact that we're sitting on sort of a $150 million or $200 million of grain year-over-year, just where we are at the moment. So is that -- and if that moves around we'd rather be at the year-end give you a guidance. We've given you the percentages so that you can start to shape the year yourself. We've given you the top line, I think that will at least give you a head start.","Noel White","Robert let me add that our hedging policy has not changed from what it's always been. We in fact do hedge products, we do not speculate. So the numbers that you're hearing coming from us we mentioned it last quarter, you've heard it this quarter. The only reason we're talking about it because the numbers are meaningful and that it has impacted earnings. But otherwise it's the normal course of business for us and that's hedging products for our customer sales. I just wanted to make sure there's a clear understanding, there's nothing which has changed from past practices.","Robert Moskow","Got it, thank you.","Operator","And today's final question is also a follow-up from Heather Jones of Heather Jones Research LLC. Please go ahead. ","Heather Jones","Thanks for taking the follow-up. Going back to an earlier question about the kind of cost inflation we could anticipate in Prepared Foods, do you think we could see a move in those raw material prices to the levels we saw briefly for PED but yet on a sustained basis just trying to get a sense of what you're anticipating there?","Noel White","Well Heather, that's difficult to forecast because it's not only why China or Asia might be buying for materials but the type of products and then that has an impact on our specific products. So as an example historically there's not been a lot of Belize's an example shipped to China. Belize therefore in the United States obviously it would impact our bacon prices. On the other hand if they would take, if they would end up buying carcasses as an example then everything disappears. So, purely it would be speculation Heather for me to try and quantify what that might be by specific products.","Heather Jones","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you so much.

Please go ahead, sir.","Jon Kathol - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Good morning, and welcome to the Tyson Foods Incorporated second quarter earnings call for the 2017 fiscal year. On today's call are Tom Hayes, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dennis Leatherby, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Slides accompanying today's prepared remarks are available as a quarterly supplemental report on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.tyson.com.

This broadcast is the property of Tyson Foods and any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Tyson Foods is strictly prohibited.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom Hayes.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Thank you very much, Jon. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. We concluded a record first half in fiscal 2017, and we're off to a strong start in the second half. Because the seasonality of our business can distort our earnings from quarter-to-quarter, we get a better indication of performance trends if we look at the fiscal year in terms of front half and back half rather than four quarters.","Q1 was very strong, our best quarter in company history. We knew that Q2 would be a challenge and it was due to typical seasonality and a late Easter. There're also some unexpected challenges, which I'll explain as I dive into the segments. But both combined, Q1 and Q2, made for a record first half that saw 17% improvement year-over-year. This gives us confidence in reiterating our adjusted EPS guidance of between $4.90 and $5.05 for the current year.","Integration synergies for the second quarter were $173 million with $29 million incremental to Q2 of 2016. Total synergies through Q2 were $649 million and allowing us to increase compensation for team members in our plants, invest in innovation and build our brand, so lay the groundwork for a long future of growth.","So, now let's move to our operating results. In the Beef segment, operating income for the second quarter was $126 million with an operating margin of 3.6%. Sales volume was down 1.1% as we ran our plans for the margin, not for market share. As price was down 3.1%, reflecting the continued lower cut-out due to improved cattle availability. Consumer demand for beef, both domestically and internationally, has remained strong and we're seeing especially strong pull for our Open Prairie Natural and Chairman's Reserve premium Beef and Pork programs which are showing double-digit growth.","With continued robust exports, strong U.S. demand from consumers, increased cattle supplies, we're expecting Beef segment's operating margins to come in around 5% for fiscal 2017 and we believe the operating environment for 2018 will be just as strong. We intend to capitalize on the favorable market conditions and invest the considerable cash generated to fund the growth of our value-added Chicken and Prepared Foods businesses.","The Pork segment's operating income in the second quarter was $141 million with a 10.8% operating margin. Volume was down 1.3% while average price was up nearly 11% due to tighter domestic availability resulting from heavy export demand. With hog supplies increasing 3% to 4% and continued strong export demand, we think the Pork segment's operating margin for the full year will come in around 12% and looks to stay strong into fiscal 2018. Like Beef, Pork is performing well above its normalized range of 6% to 8%. These commodity businesses are great contributors because of the cash they generate, the raw materials they supply for our Prepared Foods businesses, and the total protein portfolio we're able to offer our customers.","So, now let's turn to our value-added businesses, beginning with Chicken. In the Chicken segment, Q2 operating income was $233 million with an 8.3% operating margin. Average price was up 4.3% on 2% lower volume due to operational disruptions as well as ongoing mix changes away from commodities towards higher-margin products. Value-added Chicken volume was up more than 4%.","While the Chicken segment fell below its normalized operating margin range of 9% to 11%, it would have been within the normalized range had it not been for the fires we experienced in two of our plants. These unforeseen events cost about $0.04 in EPS and reduced volumes. Operating margin for the Chicken segment was 9% in the first half of the year, and we expect it to be in the 9% to 11% range for the full year and similar to that again next year. Demand for chicken looks strong enough to absorb the 1% to 2% additional supply projected by the USDA. However, we'll continue to balance our supply with our demand.","In the Prepared Foods segment, adjusted operating income was $139 million in the second quarter, with a 7.9% adjusted operating margin. Operating income was adjusted by $52 million for an impairment related to our operation in San Diego. Average price was down less than 1%, while volume decreased 2.1%, mostly due to lower volume in the foodservice channel. Synergies for the Prepared Foods segment were $139 million for the second quarter, with $28 million incremental to Q2 of 2016.","Within Prepared Foods, we continued to see strong growth in some areas and others that need work. We'll accelerate profitable growth with a very-focused, fix-and-grow approach. We're investing and improving our foodservice Prepared Foods business, including pizza toppings and ingredient meats, and as I explained in our Q1 call, this will take about 18 months and we're progressing as planned.","Additionally, we're looking across the Prepared Foods portfolio to reduce costs by restructuring our manufacturing network as we reshape the portfolio through the acquisition of AdvancePierre, divest non-protein businesses, and focus on growth categories and growth channels. We're confident we'll drive long-term profitability. That said, we are still in the fix-it phase, and due to volume declines and increased costs in the foodservice Prepared Foods business, we're lowering our expectations for the year to 9% return on sales for the segment. We expect it to return to normalized range within fiscal 2018.","The challenges I've referred to are specific to the foodservice channel within Prepared Foods. The retail business continues to perform very well, growing both volume and share, while delivering strong financial performance. As we reap the benefits of the investments in our retail-branded business, improve the performance in the foodservice Prepared business and see the effects of focused M&A and divestiture of non-core assets, we should realize our long-term goal of improving margins, while outpacing industry growth.","As I mentioned, we continue to optimize our footprint to support our protein-packed strategy and shape our product portfolio. Two weeks ago, we announced the intention to sell the Sara Lee Frozen Bakery, Kettle and Van's non-protein businesses to acquire AdvancePierre Foods. With the acquisition, we expect to realize cost synergies of more than $200 million within three years, and it's important to understand that the synergies will come from the combination of the two businesses, regardless of whether it's Tyson or AdvancePierre. We see the acquisition increasing the scale of our Prepared Foods offerings with ready-to-eat sandwiches, sandwich components, entrees, and snacks. AdvancePierre brings strong branded presence in the foodservice channel, in addition to capabilities that will enhance our innovation pipeline in retail packaged brands and our ability to drive profitable growth at the store perimeter.","So now let's move on to what we're seeing in the sales channels. Overall, foodservice growth has been driven by check size, as traffic has been flat to declining for four consecutive quarters. QSR chicken, where we're very strong, continues to be a bright spot, with traffic growing in the mid-single digits. Within broad line distributors, our focus five businesses continued to grow in the second quarter, driven by value-added chicken, breakfast sausage, and dinner sausage.","At retail, total food and beverage sales volume was down 0.5%, while dollar sales were up only 0.4%. Tyson once again went against the trend, and we were the only top 10 CPG retail food manufacturer to grow both volume and dollar sales. According to IRI, for the 13 weeks ended April 16, we grew total Tyson volume 5.3%, and Tyson Core 9 posted 5% growth. In sales dollars, total Tyson and Core 9 were both up around 4%. We also grew share in seven of nine categories.","We continue our proven track record of innovation in retail and foodservice behind successful launches of Jimmy Dean Frittatas and Stuffed Hash Browns, Tyson FoodService Fully Cooked Drumsticks, and Buffalo Chicken Crispitos. We're on schedule to transition all of Tyson retail branded chicken production to No Antibiotics Ever in June, an innovation consumers and customers are demanding. And we'll be launching organic chicken under our NatureRaised Farms brand in July. Additionally, we've expanded our Tyson Tastemakers platform beyond e-commerce to include an introductory group of retailers in the Texas region.","So before I turn it over to Dennis, I'd like to say a few words about sustainability. First, Justin Whitmore joined our leadership team on May 1 as Tyson Foods' first Chief Sustainability Officer, and we're excited to have his leadership as sustainability comes to the forefront of the company. We recently unveiled our strategic intent to sustainably feed the world with the fastest-growing portfolio of protein-packed brands. As a part of our focus on sustainable food production at scale, we've committed to expanding our efforts to create a better workplace for our team members in our production facilities. We've always been committed to safety, sound workplace practices, and supporting our team members, but we want to do better.","We announced last month we're taking steps to expand training, improve workplace safety, improve compensation, and increase transparency. We've announced ambitious goals, and we'll be sharing the results of third-party social compliance audits of our plants. As we raise the world's expectations for how much good food can do, we are raising the bar for ourselves. By investing in sustainability, we'll create a beneficial cycle that pays for itself over time. To be successful, we must step up our focus on continuous improvement to reduce waste and costs. And with the addition of AdvancePierre, we'll be even more aggressive in utilizing Lean Six Sigma practices throughout the organization.","That wraps up my remarks for the quarter, and now Dennis will take us through the financials.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We delivered record EPS and operating income for the first half of fiscal 2017, as record results in our Beef and Pork segments are providing fuel for growth in our value-added Chicken and Prepared Foods segments. We remain on track for our fifth straight record year, as our diversified portfolio of protein-packed brands and ongoing investments in our businesses continue to provide strong, stable growth.","Revenues for the first half of fiscal 2017 were flat compared to prior year, and were slightly down in our second quarter to $9.1 billion, as lower beef prices were partially offset by higher pork and chicken prices. Adjusted operating income for the first half of fiscal 2017 was a record $1.6 billion, up 8% over a strong comparable period last year. Adjusted operating income for Q2 was $623 million, which includes $23 million of costs associated with two chicken plant fires and $14 million of incremental costs from standardizing our benefits and compensation structure. Total company adjusted return on sales was a record 8.8% for the first half of the year, with our Beef, Pork, and Chicken segments all within or above their normalized ranges.","Our record adjusted EPS of $2.60 for the first half of fiscal 2017 represents a 17% increase over $2.22 last year. Our operating cash flow through the first two quarters was just shy of $1 billion, and we spent $467 million on capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $153 million, as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC. During the first half of the year, we repurchased 10.2 million shares for $653 million, which includes 2.1 million shares for $133 million in Q2. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 34.5% on an adjusted basis. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.7 times. Including cash of $243 million, net debt was $6.2 billion, and total liquidity was approximately $1 billion. Net interest expense was $55 million during Q2. For the quarter, our diluted shares outstanding were 370 million. Pre-tax ROIC for the past 12 months was just under 19%.","Two weeks ago, we announced our agreement to acquire the tremendous business of AdvancePierre. We expect this acquisition will close this year in our fiscal third quarter, pursuant to completion of the necessary closing conditions. Our Prepared Foods segment will benefit significantly with its complementary portfolio of products and market-leading convenience food capabilities. The addition of AdvancePierre is expected to be immediately accretive to EPS and cash flow, and is expected to create approximately $200 million in cost synergies within the next three years. These synergies are expected to come from manufacturing, procurement and distribution efficiencies as well as addressing duplicative corporate overhead of the combined companies.","Upon closing, our last 12 months pro forma adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA is expected to be around 2.7 times. We are committed to investment-grade ratings. And with the strong cash flows we expect to generate organically, along with divestiture proceeds and the incremental cash flows from this acquisition, we anticipate to quickly delever to bring our net debt to adjusted EBITDA down to around 2 times by the end of fiscal 2018. In addition, as Tom pointed out, we announced our plan to sell three non-protein businesses currently included in our Prepared Foods segment, as we continued to sharpen our focus on our core businesses and expand our protein leadership in retail and foodservice. We expect to record a net gain as a result of the sale and use the proceeds to delever following the AdvancePierre acquisition.","Now here are some additional thoughts on fiscal 2017. Please note that because of the timing of the planned divestitures is fluid and could (17:10) fall into fiscal 2018, the following outlook does not reflect the impact of these divestitures. In addition, this outlook assumes the closing of AdvancePierre in our third quarter. We expect revenues of around $37 billion as we grow volume across each segment, offset by the impact of lower beef prices. Adjusted net interest expense should approximate $275 million as a result of the incremental borrowings in our third quarter to fund the AdvancePierre acquisition. We currently estimate our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 34.1%.","CapEx is expected to approximate $1 billion, as we focus on capacity expansion and operational improvements that create long-term shareholder value. Based on our average share price in Q2, we expect our average diluted shares to be around 370 million. During the first half of fiscal 2017, we produced record financial results while making significant investments in CapEx, network optimization, talent, safety and animal well-being that will lay the foundation for sustainable, long-term growth. Despite $23 million of incremental costs related to two chicken plant fires as well as an incremental $72 million investment in our team related to standardizing our benefits and compensation plans, our record results in the first half of fiscal 2017 gives us guidance to reaffirm our annual adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.90 to $5.05. This range is approximately 12% to 15% over a record fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS and represents a five-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 20%.","In closing, the back half of the year is expected to be strong, and we're excited about the growth opportunities we see in the AdvancePierre acquisition, as we remain focused on investing for the future to deliver shareholder value.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Denise, we're ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And your first question will come from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, guys. The Prepared Foods profit was lighter than we had expected. You cite the foodservice sales declines in that segment. Could you talk a little bit more about the nature of those declines and the outlook for potential improvement? And I have a follow-up.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Sure. Good morning, David.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes. The sales were certainly not what we expected for sure, as foodservice channel has been a little bit lighter than retail, particularly for us I would say. And so we do have some challenges also in predominantly the legacy Tyson Prepared Foods of foodservice business. In order to get our portfolio back to where it needs to be, profitable growth and the ROS we expect, we are doing a number of things: shifting channel mix and customers to a certain degree to capture growth; leaning out SG&A, doing some manufacturing work on costs. And we feel good about where we're headed, but we do still have some challenges, and certainty, in Q2, the volume didn't help the situation as we had some under-absorbed overhead at some of those plants.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And from the guidance or in that specific guidance, you say 9% margin, which I guess implies a similar margin for the second half. Is this going to be a multi-quarter turn in the business?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","It is. Like I said, the retail business continues to do very well. It's the foodservice prepared business, and we do see that's going to take some time to get that back to where it needs to be. I also said, in 2018, we believe it will be back within the range as Prepared Foods...","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Yeah.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","(21:24) set up.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And speaking of 2018, I know it's a little early, but what is your early thinking about the earnings outlook for that year?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. We think 2018, at least this is the way that I see it right now that we are going to continue to grow, certainly, where we want to grow, value-added versus commodity, both on Chicken and Prepared Foods. The Core 9, as you see, continues to do really well. The perimeter of the grocery store is doing fantastic. We benefit from that. And certainly, the products that we're focused on in foodservice, the focus five products, are doing very well in broadline distribution. So we just talked about prepared beef, looks to be good next year as it is this year just about as good. 5% is where we're saying we're going to wind up. Supply is looking very strong.","Pork, I'd say, we'll benefit from livestock supply, very strong export markets, and we'll deal with more slaughter capacity which we talked about in the past coming on in the industry. Still above the normalized range is where we see it. So Pork feels good. Chicken will benefit from the move to NAE. Just announced today moving towards organic in July, and we'll have a better mix. So Chicken will be within the ranges the way that we see it today.","And then just as we continue to drive the acquisition synergies, I feel great about where we're going to wind up longer term with Prepared Foods. So not necessarily coming in 2018, but that normalized range I think will become something for us to take a look at because the synergies, I think, are going to be exceptional, also revenue synergies beyond costs. So I hope that answers your question.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","The next question will be from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe digging in a little bit more into the Chicken performance in the quarter. The profit in the segment was down $114 million year on year. I think based on all those things that were disclosed in the 10-Q, you can isolate about $80 million of that between the plant fires, feed, compensation, you alluded to higher grow-out and outside meat purchases. But you also had a pretty nice benefit from price\/mix year-on-year. So I'm hoping if you could just talk about the Chicken business and maybe the part of that bridge that we're missing and maybe the impact of that as you think about the balance of the year.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. As you said, I think we had a really good quarter, but for the fires, which we don't look past. We are certainly focused on the root cause of those to make sure that that's not \u2013 so it's something (24:04) we can control it as part of our future. But Q2 ended up at 8.3%. The effect of the fires really put us in a situation where we felt like we had a great quarter running and that is not just the cost of the fires but also the volume that it cost us. That certainly impacted us.","The other thing we haven't talked about much is that there was AI events during the quarter, which we just came in and out of I think with a very strong approach. So for the balance of the year I think we feel great about it in the middle of the normalized range between 9% to 11%. We expect our value-added to continue to grow, and that's both frozen and fresh, taking advantage of low-cost raw material, add equipment capacity, the capacity we just added this last year is almost full and we're in the process of adding more, our mix is improving, focused on reducing the cost structure.","As I mentioned, the CII plan is continuing to drive continuous improvement, continuing to drive more and more focus on the right costs and getting waste out. And our Chicken business continues to improve or grow in the right areas. And I think we're going to see that continue to strengthen.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's some helpful color. And then maybe a longer term question. And, Tom, I want to go back to something you said on the AdvancePierre call a couple weeks ago that there's a new CEO, new management team, and a new strategy for Tyson and I appreciate some of the discussion at CAGNY and more recently about the sustainability efforts. But maybe talk about how investors could actually perceive that change in strategy as it impacts the financial results. And AdvancePierre, I think investors could have imagined Tyson doing that acquisition a year ago. So it's not clear that AdvancePierre is necessarily evidence of a new strategy, but maybe talk a little bit about what's really changed within the organization outside of the leadership team and how investors can look at that? Thanks.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Sure. Yes. I'll address that, Adam. We finished our strategic planning process as a company end of February, beginning of March time period. And part of that was to make sure that we had a razor-sharp execution of where we want to play in addition to where we don't want to play, and getting a better understanding of the role of our businesses in the portfolio, whether they're value-add or commodity. The discussion about AdvancePierre has been going on for some time, and as it relates to us being in a position after closing out our strategic focus, so it's clear to us that the perimeter of the store, convenience channel, being in proteins was something we wanted to continue to sharpen and play at a higher level.","So for us, that acquisition certainly plays in all those spaces. So for us, it's about growth, growth continually. We certainly know that packaged food has had its challenges. And as we look to continue to invest in areas that consumers want, this became absolutely crystal to us, this was going to be a fantastic acquisition for Tyson.","So the way to think about it, why now versus then, they've also \u2013 I mentioned this on the call when we talked about the AdvancePierre acquisition. Their team has done an amazing job of putting that company in a place where they have taken a lot of costs out. They've refocused on growth. They have continued to excel at practically everything that they're doing through a very disciplined approach. I'm really looking forward to having them join the team and help us in the areas that we don't have the prowess that they do. So for all the reasons that I mentioned, and hopefully the timing is explained there, I think this is going to be excellent for our shareholders.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for the question. Could you just help me clarify? I'm a little confused, and I think some investors are too, exactly what's included in guidance, and what's not, from AdvancePierre? I understand interest expense guidance includes it. It seemed from the press release like sales exclude it, but I wasn't 100% sure on what you were saying earlier about earnings. If you could just walk me through that, I would appreciate it.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Hi, Ken, this is Dennis. We are including AdvancePierre, but the way we think about it is more like one full quarter in our fourth quarter. We're not exactly sure in June when it closes. So it has a little bit of a impact there. But to be clear, it is in our forecast.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","For every line item, just to be sure?","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Okay.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","One thing I would call out, Ken, real quickly though, is, we will have merger and integration costs, and so we will separate those out.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No, sure, I understand that. Thanks, Dennis, for that. And then my follow-up is, I wanted to ask a little bit about going fully antibiotic-free in chicken, which I think long term is clearly the way the market's going. Some of your peers we've talked to, though, have talked about maybe some margin struggles initially when this happens, because your costs go up faster than your pricing can necessarily be taken. So first, I'm curious, is this something that you expect to happen in your business as well? And is that in guidance? And secondly, if not, I'm just curious, what would be different for you than maybe some of your smaller peers out there that have sort of expressed this concern?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Sure. Ken, of course I won't talk about our peers, but what I will say is that this is not a brand-new thing for us. We talked about how NAE has been something that we've been working on. And as we continue to improve operations, it puts us in a position where we were able to go the final step. The cost structure is anything that would be impacting the cost structure, certainly in our guidance. But I would say that Noel White and Doug Ramsey and the entire team has been pushing aggressively just to get us in a position where we can execute NAE and make sure the cost structure is as good, if not better.","Now so that is \u2013 what we've learned through the process is that it continues to make us better as we push ourselves. So I can't speak to peers necessarily in our industry, but I can tell you that for us, we feel great about our cost structure and great that we're going to be NAE across the retail brand in June.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks so much.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You are welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from Farha Aslam of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Good morning Farha.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Question about acquisitions. Could you just remind us exactly how much, in terms of synergies, you expect from the Hillshire transaction now and the $200 million from AdvancePierre? If we think back (31:11) generally, is there a target that you have of how much needs to be reinvested back into the business, and how much you anticipate letting fall to the bottom line?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. As it relates to Hillshire, I mean, I'll have (31:24) Dennis just talk about that real quickly, and then let me start by saying, the two are very different. We invested a lot, as you well know, in innovation, brand building, and setting ourselves up for continued growth on the Hillshire acquisition. So certainly, there was a lot of reinvestment. Don't anticipate the same for AdvancePierre. I think what we'll see is that revenue synergies will come with time, and we will be focused on getting the redundant costs out, and it's both teams.","I was with the AdvancePierre team couple weeks ago and we talked about it. This is a team event for all Tyson team members, when they become Tyson team members, for us to focus on costs because it's there. But I would say, as it relates to investing that back, that was more of a Hillshire phenomenon. Dennis?","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","As far as the synergies go on Hillshire, we initially started at $500 million, took it up to $700 million cumulatively. We backed it down to $675 million, simply because there is going to be some more carryover into 2018. So, again, think about $675 million on a cumulative basis and more than $700 million in 2018 and beyond.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. And then, could we go back to Chicken? You said very specifically that you expect margins to be in the normalized range into next year as well. Is there something with the plant fires that will continue? Is there a level of investment that we need to think about that will keep those margins in the normalized range, whereas before, given the low feed cost and very good pricing for commodity chicken, there was an opportunity for it to be ahead of your long-term normalized range?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah. So a couple of things, Farha. One is we're not giving specific guidance as it relates to 2018 yet. What we're doing is telling you how we're feeling about how it's setting up. As it relates to 2017, the second half of our year looks to be within that range. And based on everything that we see now, we have improved our mix, we're continuing to do all the things that we want to do. But as it relates to the plant fires, that's going to be something that will be behind us. It's not any continuing expense. The team has done an amazing job putting us back in the right footing. But as we see it today, improving our mix, focusing on reducing the cost structure, taking advantage of the low-cost raw material environment, talk about our food capacity, all those give us the full confidence that between 9% to 11% is where we'll wind up for 2017.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from Heather Jones of the Vertical Group. Please go ahead.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Good morning. Hi. I had a quick question on Beef. You all's outperformance jumped dramatically during the quarter, and just was wondering if you could give us a sense of the cause. Because if we look at beef prices during the quarter, they were up less than live cattle costs were, particularly in the Northern regions, which I know you'll tend to be more exposed to the Northern regions. So I was wondering us if you could help us understand how that drove that outperformance? And the second part of that question is your confidence with 5% margins for the year, given what we've seen in Beef margins over the last few weeks, given the rally in live cattle costs, just seems like maybe you'll are doing something different in that business. And just help us understand what's going on there?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Sure, Heather. Like we said when we were talking at the CAGNY and otherwise, Q2 is always a little bit choppy, and you never know what's going to come at you, certainly as it pertains to beef; that's true. I would say that are our team has done an incredible job. Steve Stouffer and the team in our first meats group continue to execute against the fundamentals. And without commenting against our competition, I feel good about what our team does. 2017 continues to look strong for us. As we are in the Midwest, there should be more cattle coming to market for us. We believe the margins for this year, as we said, it will be at an exceptional level.","Q1 was very strong. Q2 came back a little bit. But as it looks like Q3 and Q4, they have the potential to be very good. We certainly didn't have \u2013 it wasn't without some challenges, certainly, in Q2. It's been up and down from both a supply and demand standpoint. But what I'd say is, for us, just focusing on the fundamentals and making sure that we're driving the right thing that's what continues to set us apart from our view.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","And then on Pork, sort of a similar question. I noticed your volumes were down, and I mean, weights were down a little bit during the quarter, but it seems like more that your head had to have been down despite heads for the industry being up. So was wondering if this was a margin versus market share decision and if that's going to be your strategy going forward with the new slaughter capacity, if you're going to just choose margins over market share and possibly kill less just to be able to maintain that. Just if you could give us some color on that.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah. I'd say that is the case, Heather, but we'll manage our business the best that we can for Tyson. And certainly, seems to be large supply products (37:12) coming 3% to 4% more head or so. What's nice is the demand for U.S. pork continues to be extremely strong. None of us see any signs of that slowing down. And exports have been incredible. So that for us, as long as that continues, that's going to put us in a good position. So sustained demand, great hog supplies, we remain in balance in our thoughts for this year. We're feeling good. And like I said on my a prepared remarks, 2018 is looking to be very strong above the normalized range, not as good as probably as high as 2017, but above the normalized range. And so that's the way that we see it.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay. Thank you so much.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah, you're welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from Akshay Jagdale of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Lubi Kutua - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. This is actually Lubi. I am filling in for Akshay. I wanted to ask a question on your Chicken segment. So if I just look at Chicken segment margins over the last maybe 1 year, 1.5 years, it does seem like they've trended down somewhat, although that's been primarily related to looks like some execution issues maybe on this mix shift strategy towards value-added, which is obviously a key element of the future growth prospects for that business. So can you just talk maybe a little bit about what's driving? There seems to have been, I guess, a little bit more in terms of execution issues over the last couple quarters. And then does this have any impact potentially, in your view, on the long-term growth prospects for this segment? And then I have a follow-up.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes, so, Lubi, I would say that execution issue, the plant fires certainly are an execution issue, I guess, you could say, something that we don't certainly plan for. Tyson has been much less volatile, I would say, than the typical commodity player. Diversification of our product types, pricing models, reduced export closure really helps us stabilize margins.","So, as we said, ex the fire cost, $0.04 EPS would have been added back. I think that would have put us in a great spot right within our normalized range. So the continued strong execution against our business is going to give us long-term EBIT growth. Where we will see some differences is the lack of volatility, and certainly, as it pertains to our business, that's what we play for.","Lubi Kutua - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then the second question, also on Chicken. So at CAGNY, you spoke about some new products that you have planned in the Chicken segment. And you also mentioned in your prepared remarks today about ongoing mix changes in the Chicken business.","Could you just talk a little bit about the progress that you've made on some of these initiatives, maybe where we are in terms of timing and rollout and, just generally, how you're thinking about the potential contribution from these new items into fiscal 2017 and 2018? Thanks.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah, certainly. We continue to be very focused on conversion of dark meat into, what I call, first-run products, that's something that the team has made tremendous progress against. And so those are a number of different forums to speak to your question directly.","The 100% NAE on the Tyson retail brand will be up and running by next month. So we love that because it's making a lot of progress in a very consumer relevant area. It's a bit of (40:54) issue for, certainly, consumers, but we feel that, that is going to set us apart as the world's largest NAE producer of Chicken.","Also, we talked about Nature Raised Organic, so that comes in July, but that is also going to be \u2013 it's a growing space. It's much smaller for sure, but it's a growing space for us and we feel like that's going to be an important development for Tyson.","Just to wrap up with ground chicken, ground poultry, predominantly Turkey, is a $1 billion space. For us, we feel like we can play there and can play effectively. And so we're extremely excited about that launch as well, and that's all \u2013 all those things that we talked about at CAGNY are on track.","Lubi Kutua - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you. I'll pass it on.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. I just wanted to talk recently about some of the recent storms in Colorado and the impact that might have on cattle supplies and weights this year and how much of an impact you think that's having on packer margins over the last couple of weeks. And is there any sustainable impact from that?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Certainly. Certainly, Michael, there's been an impact. First off, I would say our hearts go out to those cattlemen for sure because, by some estimates, there were thousands of cattle lost in the storm, so we are very sensitive to that. And so we certainly want to make sure that we express that.","Our plants typically have enough breadth and scale to adjust, and it looks like there's going to be certainly, some of \u2013 there has been some effect, there is some effect. Anything that we see today is built into our outlook. So again, tragic loss for the producers there, but for us we feel like we are going to be in a fine position going forward, and hopefully, something like that doesn't happen again.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then switching over to Prepared Foods, just trying to understand by the time, I guess, fiscal 2018 rolls around, I mean, would you expect AdvancePierre Foods to be accretive to your Prepared Foods margin? You talked about getting back to a normalized range. Or is that something that you would expect initially, because of increased brand spending they might be a little below your normalized margin on a standalone basis and as you invest in the business that, over time, it would reach your normalized range? Thanks.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome. Two things, absolutely accretive. Second thing is it's going to put us in a position, as we look long-term, to look again at what our normalized range is for Prepared Foods, because that's going to be a tremendous margin business for us. But more so, just continue to come back to growth. We are acquiring a company that has been growing, is going to support our growth, not just in the convenience channel and in the retail store perimeter, but there are capabilities that we're going to leverage for our Tyson brand that we already have in the portfolio.","So as we continue to make the most out of this, it will not be reinvestment in the brands per se that AdvancePierre has all over going to support those (44:06). It's going to be really focusing on the capabilities this brings to excite consumers against where they're headed. This is the reason why we did it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Ken Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning, gentlemen.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Good morning.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Hey, Ken.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just a couple of questions. As you evaluate the AdvancePierre acquisition, can you talk about \u2013 you did say though that the $200 million of synergies is both combined as well as individual. Did I hear that right? And can you talk about the buckets to which the synergies will come from? That's my first question.","The second question is, so as you evaluate the Prepared Foods margins, what will go into the determination of where you think that will go? Because again, you started out with Hillshire as 9% to 11%, we're kind of now in that 9% region. Is there a potential where we could see 13%, 14%, 15% margins? How do you think about that?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Nothing's off the table in terms of margin upside. What I would say is, we're not going to sacrifice growth, we're going to continue to grow. So we want to make the right margins, we want to have affordable food, and we want it to continue to be growing, is what we're focused on, Ken.","So, as it relates to the question on the synergy buckets, you got it right. Absolutely, it's going to come from both sides. We feel like, as we get through the integration process, we're going to find that AdvancePierre is going to make Tyson, legacy Tyson, better. The whole company is going to benefit.","In terms of the specific areas, clearly, procurement, we see manufacturing, like I talked about, logistics for sure, so warehousing and transportation, clearly redundant overhead, with two publicly-traded companies. Too soon to disclose the exact size of that, but the synergies are coming from both businesses. And we are going to, on top of cost synergies, grow.","So we feel very comfortable with the overall target. It's going to put us into a position of great confidence to improve the margin structure over time. And again, just emphasize, not to sacrifice growth.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just Dennis, just one housekeeping question. What is the cost in 2017 that won't recur in 2018, aside from the fire? I just wanted to kind of aggregate them up, because you're including in your underlying performance, but I think there are some costs that may not be recurring, such as maybe...?","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","That's a great question. As a reminder, last quarter, we talked about vacation and holiday pay and those kinds of things, the true up both companies and the cumulative number was about $58 million, and about 80% of that was more or less a one-time event, so call it $50 million or so. And then you're right, the plant fires would be in there as well.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Brett Andress of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brett Andress - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Hey, Brett.","Brett Andress - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I just wanted to go back to Chicken because, relative to 90 days ago, really the segment guidance range, I think, has been stepped down somewhat, even when you exclude the costs. And at the same time, I think the outlook for the industry, we would argue, has improved pretty meaningfully. So I was hoping you could kind of square those two and maybe provide a little bit more color as to why we shouldn't see the improvement that maybe some would have expected in Chicken as we go through the balance of the year?","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","So I'll come back to just kind of, Brett, tagging on to the question that Ken asked is that our margin is going to be also indicative of where we are planning to grow. So we are not going to have a margin structure that does not allow us to continue to grow and provide our products at the right prices. So for the range, I think, 9% to 11% is the range we feel comfortable about with having a growth profile. So delivering within that for the year, feel very strong about. And I will say that we are very bullish about what Chicken looks like for 2017 and for 2018, frankly. So, continuing to improve our mix, we're off to a very strong start in Chicken for Q3. May is traditionally the start of the grilling season. Margins tend to follow that. Inventories are in a good position. We're operating in a range that really puts us in line with our targets and the ability to continue to drive growth at those margin rates. That's what I'd say.","Brett Andress - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will be a follow-up from Heather Jones of the Vertical Group. Please go ahead.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Thanks for taking the follow-up. I wanted to go back to guidance, and I know, in answer to someone's question, you've said that AdvancePierre is implied in all lines of guidance. So I was just curious, when the outlook language for Prepared for the full year, when you talk about it being margins approximating 9%, my gut is that comment excludes AdvancePierre, but I want to double-check on that?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","No, it includes AdvancePierre; if anything, we might be modestly conservative on that.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Can you help me understand is there some \u2013 what's the word I'm looking for, some seasonality to Advance (49:40), because I mean, their margin structure is robust. And I know you're only talking about them being in there for one quarter. But still, you would think that would bring up the total pretty substantially. So can you help me understand, is there some major seasonality that Q4 is not a big margin quarter for them or something?","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Certainly they have a very seasonal business as it relates to schools. And so some of that product will certainly flow through at the beginning of the school season, but then sort of into what would be our Q1. So we want to make sure that what we're doing is integrating this in the right way.","And to be clear, Heather, we're not giving guidance right now. What we're talking about is how we feel about the business, and we feel like those margins are going to be certainly strong. But we have to learn more. So we'll be prepared in Q3 to talk more specifically about 2018 guidance. But the feeling right now is that, because their business does start to pick up during the school year, we got to see what that looks like as we get the two businesses together.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay. And one more follow-up, quickly. So, sitting back and listening to this call, my take is, you're intending to grow Prepared and Chicken on the top line pretty substantially. And so those margins may be restrained as you invest, whereas for, it sounds like your Beef and your Pork business as you intended for those to be essentially cash cows to fund that growth. So, we talked about earlier, in the Pork side, there is significant slaughter capacity coming on. My estimate is somewhere in the 10% to 15% range over the next year-and-a-half, which is going to outpace hog supply growth. So going back to that whole margin versus market share comment, in order to retain the cash cow nature of that business, I mean, should we think that you all will be willing to even close a plant if that's required to maintain the strong margins that that segment has enjoyed over the last couple of years?","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Heather, we're not going to talk about those sort of things here, but what I can say is that there is going to be some level of equilibration in the industry. We see that the segment, the Pork segment will still be above its normalized range for 2018. But the other thing we just haven't talked a lot about is the export demand. Export demand remains very strong, and that should benefit us. We are a preferred pork supplier, particularly to the Pacific Rim markets.","There is a lot of questions, but I would say that for us, we feel good. We feel good about, certainly, 2017 and 2018 setting up a little lighter based on some of this capacity coming on, but we still think 2018 sets up well.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much for taking the follow-up.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","And the next question will be a follow-up from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thanks. Yeah. Thanks so much for letting me ask one more. I know you're hesitant, I understand why, to give details on AdvancePierre's impact on this year. And I realize it's impossible to know. But most of the questions I'm getting from investors this morning, and I imagine most of the questions, my peers in this call are getting too. We are just trying to figure some of this out. So, if you can indulge me for a moment, I think of it this way, AdvancePierre generates maybe $55 million, $60 million a quarter. That's the benefit you're getting in the fourth quarter. Interest expense guidance went up by $45 million. That's the cost. You're talking a net benefit of maybe $10 million to $15 million in added (53:23) added, I guess, net income from the deal before any synergies. Is that reasonable for us to look at it that way? Or am I missing something important in that analysis?","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","It's pretty close, Ken. The one thing you're missing is incremental depreciation and amortization. We haven't had that valuation work done. So we don't know what that number is, so that would take a little bit off. On the interest expense side, really it depends entirely upon when we close. So is it early June? Is it late June? That's the swing there.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's fine. Thanks, Dennis, so much.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Tom Hayes for his closing remarks.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Thank you very much. Again, great questions. And I'll just say, again, we wrapped up an excellent first half at Tyson. We feel the second half is off to a solid start. We feel great about where we are now, and we're well positioned for fiscal 2018. And we'll continue to be as transparent as we can be on all the things that are going to help you value our company and we're really looking forward to this acquisition and making a great thing for you as investors and Tyson Foods' family.","Thank you for your interest, appreciate it and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

If you have any objection, please disconnect at this time.","I will now turn today\u2019s call over to Mr. Jon Kathol, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin.","Jon Kathol","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for Tyson Foods\u2019 conference call for the second quarter of the 2014 fiscal year. On today\u2019s call are Donnie Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer and Dennis Leatherby, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I need to remind you, our remarks today include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. I encourage you to read today\u2019s press release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of the risks that can affect our business. (Operator Instructions)","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Donnie Smith.","Donnie Smith","Thanks, John, good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. With $0.60 a share, Q2 was a record-setting second quarter and we achieved it despite some significant hurdles. Q2 is typically our most challenging quarter and we expect that that to be the case again, this year. Now that is in the books, I feel like we\u2019re in a really good position for the back half of the year.","But before we comment on the balance of the year, let\u2019s look at what went on in Q2. Winter weather affected us in several ways, some positive, some negative. Although we saw a dip in our sales to school cafeterias from weather related closings, we saw an increase in our retail sales, because mom went to the grocery store and stocked up on chicken strips when she heard another round of bad weather was coming.","Our multichannel business channel allows us to serve the consumer\u2019s needs wherever they are, which is one of our streams, as a company, because of weather conditions, we had more issues than normal, getting order to our customers and to the members to our plans, cold temperatures affected livestock productivity and our propane shortages that resulted in price hikes of that important fuel sources for our growers. We expect this sort of thing every second quarter at least in some locations, but this season, winter storm started earlier where more large spread and were more frequent.","Now switching to the consumer demand picture, increasing protein prices have indicated continued strong demand for protein often as the expense of carbohydrates. we\u2019re seeing a noticeable ship among the proteins as well. Looking at Nielsen 52-week data, pounds of fresh meats sold at retail were up a little over percent, or nearly 3% higher prices.","However, if you look at the most recent four-week data for the period ending March 29, total pounds sold were about flat or dollar sales rose a little over 4%, driven by a 4.6% increase in pricing. Fresh meat volume is down nearly 7% on a 7% price increase, Pork volume is down nearly 1% or 5% gone up 5.5% and as expected, chicken pounds were up 3.5%, even though chicken pricing was up 3%, indicating a definite ship towards the relative value of chicken.","On the food service side, restaurant spending is up that the gains are from higher average check prices, not additional traffic, NPD is forecasting traffic growth beyond the 1%, which so far in the calendar year, we\u2019re seeing predominantly a small change. Technomic restated its forecast for the year to reflect the winter storm and it\u2019s now projecting 2.5% to 3% dollar sales growth down from 4% earlier.","On both retail and food service, we continue to see the bifurcation of consumers. Food spending is leaning towards either a value priced product or a premium option and the middle is getting squeezed. But again, Tyson Foods is serving all of these consumers and whatever channel, price points or tight products they are looking for, and that\u2019s one of the reasons we continue to be successful. I\u2019m really pleased with the 7% growth in sales of our value-added products in all of our channels and this is a key part of our strategy.","So the takeaway for Q2 is that despite bad weather, our prices that affected demand and sluggish food service traffic, our volume was up nearly 3% over Q2 last year and we had a 4% return on sales. Now, lets\u2019 see how that looks at the segment level and what we expect going forward?","The Chicken segment had an 8.2% return on sales in Q2, volume was up, our pricing was up slightly as a result of lower feed ingredient costs and we expect to be down about $500 million for the year. We expect overall domestic chicken production to be up only 2% to 3% in fiscal 2014, given continued type premium supplies. We think that strong consumer demand for chicken can easily absorb the small supply increase and it should be a strong year for the Chicken segment.","The Beef segment has just under a 1% return on sales. We had to deal with the considerable amount of volatility throughout the quarter with temporary supply and balances due to an extreme run up in cattle prices. It was difficult to maintain the spread, but we stayed positive for the quarter. One of the ways we managed our spread was to run fewer head, which is why our volume was down, but we effectively maximized revenue and controlled cost to continuous attention to detail and execution of the fundamentals.","Although we may see more of these temporary imbalances in some regions going forward, our plans are strategically located near the cattle supplies and we expect to have adequate cattle to run a plant. as always, we\u2019re managed through margin and we expect these segment results for 2014 to look similar to last year.","In the Pork segment, we had a 7.2% return on sales in the second quarter, volume was up on strong demand, of course, the big concern in Pork is the PED virus and its impact on hog supplies. We did begin to see a supply reduction in our Q2, although heavier weights partially offset fewer heads and we were able to make up some by improving yields as part of our continuous improvement efforts.","The impact of PED is expected to further affect our hog supplies, beginning around the June 1, peaking in August and then beginning to ease in October. Hog weights are expected to be higher and offset some of the head reduction. So we anticipate industry pork production to be down as much as 4% for the year. We need to adjust our operating hours accordingly, but we think the pork segment will still perform well this year despite these challenges.","The Prepared Foods segment had a 2.4% return on sales for the quarter. we have strong sales volume, but the rapid run up in raw materials and our formula pricing mechanisms created a pricing lag, although we expect to recoup the difference later in the year.","Now I want to leave you with the impression, however that we\u2019re satisfied with these results, because we\u2019re not. We\u2019re working on product innovation, maximizing the opportunities from our leasing acquisitions, investing in our operations and putting mass spending towards product launches to improve the long-term profitability of the Prepared Foods segment.","I\u2019d like to update you on one of these launches that we previously told you about, which is Tyson DAY STARTS. The initial rollout went better than planned, and we\u2019re exceeding all our pre-launch objectives. These products had an ACV of 60% by mid-March, which is the fastest growing ACV of any product launch in our industry.","Bacon is another bright spot. Despite value markets that pushed retails higher, we didn't see any demand erosion in Q2. When you combine our three-tiered branding strategy of Wright, Tyson, and Corn King, Tyson Foods holds the number two market share in sales dollars, and when you add private-label to our three branded bacon offerings, we\u2019re the biggest seller of bacon in retail. And we\u2019ll continue to be aggressive with ACV goals, especially with the Wright brand, our premium offering.","Bacon is a strong performer, and I think there are several other businesses at varying stages of development within the Prepared Foods segment that can\u2019t perform as well as our Bacon business in the future. Admittedly, we have room for improvement, but I think our Prepared Foods segment is better than the 2.4% return on sales we showed you this quarter and we\u2019re determined to prove it.","And our final segment to discuss is our new International segment. I\u2019ll give you the highlights and then Dennis will give you the particulars of why we created this new segment and what it comprises. International had a negative 9.1% return on sales. China is still the biggest portion of the loss due to the demand destruction. As I said on our Q1 call, we slowed the pace in China, as we wait for demand to return. We think the worst is over, and that it should get sequentially better from here, but we\u2019ll need to see demand recovery before we can predict when we'll reach profitability in China.","Our operations in Brazil also struggled in Q2, but we\u2019ve restructured our team there to improve the operational focus. And speaking of focus, back in November we announced several leadership changes for the company, and a new organizational structure focused on the key elements of our strategy to accelerate growth, reinforce our operational excellence, and create opportunities for our team members.","We recently completed the reorganization and now have the teams in place under Hal Carper in Strategy and M&A; Donnie King in Prepared Foods and Customer and Consumer Solutions; Steve Stover in Fresh Meats; and Noel White in Poultry. Now that we have this important step behind us, we can turn people loose to do their best work in the areas that have the most impact. And now let's go to Dennis for the financial update.","Dennis Leatherby","Thank you, Donnie, and good morning. As Donnie said earlier, we had a record setting second quarter. Our top line revenue growth was 7.7% over the prior year, and quarterly sales surpassed $9 billion for the first time in our history. We continue to execute our growth strategy as evidenced by increased sales volumes in Chicken, Prepared Foods, and International.","Total company return on sales was 4%, and operating income was $361 million, up 53% from Q2 2013. Our earnings of $0.60 per share is a record for our second quarter and represents the 58% increase over adjusted EPS of $0.38 in Q2 2013. Year-to-date, EPS was $0.32, or a 52% increase compared to last year\u2019s $0.87 adjusted EPS coming from operation \u2013 continuing operations.","Our rolling four quarter EPS is $2.71 from continuing operations on an adjusted basis. This compares to $1.95 for the same period a year ago. We achieved a 12-month pre-tax return on invested capital of just over 20% compared to 16% for the prior year period. This 20% ROIC goal is an important metric for us and one we\u2019re proud of attaining.","Operating cash flow through two quarters was $265 million after funding $367 million in additional working capital as we grew our business. This compares to operating cash flows of $230 million for the first two quarters of fiscal 2013. We spent $153 million on capital expenditures for the second quarter and $293 million for the first six months of fiscal 2014. This outpaced our depreciation and amortization by $39 million as we continued to invest their projects for both our domestic and international operations. These projects will not only result in improved productive capabilities, labor efficiencies, yields and sales mix, but will also increase our ability to innovate and introduce new products to our customers.","During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $100 million under our share repurchase program. Since May 2011, we repurchased 50.4 million shares for $1.2 billion. Our effective tax rate in Q2 was 38.3%. Net debt to EBITDA for the past 12 months was 0.7x and on a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis, this measure was 0.9x. Including cash of $438 million, net debt was $1.5 billion. Total liquidity was just under $1.4 billion, remaining above our goal of $1.2 billion and gross debt remained as just over $1.9 billion.","Year-to-date, net interest expense was $48 million, down 30% from a year ago. Average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 356 million. This reflects the dilutive effect of options and warrants of 13 million. The impact of 2.5 million shares repurchased during the quarter will not before you realized until subsequent quarters. Now, here are some thoughts on the full year for fiscal 2014. We now expect revenues of approximately $37 billion, up $1 billion from our previous estimates, and almost 8% over fiscal 2013.","Net interest expense should approximate $95 million, down $5 million from our previous estimate and down more than $40 million from a year ago. Effective tax rate should be around 35.5%. CapEx is expected to be in the $650 million to $700 million. We expect diluted shares in Q3 to remain around 356 million and because our convertible notes and warrants are behind us, there should be less volatility in our diluted shares. We still think we\u2019ll generate at least $2.78 EPS per the year and at least 10% EPS growth in 2015 and beyond.","Our priorities for excess cash remain the same, which are capital spending to improve and grow our existing businesses, acquisitions, either small bolt-ons or larger strategic acquisitions to fulfill our growth strategies around value-added products and international and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, all while maintaining, we maintain \u2013 while ensuring we maintain plenty of liquidity at our disposal.","As Donnie noted earlier, we beginning with the second quarter, we are now reporting our International operations as a separate segment. The International separate segment, which has been included in our Chicken segment includes our Chicken processing operations in Brazil, China, India and Mexico. International became a separate reportable segment as a result of changes to our internal financial reporting to align with executive leadership changes and reorganization Donnie previously mentioned. We believe this will provide better transparency into our business to enhance understanding of our financial performance. I would also note that our Beef, Pork, Prepared Foods and other results were not impacted by this change.","To wrap up, we delivered solid results in a seasonally soft quarter and adjusted earnings per share are up 32% for the first half of the year. We continue to think the back half of the year should be strong and we are confident, we can deliver on our targets.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Denise, we\u2019re ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And I do have today, first question from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Kenneth Zaslow \u2013 Bank of Montreal","Hey, good morning everyone.","Donnie Smith","Hi, good morning.","Hey, Donnie, your expectation for chicken production levels are up 2% to 3%. It's higher than most of the industry that we're hearing from including future. With lower production in the first half of the year, does that imply a fairly rapid expansion in the back half of the year? And what are you thinking about 2015 on that? Can you just help us out with that?","Donnie Smith","Sorry, the 2% to 3% is driven mainly on weight continuing to increase of what we think placements will be about flat to maybe up 1% or so in the back half of the year. I don\u2019t see a meaningful change in poultry production until probably the back half of our 2015.","So I don\u2019t think there's anything that's going to get away from us. But I also think, Ken, there\u2019s going to be a very strong demand pull for chicken, and the industry is going to try to respond as much as it can. The relative value of chicken at both retail and food service is going to make for a very, very strong chicken back half. So that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re seeing. I don\u2019t think the 2% to 3% is anything that would change our margin outlook for the back half of the year.","Kenneth Zaslow \u2013 Bank of Montreal","And my follow-up question is, this is more of a technicality. I just want to \u2013 making sure I understand, you're now obviously excluding international from your business, and you said that your chicken outlook is to be above your normalized range. If I net those together, did the net of those to change to the upside, downside or hasn\u2019t changed relative to your initial expectations?","Donnie Smith","To the upside, if you look at our domestic chicken business for the first half, we\u2019re just under 9% on sales, and there is no reason going into the back half of this year for us not to expect our earnings in chicken to be at least that good or better. So, yes, I think in general, it's the total range if you put the two back together to the upside.","Kenneth Zaslow \u2013 Bank of Montreal","Great. I appreciate. Thank you.","Donnie Smith","You bet, Ken. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Farha Aslam. Your line is open.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Good morning.","Donnie Smith","Good morning, Farha.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Just continuing on the Chicken discussion, could you just give us a read, your pricing was down in the March quarter. And we\u2019ve seen spot pricing for chicken improve. Kind of your outlook for pricing and profitability and a little bit more detail on the U.S. chicken business for the second half would be helpful?","Donnie Smith","Yes, certainly over the last, say, 30, 40 days or so the chicken market has responded. If you look at, I think the beef cut out topped out around 240 or so and pork ran up to 130 or so, and that provided a huge Halo for chicken prices to continue and increase, because chicken pricing looks relatively cheap compared to those beef and pork numbers.","So we expect to see another strong year of chicken pricing for the summer. And think that the outlook for the back half of our year should be better than \u2013 the earning outlook for the back half of the year should be better than the front half.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Okay, thanks helpful. And then when you look at capital allocation clearly you have significant liquidity available to you, yet you\u2019ve said that your share count should be relatively flat for the rest of the year. Can you share with us your thoughts on M&A and the environment you're currently seeing?","Donnie Smith","Sure, Farha. Let me take this one by one. First, as far as the share count, that\u2019s where we are as of now, so we\u2019re not projecting where we\u2019re going to go from here. In terms of the M&A environment, it\u2019s a very attractive environment. Over the past 12 months, our EBITDA was about $2.1 billion, and so we can put some pretty good leverage on that. And so \u2013 and have the ability to both go after small bolt-on acquisitions or larger more strategic acquisitions.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens Inc.","And just on transactions, any color on what you're seeing out there right now?","Donnie Smith","We\u2019re seeing a variety of opportunities and value-added and International or just looking for the right strategic fit right now.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question comes from Brett Hundley. Your line is open. Hello, Mr. Hundley, your line is open. Would you like me to move on?","Brett M. Hundley \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Yes, please.","Operator","Thank you. Up next is Michael Piken. Your line is open.","Michael Leith Piken \u2013 Cleveland Research Company LLC","Yes, good morning. Just wanted to shift over to the beef side of the business, and if we can start on the Pork side, I see you've taken your production down 4% to 5%; you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you think the supplies are going to be tightest kind of from June to October. But where's the industry in terms of finding a vaccine or something to stop the spread of PEDV at this point as best you can tell?","Donnie Smith","I\u2019m not aware of any vaccine that has been developed. I do know in working with our pork suppliers, we have a very close, very good relationship with the farmers from which we purchase hogs. And there has been a noticeable increase in biosecurity throughout the areas where we draw our hogs from, but as far as we know there is no readily available vaccine.","Michael Leith Piken \u2013 Cleveland Research Company LLC","Okay. So I mean, do you think at this point, I mean, it seems like at least the spread of the disease has been a little bit contained. How much of that is weather versus just the improved biosecurity, and how confident are you now that sort of we may \u2013 the down 4% or so is probably what we're going to see now and that it might not get worse?","Donnie Smith","Let me approach the back half of that question first. Although it\u2019s difficult to be completely confident and I'll explain that in a second, we work very closely with our farmers. And we know in the regions where we operate, when, which farms were affected, and we work closely with them to understand how much they are affected. We also work closely with them to know how much longer they\u2019re trying to hold their hogs to put a little bit more weight on, I mean that kind of thing.","So we stay pretty dialed in say, within a three or four-week period of what the hog supply is going to look like coming into our plans. Now, the things we can\u2019t tell is, for example, with the increased biosecurity around PED, how much improvement is that having on PRRS, for example, on these farms.","So there is a little bit of movement in that number. But in general, as we just look at the case sections and how they reflected to farmers that we draw hog from. We\u2019re pretty confident that between June and then, probably dipping the deepest in that August set period and then trying to start recovering or so, in October is the right way to plan our business. And we work not only with, of course, our plants in making sure we've got a good plan dialed in as efficient as we can be and move also around where we need to, but we\u2019ve also been working with our customer base to make sure that those products that are sold by the each, for example, ribs or bellies or whatever are that we understand what the dip is going to look like and how we can help them merchandise through that. So we think we\u2019ve got a good plan. We think we're as dialed in as we can be.","Michael Leith Piken \u2013 Cleveland Research Company LLC","Okay, great. And then just shifting over to beef, it looks like the catalog field numbers are supportive of relatively good supply availability over the next two quarters, but if you think about fiscal 2015, could you talk a little bit about your outlook for beef margins, do you think we can get back to a normalized level, it looks like the cattle supplies might get a little more tight as you head into the early half of fiscal 2015, any thoughts there in terms of how we think about your beef business next year?","Donnie Smith","Little more comfortable in the back half of 2014 certainly, and we agree with you assessment there that there should be adequate cattle certainly around us, the drought in the South West continues and that tends to push a few more cattle up in the Midwest where the predominance of our processing base is. So we feel good about having adequate cattle around us. As you get out into 2015, I think you can \u2013 looking at the calf crop, you can already say that 2015 numbers will be down another 2% to 3% or so.","And it looks like that the cattle are going to continue to concentrate in the Midwest creating some of these regional disparity with cattle supply out there. But we feel very comfortable that we\u2019re going to have good cattle around us. And at this point, there is no reason for us, not to think of our beef business at least as good as last year or better this year and now a lot of reason to think about it very differently going into 2015 from where we stand today.","Michael Leith Piken \u2013 Cleveland Research Company LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Donnie Smith","You bet.","Operator","The next question comes from Diane Geissler. Your line is open.","Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning.","Donnie Smith","Good morning, Diane.","Dennis Leatherby","Good morning, Diane.","Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","I just wanted to put together a couple of these comments that you\u2019ve made about production into 2015 to get more of a holistic view on total protein production in 2013. It sounds like to me you\u2019re saying that given the constraints of the hen flock you might see a little bit more production in chicken later in 2014, but it won\u2019t really ramp until later in 2015.","I don\u2019t know if anybody really has a clear call on hard numbers, because until we get on top of the virus itself, I\u2019m not sure where it\u2019s going to go, so I would look at maybe on the hog side flat to up slightly next year and then it sounds like the cattle supply should be down again because of either drought and\/or retentions. If you kind of put that altogether, are you looking for sort of flat to up slightly in terms of total protein supply next year or do you have a view on that at this point?","Donnie Smith","The big if for us is what\u2019s going to happen with pork. I\u2019d like to think we\u2019re going to see a herd expansion, I\u2019d like to think we\u2019re with biosecurity we'll get on top of PED, but it\u2019s just too early to tell. I think the rest of it, Diane, you\u2019re dialed in very well on what to expect from a supply standpoint. So I don't think I'd change your outlook very much, and if anything flat to up maybe a little bit would be a pretty decent call in May. Now, we\u2019ll know a little bit more as we get down into the fall, but I think you\u2019re dialed in pretty good.","Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And then maybe just to move to the demand side of the equation, some of the drivers between the DAY STARTS and the light sausage, some of the recent eliminator you\u2019ve done, or sort of the best and better growth in the legacy portfolio.","Donnie Smith","Yes. We have \u2013 our Prepared Foods business is really a broad mix of different types of businesses, some other different stages of maturity. we had several of our segments that responded very well this past quarter, and frankly, continue to see good \u2013 good opportunity all in front of us, and we continued to invest in that business, we\u2019ve made have some significant operational improvements in the lunchmeat side of our business and we look for that to bring continual improvement, as we move forward. we\u2019re investing pretty heavily in our max spending, not only in the DAY STARTS, but also in our breakfast sausage line, and we look for those businesses to respond well to that.","And so, really we do have some strong businesses in that portfolio that are doing very well, and we\u2019ve got some others that are a bit more immature that we\u2019re investing heavily in and we give the whole segment \u2013 we give that whole segment up to its normalized range. and I really think looking forward, what you should expect we pay for that Prepared Foods segment to be in its range next year, as we see these investments come to provision in these next two quarters.","Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And maybe, just a follow quick one from me, in the prepared remarks, you alluded some poor operational execution in poultry in Brazil, and you said you had restructured that business, and maybe elaborating a little bit on what\u2019s going on that?","Donnie Smith","Yes, we had some folks make some poor decisions around how we handle the part of our processing that \u2013 what we had was, we had a freezer that made it some repair, our folks down there frankly did not do a very good job in that, it also backed up into the field and infected our law production. And so basically, we changed that out our country manager in Brazil. we changed out the plant manager in that location, and the law production manager and we have a firm grip on the situation from this point forward. so that behind us and we\u2019re looking forward now to \u2013 two much better quarters coming ahead.","Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","All right. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And the next question comes from Akshay Jagdale. Your line is open.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Donnie Smith","Thanks. Hi Akshay.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. So my question is on chicken, first on fiscal 2015 obviously, chicken being a largest business, you may \u2013 you reiterate it 10% EPS growth. But at the same time, you did talk a little bit about production in the sense that you think that the industry is going to respond to the margin that we\u2019re seeing right now, so can you just help us understand in a scenario where the industry is increasing production, which I understand may not happen next year. but in a scenario where that\u2019s happening and you\u2019re coming off a year where you have above normal margins, can how can Tyson still grow earning the 10%, so first Kenneth and what\u2019s the strategy to execute on that?","Kenneth J. Kimbro","So, let me take the kind of the part B side of your question, can we grow EPS 10% absolutely, you should see significant improvement in Prepared Foods next year, international off to get better this thing in China is not going to last forever. I can\u2019t tell you today, I\u2019ve been wrong two quarter to put forward and when we though that thing would return, so I can\u2019t tell you today, but I can\u2019t tell you the current situation is not sustainable and that it will and for you \u2013 and we\u2019re doubling down on our cost efforts, particularly in China. So, you should see improvement in our international results. We think, Beef ought to be every bid as good next year, it is this year same story on Pork, if we get any kind of production expansion maybe a little bit better.","And so then, kind of back in and then the first part of your question, it really pulls back to our buy versus growth strategy, Akshay. We don\u2019t have to necessarily grow the Chicken to expand our business. We\u2019ve got two areas for our current Chicken business. We were just about out of capacity and that\u2019s our case-ready fresh chicken, which we are the number one brand at retail and that\u2019s a very, very important segment to our customer and to the consumer. And so we\u2019ve got to expand our capacity there and they don\u2019t be thinking necessarily production just think capacity.","So, it may mean a capacity move from one process type into another to capture a more value-added segment. And then speaking of value-added, we are tapped out on our further process and fully cooked capacity as well. So, we have two lines under construction now and we\u2019re thinking about another two, three lines, because our \u2013 the consumers responding to our value-added poultry and as the we\u2019ve grown about 7% I think, so far this year in value-added and see no reason off to believe that we won\u2019t sustain at 6% to 8% growth in fiscal 2015 as we move forward.","Dennis Leatherby","","And Akshay, this is Dennis, I would add to that. We have a considerable pipeline of projects in the queue around capital spending. We talked about $650 million to $700 million this year. We fully expect next year to be quite a bit more and as we\u2019ve talked about capacity aggregate MIRR our projects over the last four years have been just shy of 25%. We fully expect that to continue to be the case in fiscal 2014 and 2015. So, there is every reason to believe we can add to the margin structure even through CapEx.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. Good segue into the next half of my question which is, so what do you expect in terms of supply for the industry next year? So this is live, obviously, the live part of the industry. What are you expecting for supply next year? And do you expect industry margins to sustain themselves on the spot level?","Dennis Leatherby","I would expect on the supply 2%, 3% or so driven primarily in the back half as we\u2019ve said earlier. And then yes, I mean with cattle numbers coming down, call pork flat up a little bit. There is no reason not to expect chicken to not have another good year in terms of its demand, if for no other reason than the relative price versus the other proteins. So yes, I think demand for chicken will continue to be strong next year, sure.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","Okay. And then just the short term \u2013 and again, sorry to ask so many questions on chicken, but you\u2019ve clearly proven that in the bottom of the cycle, you can outperform the industry. The question I\u2019ve always had is, when things are good, how good can it get for Tyson? So things are pretty good. They have been for the industry now for over a year. You\u2019ve put up a 9.5% margin last quarter, but you would expect that the next two quarters would be the best environment from a margin perspective for Tyson, is that for the U.S. Tyson business in Chicken. Is that a fair assessment and can you give us some insight into how the quarter is shaping up one-month into it?","Donnie Smith","No reason to expect the back half of our year, do not be at least as good or better than what the front half was from an earnings perspective. But remember I would say, we don\u2019t respond like pure play commodity guys. Our business model is much more smoothed out through the year. So, we won\u2019t necessarily hit the peeks in the summer time like the commodity players will, but we also won\u2019t see the dips in the lower part of the market to our consistent earnings over time is what our business model is shooting forward, and that\u2019s what you should expect.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","Okay. And just one last one following up on some of the questions on M&A. What I've been sort of impressed by your discipline on M&A as it relates to the price with your ROIC metric, the 20% return that you talked about. So can you just remind us again about the filter and sort of the priorities of that filter? So I mean, there's obviously the M&A environment is very good right now. But the type of prices being paid I would argue are also pretty rich, especially let's say for Michael Foods to get a 20% ROIC pre-tax would imply I think doubling the EBITDA on that business in five years. So can you just help us with your filter and the discipline and put that into context with the environment you're seeing?","Donnie Smith","","Dennis.","Dennis Leatherby","Sure. Akshay, this is Dennis. As far as the filter goes, first and foremost they need to be strategic and fit within our goals to grow in the value-added categories around Chicken and Prepared Foods and for that matter possibly even Beef or Pork to the extent they are available. International\u2019s obviously a priority as well. From a disciplined standpoint, you are right, our goal is to achieve a 20% ROIC with an acquisition. To the extent that the M&A environment requires higher prices to be paid for companies. That means we have to work that much harder to get there and we can \u2013 we do that through looking at synergies how we can expand the business within our existing distribution framework, and just be very disciplined and get there. That might mean we have to push it out for three to five years to get that return But we think ultimately, those kind of acquisitions still would be very accretive from an EPS and then ROIC standpoint over time. So really nothing\u2019s changed.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","Great. I will pass on. Thank you.","Operator","","And the next question comes from Ken Goldman. Your line is open.","Ken B. Goldman \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Hey, can you talk a little bit about what's going on in Mexico with avian influenza at the moment? There's some reports it's worse than what the Mexican government and some companies that operate there have stated publicly. I'm just curious to what degree you might expect Tyson to actually benefit from the virus, you might see some more industry exports of meat or polis to Mexico?","Donnie Smith","From time to time this is an issue in Mexico. We don\u2019t have any flocks that are affected by right now. You should know we are taking all of the necessary steps and all of the biosecurity measures to ensure, the viability of our supply, pricing has improved in Mexico and we\u2019re reaping the benefit of that. Certainly, as far as eggs moving down there, we don\u2019t have any plans to move any eggs to Mexico.","Ken B. Goldman \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","And you talked about \u2013 separate question \u2013 the strength in DAY STARTS beyond your expectations. Can you talk a little bit about to what extent your success in generating your own brand makes you less likely to buy something in Prepared Foods? I guess to put it another way, DAY STARTS has had success, so why buy something if you are finding that you can make it yourself? It\u2019s an old make versus buy conundrum I guess.","Donnie Smith","It is, as Dennis said on the previous question, what we\u2019re really looking for is strategic fit and the ability to make an acquisition that will be accretive to our earnings. and so we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to be able to use the insights we have about, what\u2019s the consumer needs to find a way to fill that need and grow our business. We feel great about our organic opportunities, we feel great about our opportunity to invest in our current business, but we\u2019re also going to be out there looking for strategic opportunities to fill in the gaps where we need to, or to create a little bit more aggressive headspace in a category where we maybe able to buy, as long as the purchase make sense, and then accelerate growth in that \u2013 that particular category whichever category that might be.","Ken B. Goldman \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Donnie Smith","You bet.","Operator","And the next question comes from Farha Aslam. Your line is open.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","Just continuing on that M&A question front, do you feel like you need more chicken capacity? Would you build that with CapEx or via acquisitions? And in terms of M&A, is there a geographic preference or is there a protein preference that you\u2019re looking for?","Donnie Smith","The answer to your first question is yes, and the answer to our second question is gone with it\u2019s a strategic fit whether it\u2019s an International acquisition, Poultry value added or Prepared Foods, those are the areas of our business where we believe our growth potential loss and where we can have the most value to the consumer and the most value to the shareholder and so our acquisition targets will be focused in those three areas.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then one just on the base business, when you look at the Texas facility that the lunch meat plant you took down and are ramping back up, could you just give us some color on what that can do for earnings in the second half of the year now that it\u2019s starting back up?","Donnie Smith","In the second half of this year, marginal improvement, but sequentially in 2015, it ought to make a more meaningful difference, it takes a while to get that backed up frankly, we\u2019ve got to get some more business around us to get the revenue side moving, that\u2019s going to take us at least couple more quarters, but we think certainly as we move into 2015, we\u2019ll see sequential and meaningful improvement in that part of our business.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Donnie Smith","Okay. That concludes the call. thank you for interest in our business. And I hope, you have a great day.

Sir, you may begin.","Jon Kathol","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Tyson Foods Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter and 2013 Fiscal Year. On today's call is Donnie Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Leatherby, Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Lochner, Chief Operating Officer.","I need to remind you our remarks today include forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. I encourage you to read today's press release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of the risks that can affect our business.","[Operator Instructions]","I'll now turn the call over to Donnie Smith.","Donnie Smith","Thanks, Jon. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. As we close the books on fiscal '13, I want to celebrate what Tyson Foods achieved this past year. We produced record earnings of $2.26 a share or 15% growth over the previous year, surpassing our goal of at least 10% EPS growth. We grew sales by 4%, achieving our goal and reaching a new record of $34.4 billion.","Operating income grew 7% or $89 million over the prior year, despite $470 million of incremental feed cost. We grew sales of value-added products by nearly 6%, against a very aggressive goal of 6% to 8%. We made significant progress in building our international Chicken production, growing sales by 20% against a goal of 12% to 16%. We returned $650 million to shareholders by paying out $100 million in dividends and buying back 21.1 million shares of stock for $550 million. Our stock was up 78% for the fiscal year, and we reached a new all-time high stock price. ROIC continues to be over 18%. At the end of the fiscal year, net debt was $1.3 billion and net debt to cap was at 17%.","We made 2 Prepared Foods acquisitions, Don Julio and Circle Foods. And we had a greater focus on growth drivers, while maintaining a steadfast commitment to operational excellence, which is carrying us into another year of growth in 2014. That's what we did.","Now let's look at the macro environment we were operating in. We continued to see a shift away from foodservice into retail, reflecting the overall economy. Now that's not to say our foodservice business wasn't successful. In fact, it did very well in a challenging year for the foodservice industry, in general. We were nimble to respond as consumers moved among proteins and channels, depending on their confidence in the economy and the effect gas prices had on disposable income.","We're also seeing more bifurcation among consumers between those choosing higher-priced value-added products and those moving down the value stream to save money. According to Nielsen data, for the year coinciding with our fiscal year, total fresh meat pounds sold at retail were up 1.4%, while pricing was up 2.3%. Ground beef and fresh beef pounds declined 0.3% and 1.4%, respectively, as price rose over 3%. Pork pounds increased 5% as price declined 4%. Fresh chicken was the winner, with pounds up 2%, even with a 7% increase in pricing, indicating that chicken was still viewed as a value relative to the other proteins. Tyson captured share as the #1 brand of fresh chicken in the United States.","Now let's take a moment to talk about where we're going and how we'll get there. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing several new leadership positions. This structure is focused on the key elements of our strategy, allowing us to accelerate our growth, reinforce our operational excellence and create opportunities for our team by deepening our best in class talent. By separating our poultry and Prepared Foods division, we are sharpening our focus on these 2 crucial growth areas.","Noel White, a proven leader in our fresh meats business will now be leading our poultry division. Steve Stouffer, a 30-year veteran of our fresh meats business will lead our fresh meats team. Donnie King will be leading our Prepared Foods division and will create an integrated sales and marketing organization to strengthen our customer relationships. Hal Carper will lead in the areas of strategy and new ventures.","I'm excited about these changes because they will allow us to capitalize on these leaders' considerable experience and talent, as we carry out our long-term growth plans. As we make these transitions, we will minimize distractions and concentrate on customer service, product quality and innovation.","This morning, we'll also announce Jim Lochner's decision to retire at the end of our 2014 fiscal year. During the upcoming year, Jim will be working with the fresh meats group to ensure smooth transition, and he will help us make the move to a new organizational structure. I personally want to thank Jim for being an integral part of developing our performance-based, metrics-driven approach to business. Operational excellence is a hallmark of our culture. And as Jim makes his transition, he will help us sustain this mindset for long-term success and growth beyond 2014. He will continue in an advisory role for several more years. I'm happy that Jim will get to enjoy the rewards of his 4 decades of hard work and dedication.","I just said a lot about growth and strategy in the future. But I'd like to give you some specific examples that illustrate how we're executing on these broad concepts. So we study consumers' needs and behaviors, and we have identified opportunities to grow retail value-added sales beyond center-of-the-plate chicken.","Breakfast emerged as a high-potential category. Wright brand Breakfast Sausage is a natural follower to Wright Bacon, and a category that makes perfect sense for us as a leading pork processor. We recently rolled out Wright sausage, starting in the Southeast where Wright Bacon has the strongest following. And we're supporting this premium product line with highly targeted media.","Another breakfast category, frozen handheld, is also a good fit for us. At nearly $1 billion in annual sales, it's a large category that grew more than 20% over the last year. Consumers told us they think a good breakfast should include protein, and Tyson is the brand they trust to deliver high-quality protein. 48% of consumers who buy frozen breakfast items also buy Tyson frozen value-added chicken. So we have a base of familiarity and positive perceptions as we enter this new era.","We're launching 7 products under the Tyson DAY STARTS brand that will include biscuit sandwiches, flatbreads and wrapped omelettes. After consumer taste testing, 93% of consumers who already buy in this category said they would buy Tyson DAY STARTS and 89% said our products were better than anything currently on the market. Sell-in is underway now, and we've received a great response from our customers.","We'll begin shipping in January, and we'll support our entry into this category with significant MAP spending. DAY STARTS is a great example of our push for innovation, as we set a goal to have 20% of our domestic poultry and Prepared Foods sales coming from new product innovation. We define that as something that we've developed within the past 3 years. And in 2013, we exceeded our goal with 21.5% of our sales resulting from innovation.","Turning to another growth area, international. This time last year, projections for improvement in our international performance would be around $80 million, but due to avian influenza in China and a weak fourth quarter in Mexico, we improved by only $45 million. I'll quickly add that I'm still confident in our business plans in China, Brazil, Mexico and India and believe that we're headed in the right direction for long-term success.","Before we go to Dennis, I'd like to give you an indication of what to expect from Tyson in 2014. First on the list is paying off the $458 million in convertible notes, which we did in early October in cash. It should be another very good year of growth, and we're off to a strong start, especially in the Chicken segment. On our last call, we said, overall, 2014 would look a lot like the back half of 2013 times 2. We still see it that way, meaning we should over-deliver on our EPS growth goal of at least 10% a year.","And like 2013, we think earnings will be more weighted to the third and fourth quarters. As a reminder, our other annual goal is for 3% to 4% top line sales growth, 6% to 8% value-added sales growth and 12% to 16% international sales growth. We expect an ROIC that continues to grow and drive shareholder value. With AI and China hopefully behind us, our plan is to reach breakeven profitability and processing almost 100% company controlled birds by the end of fiscal year.","As I just explained, we'll roll out several major product launches, including Tyson DAY STARTS and Wright brand Breakfast Sausage. We'll stay focused on our strategy, investing in growth and setting ourselves up for a great 2015 and beyond.","Now let's go to Dennis for the financial update, followed by Jim with the segment results.","Dennis Leatherby","Thank you, Donnie, and good morning, everyone. I also want to personally thank Jim publicly for his great leadership role and our turnaround and ongoing success. Jim, I thoroughly enjoy working with you, and I'm glad you're still going to be around to help us achieve our long-term strategic plans.","In this morning's earnings release, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $0.70 per share, up 23% compared to $0.57 per share a year ago. As a result of another strong quarter, I'm pleased to report a record year of earnings from continuing operations of $2.31 or $2.26 after excluding the currency translation adjustment in the second quarter. This $2.26 adjusted EPS compares to $1.97 adjusted EPS in 2012, up 15% year-over-year and beats our previous best of $2.22 in 2010 despite $1.4 billion in increased feed costs and many other significant challenges since 2010.","Pretax return on invested capital for the past 12 months was 18.5%. Over the past 3 years, pretax ROIC has averaged just over 18%, again in the face of considerable challenges. Our operating cash flow for 2013 was $1.3 billion and is consistent with our 4-year average. We have shown the ability to sustain high levels of cash generation, and this should increase as we continue to grow our earnings.","Capital expenditures were $133 million for the quarter, bringing the 2013 total to $558 million.","During the fourth quarter, we acquired 9.9 million shares for $300 million under our share repurchase program. Since May 2011, we have repurchased 43.3 million shares for $950 million.","Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 32.5%. For the full year, the effective tax rate from continuing operations was 32.6% or 33.1% excluding the currency translation adjustment in the second quarter. Net debt to EBITDA for the last 12 months was 0.7x. On a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis, this measure was 1.3x. Including cash of more than $1.1 billion, net debt was just under $1.3 billion. Total liquidity was $2.1 billion, well above our targeted range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Gross debt was just over $2.4 billion. I'm pleased to report that our $458 million convertible notes matured 2 weeks after our year end, and we paid the balance with cash on hand.","Our diluted average shares for the fourth quarter was 370 million. This included dilution of 12 million for our convertible notes, 6 million for the warrants and 5 million for stock options. As we previously reported, we had call options for the convertible notes, which will cancel out its dilution starting in Q1 of 2014. As a result, our diluted shares will decrease in Q1 by the 12 million shares from these convertible notes. Additionally, in Q1, we should realize a reduction of another 4 million diluted shares versus Q4 of 2013, as we benefit from the full impact of the Q4 share repurchases.","Now looking forward, here are some additional thoughts on 2014. We expect revenues of $36 billion, up almost 5% over 2013. Net interest expense should be about $100 million, down $38 million from 2013, primarily due to the payoff of our convertible notes.","The effective tax rate should be around 35%. Our preliminary CapEx plan is around $700 million, up $140 million from 2013 and $180 million greater than our depreciation and amortization expense.","Based on our average share price in Q4, we expect our diluted shares in Q1 to be around 354 million, prior to considering changes in our stock price, which would impact the dilution from the warrants and stock options. This also does not reflect the impact of any additional share buybacks.","And finally, this morning, we reported our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend from $0.05 to $0.075 per share on our Class A common stock, a 50% increase payable on December 13.","Over the past 4 years, we have made a lot of improvements that have provided us with a balance sheet that we believe is a competitive advantage and is a solid foundation for our strategic growth plan.","During this time, we have generated $5 billion in operating cash flows, and that is after funding $700 million in working capital increases. We invested $2.5 billion back into our business, including acquisitions, which is $0.5 billion greater than depreciation and amortization and is a further reflection of our growth plans. We also paid down over $1 billion in debt and returned $1.3 billion back to our shareholders via share buybacks and dividends.","Our priorities for excess cash remain the same, which include additional capital spending to improve and grow our existing businesses, acquisitions to fulfill our growth strategies around value-added products and our international footprint and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, all while ensuring we maintain plenty of liquidity at our disposal.","As Donnie mentioned earlier, we are off to a strong start in 2014 and we still expect it to look like the back half of 2013 times 2, with the strongest quarters in Q3 and Q4. This would be well ahead of our annual goal to deliver at least 10% EPS growth.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jim for a closer look into our operating segments.","James V. Lochner","Donnie, Dennis, I appreciate your kind words earlier. I've always had a goal to retire at 62, and we have worked on the development of the team and the organizational structure, which allows me to accomplish this. I feel very fortunate to have worked with some really great people over the last several decades. I'm excited to begin the next chapter of my life, and I'm also very excited about the future of Tyson Foods.","I really like the new organizational structure and the senior leadership changes, and I look forward to supporting this great team over the next year and beyond. I am confident Tyson is poised to move to the next level. The new structure, processes, people and strategy are aligning in such a way that the earnings power of this company can move to a higher plane, and I'm looking forward to watching it happen.","Now let's talk about the segments. Starting with the Chicken segment, in the fourth quarter, we reported $175 million in operating income and a 5.5% return on sales. Volume and pricing increased 2.4% and 4.3%, respectively, over Q4 last year. Through operational mix and price improvements, we offset a $30 million increase in feed costs for the quarter.","For the fiscal year, the Chicken segment produced $646 million in operating income and a 5.3% return on sales. Volume for the year was up nearly 2%, while price per pound was up over 6%, which partially offset the $470 million incremental feed costs for the year.","Our buy versus grow strategy continues to work for us. By keeping our production short of demand, we can make opportunistic purchases on the open market for breast meat used and value-added products, while keeping our late quarter inventories in check. We will maintain this strategy into fiscal 2014 as it allows us to be responsive to customer needs and market shifts.","Seven weeks into the new fiscal year, the Chicken segment is off to a strong start. We expect Chicken supplies to be up 3% to 4% for the year, but we also expect demand to be up as well, due to the relative strength in beef and pork pricing and chicken features at both foodservice and retail. We will continue to diversify to a more value-added product mix in total, particularly focusing on dark meat products for domestic customers.","We currently project our feed costs will decrease approximately $500 million in fiscal '14. However, the cost of grain is only 1 factor in our pricing conversations with customers. Chicken supply and consumer demand, along with the value we provide through quality, service and innovation, are all part of the pricing dynamic. They are important factors in the growth of our domestic Chicken business as well, as we continue on a path to develop more value-added chicken products in addition to increasing chicken production in our international locations.","Turning to the Beef segment. In the fourth quarter, we generated $162 million in operating income and a 4.3% return on sales. Volume was up 4%, while price was up nearly 5%. For the fiscal year, operating income was $296 million, with a 2.1% return on sales. Volume for the year was down nearly 2%, while pricing increased 6.6%.","Our beef exports increased, while overall industry exports declined. 2014 will have challenges similar to those we experienced in 2013. And like last year, we'll concentrate on being a best-in-class producer, growing exports, increasing revenue through premium programs and brands, such as Star Ranch Angus, Open Prairie Natural beef, Reuben brand Corned Beef and our Case Ready program. And we'll continue providing our customers with options by adding value to wholesale cuts, such as our closely trimmed subprimals.","Moving on to the Pork segment. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $68 million, with a 4.9% return on sales. Pricing was up 12.6% on a 5.6% decrease in volume. For the fiscal year, operating income was $332 million and return on sales was 6.1%. Price was up approximately 2% on 3.6% fewer pounds.","A ban on ractopamine limited total U.S. exports to Russia and China. We are working with our customers in both countries, especially China, to meet their specific needs. We adjusted by keeping our supply in balance with demand, which accounts for some of our volume decrease. Additionally, we adjusted our mix to increase price realization. The effects of the PED virus started showing up this month, although we are not expecting shortages in our plants, the overall reduced volumes should be favorable for wholesale pricing.","As with Beef, we continued to increase revenue in the Pork segment through product mix and premium programs, such as case-ready pork and the high-quality Chairman's Reserve and Supreme Tender brands.","We think 2014 will be another solid year for the Pork segment, and we will work to maintain and build on our reputation as a best-in-class producer.","In the Prepared Foods segment, we generated $16 million in operating income for the fourth quarter with a 1.8% return on sales. Price was up nearly 4% and volume increased 5.2%. For the fiscal year, Prepared Foods operating income was $101 million and return on sales was 3%. Price was up less than 1% and volume was up almost 2%.","Our Prepared Foods segment is a mix of strong profitable businesses, growth platforms and businesses in the early stages of turnaround and startup. While not in the normalized range, there are numerous factors that led to these results, including conscious decisions we made. Because we view Prepared Foods as a growth vehicle, we have been investing heavily in new product categories and expanding existing categories.","In addition to the frozen breakfast and raw sausage Donnie mentioned, we're entering the smoked dinner meats category as well.","As we've discussed before, we're investing to make a push to expand our highly value-added offerings in all channels. We expect our Houston lunchmeat plant to come back online in December. We have invested in that location to allow us more packaging and mix flexibility because we see it as a longer-term higher-margin play. As we work to become a low-cost, high-quality lunchmeat provider, we expect steady improvement in this business over the year. Although investing in turnarounds and startup businesses, along with MAP spending, have diluted Prepared Foods segment profitability in 2013, we're building a foundation for future growth.","If we added these investments back in, profitability would have been in the historical range. Looking 2 to 3 years out, our model suggests strong returns for the products and categories we're working on now.","In closing, I'd like to thank the Tyson management team for their attention to details, starting with taking care of the customer, taking care of our team members and driving a spirit of continuous improvement. Their enthusiasm to take on new challenges has been very gratifying.","That's the end of our prepared remarks. Candy, we're ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Jim, I just want to congratulate you on your retirement. It is well deserved and we will definitely miss you. Thank you very much for all your help throughout the years. So we will miss you.","James V. Lochner","I appreciate that very much.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Let me just go to some questions as well. Look, Tyson's free cash flow has accelerated over the last couple of quarters to like new levels. So my question is, at these current run rates, are these the current -- is this the current run rate of cash that you expect at these current levels? Or can it even accelerate to new levels? And your share repurchases, clearly, have accelerated in the last quarter. Is that the new run rate of how you're thinking about cash -- deployment of cash for the next year or 2?","Dennis Leatherby","Thanks, Ken. Multipart answer. First, I want to say that yes, we are on a new run rate as we continue to grow earnings like we said back half times 2. That would certainly mean more cash flow, and so more options for us to deal with that cash flow. So we want to just reiterate that it's first on growth, CapEx over and above depreciation for our existing businesses, acquisition activity and then returning it back to shareholders. But you're right, cash flow is growing.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. But what about share repurchases? Because I think you did 300, going from 250 -- it was 550 for the year. You're at 300 for the last quarter. I don't know if the 550, 600 is the new run rate on an annual basis that we could start thinking about it. Is that the way to think about it?","Dennis Leatherby","It certainly would be more, Ken. But it depends on what might come in front of it in terms of growth opportunities.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then my second question is when I look at your numbers, I get that you've committed to doubling the back half of 2013 throughout the year, but if I actually take your numbers and use your quantitative guidance, I get a much higher number than what you're saying. I'm not saying that you do not want to be conservative here, but is there something wrong with my math of how I'm doing it? Because the numbers that you're saying with the share count, where it is, plus the Chicken margins being at the higher end or above, Beef being the same, I'm getting to more -- numbers -- at least $0.10, $0.15 ahead of what you're implying on the double. Can you talk to that?","Donnie Smith","Sure, Ken. Like we said, we're off to a good start, particularly in Chicken in this fiscal year, which feels really good. I think the things you can have in mind, we feel good about our top line sales growth. We feel good about our value-added sales growth being in that 6% to 8% range. In Chicken, we are heading into a lower-cost environment. A little bit higher supply, but we also think that will be offset with some, call it, pricing halo effect from really high-priced beef and pork this year. So we like the way that the chicken supply and demand fundamentals are setting up. We'll continue to get some tailwinds from grain, moving on through our Q1 and then into Q2. And as Jim said in his comments, we've done a great job with our quality service and innovation, and we think that will pay off in our pricing conversations with our customers because they view our product offering as one that has additional value because of those attributes. If you look at Beef and Pork, it looks like to me that the supply dynamic is set up next year or 2014 to about like 2013. Jim talked about Prepared Foods, certainly, with Houston coming on -- our new technology coming on in December. We expect that business, our lunchmeat business, to get better through the year. So that has the potential to be additive. In our international business, Mexico has been a little difficult for us in the pricing so far this quarter. But that deal seems to be -- the market seems to be firming up a little bit. The supply seems to be -- giving us an opportunity to get our pricing up on top of us a little bit. China is still -- we're still getting better in China as we get more of our housing, in our company-controlled housing, our costs will get better. So as we ramp through the year, we anticipate that part of our business being profitable by the tail end of the year. So it feels like to us we've got some early tailwinds and some possibilities to gain momentum through the year. So that's how we feel about it.","Operator","Next question, Brett Hundley of BB&T Capital Markets.","Brett M. Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Jim, let me offer my congratulations as well. If I can even offer congratulations on your retirement, I don't know if you can call it that. It sounds like they're going to hold on to you pretty well, but congratulations.","James V. Lochner","Yes. We'll be [indiscernible] to that though, don't worry. But thank you.","Brett M. Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I wanted to start with Pork. Jim, I thought your comment was very interesting on not expecting shortages at company plants related to PED. And I wanted to work through some of my calculations with you and see maybe if this is how you're thinking about it or just to get further clarity. But when we heard about PED expanding like it has been in North Carolina, we were thinking maybe anywhere from a 3% to 5% potential reduction in headcount, call it, February through April, May, June kind of a thing. However, we're also noticing increased weights, increased litter rates, increased gilt retention. We think there could be stronger demand in periods going forward, potentially related to demand from Asia for U.S. product. And so I had thought that we could see some offsets there. But I just want to get a, to see if you agree with that; but b, what you're really talking about when you state that you don't expect big reductions at your plants.","James V. Lochner","Let me start with some of the swine veterinarians that we've talked to around the country, would suggest that about 10% of the sows in the U.S., somewhere a little -- on the 550 -- 550,000 zone might be impacted. And generally, it's thought it might impact 10% productivity on the effective herd. So that quickly equates to about a potential on an annualized basis of 1%. So the key will be just kind of at what points and what locations. But it seems that Oklahoma and North Carolina zones were early impacted, haven't heard yet. Although I'm sure that we expect to see some impact, the upper Midwest and the Corn Belt. But again, if I base it on that, we kind of expect to see that 1% impact could be greater, but we also -- it would maybe just negate the productivity increases we've been seeing. And we -- and I agree with you, I think particularly on the wholesale pricing side that I think the export demand in total will probably start to increase for 2014. And so a combination of containment of potential increases in pounds produced, with exports should be fairly favorable for wholesale pricing increases.","Brett M. Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay, I appreciate that. And then my follow-up is related to pork, but it has implications for other proteins. And certainly, Donnie, you talked about the picture and the outlook for chicken, and I certainly agree with you on the demand side. My only worry would be on supplies potentially building greater than expected. But back to the demand side, we've noticed some recent featuring of Pork items at QSR. And a lot of times, the featuring tends to be temporary. Do you worry at all that this recent activity shows some consumer fatigue surrounding all the chicken featuring that's been done? Or how do you view the demand dynamics going forward through fiscal '14? I appreciate it.","Donnie Smith","Sure. Yes. Well, it\u2019s great to have a diversified portfolio because we can take advantage of whatever they're featuring. But here's how we view it: Beef 50s and Beef 90s look like they're going to have another really, really strong year. So if you're a QSR, in the last couple of years, you've been running chicken promotions, it's going to be really hard to comp a chicken promotion with a beef promotion. So -- and that's more likely than not, that would dominate the feature activity. So the great thing about chicken is it carries a lot of flavors, shapes and forms, and I don't see any fatigue at all at QSR for chicken. So here's kind of the way we think about it: So beef and pork prices ought to be pretty high, beef prices particularly, which sets up a pretty good halo in chicken, relatively speaking is a very good value when compared to those high beef prices. So we continue to think you'll see a demand shift. In some of the numbers that we talked about, you got chicken pounds up 2% on 7% increase in pricing year-over-year. And what we saw was the beef pounds kind of struggled a little bit as they reached some pricing elasticity. Now the key thing about us in the beef and pork deal has been around where the animals are. And we're very well positioned from a supply base around a lot of the feedlots -- that are high-volume, high-capacity feedlots. So we like the way our Beef business is set up this year. We view it a lot like we did last year. Did that help?","Brett M. Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Very much so.","Operator","Next question is from Farha Aslam of Stephens.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Jim, congratulations on a very, very successful career.","James V. Lochner","Thank you.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And my first question is on Chicken, Donnie, you had mentioned that you're really managing Tyson's U.S. business for earnings consistency, as well as growth. Could you just highlight how Tyson approaches Chicken that will -- might help the company manage through the ups and downs of the commodity volatility, better than possibly the rest of the industry?","Donnie Smith","Sure, Farha, thanks. A couple of principles that are really important to us is maintaining a manageable minimum of inventory and then the second thing is we never want to get long chicken. We all -- we don't want an excess supply. So our buy versus grow strategy plays into part there. As we look back a couple of years ago, it seemed apparent to us that we needed to use our pricing structure as well, as a way to manage the commodity volatility. Though when you think about our business, we're probably not going to hit the highs during the summer high peaks in the commodity markets. We're certainly not going to hit the lows during the wintertime dips in the commodity markets. And we're going to have a more consistent profile because our pricing profiles are a bit different. In the last couple of years, we've moved about half of our pricing contracts to adjust to either the grain costs or the parts markets. And what that would allow us to do is protect our dollar margins and give us a more stable return in up or down grain markets. That's really our focus, is to present to our shareholders a stable return, I'm going to say almost regardless of what the commodity markets are doing.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then on Beef, there's considerable concern right now about the tight supply of cattle and notably commodity beef margins just registering negative. Does that mean Tyson's Beef division is running red right now? Or is there programs that you have that can help you outperform that commodity average?","James V. Lochner","Well, let me answer that by saying we are not red right now. They've compressed. But as I said in my remarks and before, we put a tremendous amount of focus on really the -- beating the revenue components through mix, through pricing, through yield, through a variety of other product management. And then we know one thing, the market won't let us buy cattle any cheaper than the market. So we put all our focus on driving revenue and staying in position. We really kind of watch very carefully what the forward demand for cattle -- or excuse me, what the forward supply for cattle availability are and we keep our product sales in reasonably good alignment with that, so that we can manage margins by plant as best we can. And again, all our focus has always been on the execution components within our control. So that's really kind of the play. If you look forward, I think '14 will be very similar to '13, but with a gradual decline in some periods, where the supply is very adequate and some periods where the supply is a little bit more challenging. And that's the essence of margin management, to really see what's out in front of you and make your adjustments accordingly.","Operator","Next question is Akshay Jagdale of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Congratulations, Jim. Hopefully, you're still going to be teaching some classes that maybe someday we can join. But congratulations on a great career.","James V. Lochner","I'm teaching a long time. I plan on continuing to do so. So...","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. Well, I wanted to talk a little bit about Chicken, if I may. So in the fourth quarter, at one point, I don't know if it was last quarter or the quarter before, we expected margins to be at that high end. Can you just talk a little bit about what happened this quarter? I'm having a hard time understanding why margins were down sequentially, perhaps it was Mexico and China. So maybe you can tell us how the U.S. business did. Can you just help me understand that? Why were margins down as much as they were sequentially?","Donnie Smith","Yes, that was it was, Akshay. It was China and Mexico. With the commodity markets -- I think what happened is maybe the supply rebounded in Central and Southern Mexico perhaps a little quicker than what others expected and certainly did more than what we expected. And so we faced some pretty cheap commodity markets down in the Mexico City area. And that hurt our Mexican numbers, too. We continue to struggle through the rebound in the markets in China. What happened in the spring, there was evidently a lot of chicken that went into the freezer in China. And that's been coming out. And it's kept the commodity markets softer than what we thought they would be. Our volume rebound -- we're probably around maybe back to 80% of our pre-AI volume. But the markets haven't responded like we thought we would. And we think that has to do with some excess inventory. So domestic business is running great. And you have to remember, too, that there's a significant -- well, I'll say significant, there's about an 8 week or so lag in the commodity costs. And so we still had really, really high grain prices into mid-August. In the last half of August and then September, we started taking a little truck grain in, which is -- we hedged it up. It was typically cheaper. But it was really like the second week of September before we really got into heavy truck grain. Well, by then, you're really looking at mid-Q1 of FY '14 for a cost drop. And so it was really the way the commodity market -- the futures market looked cheap, the basis levels looked high, but that drop really gets shoved in to Q1 and Q2 of '14 in your Chicken cost structure. Does that make sense?","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. It makes sense. But -- so can you give us like a -- I think you had said for fiscal '13, you'd get 80% of the $100 million in losses back, right? So there was going to be an $80 million improvement, if I may, in international? So I guess, we didn't end up with that number. The only reason I'm asking is...","Donnie Smith","You're right, Akshay. We only got $45 million. And that's part of the -- that and coupled with what happened in Mexico is the money you're looking for in Q4.","Dennis Leatherby","Both China and Mexico.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes. So what's the expectation embedded into '14 for international, on the same operating income number?","Donnie Smith","Yes, we're -- we should get consistently better quarter after quarter, but China probably won't reach profitability until our Q4.","Dennis Leatherby","But overall, it will be profitable for the year, slightly [ph].","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you said Chicken's off to a good start. I mean, can you help me understand what a good start means for you in terms of operating margin? That would be helpful. And then I just have a follow-up on supply.","Dennis Leatherby","No. Other than saying, we're off to a good start, I really can't give you any more help than that, Akshay. We're off to a good start.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on supply, you increased your supply estimate for '14, 3% to 4%, I mean, why did you do that? Have you seen something in the pullet placement numbers? Or what's the reason for the higher supply? And why doesn't that impact your margin guidance negatively?","Dennis Leatherby","Okay. So head up a little bit. You're right, the pullet supply for '14, it is what it is. But we think weights. We're particularly heavy this quarter, and we think weights are going to continue to increase next year, driven, of course, by cheaper grain costs. The reason it's not impacting our results negatively is that we've planned for it. And our buy versus grow strategy will have us buying cheaper raw materials and then upgrading those into value-added sales. And that's our model.","James V. Lochner","The other thing you have to really look at, Akshay, is Oct, Nov, Dec period here, year-over-year is up, and we're talking about fiscal. So you're starting with this period with a fairly high increase in pounds. So you've got to get yourself adjusted to the fiscal versus the calendar as well.","Operator","And next question is Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jim, congrats as well. I hope this doesn't mean you've gone vegan on us here.","James V. Lochner","Let me put the probability of that happening, it's 0% to negative 100%.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Good, good. Well, I appreciate your comments on packaged meats and some of the opportunities you have to turn that business around. But based on your comments from around a year ago, maybe a turnaround has taken slightly longer than you initially","[Audio Gap]","a different set of categories to compete in. So I guess, I'm just curious, if the turnaround eventually doesn't work the way you hope, what would it take for you to potentially turn to some acquisitions, right, to get some brands that are maybe more established in some categories, call it, lunchmeats, whatnot, in order to kind of solidify and accelerate your growth? I mean, Ken Zaslow, made a good point I thought, you have a lot of cash and you're generating even more cash every year. So I'm just curious about that sort of make or buy proposition in packaged meats.","Donnie Smith","Certainly, and this is Donnie. We absolutely have our eye on multiple ways to grow our Prepared Foods business. With our cash flow, it's obvious that acquisitions are within our view. We did a couple of small acquisitions last year to try to fill in some gaps. And we obviously have capacity and options now with our great balance sheet to be more aggressive if we need to, if there's a right fit. Dennis and I have done -- have talked a lot over the last couple of years about how we view acquisitions. We approach them fairly clinically. We want to make sure that an acquisition can be accretive to our ROIC within a fairly short and reasonable period of time. We try to target something that can -- if our total ROIC is going to be at 20% or better, we want to target an acquisition that can get there within a 2- or 3-year time period, that type of thing. And so that's the math we use whenever we're looking at an acquisition target. But we're also committed with our current facilities to continue to improve. I'm extremely confident that the moves we're making, particularly in our lunchmeat business, will have us very well positioned by, say, this time next year in our lunchmeat business. And again, our Prepared Foods business is a broad range of categories. Some of those businesses are doing very, very well with great margins, and we'll continue to drive those. They're very important to the customer targets that they focus on. So we feel really good about our Prepared Foods business. And if you noticed in our organizational changes, we're doubling down. We've got great talent against our Prepared Foods segment, and we're going to put a lot of focus on Prepared Foods going forward. Jim, you want to add anything?","James V. Lochner","Yes. The only thing I'd add is we -- as I said in my remarks, we made a lot of conscious decisions. And I think some people sometimes underestimate the startup cost and investment in G&A, putting the right organizational structures, the MAP spend. They don't accrete earnings right away. You've got to bet on them going forward. So that's part of what we saw on the dilution this year and particularly this quarter, as we look at multiple categories. We've got our eye on a lot of things, and this area has a lot of potential and we put a lot of manpower and good talent around it.","Dennis Leatherby","Ken, this is Dennis. I'd just add that Prepared Foods, were it not for all these turnaround expenses and startups, it would have generated about a 4.5% return on sales, which is, as you know, within our range. We think next year, we're going to continue to improve the business. And the real fruits of this labor will come in '15 and beyond as these businesses build out and fill out, I think they'll be nicely profitable.","Operator","Next question, Tim Ramey of D.A. Davidson.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And let me add my great wishes to Jim. I just threw open my 1988 initiation on IBP, and he was there, jumpy, fidgety, had this demeanor of a commodities trader, superbright, and nothing's changed really. So congratulations, Jim. It's been fun to be hanging around you for 25 years. That could have been due to working for Bob Peterson at the time though. I'm not sure.","James V. Lochner","I did have hair in 1988, I think.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","That's true. So you made a comment, Donnie, on profitability in the fourth quarter by -- in China, fourth quarter of '14. But I mean, you featured China kind of right up there in your first paragraph. And so I'd love to have you kind of dream a little bit more publicly about what that might look like in '15 and '16, just to kind of re-satiate our appetites on the outlook on that one.","Donnie Smith","So the tough thing about FY '13 was the financial impact on our business. We were -- about half of our production is in company-owned -- or company-controlled birds now. And our cost structure in those houses is really effective. So we can't get our land-use rights and can't get these farms built fast enough for our taste. And we're doing pretty good. Our initial plan, if you go back maybe 2, 2.5 years ago was to be completely built out by FY '14, by the end of FY '14. We're probably going to miss that by a few weeks. But still, the vast preponderance of our chickens will be in company-controlled housing. So I guess, it's a cost advantage and the uses of marketing advantage. The thing we have seen is the importance of the supply chain that we're developing. And what we've seen in '13, although it's not been great for us financially, it has validated our business model. So we think having a supply chain that is from pullet to plate is very consistent with a lot of cost controls and a lot of bio-security controls is going to be very good for us in '15 and beyond. So what we would see is going into '15, we'd have an advantaged cost structure, we'd have a very unique and very differentiated selling story. And I tell you, I think we've got a great opportunity. Yes, we deal with foodservice QSRs and that kind of thing, but we have a great retail offering in China as well. And we've got the ability to take the Tyson brand across more areas of China and to expand that geographically and have a really strong branded presence. Because as you well know, Tyson Foods has meant trusted food and great quality for years and years in America. We want to bring that as well to China. So we're very optimistic about what happens in '16 and beyond and really looking forward to getting there.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And just to kind of restate the focus on food safety and bringing it all in-house, leads you to believe that pricing will be such that you can charge premium prices, as well as get your cost under control. I think you originally said that it could have twice the margins of the domestic business. Is that still kind of roughly your thought process?","Donnie Smith","Absolutely, in a mature complex. We intend to grow China pretty aggressively. And so we may have 2 mature complexes that are at those levels of margins, and then we may have an immature complex or partnership or that kind of thing that's still coming onstream that would be in the mix as well. But when these complexes get full, just like there's U.S. complex today, we're still confident that they'll carry a very aggressive margin structure about twice of what we see here.","Operator","Next question is Michael Piken of Cleveland Research.","Michael Piken","Congratulations, Jim, on your retirement. Just wanted to make sure that -- on that Beef side, a couple of quick questions. You guys have talked about a 2% to 3% decline in fed cattle supplies. And if we look at USDA's numbers, which are more on a pounds basis, they're kind of suggesting beef production for calendar '14 will be down more like 6%. Was that 2% to 3% more for the cattle supplies in your area? Or is that sort of an industry-wide outlook? And then secondarily, if production is really down about 6%, do you think that the industry as a whole might need to take down another packing plant?","James V. Lochner","Let me -- I saw the USDA pounds estimate, you have to factor in the probability of beef cattle slaughter being down appreciably. We're thinking more in the fed steer and heifer, was what we referenced because we don't participate in the other category on the process side, so we don't process cows. And I'm just really basing that off of looking at the prior year calf crops on '11, '12 and '13. And being in that 2% last year, in our fiscal year '13 versus '12, we were down 1.5%. So we're thinking that trajectory is down. If heifer retention starts to accelerate, which it hasn't shown signs of yet, that number changes. If heifer retention doesn't happen, that number could actually lessen. So we're just really basing everything always off the calf crop going forward. And to answer your question, yes, as supply is based on the beef cow and the dairy cow herd and the calf crop going forward, yes, we'll still have overcapacity. There is probably some peripheral plants outside the feeding zones that will struggle. Again, our plant's set right where the bulk of cattle feeding occurs. And so we're fairly comfortable, and we pay very close attention always to the forward supplies and try to keep ourselves in very good balance.","Michael Piken","Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up on that, I know you had mentioned earlier in Farha's question that you guys are profitable kind of right now, and this is typically this quarter and into your second fiscal quarter the weaker time for beef. I mean, if you guys are sort of profitable now when the industry margins are lower, like, I guess, could you explain sort of why you think your margins could potentially be below your normalized range?","James V. Lochner","Currently, now we expect -- we're -- like Q2 normally would be the tougher quarter. We are fairly pleased as we look back at '13. And we sat here a year ago during the Oct, Nov, Dec period and then went into the Jan, Feb, March period, and we felt like we were struggling. But we came back strong in our last 2 quarters, and I expect pretty much a repeat of that. If we continue our emphasis on controllables, which I'm very pleased that the team there is extremely focused on those, it could be better than that. But we're factoring in some periods that we think that the cattle will be a little bit tighter, and the industry margins as a whole could compress. But we certainly think there's times that they can expand. So that's why really we said we think '14 will be very similar, with the similar challenges that we had in '13. That's the way we look at it.","Operator","Next question is from Tim Tiberio of Miller Tabak.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Jim, I want to add my best wishes to you.","James V. Lochner","I appreciate that. Thank you.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","All right. And then just 2 very quick questions on your outlook for 2014. Do you feel that the country of origin labeling, that the supply chain has fairly well adjusted to that event? And are the potential for higher costs reflected in your outlook for the Prepared Foods segment in 2014?","James V. Lochner","Let me address country of origin labeling. Yes, we factored that in. And maybe that will change. There's still an opportunity for the farm bill or adjustments to take care of that. If it doesn't, we fully adjust. And we're in compliance today. We made the adjustments we need to. And looking forward on this -- on the long-range supply activity to accommodate that. And then I'm not following your second question. Was that jumping into the Prepared Foods segment or related to cattle or beef?","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Well, I guess, cattle and beef and whether you think that you've got a good handle on the cost structure. Obviously, you're bringing in more feeder cattle from Canada to the U.S. So just wanted to get a sense if you feel like the supply chain is prepared for that impact? And it sounds like that is the case.","James V. Lochner","Yes. Totally, definitely, and we did announce that we would curtail, at least for a while, any direct importation of Canadian cattle. And we can always reevaluate that and adjust our SKU count accordingly. But in the interim, we're going to try to simplify the product mix out there. But as a whole, I'd say that the adjustment has happened. And we'll just have to see, and that does take some supply potentially out of the U.S. beef.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just secondly, on the international outlook, does your outlook include the potential for increased supply in Brazil, as soy milk prices come down? There's obviously the potential for production in that country to grow. They are obviously a large competitor in the export markets. Just want to get your thoughts with regards to Brazil.","James V. Lochner","As beef -- yes, as Brazil imports -- excuse me, exports more beef to more countries and has an increase of supply, that puts a little more pressure on the manufacturing meat. It might indirectly work, where we see more 90 or imported lean beef coming into the U.S. that could potentially offset some of the cow slaughter reduction that's there. So those are always balances that you're walking -- watching very carefully, simply because they do impact raw material costs, they impact the pounds and they impact the utilization of particularly manufacturing beef. And that's why it is a global market. U.S. beef and Brazilian beef don't necessarily compete in like markets for like causes and uses, but they are all in that balance. So, thank you.","Donnie Smith","And by the way, on the Chicken side, very much intend to grow our business in Brazil, not just in terms of the number of heads processed, but also in our value-added offerings, so very much a growth vehicle there.","Operator","And our last question comes from Rachel Nabatian of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Rachel Nabatian","First off, I just wanted to say congratulations to Jim. Now your Beef results came in a little better than we were expecting. So I was just wondering if you got a short-term benefit on cattle bidding from the USDA shutdown. And this is particularly when the outlook and the conditions were weak. And then I also wanted to know if the LFTB issues, have those turned back into a positive? And are you now monetizing LFTB again?","James V. Lochner","Let me start with -- no, we did not have any benefit. We just used alternative pricing mechanisms. We gave both buyers and sellers alternatives. If they didn't want to use the alternative formulas, non-USDA reported markets skilled [ph] negotiated, did that on beef and pork as well; did create some disruption for a period of time, but both buyers and sellers, all did adapt and we used traditional or old market reports or negotiated. So had no -- really no impact from that. Lean, finely textured beef, now the volume is still not utilized anywhere close to the same percentage. And quite clearly, going forward, we and others, will clearly label its presence in ground beef. So that, that issue cannot be attacked again. So that's kind of the play on that. Really, again -- in the margin scheme, that's also probably neutralized itself, now probably it has neutralized itself, and we're not seeing any impact one way or the other from it at this stage.","Donnie Smith","Well, before we go, I want to thank our team members for all you've done to make 2013 such a great year. And I also like to thank our investors for your continued support of Tyson Foods. Hope you'll have a happy Thanksgiving. And, hey, eat some chicken, beef and pork instead of turkey this year, would you? Thanks, everybody.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today's conference.

Those statements are based on our view of the world as we know it now, which could change. I encourage you to look at today's press release for a discussion of the risks that can affect our business.","On today's call is Donnie Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Lochner, Chief Operating Officer; and Dennis Leatherby, Chief Financial Officer. [Operator Instructions] ","I'll now turn the call over to Donnie Smith.","Donnie Smith","Thanks, Jon. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Our second quarter earnings were $0.44 a share compared to $0.42 in the second quarter of 2011. Operating income was $302 million, which was about flat to Q2 last year. Sales were up 3.4% versus Q2 a year ago at $8.3 billion. The Pork segment was again above its normalized range with an 8.4% operating margin. Prepared Foods was near the top end of its normalized range with a 5.5% margin, and our Chicken segment returned to normalized earnings sooner than expected with a 5% return on sales in the second quarter. Beef was challenging again this quarter, finishing around breakeven. And Jim will speak to what happened there in his remarks. ","We're now halfway through what will likely be our third consecutive year of solid earnings. The team is running the business well by focusing on our customers and executing on key performance indicators. We continue improving production efficiencies and management systems, and we're getting a solid return on the capital we've invested in recent years. The work we've done internally is paying off and now, we're beginning to build on that for the long-term success and growth. ","Externally, key economic indicators continue to recover slowly. Consumers' views about current conditions improved in February and spending jumped to its highest level in 7 months, however, consumer confidence pulled back slightly in March. Consumers appear to be cautious about the economy, but still hopeful. The national gasoline price average fell in April from its recent highs of about $3.92 a gallon, to the current average price of about $3.75 a gallon. The energy department, however, still says fuel prices will peak in May at about $4. Taking all these economic indicators into account, we're cautiously optimistic that the worst is over for the food service industry.","Food service dollar sales increased 6% in the first calendar quarter of 2012 versus the same quarter last year. Quick-service restaurant segment continued showing growth, with consumer spending up 3%. Full-service is showing dollar growth, as well with spending up 10%. Again, this is sales growth, driven primarily by inflation, not necessarily volume growth. ","Major restaurant chains are leading the recovery, although it likely continues to be at the expense of independents, which are still struggling. NPD-CREST reports also show a bright spot. Traffic to commercial restaurants increased by 1.7% end this Jan-Feb quarter. This was the strongest gain since the summer of 2007. The major chains realized 4% traffic growth, with growth coming from the QSR segment at 4% and casual dining segment at 1%. Small change were flat and independents continue to lose traffic down 2%.","Of course, Tyson partners with many of the chains that are growing faster than the industry average, providing us an opportunity to outperform the industry in terms of average volume growth. As Technomic pointed out recently, restaurant concepts in any segment of the industry can beat the odds on sales growth but they must offer value, convenience, a differentiation that makes them highly memorable and alignment with what consumers are seeking in away-from-home dining. Our R&D resources have us well positioned to help our customers in those areas. ","There's good news on many of the key menu categories. Morning meal traffic has been up, and servings of breakfast sandwiches that include sausage, bacon, chicken and steak are growing. Chicken nuggets, chicken sandwiches, wings, meatball sandwiches, and bone-in chicken, also a growth during the period. And we're expecting a significant amount of chicken features at food service this summer, especially in the major QSR change. ","Now the retail channel for the 13-week period ending March 31, the Perishable Group reported the volume of fresh meat sold at retail down about 4% versus the same period a year ago, driven by higher retails. Beef pounds were down 9%, ground beef was down 7%, pork was down nearly 3% and chicken was about flat. ROI data show that the bacon and frozen strips and cubes category grew during the 13 weeks ending March 18, but other frozen and refrigerated category volumes declined versus a year ago. Tyson still commands the dominant share in the frozen breaded chicken category, and we grew share in Q2 in the individually frozen segment. ","The Tyson brand is the market leader in value-added poultry and has a track record of driving consistent, profitable growth. Innovative new products to solve problems and deliver values to consumers continue to be the key. Some of the new products we're introducing include Tyson whole grain chicken chunks, and Tyson Stuffed Mini Bread Bowls in the grocery channel, along with Tyson Grilled Chicken Tenderloins in the club store channel. ","Our case-ready beef and pork rib is valued-up proteins by pairing beef, pork and chicken with fresh vegetables, seasonings and sauces to create healthy convenient meal solutions. This product line has seen double-digit growth this year. Turning to our international business, we're making progress on the growth of our operations in China where we're placing an emphasis on food safety, quality and supply chain integrity as we grow that business. Our startup plan in Jiangsu achieved full production on the first shift in April, and we're on plan in regards to our food housing construction plans. Our operations in Brazil aren't at the level we'd like at this point, but we're working on upgrading our mix, getting costs down through automation and filling up our plants. However, we are pleased with the progress and the efficiencies we're gaining as we double shift these plants. ","I'll wrap up by saying that we still believe we have the potential for $2 a share for the year, especially considering the pricing support we should get from overall declining domestic availability. Now, it won't be easy considering beef results in the first half of the year, but beef is rebounding and our other segments continue to do well pertaining another good year. Again, this demonstrates exactly why I continue to believe that our multi-protein, multichannel, multinational business is the right way for Tyson Foods to deliver long-term sustainable earnings. ","I'll now turn it over to Jim for a review of our segment results, followed by Dennis with the financial report.","James V. Lochner","Thanks, Donnie, and good morning, everyone. With $115 million in operating income and a return on sales of 8.4%, the Pork segment, again, performed above its normalized range of 6% to 8%. We have accomplished this by staying focused on operating efficiency, product quality and yields, mix management, customer service and taking care of our team members while moving commodity products up the value chain. The Pork segment is currently experiencing some domestic demand pressure in hams, bellies and trimmings. Exports have remained strong in calendar '12 year-over-year. We do expect to see hog supplies up 1% to 2% year-over-year for the balance of our fiscal year. While our Pork margin performance should remain strong through the second half of the year, we do not expect it to be at the levels we achieved in the first 6 months.","Our Prepared Foods segment, with $44 million in operating income and 5.5% operating margin, again produced returns in the upper end of its 4% to 6% normalized range. These results reflect improvements in pricing and mix. Growing our Prepared Foods business remains a key growth avenue for the company. For example, today, we're opening our state-of-the-art expansion at our Council Bluffs, Iowa pepperoni plant. We will continue to look for opportunities to acquire or build new assets to expand in several other categories or to increase capacity in existing categories.","Recovery in the Chicken segment occurred faster than we expected. As we return to our normalized operating margin range of 5% to 7% in the second quarter, Chicken posted a 5% return on sales with $145 million in operating income after absorbing $65 million in additional feed costs versus Q2 last year. Our team has done a very good job of managing price to cover inputs and we're expecting pricing to remain strong as we have kept our inventories in line. Meanwhile, the industry as a whole has reduced production pounds by 4% to 6% year-over-year. ","To help keep our production balanced, we bought chicken on the open market rather than growing all the birds we needed. We won't grow a bird solely for the part in the highest demand because we have to sell the entire bird. Grow versus buy is a strategy we look at continually based on input costs, revenue demand forecast and the needs of our customers. We've been very methodical in our approach but we can and will add production when long-term demand warrants, and we'll use our locations where the cost of production is most competitive.","In the second half of the year, we expect our Chicken segment to be in the normalized range and we are still on track to meet $125 million operational efficiency target for fiscal '12.","And finally, let's look at the Beef segment, which essentially broke even for the quarter. The fact we are able to come this close to making money in the second quarter demonstrates that we have a strong well-managed business. The team did a good job of executing in the areas they could control and competed well in other areas. In Q1, supply balance was a problem, in Q2, it was the demand issue. Since our last call, the industry appeared to be headed toward a recovery and we briefly returned to normalized margins in late February and early March. Then the unwarranted controversy over lean finely textured beef, temporarily destroyed demand for ground beef and beef in general virtually overnight. This caused a rapid decline of over $120 per head over a 4-week period. Personally, I don't recall a revenue decline that steep. ","Cattle price is corrected, but not at the same rate, which did cause extreme margin compression in March and early April. In a commodity spread business, raw material prices ultimately adjust to the revenue and forward revenue projections and we're seeing that correction occur. Industry slaughter in Q2 versus a year ago was down 6% and Tyson was down more than that, so we gave up market share in an effort to manage our margins. ","We believe the revenue-to-cattle cost relationship has the potential to realign to the normalized profitability as cattle supplies appear to be adequate from May to early fall. Although we're taking a cautious approach to beef demand, other fundamentals would suggest optimism. We're headed into our seasonally strong demand period. The reduced steer and heifer slaughter in our Q2, plus the continued reduction in April, would indicate more-than-anticipated supplies in May and beyond. Some analysts are projecting fed steer and heifer availability to be much higher than originally anticipated in most feeding regions. ","Longer term, it looks like we could be on the initial stages of the herd rebuilding as beef cost slaughter is down and some heifer retention appears to be taking place. This will not impact the remainder of our fiscal '12, but the extent of heifer retention will influence the fed supplies into 2013 and beyond. We have seen the shift to more cattle being fed in a 1,000-head-plus feedlots which is generally favorable to our plant locations. ","In closing, I'd like to thank our team members for staying focused on the long-term objectives of managing total revenue and costs, while also managing through the near-term ups and downs. ","I'll now turn it over to Dennis for the financial report.","Dennis Leatherby","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Donnie mentioned in his remarks, we reported Q2 earnings of $0.44 per share. Return on invested capital for the last 12 months was 14.4%. Capital expenditures were $162 million for the quarter and totaled $344 million for the first 6 months of fiscal 2012. We continue to invest in numerous capital projects for our domestic and foreign operations. These projects will result in improved productive capabilities and drive labor efficiencies, improve yields and sales mix. Our operating cash flow for the first 6 months remains strong at $454 million. Including cash of more than $700 million, net debt was just under $1.5 billion. Total liquidity was $1.7 billion, well above our targeted range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Gross debt remained at $2.2 billion.","Gross debt-to-EBITDA for the last 12 months was 1.4x. On a net debt-to-EBITDA basis, this measure was 1.0x. During the second quarter, we acquired 3.6 million shares for $70 million under our share repurchase program. Over the past 4 quarters, we have repurchased 15.1 million shares since we reactivated this program, representing a reduction of about 4% of our outstanding shares. Over time, we expect to continue repurchasing shares. ","Last week, our board expanded the share repurchase authorization by 35 million shares, increasing the total remaining authorization to just over 42 million shares. Our average diluted shares outstanding for the second quarter was 373 million. The dilutive share effect totaling $5 million for options and $4 million for convertible bonds will fluctuate depending on our stock price performance.","Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 35.3%. So here is an update on the outlook for fiscal 2012. Revenues are expected to approximate $34 billion, driven largely by raw material price increases and continued tight domestic protein availability. We expect net interest expense to be approximately $190 million, down $41 million from fiscal 2011. The effective tax rate should be about 36%. CapEx should be around $800 million to $850 million. This reflects continued spending on improving the efficiency and competitiveness of our domestic and foreign operations, while also continuing to build out our foreign businesses, especially in China. ","In closing, our Q2 results continue to demonstrate that our diversified business model works. We are pleased to see our Chicken business return to its normalized range, while our Pork and Prepared Foods segments continue to operate in or above their normalized rages. Although our Beef segment faced volatile market conditions in a reduction in demand for Beef products from factors out of our control, we delivered solid results as a whole. ","As we have mentioned before, while it is great when all 4 segments are within their normalized ranges, it's not a requirement in order to perform well as a company. We will continue focusing on the areas of our business we control, and remain confident we will provide strong results for a third consecutive year. ","This concludes our prepared remarks, and I'll ask the operator to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Tim Ramey with D.A. Davidson.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Jim, unless I missed it, you gave a little bit of an outlook on how you expected margins to look on every segment but Beef. Did I miss something there or was that an intentional omission?","James V. Lochner","I thought Donnie had actually had it in his remarks, but Beef margins have, in the last couple of weeks, turned nicely. And if I replay it back into Q2, we had those Beef margins turn where the relationship of revenue to cattle costs was back in line kind of through February or mid part of February and early March, and then they really corrected after the LFTB controversy hit where we saw that really rapid decline in Beef wholesale prices. Again, I said that was probably steeper than I can ever recall at $120 a head. Now if we looked forward, with they -- have come back in the last couple of weeks, it took a while for that correction. And we do see adequate supplies because you have to look back. The industry has really processed dramatically fewer animals through -- January through March. That also happened in April. And we also looked back in October through December, we processed considerably fewer. Against my calculation in that first 6 months, we're seeing 700,000 fewer head processed, which tells me that the supply should be very adequate for the balance of this year. And the key will be in margins, if we expect to be able to hold on to this revenue to cattle cost relationship going forward.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Great. And then as a quick housekeeping, Should -- I mean, I'm surprised that the earnings presentation doesn't say $0.45. It looks like we were really $0.415 for the first quarter, I think, or -- anyway, the bottom line is that we rounded down for 2 quarters in a row. Sorry to nitpick on that, but...","Donnie Smith","You're right, Tim. We're being conservative on that.","Operator","Our next question is from Christine McCracken from Cleveland Research.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Nice job on the quarter, especially given everything they keep throwing at you. In any case, Jim, you mentioned on the Beef side that your slaughter volumes were down more than the industry. And it's obviously already at pretty low levels. I'm just wondering, as you look into maybe a little beyond the end of your fiscal year and looking at the retention that we're seeing on the heifer side, are you expecting to be able to manage through that continued kind of decline in slaughter volumes as things maybe tighten up with heifers, and then maybe tighter cattle supplies as you head in fiscal '13?","James V. Lochner","Well, fiscal '13, as you know, fed steer and heifer supply will really -- the base number on that was 2011 calf crop which was still 35.7. We didn't see that decline will be this year's calf crop in 2012. And typically, you roundabout a 2-year lag so about 73%. If heifer retentions, since we usually process about 9.5 million to 10 million heifers, we could see 400,000 to 500,000 come out of the 2013 number. But again, you have to look at the fact that the feeder cattle imports are also running more than they were a year ago. And what we've seen is the shift in because basically the crush has been very negative. So you've seen less cattle being placed in the smaller feedlots, which again is favorable to most of our locations that sit where there's very dense feedlots. So the supply will tighten and then we'll have to see as this calf crop in 2012, how much heifer retention's there. You have seen fewer beef cows processed and you've got a little bit of a conflicting message on the heifer retention when you look at the April on feed number, which actually shows 4% over. So I would expect though that we'll see heifer retentions start to rebound as we go through the year, if we have adequate moisture in those cow states.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","So is it your expectation then that feeder cattle imports will continue to be at these levels, because it looks like the cattle supplies in Mexico and Canada are getting a little tighter?","James V. Lochner","Well, I'm looking at the year-over-year number, which is roughly, in the last 6 months, running about 100,000. And so as their cow herds would decline, obviously, we'd see less, but the feeder cattle price in the U.S. has been very supportive to pull those cows out of Canada and Mexico.","Operator","Our next question is from Heather Jones with BB&T Capital Markets.","Heather L. Jones - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","My question is for Beef and Pork. Since Q1 of your fiscal '10, we've seen Tyson outpace hedgers at just calculation of industry margins by about 15 a head in Pork and 55 to 65 a head in Beef, and there's been about -- there's been an upward bias to your trend. I guess my question is what 2 to 3 factors are most critical in driving that out-performance? And more importantly, do you believe there's an opportunity to widen that further in a significant way, say 5 to 10 a head?","James V. Lochner","Well, you've put me on a spot when you quantitated the second part of that question.","Heather L. Jones - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I was trying to corner you into answering me.","James V. Lochner","I do think there's upside, and that's what we work on everyday because we're looking at how to really value up the mix and then -- in fresh meat, you really have to say that the bulk of those price quotes are on commodity or second value-added raw products. Our whole thrust has always been to try to understand where we can add value to the customers by taking more bone, more trim, more case-ready trim, more retail ready-trimmed sub-primals, and we obviously charge, so we look at a return on labor. The industry will continue to evolve, it has over a long period of time. But with higher freight costs, you're going to see, I think, a more rapid transformation to more value-added raw products. And that's one of the ways that we've done that. I think we will continue to see upside. But the other 3 -- 2 to 3 factors that we really focused on, some of it's location. Our plants do sit where the livestock, quantities are, that gives us a freight advantage on the buy, gives us a shrink advantage for yield. And then we're looking again at -- always our efficiency and how we really manage the mix. And another thing we do is really look at our pricing mechanism, try to get as much on formula, take the least amount of fixed forward selling risk that we can, so there's a variety of things. I know you don't like always the answer, it's simple blocking and tackling on focused on basics. But there's probably over 80 metrics that our teams really look at from a combination of plant efficiency, labor efficiency, yields, mix, value-added mixes, pricing metrics. We index ourselves every way that we possibly can and that's why we drive that differential.","Heather L. Jones - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","The most important takeaway I should take from this is that you do think there's further upside to widen that out-performance?","James V. Lochner","Our goal every quarter and every year is to add to that margin differential on the revenue. Our job, the way we look at our position in life and Beef and Pork is to add as much revenue to the product as we can because we do know that the revenue and the livestock cost will stay in a pretty good correlation for the most part over time, and we want to maximize the revenue to the overall category.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","[indiscernible] reported a nice jump in boneless, skinless breast prices last week and I know some of that's seasonal. But their commentary about breasts was a little bit more constructive than it usually is. And I've heard of some buyers looking for say 100 loads only able to get 60 or so, is this what you're seeing in the boneless market, too? And if so, how sustainable of a trend into the summer do you think it will be?","Donnie Smith","Ken, this is Donnie. It feels like that this firmness will probably continue a little bit longer maybe on even into the summer. The thing we keep our eye on, keep our eye on gas prices, we keep an eye on the hopeful but sluggish economic recovery. And I think that's probably got as much to do with it if anything, and I'm not sure how accurately we can predict that. But I can -- we can predict this. Jim mentioned in his comments our buy versus growth strategy. We've been able to buy -- we balance to the nearest whole bird increment and then buy the parts that we need. A lot of that's been breast meat, the meat's been available. And I think as things firm up, then there may be a little bit less meat available. But frankly, all that was kind of built into our plan as summer demand picked up. So honestly, it's working just like we expected it to and we feel really good about how that's going to play itself out for us this summer.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then sticking with chicken, and forgive me if you addressed this already, but can you talk a little bit about your forward buying on beans. I think the last time you spoke on hedging, you mentioned you were fairly close to the market on grains. But I didn't hear a whole lot about soybean meal and of course, the price of that commodity has risen a lot.","James V. Lochner","Yes, that's great question. The South American production is down versus what we expected it a couple -- 3 months ago. And then another factor in our DDGs, a lot of the ethanol producers are pressed in those DDGs to get the corn oil out, which is going into renewable fuels. And that, of course, once you take the energy out of that it\u2019s a pretty high -- the protein fiber ratio gets to the point that you really don't feed it in simple-stomach diets at near the ratio. So that has caused, I think, an increase in feeding. Meals shot up dramatically. I think futures, I didn\u2019t look this morning, but late last week, they're around 430 a ton. We're about 4 to 5 weeks out, something like that. We stay pretty conservative and we're, by the way, about the same place in corn. And so, we do keep an eye on that. We've got pretty decent bases coverage out through the summer, so we feel pretty good about where we are. And you've got to remember, it looks like we've got a huge new crop coming. Lots of uncertainty yet, but you sure don't want to be too long going into that cliff period where you're going to start bringing a big new crop into the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question is from Christina McGlone with Deutsche Bank.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, Donnie, first question, if Chicken was better than you thought kind of one quarter earlier and achieved normalized margins, why wouldn't it be better than normalized this summer?","Donnie Smith","It could be. There is certainly the possibility that it would. As we look at our year and you look at all of the segments combined, it looks like to us Pork's probably going to end the year at a little better than normalized. Chicken can sure get there, expect it to. Again, the only caution in my comment at all about Chicken is this economic recovery. It looks like to us, slaughter pounds are going to be down about 4% for the year, so the environment is about right. But the demand picture, what's $4 gas going to do to disposable household income and what effect that might be, it could -- might tame it down a little bit at the end. In our press release, we mentioned that Beef ought to be in the range in the fourth quarter, and then our Prepared Foods business will be in the range. So we feel good about how this summer is shaping up for us. It ought to be a strong back half for us.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And a follow-up on Beef. So fourth quarter is normalized even though margins right now appear to be very strong. Was it just that April was so weak that that's why you can't be normalized in the third quarter and how should we think about the fiscal third quarter in Beef for margin?","James V. Lochner","April was bad in the first couple of weeks, before that price of cattle corrected down with that revenue decline, and so that's the only caution on Q3. But in the last couple of weeks, we've been very pleased as that revenue livestock cost spread has widened.","Operator","Your next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wasn't sure, maybe I missed it, but have you actually quantified what you expect feed costs to be up year-over-year this fiscal year if we were to spread or mark everything to market as of today?","Dennis Leatherby","It's in the $250 million to $260 million category. Somewhere -- that'll be a ballpark range. I don't know if we specifically put that in the press release, but it's going to be about that range. Year-to-date it's $285 million.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And you also mentioned in the press release that there's other non-feed costs that were inflationary in the period. Can you just talk a little more about those?","Donnie Smith","Yes, a lot of your animal byproducts, all of that trades off, soybean meal, a lot of ratios, your feed fats, for example, are an energy source. And as corn's trades up and down, so do those sources. So just when you put all that stuff together, you're going to get -- the vast majority of that cost is going to be in corn and soy. But fat, animal byproducts and all of those things can -- will come to play, too, because they all feed off those 2 markets.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And you guys have been speaking a bit more about as the turnaround restructuring story of Tyson is clearly full force and we\u2019re talking a little bit more about growth opportunities in the future, you spend more time talking about both the international opportunity and the value-add opportunity. I was wondering if you were prepared to maybe put some more numbers around, for example, accretion potential in your China expansion or how you think things like the new additions in Prepared Foods that you guys mentioned today may ultimately add to earnings? Just a little more color around the real earnings opportunity there as we start to think longer-term?","Donnie Smith","That's a great point. Obviously, our international and value-added segments are intended to be the acceleration for our growth, a little bit on China. Our model there is really around company-owned, company-controlled live production and food safety and quality and supply chain integrity. I think we said in the last quarter that by 2014, we'll be at about 3 million head a week there, which, hey, is less than 10%, I guess, of what we're doing in the U.S. But still that'll be the equivalent of 3 pretty decent sized U.S. complexes. We are seeing our entrants into those markets, not only in the Food Service but also at retail. We have Tyson-branded chicken at retail to-date which is small. These plants are just start ups and we're just getting started, but so far so good. In value-added, whether it's poultry or Prepared Foods, we see a lot of opportunity. We've done a lot in the last, really, a couple of years. As you mentioned, our quality, our service, and our innovation are really driving customer loyalty and we're getting paid for it. And as our customers continue to struggle in this economy to find ways to drive traffic to their store or to their restaurant, they're looking to us for that new product innovation and leadership, a greater presence in value-added chicken, whether it's breaded or non-cooked. It's certainly in our future and there's lots of opportunity for us in Prepared Foods and all of the categories. We've made great strides in the last couple of quarters in our lunchmeat business. We've got great opportunities there. We did all for a right brand dinner sausage in the marketplace, off to a good start there. We've got a new pepperoni plant and our folks are out currently very aggressively selling that product. And so we've got tons of potential. It's a little bit too early, I think, to start getting into a whole lot of detail specifically about what each one of those would do to earnings, but the potential's there and you've certainly read us correctly that we're going to be aggressively growing our business.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just last thing, a little bit more noise about what Russia's WTO accession might mean. Can you just give a view on what you think that might mean for exports of Pork and Chicken in particular?","James V. Lochner","Russia does have a goal set, this is Jim, on trying to get self-sufficient in both Poultry and Pork production. They won't be able to get quite caught up in Beef. But as of late, they've been strong importers of U.S. Beef and U.S. Pork. So if they get into WTO, I don't look at that -- that's all upside is the way I look at it. But the key thing on what -- we always watch world production numbers and try to make sure that we're optimizing our sales relative to what's going on in the world and search for the highest revenue component that we can find.","Operator","Our next question is from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I want to follow up a little bit on Beef. So I noticed that your supply projection for your fiscal year for steer fed cattle supplies is down from what it was previously. I'm guessing that's because of what you've seen so far this year, and that just means that they'll be more available in your next fiscal year. Can you talk a little bit about that, Jim?","James V. Lochner","Certainly can. If we look at our fiscal year, we were projecting in the 1% to 2%. And if you look again at our first 7 months of our fiscal year, we're down just short of 699,000 head year-over-year, and I didn't adjust for any difference in days on that. Which would imply that we should have more cattle available at the back half, but the key is demand is very fragile to all of this supply. So I don't expect that and we're watching it very carefully ourselves, that we don't push more meat on the market than the market can absorb. We try to make sure that we hold prices as best we can, which would suggest that we'll push cattle past our fiscal year into our first quarter of 2013. And the beauty of Beef and the supply chain is you do have a number of options in the way that you feed and manage them to try to hit different marketing windows. And I'm thinking that we'll see more cattle pushed out into 2013. The key number, going forward again, is what is 2012 calf crop that's 2014 supply. So we'll buffer out as best we can and we're looking at that on a continual basis as well. But it is very interesting that we process that many fewer head in the first 7 months of our fiscal year.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So Jim, there's obviously a lot of negative headlines on Beef as you know. And it seems like, at least from the investor side, there's concerns about '13. Now you've said fiscal '13, you don't expect supplies to be a major issue. Can you -- I mean, when would you be sort of comfortable enough to say something about margins for fiscal '13? I mean, I know it's a dynamic situation, but assuming demand's relatively stable, shouldn't we have a pretty good environment for Beef margins in '13?","James V. Lochner","I thought we should have in '12, but it didn't work out that way in Q1 and Q2. So we had a couple of strange issues, one on last -- on Q1, the demand pushed for high-quality cattle, pushed that spread up. And then in Q2, when you have this much demand destruction for an unwarranted publicity on beef and it was surprising how much that put pressure on ground Beef and trim and then the rest of the cuts. But absent any of those, and I don't foresee anything more happening on Beef on the negative side from a demand standpoint other than basically the normal economic factors, and the fact that I think we could push a few more fed steers and heifers out in front of us. 2013 could be a very decent year. I'm more concerned about the out front year 2014, particularly with this year's calf crop and the cowherd that was down almost 1 million heads last year. So that's the concern, and then how much heifer retention will occur, between now and then will take fed steers and heifers up. So we've got a lot of moving parts to call before we can get too far out front on calling what we think will happen in 2013.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just on Chicken, if I may, just following up on some earlier question. So has profitability been better each month throughout this year? I mean, has it sort of been moving up pretty consistently?","Dennis Leatherby","Yes. I'm trying to think real quick...","James V. Lochner","Yes. [indiscernible] Again, it's improved every month.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right. So then just -- I mean, you\u2019ll caution, you mentioned, in terms of the possibility of margins being above normal at some point this year. Your caution is just on demand, right? But, let's say, demand is relatively stable to even up over the next 6 months, I mean, what kind of potential does Chicken have?","Donnie Smith","You ought to feel good about it. It's hard to say what this good demand mean and that kind of thing, right? So I'm going to say we have the potential as the environment stands today to end the year in the range in Chicken. And so what that's going to mean is a strong back half. We had a 1.5 or so for Q1. We've got a 5 for Q2, so do the math. We've got to be well up into the upside of the range later. We're facing some -- the possibilities of some pretty strong QSR chicken promotions this summer. We think that's going to be advantageous to us. So hey, my cautionary note is what, if anything, is $4 gas going to do and that kind of thing. But if that stuff doesn't happen, we're positioned very well for the year.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And just one last one on Chicken more sort of medium to long-term. One of your competitors always has made a bet on sort of exporting the back half of the Chicken, while it seems like your positioned well even if some of the demand in the U.S. increases on dark meat, I mean it seems like your investing to add value to the back half of the Chicken, even in the U.S. I mean, is that -- are you taking a bet either way, I mean -- or are you going and you're just increasing flexibility in your plans to take advantage of either situation? I mean, just trying to clarify.","Donnie Smith","Well yes, we're taking a bet. And we see there's an opportunity domestically to grow dark meat sales in lots of forms. In areas that have had a traditional Beef and Pork meat bought, whether it's a sausage, pepperoni, et cetera, et cetera. Dark meat chicken has a play there in lunchmeat, there's obviously great opportunity there. So yes, we are definitely moving value-added dark meat domestically and internationally, too. I mean, we keep an eye on all those markets constantly. We have a very diverse selling program and lots of different geographies. And we think that gives us the best opportunity to drive the best whole bird return for every bird we grow.","Operator","Our next question is from Farha Aslam with Stephens.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I have a question on the retail market. From what we see in our data, retailers are really keeping the price of particularly Pork and Beef exceptionally high and really expanding out those retail margins, and that's pressuring profitability of the protein producers. And could you talk about what you expect demand going forward at retail if you expect pricing to moderate at all this summer? And how you expect those margins for processors and yourself in Pork and Beef to progress as the summer goes by?","Donnie Smith","You're right. Higher retails have dropped volume. As I mentioned a little earlier in the call, Beef down 9%. Ground Beef, of course, a lot of that had to do with LFTB was down 7%, Pork down 3%, Chicken flat. Frankly don't expect a whole lot of change. We seem to be seeing a little bit of resistance at a composite cut out of about 90 plus. So that may stem some pricing. But as for us, we have all that factored in and the margins that we're talking about and feel pretty good that at the end of the day, we're going to be able to deliver above what we're saying.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","You still think $2 is possible even with a tough retail environment?","Donnie Smith","We've got work to do. But yes, it's possible.","James V. Lochner","One comment on retail is that last year, as those wholesale prices inflated and they lagged pushing retail, this year they're trying to get ahead of it. It's as simple as the market's doing its job. And the retailer has costs, too, and they have margin expectations. So they're passing on the wholesale prices, and if it decreases pounds then it adjust wholesale prices. I mean, that's the way the market works.","Donnie Smith","Yes, the biggest pounds are down in the categories where we spread business. So we adjust to that.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Do you expect livestocks in terms of cattle and hog prices to reflect that retail demand over the back half of your year?","Donnie Smith","Repeat your question?","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","So the back half of the year, given where cattle prices are and hog prices are, you think you can make your target margins and hit $2 despite the tough retail pricing environment?","Donnie Smith","Yes. Yes.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just my second question is you've announced an increase in your share repurchase program, could you just share with us how aggressively you plan to execute that program and if you have any time horizons in mind for share repurchase?","Donnie Smith","The reason we increased the authorization is we were down to 7 million shares, and we acquired 15 million over the last 12 months so we needed to increase the authorization. As far as the rate of purchases, that really isn't going to change too much. We're focused on our liquidity. We need a lot of liquidity in our business. And we also have a couple of big maturities coming up in the next 2 years. So with $1.7 billion in liquidity, that's more than sufficient to cover those maturities and run our business well. So we'll just -- we'll let our liquidity determine how much we buy each quarter and we'll respond accordingly.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. So no time horizon that you've established?","Dennis Leatherby","No.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I think everything has been asked and more. So about the 2, I guess, pieces of debt that are coming due, can you give us the timing on that? And what do you think that might do to your interest expense? Do you expect to refinance? Can we look at fiscal '13 interest expense as going lower right now?","Dennis Leatherby","Fiscal '13 interest expense will be pretty much the same. There were -- 2 maturities or actually in the early part of fiscal 2014 so the big drop will come mostly -- a big jump will occur in '14 and then in '15, it'll be a really big jump of more than $100 million. In terms of how we're going to handle it, at some point in the future, we'll fund part of it with a bond offering or some other kind of capital raise. I'm not sure when we're going to do that since we have enough liquidity today.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","All right. It just seems like the way I model it, you're going to have a lot of cash flow building up on your balance sheet -- a lot of cash building up, and if you're going to wait all the way until '14. So getting back to Farha's question, is there any sense of urgency to -- is there any thought anyway to increasing the share repurchase authorization beyond $35 million?","Dennis Leatherby","No, at this point, no. But hey, love having the options that great cash flow gives you. We've announced, I think, very recently, our expansion in Sedalia, Missouri. We've spent about just something shy of $50 million in Council Bluffs on our pepperoni dry sausage plant. We've got great opportunity within our business to continue to grow and get into new categories. And it gives us great resources to be able to grow our business. Now we've also got great options in buying back stock, debt reductions, acquisitions when they come about, all those type of things. So what we're trying to do is give ourselves options and you can see that those options are piling up.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can I ask one follow-up. You mentioned lunchmeat and sausage, there is a pure play domestic lunchmeat and sausage company that's going to have an analyst day coming up. Why get into lunchmeat and sausage now? You've been in it before, why the strategic push now?","Donnie Smith","Well, we have been for quite some time. I mean, when IBP bought up all of the businesses that made up Foodbrands America, a lot of those businesses, several plants were lunchmeat and sausage. It's a good business, a good category. We have in our lunchmeat business, we've not performed like we should. Our team has done a great job getting that business turned around and getting our cost structure right. And we found that we can compete in that category. We're good at it. Our customers depend on us. We're a pretty large private label lunchmeat supplier today and sell a lot of own-brand lunchmeat, deli meats, that type of thing. So we've been in it, we're pretty good at it and we're going to grow it.","Operator","Your next question is from Ken Zaslow with BMO.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So obviously, the fiscal year is an arbitrary date. Pretty much everybody has different dates. But if I look at your guidance or your implied guidance, your run rate is much above the $2 run rate, right? Because you're -- the first half of the year is below that. Is there anything that takes you off that run rate above the $2 number beyond 2012 and 2013?","Donnie Smith","No, not really.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, that's what I thought. The second question I have is in terms of the Chicken margin structure. This year it's $125 million in savings. What are you guys looking for in terms of your next leg of savings into 2013 and beyond? Is there more programs then being instituted with the CapEx funding? Can you talk about that?","Donnie Smith","A little early yet. Our folks will begin planning the 2000 fiscal year late this month, early June. And we will have our savings projections and those types of things in the August, September time period. We always asked our businesses to have that in front of us before we begin the fiscal year. So you\u2019re about a quarter early. We do see potential down the road, but it's a little bit too early to quantify.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","But we should expect to see another -- some sort of program into 2013 of...","Donnie Smith","Every segment of our business, we are always looking for ways to maximize our operating efficiencies and continue to drive our business performance through executional excellence.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And just final question, you don't consider this year a good operating environment year or do you?","Donnie Smith","No. No. I mean, we -- let's just take a segment. Take Chicken, for example, I mean, last year it probably absorbed 800-plus in corn and then maybe another 200 in other Prepared Foods and another couple hundred in raw material increases. This year, you're probably going to absorb 250 million, 300 million more, plus obviously you've had LFTB and all these other issues that have come up in the Beef segment. So no, this has been far from an ideal operating environment.","James V. Lochner","Q2 felt like we just got beat up every week on an issue. I mean, it was something every week and we came through it. Well when it was all said and done, fairly well.","Operator","Our next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you just talk a little bit about how you're Chicken results compare to what you see in Agri Stats? Just trying to get a sense of how much your self-help stuff and so forth is helping.","Donnie Smith","We do look at multiple benchmarking services. I would tell you that our performance has continued to improve. Now there's always ups and downs month-to-month. Frankly there's a couple of things in Q2 that we were a little bit disappointed in, in our Chicken segment but the team did a great job and pulled it out. So we're at or approaching top quartile performance. And of course, we have a multitude of plants probably 30-something locations that factor into our average, 32 I think. So to have an average of 32 locations in the top 1\/3, top quartile of that is pretty solid performance.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And maybe just as a follow-up to that, could you discuss sort of where the lowest quartile is? And I guess what I'm just trying to understand is that your margins are obviously back where they are. And you think that they could get better going forward. You also talked about maybe there being a big corn crop coming and you sounded a little more positive on breast meat, which has sort of been one of the things that's holding back margins. And we are seeing -- I know you think production's going to be down 4% this year, but we are seeing -- sequentially egg sets are increasing. So I guess I'm just wondering, maybe over the next 12 months, are you at all concerned that we're going to get back into an environment where supply is going to start increasing again in a meaningful way or is the bulk of the industry just not at a point yet where that's even worth worrying about?","Donnie Smith","Well, just one quick point of clarification. Sets and placements aren't necessarily increasing but the comparator versus a year ago is tightening up because of when we began to cut back last year. So the...","James V. Lochner","A year ago we were at 208. Last week, we dropped it down back down like a 190...","Donnie Smith","200 to 198. But hey, I really don't want talk about our performance. We have seen great increases in our live performance, our team has done a very good job. We continue to make great progress in our labor efficiencies, line efficiencies. Our yields are better. Just all aspects of our conversion costs continue to improve partly because of the capital that we've been able to spend. But also our folks are very innovative and they're constantly pressing on analytics and finding new ways to innovate processes to continue to outpace the others. And we\u2019ve built great customer loyalty. We continue to expand on that. We want to be seen as our customers' go-to supplier and I think that is also a very key component. So it's a very balanced approach. It's a combination of lots of things that have come together and we've got, I think, great opportunity, looking forward.","Operator","And our next question is from a Tim Ramey with D.A. Davidson.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Donnie, just a follow-up. I've heard you say case ready was doing well, and every couple of years we get excited about case ready, I'm wondering if it's time for something happening there in particular or if this just was kind of a one-off?","Donnie Smith","Steady growth, business does well. We're -- hey, we're very good at case-ready beef and pork. And their value-added line is doing well and adding to their business. That's a great team around a great business. The retailers view it as an important part of making sure that their sales presence in their category stays and stays healthy. And our team has done a super job, not only in terms of the quality of the product offering, but also in the service. Our on-time delivery, our order fill rates are just, just phenomenal. So we've got a great team around that business and it continues to grow progressively.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And I remember you making comments maybe last quarter about how Memorial Day weekend last year was a disappointment. And I assume that you'd know a lot about what the Memorial Day order book looks like right now or it's coming together right now. Can you characterize the year-over-year on that?","Donnie Smith","Certainly better than last year. And it's interesting because gas prices, gasoline prices actually peaked higher than they did a year ago sooner, about by maybe 6 weeks or so. And in terms of an average have taken more disposable income out of consumers products for longer this year and yet it feels like to us, the Memorial Day weekend should certainly outpace last year's by a pretty good margin. So we feel good going into the summer grilling season. I can't tell you -- Pork demand's a little bit slow. But again, it's a spread business and the other categories are doing fine.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A.

Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on what you just referenced, the slower near-term demand for Pork. Do you know what's behind that?","James V. Lochner","Let me jump in a little bit on that. The retail has been down slightly, but your biggest wholesale drops have been in bellies, which basically, I do think market did its job there. High-priced bacon actually decreased consumption, et cetera, so that put pressure on the belly complex. The biggest disappointment though overall is hams, and export ham stayed up fine and it was domestic consumption of ham products that came down putting pressure on that. And then trimmings actually have also had a major hit on the wholesale side, which I think is a combination of the beef trim correction that we saw from LFTB, as well as the fact that pigs have been very heavy and there's been ample supply and we've probably seen a pull back and have seen a pull back in some of the Food Service consumption on pizza products that support that market.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you referenced in your comments about overall industry for chicken production to be down 4% still for the year.

You may begin, sir.","Jon Kathol","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Tyson Foods conference call for the first quarter of the 2014 fiscal year. On today's call is Donnie Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Leatherby, Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Lochner, Chief Operating Officer.","I need to remind you, our remarks today include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. I encourage you to read today's press release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of the risks that can affect our business.[Operator Instructions]","As you are probably aware, our Annual Meeting of Shareholders is this morning, and we will need to stay on schedule. I hope we get to all of your questions, but we'll have to put a hard stop on this call to get over to the shareholders' meeting on time.","I'll now turn the call over to Donnie Smith.","Donnie Smith","Thanks, Jon. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Fiscal '14 is off to a strong start with earnings of $0.72 a share in the first quarter, which is a 47% improvement over Q1 of last year. Operating income grew 36% quarter-over-quarter, and our overall operating margin was 4.7%. Sales were $8.8 billion, the highest Q1 sales we've ever reported, up 4.7% over Q1 of FY '13. Chicken, Beef and Prepared Foods all had record Q1 sales, and Pork had its second-largest Q1 sales.","I'm really pleased with those results, but I'm even more pleased with what I'm seeing from the team to manage for the long term and invest in future growth. As an example, last week, we acquired Bosco's in Michigan, which was our third Prepared Foods acquisition in less than 1 year and another step in our effort to grow sales in our Prepared Foods segment. Bosco's is a great fit with our pizza toppings and crusts, and it aligns nicely with our K-12 school foodservice business.","We have to look at a variety of options and avenues for growth. It goes back to being nimble and responsive to consumers and their changing needs. One of the first places consumers adjust their spending is on food purchases, not just what they buy, but where they buy it. As you know, our business model is to offer a broad portfolio of products spread over multiple distribution channels, so we're able to shift with the consumer and give them what they want, where they want it. Consumers today are expanding their food purchases beyond the traditional foodservice and retail channels, creating opportunities for us in dollar, convenience, drugstores and even online.","In spite of historical high prices, Nielsen data for the 52-week period ended December 28 indicates that total fresh meat volume at retail was up 1.3%. Pork, chicken and ground beef pounds-sold increased, while whole-muscle beef held steady. Fresh chicken was the leader, with dollar sales up 8% versus the previous year. And once again, Tyson was the #1 brand of fresh chicken in the country.","Record high beef prices should continue through 2014, meaning fewer beef promotions in retail and foodservice. Pork prices will also remain high due to lower supply. Chicken should continue to be the winner.","As consumer confidence rebounds, people are becoming less defensive in their spending, but I don't know of anyone who thinks that consumers will go back to their pre-2008 spending habits anytime soon. Expectations are different. The definition of value is different, and it isn't limited to price. The consumer is asking, what am I getting for my dollar? What are the ingredients? Is it fresh? Is it good for me? All those factors are part of the consumer's new value equation. They're willing to pay for convenience, but the product must legitimately fill an unmet need or solve a problem in a unique way. Our insights-driven approach to new product development is focused on those unmet needs.","Better For You foods are becoming mainstream. People want clean labels and transparency in ingredients. They want to know where their food comes from and that we're being responsible in how we produce it. They're uncompromising about food safety, and rightly so. But they also want only a few ingredients on the label. So that's our challenge and an area of focus for our R&D and innovation.","Another challenge is the cut to the government's Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. This could reduce total food sales growth by 1%. Shopper card data shows that SNAP shoppers' spending has dropped 4 points more than other shoppers since their benefits were cut. We're developing consumer insights into those shoppers to retain them as consumers, even though they have less money to spend.","So that's how we're thinking about the market dynamics domestically. And now let's turn to our international business.","It was a disappointing quarter with a $28 million loss. While China certainly wasn't the only source of the negative returns, it was the largest, and we've been making significant investments to build a fully integrated poultry business. I said on our Q4 call that I thought our China operations would reach breakeven by the end of the fiscal year. But I don't think -- I think it will take longer. There's been a change in the market dynamics in China over the past year, following widespread food safety concerns an avian influenza outbreak and economic slowdown.","Previously, I told you that demand would return about 3 months after the initial AI problem was over, but I was wrong. Demand hasn't recovered, which has led to a substantial oversupply of chicken. And now there are new concerns about avian influenza. Because of these factors, we've decided to slow down on building more chicken farms beyond those currently planned for this fiscal year until market conditions improve. Now I want to be clear, we're not changing our path, just our pace. We are not backing off our long-term commitment to produce quality chicken from a controlled supply in China. We're simply slowing down until the supply-and-demand dynamics get back in balance, in order to protect our margins. We'll move forward with our planning processes, and when the markets improve, we'll be able to resume construction of company-owned chicken housing.","I think one of the characteristics that makes Tyson Foods a great company is our ability to be flexible and to reassess, and that's what we're doing to grow our business and optimize shareholder returns.","I remain confident about 2014. I think it's going to be another great year for us. There's still a certain amount of seasonality to our business and Q2 is typically our softest quarter and the hardest to predict. It was last year, and it certainly appears that this quarter won't be an exception. We still feel confident that the back half of our year will be strong and that this will be a very good year for us.","Overall, we've got a lot of momentum, and we're anticipating healthy growth this year, next year and beyond. We feel really good about where we are as a company. There are always challenges in this business, but we don't see anything on the horizon that we can't overcome.","And now I'll hand it off to Dennis for the financial update, and then Jim will talk about the segments.","Dennis Leatherby","Thank you, Donnie, and good morning, everyone. As Donnie mentioned, this morning we reported first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $0.72 per share. This represents a 47% increase over the $0.49 we reported a year ago. I would also like to note that on an adjusted basis, our rolling 4-quarter continuing EPS is $2.49 as compared to $2.26 for fiscal '13. Pretax return on invested capital for the past 12 months was just under 20%. Operating cash flow was strong in the first quarter at $361 million. Capital expenditures were $140 million for the quarter, as we continue to invest in projects for both our domestic and foreign operations that result in improved productive capabilities, labor efficiencies, yields and sales mix.","During the first quarter, we acquired 4.6 million shares for $150 million under our share repurchase program. Since May 2011, we have repurchased 47.9 million shares for $1.1 billion. I'm also pleased to announce, yesterday our Board of Directors increased the authorized shares under this program by 25 million, and we now have 34.6 million shares available for repurchase.","Our effective tax rate for continuing operations in Q1 was 34.3%. Net debt to EBITDA for the last 12 months was 0.6x and on a gross-debt-to-EBITDA basis, this measure was 1x. Including cash of $825 million, net debt was $1.1 billion. Total liquidity was $1.8 billion, remaining well above the targeted range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Gross debt was nearly -- was down nearly $0.5 billion from Q4 '13, coming in at $1.9 billion.","As we reported in the last call, we paid off our $458 million convertible notes in October with cash on hand. Additionally, we issued 12 million shares at maturity for the conversion feature. And at the same time, we received 12 million shares under our bond hedge. This had the impact of finally canceling out the negative dilution impact we have been experiencing the last few years associated with convertible notes. However, we still have warrants outstanding related to this transaction that we'll exercise from January through April, which are already included in our diluted share count.","For the quarter, our diluted shares outstanding were 354 million, which included dilution from warrants of 8 million shares and stock options of 5 million shares.","Now here are some thoughts on the remainder of fiscal '14. We expect revenues of approximately $36 billion for fiscal '14, up 5% over fiscal '13. Net interest expense should be about $100 million, down $37 million from fiscal '13. The effective tax rate for continuing operations should be around 35.5%. And our CapEx plan remains at $700 million, up $140 million from fiscal '13 and $180 million greater than our depreciation and amortization expense.","Based on our average share price in Q1, we expect our diluted shares in Q2 to remain around 354 million prior to considering any changes in our stock price, which would impact the dilution from warrants and stock options. This also does not reflect the impact of any additional stock buybacks.","Our priorities for excess cash remain the same, which include additional capital spending to improve and grow our existing businesses, acquisitions to fulfill our growth strategies around value-added products in our international footprint and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, all while ensuring we maintain plenty of liquidity at our disposal.","As Donnie mentioned earlier, we have a lot of momentum going, and we feel great about where we are as a company. Fiscal '14 is off to a fabulous start with a 47% EPS improvement over prior year in Q1. And Q2, while softer and seasonally more challenging, should beat last year, and the third and fourth quarter should be really strong. Although we don't normally provide guidance, the last couple of quarters, we referenced the back half of fiscal '13 times 2, which implied about $2.78 earnings per share for fiscal '14. While it is still early in the year, we are confident we can deliver at least that number, which would be in excess of 23% EPS growth for the year, and we are poised for at least 10% EPS growth in 2015 and beyond.","I'll now turn it over to Jim for a closer look into our operating segments.","James V. Lochner","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning. Starting with the Pork segment, in the first quarter, we reported $121 million in operating income and an 8.5% return on sales. Volume decreased 2.1% compared to Q1 '13. The available supplies of hogs were lower year-over-year, and we adjusted our weekly volumes accordingly. Sales prices are up 6.7% due to mix changes and price increases associated with the lower total pork supplies. This helped to offset the lower U.S. total exports.","We're now 1\/3 of the way into our second fiscal quarter, and we're about where we thought we'd be, meaning we're performing well and on track managing revenue drivers such as mix, yields and pricing. This fiscal year, we expect the PED virus to impact domestic hog supplies by 2% to 4%. In our plant locations, we'll see the effects in the summer months. Heavier weights will offset some of the headcount reductions, but we do expect to see wholesale price increases. We do not anticipate any issues running our plants.","In the Chicken segment, we generated a record $225 million in operating income with 7.5% return on sales for the first quarter. Excluding international losses, Chicken margins were 9.5%. Volume was up 3.6% compared to the first quarter of fiscal '13 due to increased international production, outside buy and rendered product sales. In aggregate, pricing was down 1.4% year-over-year, predominantly from export sales, rendered products and international operations.","Q2 is off to a good start, but this is typically our most challenging quarter.","Looking further out, Chicken supplies for the last 3 quarters of our fiscal year are projected to increase around 2% over last year, reflecting the production cuts in 2013. We will continue our buy versus grow strategy in Chicken to make opportunistic open market purchases and value-up those sales. Currently, we project lower feed cost for the fiscal year to be around $600 million.","As we discussed in previous calls, less than 10% of our contracts are annual fixed price and our focus is on helping our customers drive their businesses and generate category growth. So our pricing conversations lean more toward what our portfolio of products are worth to the customer and to the consumer.","Turning to the Beef segment. In Q1, we generated $58 million in operating income and a 1.6% return on sales. Volume was up 4.1% over Q1 '13. Price was up 2.9%, reflecting higher beef wholesale cut pricing from reduced supplies and stronger overall exports.","So far in Q2, we've seen historically high wholesale beef prices and the cutout has set records each week. Low production volumes relative to demand, particularly in ground beef, trim and the chuck and round cuts have driven the rapid rise in the overall cutout and Beef revenue. As a result, consumers will see higher retail beef prices. And as Donnie mentioned, we'll likely see fewer beef features at retail and foodservice this summer. We expect to have adequate supplies for our Beef operations as our plants are located close to the fed cattle supplies.","In the Prepared Foods segment, operating income for the first quarter was $16 million with a 1.8% return on sales. Sales volume increased 3.5% versus the same quarter last year due to an improved demand and the additional volume associated with the Don Julio and Circle Foods acquisitions. Sales prices were up 4.2% as a result of mix improvements and price increases associated with higher input costs.","Pricing gains, however, were not sufficient to fully offset increased inputs and additional cost associated with the investment in our lunchmeat business and the other Prepared Foods growth platforms in the quarter. In our Q4 earnings call, we talked about a couple of those growth opportunities, including Tyson DAY STARTS in the Frozen Breakfast category and Wright Brand Breakfast Sausage. And although they started shipping only a few weeks ago, we're already pleased with the customer acceptance and the volumes for both product lines. We'll continue to put MAP spending behind them and other Prepared Foods as we look for growth in the long term from this segment.","In closing, I'd like to say thank you to our team members for their commitment to continuous improvement. Tyson Foods has made tremendous strides in recent years, and I still see a lot of runway ahead. As we announced in November, I've begun transitioning into retirement. And as a result, this will be my last earnings call. It's been a great experience getting to interact with investors and analysts over the years. And I've appreciated your willingness to learn about our business.","That's the end of our prepared remarks. Shirley, we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Brett Hundley with BB&T Capital Markets.","Brett M. Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Donnie, I just have a question for you. I'd love for you to give some just further overall color on the balance of fiscal '14 and then the outlook into fiscal '15. I think you made some -- or you guys made some interesting comments on both years. And Donnie, I think one of the things that has really helped to kind of re-rate your stock and support your stock is you guys coming out on the last call and on this call and reiterating segment guidance in the face of a number of challenges. And certainly, there's a lot of factors impacting you guys, PED, tight cattle supplies, cold weather, propane issues, oncoming chicken supply, now we have a resurgent bird flu in China and your slowdown there. And so I'm just kind of wondering how all of these plays out and affects earnings potential going forward, particularly as you guys mentioned at least 10% earnings growth in 2015.","Donnie Smith","Sure, Brett. So let me start with kind of reiterating what Dennis said in his comments. We're off to a very solid start in this year, great Q1. Our Q2 is typically softer, and it's certainly harder to predict. But it looks like to us that the back half of the year ought to be really strong. And so we're going to have a really good year and take a lot of momentum, by the way, into FY '15. So from where we sit today, we're confident in our ability to deliver at least that $2.78 or so. So let me talk about each segment just a little bit. Obviously, the Chicken segment is off to a strong start. We're headed into a lower cost environment with a little higher supply, 2% to 3%. But we're also going to see, I think, a halo effect from high-priced beef and pork. So it feels like to me that the Chicken segment is just going to have a really super year. Most of the issues in international for the year are behind us, and we'll be getting continually better there and taking more positive momentum into FY '15 there. Beef and Pork looked to be very similar to last year. So be thinking of that equal, too. And if either one, maybe a little better. In Prepared Foods, obviously, we're investing in our growth platforms, and it looks like that we're going to be about like where we were 1 year ago and could possibly do better there as well. So feel good there. When you look at the overall balance sheet, debt's low, we're at a point -- our net debt is 0.6x EBITDA. So we've got a lot of dry powder, we're going to throw off a lot of cash this year. Plenty to do the CapEx we need to do, we'll be well above depreciation and amortization again this year. So we've got opportunity for more value-added acquisitions that fit. And we'll continue to return cash to shareholders. So if you take the new acquisitions that we've made in Prepared Foods, they'll start contributing in -- well, they're contributing now, and good opportunities for growth in those businesses, and they'll be contributing in FY '15 and beyond. Like I said, we're taking our foot off the gas a little bit in China, but we're still on the road. And when the market dynamics give us an opportunity, we'll certainly continue to press forward there and we'll gain more momentum in our international business in '15. So feels real solid, we've got a great future. Obviously, with that laundry list of stuff you mentioned, we always have challenges to our business, but we really don't see anything that we're not going to be able to overcome now.","Brett M. Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","All right. That's very helpful. And then I just have a follow-up on Chicken. You guys did very well during the quarter. And I would expect, given your business make-up there, for you guys to continue to do well. I just wanted to ask you about this polar vortex that's gripping the nation, in predominantly the Midwest and Southeast. And as it relates to your Chicken business, a, do you guys hedge forward on natural gas? And then b, if your growers are having -- and of course, that natural gas is at the plant level. But, b, if your growers are having issues with propane, would the company step in or be able to step in, and would that affect margins at all?","Donnie Smith","Yes, great question. We stay fairly close in natural gas. We might have natural gas purchased a couple of months out in front of us, that kind of thing. So as we do in grain, we take a fairly conservative but sensible approach to how we manage our commodity purchases. On the propane issue for the growers, I'll tell you, we have a great team of people that came together, and we've actually been buying propane down in Houston and transporting it into the areas where our growers had need. So I'm not aware of any grower that's growing for Tyson Foods that doesn't have the propane they need to be able to take care of those chickens. And I'd tell you, it's just been a heroic effort by a large group of people. I'm really proud of them for jumping in there and, frankly, coming to the rescue for some of our growers. And yes, we will be making some adjustments in our grower pay to make sure that we take care of our growers during all of this. So we've got a great live production team. And by the way, we have great growers. And so they've worked together to make sure that we've mitigated the risk of this to our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMC.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in PEDv right now? I assume it's not very constructive since you just took your expectation down for hog availability so dramatically. And also, you did take your estimate for chicken supply for the industry down this year as well. If I'm not mistaken, it was 3% or 4% last quarter, now it's officially 3%, and on the call, you're talking a little more like 2%. Can you just add a little color, what you're seeing there to maybe drive that decline in your forecast?","Donnie Smith","Sure. Jim, you take that one.","James V. Lochner","Yes. When I referenced that Chicken supply, as I said, the last 3 quarters annualized would be the same. And I just took the first quarter, which was behind us. So I said going forward, all the analysts I looked at and the data we looked at, implies around 2% for the last 3 quarters. And now referencing the PED, that's a very fluid situation. It seems like either at least weekly, but sometimes even daily, new evidence comes out. And we do expect that it might be influencing up to 30% of the sow herd, with 10% or so impact on the available pigs impacted. So there is where the 3% comes from. Now if that increases to 40% or decreases, because a lot of that data is still flowing in, that will have some influence. So that offset -- that would offset any of the productivity gains of the balance, let's say it is 30%, the 70% would have some productivity gains, and we probably are likely to see some increase in carcass weight to offset at least some of the pounds lost from the head loss. But I do want to emphasize, information does come out fairly regularly and it's being assimilated. And we're just staying very on top of it, region to region, producer to producer.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Best guess, Jim, is PED better in terms of less spread, or worse than what most media reports have come out with?","James V. Lochner","I'm not sure -- is it spread to a greater degree or lesser degree?","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, I didn't ask that very deftly. But is it -- I guess, is it spread to a greater degree or a less degree -- lesser degree than what most people think?","James V. Lochner","I don't know what most people think. So I'm hearing it's spreading in states, and what we're really tracking is: how many sows are impacted, when. Because it impacts the baby pig mortality. So then 5 to 6 months out, there would be fewer pigs available. So that's how we're tracking it. But some people believe it's -- well, it has spread into more states. So it's the extent in the number of sows impacted that we're really monitoring.","Operator","Our next question comes from Farha Aslam with Stephens.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","National Beef announced the closure of the Brawley, California plant this morning. How do you anticipate that impacts service supply-demand in the beef market? And will that impact or benefit Tyson's facilities in particular?","James V. Lochner","Well, we just found that out this morning, and we're familiar with their daily head capacity. That plant's in California and there's generally a feedlot supply around. So it will take daily capacity out. Our best guess is around 2,000 head per day. So that obviously means those cattle will have to be marketed somewhere else, so they'll flow, I guess, east and potentially north, to different packers. And it is consistent, I guess, with what we've been saying all along, as the calf crop declines and the noncompetitive feedlot areas or noncompetitive plants or the combination thereof, we'll probably have to curtail production. So we were a bit surprised to see it this morning. But I guess, to some extent, we've always felt that -- and anticipated something like that would happen.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up on Prepared Foods. You've done 3 sort of tack-on acquisitions in that space. Could you just share with us, combined, what the sales of those 3 acquisitions are and kind of your vision for Prepared Foods longer term into 2015? Because clearly, you're taking hits in terms of the plant, et cetera. What's the potential and outlook in 2015 for that division?","Donnie Smith","So no particular specifics on the 3 acquisitions. But our Prepared Foods business is really a broad mix of different types of businesses that are frankly at different stages of maturity. We've got some businesses that are mature and have -- generate great results, and then we've got some that we're building, and we talked about lunchmeat before and continuing to fix that business. And we're investing a lot in those businesses, as Jim referenced, a couple of new product rollouts. And Farha, if we just -- I don't want to get too specific here, but if we took off the MAP spending that -- which we won't, but if we just kind of adjusted back the MAP spending, our Prepared Foods segment would be above 4%. So we're spending a lot, we're investing a lot in this business. I view Prepared Foods a lot like where we were in Chicken 4, 5 years ago, where we just had to -- getting the basics and build a strong foundation under that business. And you can see kind of the results 2, 3, 4 years later about doing all of that work. We're working on our footprint. So anyway, if you just look forward into our vision in Prepared Foods, continue to think about a broad portfolio of items that meet changing consumer requirements. We've got very broad capabilities. We've got access to raw materials. Obviously, we've got a great, sound capital structure and the ability to invest in those businesses, and we'll continue to do that. And you should expect to see strong growth in Prepared Foods.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","In 2015?","Donnie Smith","Right. I mean, and again, think of this year at least equal to last year, maybe a tad better. But as we go forward, that segment should continue to improve as we see the benefit from the investments that we're making today.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Rachel Nabatian","This is Rachel Nabatian, in for Rob. So I just wanted to get an update on the annual negotiations with foodservice customers that you recently had, and pricing. With the benefit of lower grain at $600 million now, do you think that you would be able to maybe hang on to half of that benefit in pricing and then pass the rest of it onto your customers?","Donnie Smith","So very pleased with how, let's call it contracting season, went. Our customers recognize that we grow their categories and we grow their businesses and we spur their demand. So we're being recognized for the quality and the service and the insights-driven innovation. And as Jim mentioned in his comments, that keeps our conversations with customers much more focused on what our products and our offering and our service to their business is worth than rather just what it costs. Again, let me remind you, our fixed annual price exposure is less than 10%. Now getting to the how much of the grain, question, we'll hang on to. I don't want to answer that specifically, but let me answer it this way. Remember that we've talked about our pricing profile, as today, is much more reflective of the inputs, and we've made that change over the last 2, 3 years. Over half of our pricing contracts today either adjust for grain cost or market value. So that helps us protect our dollar margins and gives us a lot more stability in up or down grain markets. Remember, chicken is still the best valued protein relative to all the other competing proteins. I guess, third thing is, again, our quality, our service, our innovative capabilities make us a go-to supplier for our customers, and we're getting paid for the value that we add to their business. Again, we mentioned this, too, our buy versus grow strategy, we continue to keep our supply short of demand and we'll capitalize on buying less expensive raw materials as we continue to supply more breast meat per capita. So we'll continue to buy those cheaper raw materials. And then the last thing I'd say is we're going to continue to grow our value-added mix and, of course, that provides us some protection from the underlying commodity markets. So if you tie all those things together, that gives us a great opportunity to hold on, if you want to call it that, to the grain benefit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Piken with Cleveland Research.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research Company","Just wanted to circle back on a couple of things. With respect to your outlook for exports in the upcoming year, if you could kind of break it down sort of protein by protein, what your expectations are for the U.S. exports for beef, chicken and pork?","James V. Lochner","Let me start with beef, I think we'll continue to see an increase, probably not at the same rate that we saw last year because Japan's entrance, and expanded to 30 months and down, certainly was a boost. But again, we continue -- we think we'll see U.S. beef exports continue to grow, probably in that 2% to 3%, and that's aligned with most people's expectations. Pork this year is down, '13 versus '12 it was down about, let's see, I think around 7% or 8%. But I don't think we'll see that same decline this year. In fact, I'm one who thinks it will probably increase. Although I can tell you there's a big divergence of opinions on most analysts to what they think pork exports are going to do this year. And then chicken exports, I consider -- I expect it will continue to grow at the 2% to 3% year-over-year. So -- and overall, again, domestic availability of protein's probably going to come down, which should be supportive of the wholesale pricing as a whole. Obviously, we'll see less beef, right now, the way PED is going to impact pork, we should see less pork than anticipated. Prior to that, most people were thinking it would be up. But I think that will be down. And then if chicken exports continued to improve and we don't think -- and we think we're beyond the year-over-year major increase, so again, I think we're going to see very supportive prices for all the wholesale meat cuts and poultry cuts this year.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research Company","Okay, great. And just as a follow-up on the Chicken side, if you can break it down a little bit more in terms of which markets you see growing. Because obviously, last year, we the Mexico AI outbreak in the second quarter. Just if you could sort of break it out market by market, and kind of is it your belief that commodity, like order [ph] prices could start to rebound off of the declines we saw in the first quarter?","James V. Lochner","Actually, we'd say that there won't be any market that's probably going to go down. We don't see any softness in Mexico, we see Russia having to come back in, Angola, Canada, et cetera. We don't really see any market that's acutely going to go down. In fact, some of them, we don't see where that supply is going to come from. So that's where the modest increase. And I think potentially, it could be stronger than what I just said. But really, we don't see any country at this point as a threat.","Operator","Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So my first question is on Chicken. And Donnie, you mentioned, it's shaping up to be a good year and thanks for breaking out the U.S. margin. So my question is really how good can it get? The way I'm thinking about it, so help me if I'm thinking about it correctly, your cost came down sequentially, it seems like $0.07 or $0.08 a pound. I would expect those to be sort of stable sequentially for the rest of the year, unless grain prices change. And I would expect revenue per pound to continue to increase as the fiscal year progresses. So I would think that your U.S. margin, at 9.5%, is biased upward sequentially unless I'm thinking about that incorrectly. And then you mentioned on the international side, things should continue to get better. So am I thinking about that generally correctly where your margins should improve from where we've seen them in 1Q?","Donnie Smith","I think you're a tad strong on your revenue growth for the balance of the year. We don't see it -- I guess the right way to put it, we don't see it deteriorating markedly. But I think continued growth in price per pound through the rest of the year is probably a little bit unrealistic. But still, hey, don't let that mean that we don't think this is going to be a really great year in Chicken. And I think you're right on our international business, it will -- the worst seems to be behind us and it's getting better. And it will continue to improve some through the year.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So the price per pound, my comment was sequentially. Did you mean that sequentially as well or you meant year-over-year?","Donnie Smith","Got it. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, sequentially, it will be better. Yes. I thought you meant from Q1 getting better into Q2, getting better into Q3, getting better into Q4. So yes, but sequentially, yes, you're correct.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up would be on the comment you made about 2Q being the most unpredictable. I would think that relates more to Pork and Beef and less so to Chicken. It just seem -- can you give us a little bit more on what you meant by that? Should it be higher or lower than $0.70? And what were you really trying to indicate by the comment on 2Q being a little bit difficult to anticipate?","Donnie Smith","Well, so I'm not going to give quarterly guidance. We struggle enough an annual. But our Q2 is not generally as strong as our Q1, I started -- that's what we mean by that. And in our Beef and Pork markets, coming out of the holidays, there's just typically a bit more volatility. It's a little harder to predict how things are going to turn out than when you get into high-demand seasons post-Memorial Day, right? So it's just a difficult quarter. I guess, it's a more difficult quarter to predict. But I'd say, our guys are on top of it. They're doing a great job managing our supply, they're doing a great job on our pricing. I feel really good about where we are. I didn't mean to over-imply anything scary about our Q2 comments, it's just Q2 is generally a little softer than Q1 and it will be this year and it's a little harder to predict. So -- but still going to have a great back half of the year and this will be a good year for us. Jim, do you want to add anything about Beef and Pork?","James V. Lochner","Beef is -- the Jan, Feb, March period is always very difficult. And this year's really extreme with record cutouts and they topped out at a choice cutout of 240. But in 2 weeks, they gave $10 of it back up. So it tends to be extremely volatile. And I feel really good about how we're navigating through this January period, particularly in Beef and Pork. So -- but the general statement is historically, this is usually our most challenging quarter and typically less than Q1 and Q3. But I personally have a lot of optimism 4 weeks into it.","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Tiberio with Miller Tabak.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Just a very brief question around some of the trends that we're seeing on the natural organic side. We've been seeing some of the national foodservice companies talking about sourcing more non-GMO ingredients. I know that you've launched a line in the last 2 years. But looking forward, I wanted to get a sense of whether you think that your current investment level is sufficient there? Or whether this is a segment that we should expect you investing in going forward over the next year or 2?","Donnie Smith","Yes, so last summer, or I guess late spring, we launched our no-antibiotic-ever line, NatureRaised Farms. As a total -- as a percent of the total meat sold, let's lump things into natural, I'm going to call it that. It's a pretty small percentage versus our traditional lines, but it's growing at a pretty healthy pace. And so it's something that we can't ignore. The category's big enough that a national player can make some difference in. So yes, we will continue to focus on the category. In terms of our investments, we've got a lot of things that we can invest in, in our business to continue to grow. That would be one of them. Feel good about our opportunity in that category. And so expect it -- expect to hear more of this in the future. But I don't look for any disproportional investment over the next year or 2, I would say, in our no-antibiotic-ever line.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Great. And just one follow-up question for Jim. With some of the supply constraints with the Australian drought, how are you thinking as far as imports of 90- or 50-CL trim? And how is Tyson positioning for potentially lower trim imports during 2014?","James V. Lochner","Lower trim imports are generally favorable to wholesale -- to domestic prices. But as always, the market likes to do its job. And we've seen very low cow kills, so therefore, low 90 beef manufacturing supplies in October, or in this -- particularly, October, November and December, more acute in December, which is extremely supportive to the trim and ground beef and chuck and round pricing coming into January. So the question will be how fast can they get it in the pipeline and will it neutralize some of this rapid price increase we've seen. But generally speaking, if you have lower imports, it's favorable to wholesale prices. And I think as we've seen these record-high ground beef prices, et cetera, that's part of that whole complex. So that's part of the big contributor to the beef cutout right there. So -- and it's a nice number, you can watch when it's coming in and look at it and its contribution to total domestic availability.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Question on Chicken. Clearly, the performance this quarter was a record. The outlook for the rest of the fiscal year is good. Supply's pretty contained, and the pricing environment, pretty healthy. And I guess, a little bit of thinking about 2015, as you start to see kind of maybe some more pressure on supplies, the breeder flock kind of gets rebuilt and one of your competitors has a new plant coming on stream. How confident are you in the 10% EPS growth in '15 if you start to see some cyclical pressures in Chicken?","Donnie Smith","Well, very. We manage the supply and the commodity risks through a variety of approaches. One is growing our value-added sales. Our value-added sales in Q1 grew by 6%. I think the total sales for the company was close to -- right at 5%, right? So we're going to make sure that we focus on growing our value-added sales in that 6% to 8% range. And then when you combine some of the other pricing things that we talked about a little bit earlier, plus our buy versus grow strategy, we have the opportunity to continue to grow our sales at a very good pace, whether we increase our production or not. So I feel great about our continued opportunities in 2015 to expand really our Prepared Foods business, our Chicken business, getting better in exports. So yes, feel very good about that.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe just one more for me. In the quarter, SG&A, about 15% year-on-year, it's the highest level both on absolute basis and as a percent of sales since 2010. Is that just really accelerated MAP spending in Prepared Foods? Or anything else there that you could comment on?","Donnie Smith","No, it's predominantly MAP spending in our growth categories. So we're intent on growing that business and we needed to increase our MAP spending to be able to get to the category growth levels that we have to have to meet our objective. So that's what it is.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Scott with CLSA.","Jeremy Scott - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Just a follow-up on China. When you say that you'll continue to plan for expansion, do you mean that you'll continue to get permits from the China government and just not build the chicken houses? Or do you mean that you're going to hold off on everything?","Donnie Smith","No, you're exactly right. We intend to continue to get our land-use permits and to have all of that in place so that when we get the demand signal that we're looking for, that we can begin construction on our houses. We will be -- at the end of this year, we will have both of our processing plants in China, 1 shift full of company-controlled birds. Now we were planning on being -- in the last half of this fiscal year, continuing the house build to be able to grow past that early in the first half of the year on company-controlled birds. But we're going to back off buying market birds and be at a single shift full at both plants with company-controlled birds at the end of this year. And our planning and everything we're doing is focused on that, with continuing to acquire the land to grow in the future. And if we get a demand signal that something is changing, we'll be able to put our foot back on the accelerator and go again because we fully intend to fill those plants out with company-controlled birds.","Operator","And our final question comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I have a couple of questions. Your 2014 outlook was always back half of 2000 run rate -- back half of 2013 run rate. But this quarter -- and then also that it was going to be more back-end loaded this year as well. But this quarter you, obviously, kept the run rate actually a little bit above the run rate. So my question is what exceeded your expectations? I mean, is there any change to the back half outlook for 2014?","Donnie Smith","Yes. I think for me, Beef probably outperformed a little more than what I was expecting it to. Prepared Foods was right where we thought it would be. Chicken is right where we thought it would be. Pork was pretty close. So it was probably Beef is what surprised us a little bit -- well, maybe not surprised us, but we're pleased with the performance. I'd tell you, Ken, coming in, I would have never predicted a 240 cutout in beef, right? So this is just an unpredictable quarter that we're in today. But yes, we feel very good about the rest of our year and carrying a lot of good momentum into '15.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So just to go back, so you don't have a change to your back half look. Because you basically said, all you said was we're going to be at least at what we thought. But you, and I'll use your own words, it was a fabulous start. So I'm assuming that, that fabulous start should be incremental to the full year when we think about the full year.","Donnie Smith","Hey, it could be. The door is open for us to do better. I'll tell you what, if we -- we will not miss an opportunity, if one presents itself, to increase our earnings, I promise. So -- but, hey, it's January and there's a few things that make it a little hard for us to predict. But I feel very comfortable about where we have been with the opportunity to get better, and we're certainly looking for every chance we get to do that.","James V. Lochner","I apologize for laughing, but we never miss an opportunity to do better.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","But -- and then also I don't even talk to the beef packer margin, this -- the Jan to March period of time is usually a pretty rough period for beef packer margins. Obviously, you have the closure, and then on top of that, you've had beef packer margins that -- I mean, look, in 25 years of history, we've never seen a $200 change per head in beef packer margins. Again, granted it's what we see. But again, beef packer margins seem pretty solid. So this quarter, you keep on saying, hey look, obviously, we don't know the predictability. But clearly, the beef packer environment seems better. Can you talk to why it's better and the duration to which that should stay better?","James V. Lochner","I always remind everybody that it's the relationship of revenue to cattle cost that's where we make our money. So I always go back and say, we do make our money in the slope of change. And prior to that run-up to the cutout, cattle ran up, and the cutout, clearly, there was insufficient supply relative to demand, the pipeline, or the cupboard was bare. And to replenish the pipeline, prices really inflated very rapidly. So we've had more volatility, and we've navigated through that slope of change very well. And that's -- and we're coming through January much better than we did 1 year ago. So that's -- but what we really watch is, again, trying to make sure that we manage our mix, our price relative to fair market value and keep our cost in line, work on saving everything we can. And the only thing I know we have no influence over is what the live cattle are going to do. So I mean, if they're tight, they're going to go up and beef will follow it up or precede it up depending upon what the circumstances are doing, and that's the nature of the market. So again, a very volatile January, unprecedented both in incline and probably will be in decline. So it's an interesting time. But you can probably tell, we feel pretty good about how we came through it.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then my final question is you're slowing down -- this is probably more for Dennis, you're slowing down the CapEx spending on China but you maintained your CapEx spending at $700 million. What are you spending more on?","Dennis Leatherby","That's a great question, and we have still many great opportunities, both in Prepared Foods and even in our Chicken segment. So we're just moving it to a domestic bucket, high return projects that we feel really good about.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So your pipeline of CapEx projects, obviously, China being a big one to slowdown, the pipeline must be pretty substantial. Is that a fair statement?","Dennis Leatherby","It sure is.","Donnie Smith","Well, thanks for your time, everyone, and certainly, your interest in our company. I'm sorry to wrap this up so quickly, but we really do need to head off to our Shareholders' Meeting. So I want to ask you all to have a great weekend.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you.

If you do have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","And I'll be turning the call over now to Jon Kathol, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jon Kathol","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for Tyson Foods conference call for the third quarter of the 2014 fiscal year. On today's call are Donnie Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dennis Leatherby, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I need to remind you our remarks today include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. I encourage you to read today's press release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of the risks that can affect our business.","Today we announced the launch of public offerings of Class A common stock and tangible equity units.

I'll now turn the call over to Donnie Smith.","Donnie Smith","Thanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone, and we appreciate you joining us a little early today. As you saw in our press release, we had a record third quarter with an adjusted $0.75 a share. We did have some one-time issues that I'll talk about when we get to the segments. But otherwise, our results were in line with our expectations. We're pleased with the quarter. We're ramping up what will be our best year so far, and we're looking forward to starting 2015 which looks to be an outstanding year even before we add Hillshire Brands' great products, brands and people to Tyson Foods.","Before we get to the third quarter commentary, I'd like to say a few words about the Hillshire acquisition. Several of us had the opportunity to spend some time in Hillshire in Chicago and we're beyond impressed with their team. We're excited about taking their expertise and combining it with ours to create a Prepared Foods business with strong stable margins and steady growth. As we execute our Prepared Foods strategy, we're estimating the impact of the synergies with Hillshire along with the cost savings and production efficiencies associated with the plant closures that I'll say more about shortly that will be more than about $225 million in fiscal 2015 and should exceed $500 million by the end of year three.","We expect the acquisition to be accretive in fiscal '15 and substantially accretive thereafter as we generate synergies. We plan to continue to delivering on our 10% EPS growth target in 2015, and we want to use our strong cash flows to delever the balance sheet quickly.","While I'm excited about the prospects of Tyson and Hillshire coming together, we must stay focused on the fundamentals that got us in the position to make this acquisition. So let's take a look at our segments, because we had some issues and there's room for improvement. The Chicken segment had a 6.9% return on sales in Q3. Pricing was down 1% due to the untimely and unfortunate events that resulted in the loss of volume in our high-margin value-added products. In February of this year, we experienced a fire at one of our fully cooked processing plants. Fortunately, no one was injured. But the damage to the infrastructure was more serious than we had originally thought. And our ability to supply products suffered. The mechanical repairs are now complete and the plant is back to producing normal volumes.","Additionally in Q3, a second sizeable fully cooked processing plant experienced a series of operational issues and the volume in supplies has been significantly impacted. New equipment has been ordered and is being installed and we expect to be back at full production volume in the early weeks of our fiscal Q1 of '15. On our Q2 call, you'll remember that I mentioned that we're completely out of fully cooked capacity in our Chicken business, which is why we weren't able to move production to other facilities following either event. So we've endured for long sizeable production shortfalls in one of our highest revenue, most profitable business during a time when high-priced beef and pork accelerated the demand for chicken.","These temporary disruptions and the resulting actions we took with customers have and will cost us between 1.5% and 2% return on sales in Q3 and Q4 in our Chicken segment. In FY '15, we'll be back to our full productive capability and we'll have additional fully cooked capacity coming on line in the spring. So our Chicken segment is expected to fully recover and deliver a 10% return on sales in 2015.","Moving on to the Beef segment, which had a 2.4% return on sales. The quarter got off to a slow start, but finished strong as the summer grilling season brought robust demand despite record high pricing. And even with those high prices, we were successful in promoting our premium branded beef programs. Our commitment to operational excellence and revenue-enhancing programs continues to work well. People often forget that a business with the 2% return on sales can still generate a pre-tax ROIC of 15% if you maximize the efficiency of your assets to turn your capital quickly, which is what we do.","Looking on to 2015, we expect next year to look a lot like this year from a cattle supply and an operating margin perspective. Heavier weight cattle are expected to continue to come into market and we're starting to see signs of heifer retention, but we're seeing adequate supply of cattle in our regions. The beef industry is becoming a combination of several small geographic marketplaces. Cattle continue to be moving to the feed lots in the grain belt. So it makes sense to have plants close to the feed lines, as we do.","Turning to the Pork segment, we had a record third quarter with a 7.2% return on sales. We've managed the supply challenges created by the PED virus very well. We were able to move supply among our facilities, adjust orders and maximize revenue. In fact, our volume was up 5% versus the same quarter of year ago, and demand remained strong as indicated by pricing that was up 26%. Looking ahead into fiscal '15, four factors indicate that we should have an adequate supply of hogs, portending another solid performance from that segment.","Futures prices indicate the industry is expecting more hogs later this fall. Hog weights are already very heavy and we would expect that to continue. PED seems to have slowed through the warmer months, but of course may reappear as we head into winter. And finally, lower price corn may incentivize some level of expansion into 2016.","In the Prepared Foods segment, first, let's address the negative return on sales of 5.5%. We incurred a $49 million impairment charge related to the three plant closures we announced Friday. Although it's always a difficult decision to close a plant let along three, it was necessary to improve our capacity utilization and streamline our cost structure. We aren't eliminating any sales volume from the closings. We're simply shifting the mix to more efficient facilities, because it's imperative that we are cost competitive in these predominantly private label and foodservice categories. Also in the Prepared Foods Q3 results were higher raw material cost of $95 million. Although this is typically recovered in future quarters, we're working on reducing the lag in our formula pricing to help our earnings correlate more closely with moves in the input cost.","Parts of legacy Prepared Foods segment are performing extremely well and the outlook for 2015 shows considerable improvement. Additionally, we expect to realize substantial synergies from the combination of our Prepared Foods business with Hillshire. Synergies are expected to come from operational improvements, purchasing and distribution. And when combined with the plant closure cost savings and efficiencies, it will be more than $225 million in fiscal 2015 and should exceed $500 million by the end of year three. We'll be looking at revising the normalized range for the Prepared Foods segment after the transaction closes.","Finally, the International segment had a negative 4.1% return on sales. Sales volume has improved and operating losses were cut in half from Q2 to Q3. Demand in China is in the early stages of recovery, but it's slow and as indicated by the recent news of another food scandal still vulnerable to food safety concerns. While a negative short-term demand, these events continue to reinforce the validity of our business model in China, which emphasizes biosecurity, supply chain integrity and food safety. We're currently seeing better supply balance resulting from a drop in grandparent stock imports, which will be supportive of pricing in 2015. As for our business, we're now processing 100% company-controlled birds and have eliminated market birds entirely from our supply chain.","Also regarding our International segment, we announced this morning that we're selling our operations in Mexico and Brazil to JBS for $575 million. Although these are good businesses with great team members, we haven't had the necessary scale to be a market share leader in either country, which is our preferred position. The sale represents an attractive price and the proceeds will be used to pay down debt associated with the Hillshire acquisition.","Now to wrap up my thoughts on Q3 and fiscal '14, despite the challenges in our Chicken segment and Prepared Foods segments, we believe we'll still generate an adjusted EPS of at least $2.78 a share in FY '14, which is more than a 20% growth over last year. Just to clarify, that excludes any earnings or costs associated with Hillshire. FY '15 is setting up to be another record year for sales, operating income and EPS. We'll have a better idea of how we'll look on our November call, but initially we expect Chicken margins to be at or above 10% as we get past the issues in the two value-added plants I told you about and we see the benefits from around $400 million in lower feed ingredient cost. We think these import margins would look similar to FY '14.","Prepared Foods margins should be much stronger as we run a sound legacy business and integrate Hillshire into Prepared Foods segment. We're excited about the synergy prospects as we execute our Prepared Foods strategy and anticipate more than $225 million in synergies in 2015 and $500 million by the end of the third year. The International segment's operating income should improve by about $50 million. We're expecting to continue our trend of at least 10% EPS growth. And we anticipate Hillshire being accretive to earnings next year and substantially accretive thereafter.","And now let's go to Dennis for the financial update.","Dennis Leatherby","Thanks, Donnie, and good morning. We had a second setting third quarter. Our topline revenue growth was 11% over Q3 a year ago and quarterly sales again surpassed the $9 billion mark. We continue to execute our growth strategy as evidenced by increased sales volumes in Chicken, Pork and Prepared Foods. Total company adjusted return on sales was 4.2% and adjusted operating income was $407 million or $351 million prior to the adjustments described in our press release.","Our adjusted earnings of $0.75 per share is a record for our third quarter and represents a 9% increase over adjusted EPS of $0.69 in Q3 of '13. Our GAAP earnings this quarter were $0.73 and we also provided a reconciliation in our press release. Year-to-date adjusted EPS is $2.07 or a 33% increase compared to last year's $1.56 adjusted EPS coming from continuing operations. We achieved an adjusted 12-month pre-tax return on invested capital of just over 20% compared to 17% for the prior-year period. Operating cash flow through three quarters was $543 million after funding $479 million in additional working capital as we grew our business.","We spent $144 million on capital expenditures for the third quarter and $437 million for the first nine months of fiscal '14. This outpaced our depreciation and amortization by $55 million as we continued to invest in projects that not only result in improved productive capabilities, labor efficiencies, yields and sales mix, but will also increase our ability to innovate and introduce new products to our customers.","During the third quarter, we did not repurchase any shares under our share repurchase program. This was a conscious decision to maximize liquidity for the upcoming Hillshire Brands acquisition. As a reminder, since May 2011, we have repurchased just over 50 million shares at an average price of about $24 per share. In order to facilitate deleveraging, we currently do not plan to repurchase shares other than to fund obligations under our equity compensation programs.","Our effective tax rate in Q3 was 16.8%. On an adjusted basis, this rate was 31.2%. Net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 0.6 times. And on our gross debt-to-EBITDA basis, this measure was 0.9 times. Including cash of $587 million, net debt was $1.2 billion. Total liquidity was just over $1.5 billion, remaining above our goal of $1.2 billion. And gross debt remained at just over $1.8 billion.","Year-to-date net interest expense was $72 million, down 30% from a year ago. Average diluted shares for the quarter were 356 million. This reflects the dilutive effect of options and warrants of $3 million settled earlier in the quarter. Consistent with our Prepared Foods strategy, we will close three plants to improve capacity utilization and streamline our cost structure. We expect the closure of these facilities will result in significant cost savings and production efficiencies, but will be revenue-neutral as the sales volumes of these closed plants will be absorbed by capacity at existing facilities.","Additionally, our Prepared Foods segment will benefit from the addition of a great business in Hillshire Brands. We will achieve significant synergies from operational improvements, purchasing and distribution. For fiscal 2015, we expect the impact of the Hillshire brand synergies along with the cost savings and production efficiencies associated with the plant closures will positively impact our Prepared Foods segment by more than $225 million and should exceed $500 million by the third year following the close of the acquisition.","Additionally, as announced today, we've entered into an agreement to sell our chicken operations in Mexico and Brazil for $575 million. This transaction is expected to close in the next few months and we plan to use the sales proceeds to delever following the Hillshire Brands acquisition.","Now here're some thoughts on the full year for fiscal '14 and some thoughts on fiscal '15. Please note the outlook for fiscal '15 does assume that the Hillshire acquisition will close in fiscal 2014. Additionally, the fiscal '15 outlook also factors in the sale of our Mexico and Brazil operations along with the synergies expected from the Hillshire acquisition and the closing of the three Prepared Foods plants. We expect revenues of approximately $38 billion for fiscal '14, which is 10% growth over fiscal '13. Revenues for fiscal '15 are expected to grow 11% to $42 billion.","Net interest expense should approximate $130 million for fiscal '14, including the financing for the Hillshire Brands acquisition. For fiscal 2015, we expect net interest expense of $290 million, reflecting the full impact of the financing. The adjusted effective tax rate should be around 34.5% for fiscal '14 and is expected to be around 36% for fiscal 2015. CapEx is expected to be $600 million to $650 million for fiscal 2014 and for fiscal 2015 CapEx is expected to approximate $900 million as we not only look for projects that improve productive capabilities, labor efficiencies, yields and sales mix, but to also implement projects that drive efficiencies between Tyson and Hillshire Brands for future growth.","We expected diluted shares in Q4 of approximately $356 million prior to the equity offerings we launched this morning. You can refer to our pro forma information filed earlier today for the potential additional shares. We still believe we'll generate at least $2.78 adjusted EPS, which is more than 20% growth over fiscal '13. This excludes any earnings or costs associated with the Hillshire acquisition.","Fiscal '15 is setting up to be another record year for sales, operating income and EPS. Chicken margins should be at or above 10%. Prepared Foods margins should be stronger as we integrate Hillshire and realize the benefits of the significant synergies and other operational improvements within our legacy Prepared Foods business as we execute our Prepared Foods strategy. The International segment should improve by $50 million. And as a result, we expect at least 10% EPS growth and the Hillshire acquisition to be accretive in 2015 and substantially accretive in future years.","Our priorities for excess cash are significant deleveraging from the strong combined cash flows of Tyson and Hillshire, capital spending to improve and grow our existing businesses, acquisitions to fulfill our growth strategies around value-added products in International, and returning the cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends all while ensuring we maintain plenty of liquidity.","To wrap up, with the operational disruptions and other significant challenges we faced throughout the quarter, we still maintained focus and delivered another record quarter with adjusted earnings per share of 33% for the year. We believe the fourth quarter should be almost as strong and we are confident we can deliver on our targets.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Kelly, we're ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Diane Geissler, and she is with CLSA.","Diane Geissler - CLSA","I wanted to ask about the US chicken operations and the operational issues that you had during the quarter. When you look at that, in particular the second plant where you said you had to order machinery, it's not going to be back up online until, I guess, the first quarter of fiscal '15, did that cause you to go back and look at all of your other facilities, because I know you went through a period when grain prices were very high that you had cut CapEx, et cetera? Just a little bit nervous about being so close to complete capacity utilization that if you have one outage, it causes such a problem. And then the second question I have is just relating to the new segment reporting where you're stripping out International. Can you give us an idea about what you think the domestic business should carry on a normalized basis in terms of the margin there?","Donnie Smith","Yes, we have been through all of our facilities. And a couple of things that we'll do differently, we'll move some of the retail fully cooked capacity among other plants, which will add a little bit of buffer in preventing these types of things from happening again. Also, we have pinpointed all of the locations where we can and should over the next few incremental quarters put in fully cooked capacity. We'll have two more lines that will come on right after the first year, so call that about Q2 of FY '15. And frankly, we need that capacity early in that fiscal year.","Also, on your second question, when you carve out international in the Chicken segment, I think for '15, we feel very good about being at or above 10%. And we're at the point where we're rethinking our normalized range for chicken. It's a little bit early with all that we've got going on in that segment in this quarter till we get all of our productive capability back up and all of that to do that. But we're rethinking that and we'll be talking about that in subsequent quarters.","Diane Geissler - CLSA","So maybe just as a follow-up to that, I think your previous range was 5% to 7%. I guess what I'm trying to ask here is your guidance for fiscal '15 at 10%-plus would be above a normalized range for the US operation?","Donnie Smith","Yes, certainly.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brett Hundley from BB&T Capital Markets.","Brett Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets","My first question is just on the Prepared Foods segment and the language that you guys gave for 2015. Can you discuss at all the synergy portion from Hillshire? Does that take up a majority of that $225 million? Is it half? Can you just speak to that and also speak to whether you're taking into account rebound in Hillshire business if in fact PED comes off and some of those costs abate?","Donnie Smith","So your second question first is no. And on your first question, think about the legacy Tyson Prepared Foods synergies being a little over half of that $225 million. So you can see it's fairly balanced. There's a lot of opportunity there. And those synergies are around operational efficiencies, purchasing, supply chain efficiencies, those types of things. So we feel really good about our ability to capture those.","Brett Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets","And then just my second question is back to your legacy Chicken business. Donnie, with the drop in feed, can you just talk a little bit about your approach going forward? Do you think that you guys would become a little bit longer as it relates to your procurement of feed and just again going back to the confidence that you have that Chicken margins can be even up again year-on-year for 2015? I appreciate it.","Donnie Smith","Yeah. So two things. Number one, on our commodity procurement strategy, we really won't change that very much. I mean we always look for opportunities when they present themselves to use options to help us with some of the commodity volatility. But we're pretty conservative when it comes to grain. We want to make our money growing, processing, marketing and selling chickens. So on the other part, I'm going to say how to think about chicken going forward, so we're leaving a good bit of money on the table in Q3 and Q4. So that then will be captured. And then as we continue to grow value-added, our case-ready chicken business is doing very, very well as breast chicken at retail becomes much more popular with consumers, particularly in light of the really high beef and pork prices, so we've got to expand that part of our business and we'll be working on that as well.","So we feel very comfortable with our '15 outlook in terms of what we're doing with our mix and how we view our underlying cost structure. The one question that some investors want to know about is, okay, what about chicken supply. And as we look at that, we don't see that there will be a meaningful increase in chicken supply until around the 4th of July or so next year. So if you look at all of that combined, that sets us for a very good '15 for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Farha Aslam from Stephens.","Farha Aslam - Stephens","A quick question about your 10% earnings guidance growth for next year. Is that kind of off of that $2.78 base that you're discussing, because Donnie, your comments were that you're very confident about 10% growth? And Dennis, your comments about the fourth quarter implied about a $2.78, $2.80 year. But consensus is at $2.90. I just want to clarify the outlook that you're providing.","Dennis Leatherby","We keep saying we expect to do at least $2.78 so be expecting the 10% growth over that.","Farha Aslam - Stephens","And then in terms of the Hillshire synergies, I mean that step-up versus your initial $300 million comment is pretty material. And I was just wondering in particular as you got under the covers basically on Hillshire and got a deeper read, what makes you confident about that significant bump-up in synergies?","Donnie Smith","So when we look to combining our legacy Prepared Foods business and Hillshire together, the businesses are very complementary and the more time that we now have gotten to spend with some of the Hillshire folks as we begin planning the integration, it's pretty easy to see that there's going to be significant synergies in supply chain arena and logistics and operational efficiencies and those kind of things. Plus we had an early conversation about latent capacity and the footprint. And so as we work through that, what it made sense to do is to unfortunately close those three locations and then move that production into more efficient facilities that frankly had better supply chain cost as well. So when you combine all of that together, that's how we got to at least $225 million number. We feel really good then about adding to not just the legacy deal continuing to improve after that, but certainly with the Hillshire synergies combined being able to build that on up to at least $500 million range.","Farha Aslam - Stephens","And will some of those $500 million be captured in your Pork division as you source that product internally more and more, that supply?","Donnie Smith","No, we do believe there's great value end-to-end in Pork and Prepared Foods. But we're just talking about the synergies that will be reported in the Prepared Foods segment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs","A little bit more detail on the forward chicken supply outlook. And, Donnie, I was hoping you could comment on your own order book at Cobb and how you see that order book playing out over the next year, year-and-a-half in relation to kind of future growth in pullets and chickens in US.","Donnie Smith","As I said on one of the previous questions, what it look like to us in terms of the pullet supply coming to the market as far as the building the breeder herd or flock, it looks like to me the increase in broiler meat on the market would appear at about somewhere mid-summer, so call it 4th of July. And I think that before that, it's just physiologically impossible to get a whole lot more supply on this market.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs","And then on the confidence in the Chicken margins next year, I mean excluding some of the operational issues that you had this year, looks like fiscal '14 would have been somewhere in the 8% to 9% range for the whole year. Is the improvement then just solely on feed with stable pricing or is there something else there beyond the feed costs that give you the confidence in the margin expansion?","Donnie Smith","As you look at the environment, you got to believe that beef prices in terms of price situation, you're going to have a similar environment next year as this year. As you get into pork, it looks like to us that more hogs are going to be coming to the market in the fall. With grain prices coming down, you're likely to see a little bit of finished hog expansion perhaps in the latter part of our fiscal '15. So that's just a great environment there in the pricing structure. The parts of our business where the demand is growing are in profitable parts of our business, our fresh chicken business. And unfortunately because of the operational issues, our value-added business is seeing great demand. As you saw during the school season in the winter a lot of demand for fully cooked retail products, so as we get our capacity back on line, that looks like it will be another great year for us.","So you're really talking about three things. Yes, you're going to have a favorable grain environment. You're also going to have a favorable market environment structurally in terms of chicken and its relative pricing to beef and pork. And the parts of our business where we're seeing the greater demand are the parts of our business where we have good margins.","Operator","Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale from KeyBanc.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc","So first question is on the '15 guidance. I'm trying to reconcile two things. One is at least 10% EPS growth implies around, I think, $3.06 or $3.05 in EPS if you take $2.78 as the base. And then if I look at your operating income guidance for Chicken and the other segments, I'm getting to much higher consolidated EBIT growth. Obviously the interest expense is going up. But when I factor all of that in, including the estimate that you've given on the share issuance this morning, it looks like 10% EPS growth is very conservative. I'm getting to closer to 20%. I mean can you give us some help? I know there's some things you can't comment on. But the EBIT guidance seems to be well in excess of what you're calling sort of 10% growth. So can you just help me out a little bit there?","Dennis Leatherby","It's early for us coming out of Q3, right? I would agree that our earnings guidance is conservative, but that's because we're early. So here's how we think about that. So let's just talk in ballpark terms, okay? If you look at how you view where this year is going to end up, if you look at the last 12 months, it's like a 1.6% in operating income-wise. You can back in using at least the $2.78. And then if you take 10% return on sales on our Chicken business, that's going to be worth an incremental $200 million or so. If you look at Hillshire's earnings, you got to be thinking about an incremental $400 million or so. The Prepared Foods synergies will be $225 million. International will improve by about $50 million or so.","You're right on the interest expense and it's probably a little early to talk about that in too specific a detail other than we're estimating pro forma is about $2.90. So then you use 36% tax rate and adjust for the new shares. And I think you got the math.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc","And second question is just a follow-up to, I guess, what Farha was saying. The $500 million synergy number is impressive in itself in terms of just increasing it from $300 million so fast. But can you just help us understand eventually what impact might this acquisition have on your Pork business? And also, does it have the potential to positively impact the Prepared Foods portion of the Chicken business? And ultimately, are those two factors that will really in your mind make this a really successful acquisition versus an okay one?","Donnie Smith","Well, we certainly believe this is going to be an extremely successful acquisition. If you look at the Pork segment, end-to-end, and we look at end-to-end value creation, we see a lot of opportunity there. I would hasten on to say it's a little bit too early. We see Hillshire a little bit today, but not very much. So we'll need to get through the deal itself and then be able to drill down on that a little bit more. But that certainly seems like that there should be two benefits, one, a stabilization of earnings between the two segments and then there should be some opportunity end-to-end to capture even more savings. So that's how we're looking at that.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc","Can you give us some guidance on D&A for '15? And I'm assuming a share count of between 405 million and 410 million. Is that roughly correct?","Dennis Leatherby","Akshay, I can't comment on the share count. That's related to the equity offering. As Jon said upfront, we can't comment on that. But if you do have the information out there, help you with the calculation. As far as D&A goes, think about $700 million or so.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Piken from Cleveland Research.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research","Just want to get your thoughts on what your expectations are for the industry in terms of taking the normal seasonal fall cuts. Do you expect people to sort of take the normal levels? Or do you think with the margins being as strong as they are that we might see people hold on their pullets a little bit longer?","Donnie Smith","I can only comment on what we're doing. Typically we'll pull out a couple of days in the fall for placement cuts for the holidays. This year, because frankly, we've dug a pretty deep hole in our value-added business. We are going to need to back off what we typically do just a hair to make sure that we've got the raw material supply to be able to run what then will be all of our fully cooked lines running full, because we've got to build back the pipe and we've got to build some incremental inventory for promotional activity next year because of the situation that we've caused with our customers this year. So I can only talk about what we'll do. And that's not a significant increase in production. What I just said is just we're going to need some incremental particularly breast meat to keep running our FP lines full.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research","And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're no longer buying breast meat the open market. Is that sort of a long-term strategy or would you expect to kind of switch back once you get everything ramped up back to the old strategy of buying on the open market?","Donnie Smith","I don't remember that being said. And if it was said, it was said by mistake, because we're still buying not only breast meat, but we're buying some tenders. And frankly, Michael, one of the customer-related issues is if you're shortened on the FP, you sure don't need to have full service and full order fill in their fresh offering, particularly as important as that is today in light of how beef and pork prices. And so frankly, we've been buying some whole birds and we've been buying some other parts to take into our tray pack plants and frankly run that on overtime. Now that's not a favorable economic position, but we're going to fix our fully cooked issue. And when we do, we don't want to make customer any angrier than they already are about not getting their orders. So we've made a decision to take very good care of them in all other lines of business, so that we can quickly recoup from the FP side. So yes, we're very much out in the marketplace, buying raw material.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research","And then lastly just shifting over to the Pork side of the business, obviously you did very well in the face of PEDV. I mean I guess if you could just talk about sort of some of the factors. Has this been sort of all demand-driven or was this some operational things you did right and sort of what are your expectations for kind of going forward? I know you said PEDV, it's too early to call, but it sounds like you're expecting supplies to alleviate. Any other color you can provide on how you're able to do so well in pork would be helpful.","Donnie Smith","We think that what we'll see about for the year will be about 5% less hogs. Now we're at the point where we are seeing, I guess, the biggest supply dip. But I also want to say that on the national numbers if you take out North Carolina and Oklahoma, then the supply dip for the industry is really only about 3%. And so most of our hog operations are in Eastern Nebraska and Iowa. And so we have a very good grasp of the supply situation around us. What our team did to manage that, number one, we worked very closely with our customers on those items that are sold off-site by the each instead about a pound, knowing that with a little bit cheaper grain basis in the Midwest, hog producers were going to be able to put a little bit more weight on the hogs, which thankfully they put considerable more weight on the hogs, which has offset some of the volume in things like hams and that type thing.","But now with bellies or ribs, we've worked with our customers very closely to manage those promotions. Secondly, we have very good relationships with our hog producers, most of whom we've been doing business with for years. We've stayed very close to them. And we're able to dial in the supply fairly specifically at least to the point that we can move hogs between facilities in order to spread out the production runs and give ourselves the best opportunity to service our orders. So when you combine those two things, our team really, really did a great job.","In terms of fresh pork supply and demand, the demand for pork is up significantly. We know the pounds are going to be down just because we're not producing them. But in the last four weeks ended in May, pork pricing just in that last four weeks at retail was up 23%. So the demand for pork is very strong. Frankly, the demand for beef and chicken is very strong. It's just chicken has been the only one to really be able to supply some portion of the demand. So if you look at ground beef pricing for the four weeks ended, you're up 12.5%. Fresh beef was up 10.5%. Chicken was up another 4.5%. And like I said, fresh pork was up 23%. So the demand for protein is really strong.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal.","Ken Zaslow - Bank of Montreal","Just starting off, just so I understand the guidance for a second, you have about $100 million less chicken profitability and you have higher interest expense and less share repurchases. Is that kind of what I'm hearing?","Dennis Leatherby","When we said $130 million for '14, that was inclusive of the initial Hillshire financing. When we talk about the $2.78, though, it's still up the old run rate that we described before of about $95 million or $100 million.","Ken Zaslow - Bank of Montreal","But still, you're keeping your guidance. So you did stop your share repurchases, which is probably another $0.02 to $0.03. And you had about $100 million that you're going to lose in your chicken profitability because of operational issues. And you're still hitting the numbers?","Donnie Smith","And the other thing to perhaps not miss there is in Q3, we absorbed $95 million in incremental Prepared Foods raw material cost that we did not recapture all of that in our pricing structure because of the way our pricing works. By the way, that's up $160 million for the year. And so there was the $50 million write-off in Prepared Foods, but there was also the inability because the markets were still going up to capture any raw material costs. So if the markets will stabilize, then that capture will happen in future quarters. Now we're doing what we can to shorten the lag. But it takes a while to work through that. So I think that's another important thing to keep in mind.","Ken Zaslow - Bank of Montreal","So your base number is actually higher than what you're saying and then you expect to grow 10% off that. Is that a fair way of also thinking about it a little bit?","Donnie Smith","I think the easiest way to look at that is what we've said was our EPS guidance would be off where we land this year. But I think we can see that there's upside potential to that. We're just talking about this now in our Q3, which normally we don't talk about that too much until November. So I think what we're trying to say is we've got a pretty conservative baseline of growth with upside to that.","Ken Zaslow - Bank of Montreal","Then my two follow-up questions. One is you obviously have a better clarity to the cost savings. What did you find out that gives you any confidence or change your view on that? Obviously, you probably had one or two meetings with the Hillshire folks. Can you talk about that and exactly why you came up with a different synergy number?","Donnie Smith","You're exactly right, Ken. We would have this assumption about a particular category and let's say some category and purchasing. And so we have a quick conversation and you find, you know what, that's probably not right. But here is another category where we didn't think there might be very much savings, there ends up being more. When we look at capacity utilization, when we look at transportation and logistics savings around, we have a different basic tenet around our distribution model. And so being able to combine that and get fuller trucks and both refrigerated and frozen been able to shorten the distance of the raw material travels to the manufacturing plant that we can figure out how to do a network optimization model to streamline that all the way to the customer, those are some of the things as we started these conversations that get popping up, that makes us feel really good about what we see going forward.","And two, our very use in our synergy number is really, let's call them, hard synergies. Call it savings and supply chain savings and purchasing savings and that kind of thing. When you start thinking about the innovative capability, new product development, sales growth, efficient map spending and brand spending, there is a lot of incremental value that will be created through this acquisition. On the front end, especially before the deals are even closed, we want to only talk about those hard synergies that we can report back on every quarter.","Ken Zaslow - Bank of Montreal","And then my last question is you didn't talk about hog supply and impact. Again, I guess PED virus. But I'm actually thinking about the hog production margin. I know you're not in the business of hog production. It seemed to be pretty great if not at near-record levels. I would assume that there would be some expectation of expansion over the next two to three months. What's your take on that? And then how is that factored into your expectation, because I'm assuming you don't expect (inaudible) prices to be at $90.","Donnie Smith","So here's the way we're thinking about that, Ken. First, a hog producer that did not have PED is having an outstanding year. Unfortunately, many have had PED, and obviously that's a devastating loss to those farms. If you go back into the early spring, there was a potential to lock up really decent margins hedging. And so a lot of guys put on hedges and their margin calls have been significant. And so frankly the farm banks have been, I think, a little hesitant maybe so far until these producers are able to clear that hedge in Chicago, the margin issue in Chicago, by selling out the hogs. They've been a little bit hesitant, as we understand it, to talk much about expansion. But in my opinion, as you get on into the fall, assuming of course that we don't (inaudible) that we have a decent corn crop, there's going to be a compelling financial case for a lot of these hog producers who have healed in a lot of their balance sheet to be able to add some finishing capacity and move forward.","And I think the finishing capacity is probably the capacity to spend on is probably the cheaper to spend. And so that gives us confidence that with the biosecurity precautions that producers have taken, they're seeing incremental benefits in other diseases that they typically work with during the year too. So that gives us confidence that we're going to see the hogs up about 2% or so next year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale from KeyBanc.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc","Thanks for taking the follow-up. First one is on Chicken. So there's two questions. A 10% margin would be obviously the highest. Not only annual margin, but I think, even on a quarterly basis, we haven't seen 10% from your Chicken business, at least in a while. So help me understand why that's not only possible, but perhaps conservative and something you're confident in. And secondly, what happens when chicken supply does pick up? In terms of the range, where are we now in terms of bottom of the margin range for Tyson, because we could argue and debate what the top end is, because you haven't really pushed that up as much as we would have thought? But certainly I think you've proven that the bottom end is higher. So when chicken supply does pick up maybe in 2016, what's the worst we could see from the Chicken business?","Donnie Smith","So let's think about '15 first. Obviously we're leaving money on the table with our production issues. Then so if you just pull that $100 million or so in and then we're going to have grain down, say, $400 million, and remember the parts of our business where we're seeing the greatest demand is the parts of our business where we have the best margin structure, rightfully so. And so when you put all three of those things together, I think it's pretty easy to see that if you do 10% on $11 billion business, that's pretty easy math.","Now let's think about going forward into the latter part of '15 and on into '15. So because we are working hard to maintain our investment-grade rating to keep a grade capital structure, we're going to have the available cash flows to be able to keep spending on our business and we intend to do that and we've got several projects in chicken where we can continue to spend money and generate cost efficiencies. And I think we've done pretty well over the last three or four years proving that we can do that. I think over a four-year average, it'll probably be like 25%-ish on our CapEx all in. So we know how to spend efficiently to gain cost improvements.","Second thing, we'll continue to grow our value-added business. Frankly, the only thing keeping us from selling a whole lot more value-added is our productive capability. So we're getting all of that fixed, more case-ready. Case-ready chicken is growing at retail, because we have decent pork prices. I think that will continue for several years and we'll continue to add capacity into that offering. By the way, we'll grow our no-antibiotic-ever line of predominantly fresh chicken. So we've got opportunity there.","What we strive for, Akshay, is a more stable business model. We have birds in all of the major bird-size classes. And we strive for variable pricing models to be able to deliver consistent growing earnings over time. And we spend a lot of time getting this business under us. Unfortunately we've had that production issue in the last half of this year. But once we get that behind us, I think we've got a great future going forward.","Then if you look at the rest of the business, our case-ready beef and pork offering will continue to grow. Of course, we're adding Hillshire, great capabilities there, plus all of the synergies there. We should see adequate pork supply. We'll start seeing some improvement in our international business. We'll see benefit from our legacy Prepared Foods benefits as we get the production footprint right and stabilize the raw material.","So when you combine all that, that's a great story going forward that will carry you beyond '15 on into the '16-plus. And besides that, keeping that investment-grade rating and then rapidly delevering this debt, we have multiple growth options open to us in the very not-too-distant future. And that's important to continue the Tyson story upfront.","Operator","Thank you. And I'd like to turn the conference call back over to Donnie for any closing remarks.","Donnie Smith","Thanks, Kelly. Hey, before we go, let me just reiterate a few key points. Number one, we expect to continue our trend of at least 10% EPS growth next year. We anticipate Hillshire being accretive to earnings in 2015 and substantially accretive thereafter. We think our Prepared Foods segment synergies will be over $225 million as we execute our Prepared Foods strategy in 2015 and $500 million by the end of the three years.","So thanks for joining us today and we hope you have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

For GAAP results and adjustment reconciliations please refer to this morning\u2019s press release. ","I\u2019d also like to point out that our accounting cycle will result in a 53-week year in 2015. To make comparisons easier the projections in our outlook have been adjusted to a 52-week year unless otherwise noted. Following our prepared remarks we\u2019ll go to Q&A. To ensure we get to as many of you as possible please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up and then get back in the queue for any additional questions.","I'll now turn the call over to Donnie Smith.","Donnie Smith","Thanks Jon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. Well Q4 was a record quarter with adjusted earnings of $0.87 a share, which is a 24% year-over-year improvement. 2014 was an outstanding year. So let\u2019s look at some of the highlights. We have record adjusted EPS of $2.94, a 30% improvement over last year. Sales were a record $37.6 billion. Adjusted operating income was also a record at $1.65 billion, a 20% increase over last year. Our overall adjusted operating margin was 4.4% and most important in 2014 we completed the acquisition of Hillshire brand, a watershed event that will take Tyson to a new level as a branded food company. ","It was a great year, one in which we structurally improved the earnings power and reduced the volatility of the business. But I don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time looking back because we have so much more to be excited about in 2015 and 2016 and for years to come. So let\u2019s take a look at the segments and see how the events of Q4 lead us into 2015. ","In Q4 the Chicken segment reported, on an adjusted basis, a 7.4% return on sales, with volume up 2.3% and average pricing down 4%. You\u2019ll remember on our last call that I told you about temporary disruptions in two plants that would affect our return on sales in the third and fourth quarters. We have corrected those issues and began bringing production back on line in Q1. We\u2019ll be adding much needed value added capacity in the spring for fully cooked and tray-packed chicken. Demand for tray-packed is growing as retail consumers seek fresh healthy options. ","It\u2019s important to understand that we\u2019re not increasing supply but rather shifting capacity to a more value-added product mix. Also to support growth in fresh chicken we very efficiently used a small amount of MAP spending to generate over 800 million consumer impressions and it's helped widen the gap over our competitors as the number one brand in the country. ","We're also experiencing double-digit growth in our NatureRaised Farms brand of no-antibiotics-ever chicken. Although it's only a small piece of our branded chicken business, we're pleased with the demand for these products and the premium consumers are willing to pay for them. As you probably saw in our press release this morning we have raised the normalized operating margin range for the chicken segment to 7% to 9% but we expect to exceed that in fiscal \u201815 with more than a 10% return on sales. With consumption shifting away from high priced beef we expect chicken demand to increase by at least 3% in 2015 which should support our pricing expectations given that chicken supplies are projected to be up about 3% for the year. ","Additionally, our domestic feed cost should be down by about $350 million. An important report to remember about our chicken business is that we have a diversified value-added portfolio and we don't require record chicken prices and cheap corn to do well. We use our buy versus grow strategy to take advantage of pricing when there is more chicken on the market and we do expect more supply in 2016 but we'll need it to meet demand. Our strategy is steady growth, not a commodity roller coaster ride. With our business model we don't view increased supply as a problem. ","I'll move on to the beef segment which had a 3.5% return on sales for the quarter. Volume was down only 2.6% and I say only because pricing was up 21.5%. Our team did a great job of managing the spread in times of record high cattle costs. We anticipate fed [ph] cattle supplies to be down about 4% in 2015, but that should be the worst of it. There are indications of heifer retention to rebuild the herd. Supplies are expected to be flat to down about 1% in 2016 and as a positive for Tyson the cattle population continues to move closer to our plants in the Midwest.","With good export demand, domestic pricing in 2015 will test how much people really want beef, but it's clear that demand for beef is very strong and will provide support for chicken and pork pricing. One of the things that\u2019s really impressed me over the past few years is our ability to manage through a low volume environment. We continue to find ways to become the high revenue low cost player in the regions we compete. How we run a commodity business is more important than the commodity volatility. A good example of our margin mentality is our continuing success in producing more case-ready beef which drives incremental sales, margins and consumer occasions. ","Turning to the pork segment, which had a 6.1% return on sales in the fourth quarter, volume was about flat to Q4 last year on a 16.5% increase in pricing. The PED virus reduced hog availability and our pork team did a good job of hog procurement in a time of tight supply which kept our capacity utilization well above industry averages. As the supply of hogs tightened this past year it demonstrated the relative inelasticity of certain type of our pork bellies [ph] for bacon. ","From an end-to-end perspective we find ways to reduce volatility and improve our margins. While I expect global beef and pork supplies to remain tight and to keep pricing at higher levels the structural shift towards increased global protein consumption will continue to driving incremental demand for our products.","Looking at fiscal '15 we expect a 2% to 3% expansion in hog supplies and it appears there will be fewer instances of PEDv coming off of reduced numbers last year. In addition to constrained beef production we think consumer demand will support a 2% to 3% pork supply increase. So 2015 should be another good year for Pork segment margins.","In our International segment as previously announced we\u2019ll use the proceeds from the sale of our Latin American businesses, one of which is expected to close by the end of this month to pay down debt. We made these decisions to generate better long term ROIC. I want to emphasize that we're committed to doing business in Mexico and supporting our customer\u2019s growth there. China remains in somewhat of a holding pattern. We are in position to take advantage when demand improves and will continue to assess the situation with an eye towards the best long-term shareholder return. ","In fiscal '15 we expect to cut operational losses to $50 million for the International segment. And finally in the Prepared Foods segment, our legacy Tyson business reported an adjusted 1.8% return on sales for the fourth quarter. Volume was basically flat with average pricing of 5.5%. We\u2019ve taken measures to right-size our operations by closing three plants and we're getting our SG&A in line. We continue to be ROIC focused in our decision making and good allocators of capital for our shareholders.","Looking forward, the new Prepared Foods segment, including Hillshire is starting 2015 in a good position with the plant closures, our capacity utilization is improving to the desired levels and our operations are becoming more efficient. We recovered pork and beef input pricing but we\u2019ll have to stay on top it as we anticipate a $140 million of incremental raw material cost in 2015 primarily from increased beef prime [ph] and turkey pricing.","With the price increases we\u2019ve implemented so far pro forma volume has been about flat to a year ago. Investing in brand building and innovation are vitally important to our branded CPG business and I can assure you that we are not slowing down the Hillshire innovation pipeline. They are speeding us up. We\u2019re not only launching on-trend consumer driven innovation this year we\u2019re supporting our past innovation launches, a critical part of ensuring long-term success. ","In our last quarter of fiscal \u201814 Hillshire launched the line of Jimmy Dean frozen sandwiches and bowls for lunch and dinner taking the brand beyond breakfast. This expansion into a new day part has achieved very good incremental distribution of 16 premium priced items thanks to our retail partners. We have a strong innovative marketing program for this launch including television, digital and shopper marketing support. ","Another big platform carrying over from 2014 is Hillshire Farm Naturals lunch meat. It provides the cleaner label consumers are looking for without sacrificing taste and quality. While we are in the early end of the launch the results are extremely positive. It\u2019s growing incremental purchasers and 80% of consumers who bought the product reported it\u2019s even better than they expected.","In addition to those two big platforms we are extending and supporting our innovation launches from early in fiscal \u201914. In retail we\u2019re launching new extensions to expand Ball Park, Park's Finest franks. These premium hot dogs deliver a flavor adventure and nothing artificial and they are a growing category. We\u2019re also extending our Hillshire Farm American Craft line of handcrafted, small batch smoked sausage with new products featuring authentic ingredients in bold flavors. And at food service we are extending our Chef Pierre Luxe Layer pies. We\u2019ll invest in MAP spending to continue growth in the second year of these success new platforms.","In the back half of the year our focus will be around two new snacking platforms. We know that shift to snacking is here to stay and believe that we have the right to win with our brands in protein snacking. One of those launches Hillshire Snacking has been in the test market since Q4 and looks to have a lot of potential, delivering incremental sales and growing the category. You will hear a lot more about innovation at Investor Day on December 10th where you will get to try some of these products.","To wrap up my thoughts on the Prepared Foods segment, although it\u2019s going to take three years to fully realize all of the synergies we expect the segment to earn a 10% to 12% return on sales on a normalized basis after couple of months of working together and really drilling down on the synergy target we\u2019re more confident than ever that we\u2019ll capture more than $225 million in the first year and more than $500 million by the end of year three.","I need to clarify that not of the synergies will fall within the Prepared Foods segment. Synergies within shared services for example would be allocated across all the segments but the majority will be in Prepared Foods. So now that I have given you our outlook for each of the segments let\u2019s take a broader look at some reasons we are so optimistic.","First, we\u2019re disciplined in our approach towards managing our business. The understanding of the consumer-centric demand and overall supply fundamentals allows us to make decisions that are ROIC-based and provide the least volatility and best prospects for long-term growth. When we assess the demand picture we are uniquely positioned to deliver against changing consumer needs with a portfolio that delivers against every meal occasion throughout the store and across the menu. ","It\u2019s not just the breadth of our portfolio that\u2019s exciting it\u2019s the depth, along with our innovation that delivers against increasing consumer demand for naturally occurring high quality protein snacks and meals. Consumer behavior at both retail and food service reflect this change. At retail growth is occurring at the perimeter of the store and in a few frozen categories with two of the biggest being chicken and protein breakfast which favor our portfolio. We\u2019re also entrenched with the leading quick service, full service, and fast casual restaurants at dressing [ph] this year. If past consumer behavior remains the same and we believe it will, the recent drop in gas prices will put more money back into consumer wallets which will result in increased meals away from home. ","So in a macro sense Tyson has the right brand and the right products in the right places for today\u2019s consumers. But let\u2019s take a look at some more specifics for fiscal \u201815 and why we feel so good about it. With six weeks under our belt it\u2019s already off to a great start. We expect adjusted earnings in the range of $3.30 to $3.40 a share. That's more than 12% growth over fiscal '14. We'll gain momentum throughout the year as we integrate Hillshire and cash the synergies. Our beef and pork prices will be supportive of pricing throughout all of our segments. We'll grow our value added chicken, much needed fresh tray pack and full through the fully cooked chicken capacity will be becoming online in the spring. ","We have a series of new product launches in the pipeline. We're investing in brand building and innovation and we're investing disproportionately over depreciation throughout our business as part of our culture of continues improvement. And let\u2019s keep looking ahead in 2016, it's unusual for us to talk about our business more than a year out, but we see a lot to be confident about. We'll be in our second year of capturing synergies and improvements as we maximize the benefits of combining of Tyson and Hillshire. ","If chicken supply allows we'll buy more that in the open market add value to it and sell it at a higher margin. Elevated beef and pork prices should continue to provide an umbrella for chicken pricing and consumption. We'll have a full year of the new tray-packed and fully cooked capacity in our results. There should be adequate supply of cattle and hogs with growth coming in the regions where our plants are located. We'll be generating a lot of cash which we\u2019ll use to pay down debt, thereby reducing interest expense. ","We'll continue to spend CapEx well above maintenance levels with high value return projects that will continue to set us up well for the future. The share count at the tangible equity units will drop as the stock price goes up. We should all be in a position to buy back stock in 2016. We have leading brands at market share that will allow us to grow faster than our peers and we're not finished growing. There is more to come. So yeah we feel really good about 2015 and 2016. It's Tyson 2.0 and we're a different company. ","And finally I\u2019d just like to say how pleased I am with the progress of the integration. Tyson has integrated a lot of companies in its history and I have been involved in many of them and this has been the smoothest I've ever experienced. We love having an office in Chicago and we are keeping key members of the team there and in many cases expanding their roles. We have two like-minded groups coming together to unlock the value that we know exists. [indiscernible] goes in the way people aren't being territorial, they're just getting it done. We've been using the expression one plus one equals three a lot, because we see Tyson and Hillshire together as more than the sum of the parts. So thank you to the team for working so well together. ","And now let's go to Dennis for the financial update.","Dennis Leatherby ","","Thanks Donnie and good morning everyone. Fiscal 2014 was another record year. We delivered strong overall operating results and used our cash flow and balance sheet to make a significant acquisition in Hillshire Brands to further deliver and execute our value added strategy for years to come. As a reminder we acquired Hillshire brands in our final months of fiscal 2014. This morning it's important for us to demonstrate that legacy Tyson delivered on results we had previously described over the last several earnings call to give you a good base line. ","As a result I will be referring to our fiscal '14 adjusted operating income and EPS for legacy Tyson only, which exclude one month of Hillshire brands results, the equity and debt financing impacts as well as a few other unrelated items. Please refer to our press release issued earlier this morning for a full reconciliation of our GAAP to adjusted results. ","We had a record setting fourth quarter and fiscal 2014. Fiscal '14 revenues were $37.6 billion, representing over 9% growth compared to prior year as we continue to execute our growth strategy as evidenced by increased sales in chicken, pork and prepared foods. Total company return on sales for 2014 was 4.4% and adjusted operating income was more than $1.6 billion, representing a 20% increase over fiscal '13. Our adjusted earnings of $2.94 per share represents a 30% increase over our previous record of $2.26 last year. We achieved an adjusted pretax return on invested capital of just over 21% compared to the 18.5% for the prior year. ","Operating cash flow for 2014 was $1.2 billion which is consistent with our five year average. We have shown the ability to sustain high levels of cash generation while still funding significant investments in working capital as we grow our business and absorb higher input costs. We spend $195 million on capital expenditures for the fourth quarter and $632 million for the full fiscal year. This outpaced our depreciation by $138 million in fiscal '14 as we continued to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC. ","Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2014 was 31.6%. On an adjusted basis this rate was 33.4%. Net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 4.1 times. And on a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis this measure was 4.3 times. On a pro forma basis, including Hillshire\u2019s results of the past 12 months net debt-to-EBITDA was approximately three times. Including cash of $438 million, net debt was $7.7 billion. Total liquidity was just over $1.6 billion, remaining above our goal of $1.2 billion. ","Year-to-date net interest expense was $125 million, down 9% from a year ago. Adjusted net interest expense was $98 million, representing a 29% decrease from fiscal 2013. Our adjusted EPS reflects diluted shares outstanding of 356 million, similar to last quarter which excludes the impact of the issuance in August of common stock and tangible equity units. As Donnie pointed out we will close on the sale of our Brazil chicken operations later this quarter and we expect to close the sale of our Mexico chicken operations in the second quarter of fiscal \u201915. The sale of both of these operations will result in more than $500 million of additional cash we planned to use to de-lever. We moved the assets for these operations to assets held for sale in our fiscal 2014 balance sheet. ","Now looking forward here are some additional thoughts on 2015. Please note our accounting cycle results in a 53-week year in fiscal \u201915 as compared to a 52-week year in fiscal \u201914. Accordingly this outlook is based on a 52-week year for comparative purposes. We expect revenues of approximately $42 billion for fiscal \u201915 which is 12% growth over fiscal \u201914. This is driven primarily by full year of Hillshire brands offset by a reduction from the sale of our Brazil and Mexico chicken operations. ","We expect to capture more than $225 million in synergies in fiscal \u201915 from the integration of Hillshire brands and improvements in our Prepared Foods segment. Net interest expense should approximate $285 million for fiscal 2015. We currently estimate our adjusted effective tax rate should be around 35.75%. CapEx is expected to be $900 million which represents approximately $300 million or 50% more than our depreciation expense as we continue to focus on projects that will create long-term shareholder value. ","Based on our share price at the start of fiscal \u201915 we expect diluted shares Q1 \u201915 to be around 416 million. This includes the August 2014 issuance of common stock and tangible equity units. This morning we reported our Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly dividend from $0.075 to $0.10 per share on our Class A common stock payable on December 15. We expected adjusted EPS in the range of $3.30 to $3.40 representing an increase of over 12% versus fiscal \u201914. ","FY\u201915 is already setting up to be another phenomenal year for sales, operating income and EPS. As we look beyond \u201915 we expect to realize annual synergies of more than $500 million by fiscal \u201917. We\u2019re excited about the tremendous value we will realize from our collection of iconic brands and look forward to growing them even further. ","We believe return-focused capital allocation and our diversified and balanced portfolio will be the engine to deliver a constant growth year-over-year and we are raising the long-term profitability expectations for our chicken segment to 7% to 9% and for our Prepared Foods segment to 10% to 12%. Our priorities for the significant cash flows that our operations will continue to generate are for rapid deleveraging and strengthening our balance sheet, a continued return-focus on capital allocation to drive long-term shareholder value, funding acquisitions to fulfill our growth strategies and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends all while ensuring we maintain plenty of liquidity. ","And finally I want to remind you that on this call in 2012 after coming off two years of more than $1 billion in incremental fee cost and facing another incremental $600 million of fiscal \u201913 we surprised some by saying we would at least hold EPS flat in \u201913 and grow EPS by around 10% or more in \u201914 and \u201915. This was based on our belief that continued improvements in operating performance in many areas of our company was accelerating and would enable these goals ought to be achieved. ","Two years later we are pleased to look back and note that we're delivering with 15% EPS growth in '13 and 30% EPS growth in '14. But we're not finished, our new EPS range calls for at least 12% growth in '15 amidst a game changing acquisition of Hillshire brands. When achieved this means our three year compounded annual growth rate since the 2012 call would be almost 19% reflecting the efforts of a great team that just keeps getting better. As we continue the integration process, we see the tremendous opportunity that Hillshire business and team brings to the combined company. ","As we execute our prepared food strategy, we're even more excited about our future as we look to create strong shareholder value along with this acquisition that will be accretive in fiscal '15 and highly accretive in future years. ","That concludes our prepared remarks. Robin we're ready to begin Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Thanks for the question. I have one and then a follow-up. The first one is Donnie; I am hoping you can detail for us some of the synergy targets, maybe if you can fill in the blanks how much is expected in COGS versus SG&A, some of the pacings of savings, anything you think is important for us to know as we model numbers out here?","Donnie Smith","","Okay. Sure Ken. So let me start with the types and then we will fill in the gap a little bit around maybe some of the amounts and when they will come. And I also want to clear up a little bit about what's not in the synergies that we have been talking about so far. So there is early days, there are some low-hanging fruit; things like procurement, some of the redundant functions that are eliminated, some of the service contracts, those kind of things; and longer term things like how we optimize and improve the operational efficiencies and the manufacturing plants, how we continue to optimize the network, some of the logistic savings. There will also be some savings we think in trade spend. ","So there is several broad categories that we think we will find more and as you know kind of increasing savings in overtime. Let me give you quick example. An early example that we'll see this year is freight management. So we've been able to reduce the rate structure by lowering the rates on some of the Hillshire legacy business and then capturing additional discounts from having a much larger freight base. We expect that alone to be somewhere in the $15 million to $25 million this fiscal year. ","So at this point I feel really good about the $225 million number this year, at least that number and at least $500 million as we go forward over the three year target. So I also want to add that this is pertaining by and large to the Prepared Foods segment. So if you look at our Prepared Foods segment, this next year is roughly an $8 billion business and if you look at that out over the three year synergy number that's about $500 million which is about 6% or so of that. Now it\u2019s a little more front-end loaded, then you would typically see with just a straight M&A deal but you'll remember we were able to see significant synergy capture in the legacy business because of this acquisition by closing three plants and then moving that product mix around in to more efficient locations. ","Now and what's not in these synergy numbers so far is any growth synergies that might come. We've not included any raw materials synergies. And what we want to do is to add a bit of clarity about that as we get more deeply into having those discussions. We've been about two months now working together as a team. We've built very detailed business cases that we can monitor to deliver these synergies and of course we'll be reporting those out to our investors quarterly. ","So going back to one thing just for clarity. Some of the things like shared service synergies, that type of thing will be seeing across all of our segments but the majority of the synergies will reside in the prepared food segment. ","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","That's helpful. If I can be very quick here on the follow-up. You mentioned even though next year has an extra week, items in your outlook are based on a 52-week year but just to be clear when you talk about that $3.30 to $3.40 in EPS, is it fair to assume that range is 53-weeks or is that also 52 and upside of that number from the extra week. ","Dennis Leatherby ","Yeah and that's for 52 weeks. ","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Hundley with BB&T Capital Markets.","Brett Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets","Hi good morning. Can you hear me gentlemen?","Dennis Leatherby ","We can. ","Donnie Smith","Brett hi.","Brett Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets","Thank you for taking the question. And my first question is on the chicken segment. You guys have -- did -- you first of all you've upped your normalized range and you continue to talk to 10% plus for next year and the theme seems to be as of ways that companies can insulate themselves in 2015 and beyond. You touched on that a little bit in your prepared remarks but I'm wondering if we can delve back into it. One of those things that we're hearing in particular is that small bird operators are signing very favorable contracts with QSR guys, food service guys for multiple years now. ","Wondering if you guys are seeing that in your own business and again going back to the original question, the insulation you see in your chicken business going forward. ","Donnie Smith","Yeah, certainly we have seen a good price increases in our small bird categories. As customers looks to ensure supply there, but as importantly there are several things that we've been able to do insulate our business a bit number one we're certainly a much more fundamentally sound company than we have been in the past and we continue to improve there. ","We continue to invest in our business. We've improved our revenue by pricing and mix, by the way. So what I mean by that is we've reduced our risk to grain market fluctuations and we've gotten a much better understanding of how the consumer is changing. Our fresh chicken business is doing very well that's the very good business for us and we can see continued growth there. As you know our business model tends to do better against the whole bird model than it does against just the UB [ph] parts and so as the small bird business improves and the tray-packed grows and you can't forget the additional value added that we have those are certainly things that insulate our business in the future. ","Brett Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets","Thank you very much for that. And then Dennis, just I had a follow-up question as it relates to the way that you rather the balance that you try to strike between looking at further M&A targets out there and then debt pay down. And I guess I'm just curious is there a certain level of debt pay down and then switch [indiscernible] and we can start looking at M&A again. Can you look at M&A right now? And as a follow on to that question if there was a food service focused target out there in packaged meat, do you think there will be any trust issues for you guys going ahead and acquiring something like that.","Dennis Leatherby ","Okay, great series of questions. The way we look at M&A in our capital structure is that we put together this financing and a capital raise in a manner to ensure that we have investment grade ratings. Right now net debt-to-EBITDA is around three times. We're going to throw off better part of a $1 billion in free cash flow, we're going to raise another $500 million through the sale of Mexico and Brazil so that will be used to de-lever. And we see net debt-to-EBITDA trending towards two times by the end of this fiscal year. That puts us in a pretty good place to re-leverage if we so choose. ","We think that we're in a much better position from a step stability standpoint from an earnings and cash flow standpoint. So we're in a really good position and we're certainly ready and willing to look at M&A to the extent it makes sense for us and it fulfills our growth strategies. As far as food service goes I'm not sure that I know how to comment on that. ","Brett Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Farha Aslam with Stephens. Your line is open. You want to check your mute button your line is open for your question Farha. I'll move onto the next question, Adam ","Operator","","I move on to the next question Adam Samuelson, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs","","Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Maybe a little more detail on the chicken outlook and as you think about the 7% to 9% normalized range; how should we think about the further processing percent of the mix on a normalized basis going forward. Clearly that\u2019s something that\u2019s changed and how you run that business and as a driver to normalized profitability to dampen the cyclicality but as we think about the further process how big of that is that of your earnings mix at this point?","Donnie Smith","","Adam let me add a little bit of color to that too. I mean we feel that over the next two, three, four years something like that, high beef and pork prices relatively speaking are going to continue to drive demand towards chicken. Also as the Millennials enter the work force they index very heavy towards chicken. So we feel like that\u2019s a meaningful consumer shift that will allow us to continue to grow our business well into the future so we predict over the next couple of years at least a 3% increase in demand for chicken and if you will go back it\u2019s been a long time, probably since \u201806 or \u201807 since we\u2019ve been able to talk about a structural shift in consumption that would drive that demand. ","So then if you look at foundationally a 3% or so demand increase driven both by high competing prices as well as preference to chicken from the Millennials then how do we go to market against that? Well fresh chicken is certainly a great component and that adds incremental margins, anything we would do on just pure commodity basis. By the way about the only commodity part just pure commodity part that we would sell would a frozen leg order internationally, and so -- which by the way favors us in terms of increase supply because we can then buy parts that we need on the outside market, add value to those through our further processing capabilities. ","Let me get to that part of the question last year I noted on a couple of our calls that we were completely tapped out on FD capacity. Well our two plants that we have been having issues with are completely back up into speed and we have incremental FD capacity there plus we have two more lines that will be coming on-stream in the spring. And so some of our food service customers would have probably inserted more chicken promotions had there been industry capacity to actually produce the product where we\u2019re supplying in industry capacity this year so we feel like that will give us an incremental improvement. ","Another thing that I can add is that even though through the years our leg quarter volume is down the reasons it\u2019s down is because we\u2019ve been able to take advantage of a bit of an incremental shift to more boneless dark meat in our business. So if you look at the price comparison to boneless dark meat versus boneless skinless fresh meat, there are times when boneless dark meat is almost at parity in the marketplace with boneless skinless fresh meat. So we\u2019re chasing that new demographic shift too. So that may have been a much more detail option but we -- answer then you were looking for, but we are very optimistic about the demand in our chicken segment.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs","","I appreciate the color. And then just as a follow up I guess you have got good detail on the demand side. On the supply side you do kind of own one of the main primary breeders in the industry. Can you talk about what the Cobb-Vantress order book looks like as you evaluate the outlook for supply growth in particularly \u201815?","Donnie Smith","","I will tell this. Over the last couple of years or so most of the primary breeders have experienced some production issues. It appears that most of those production issues are now correcting themselves and that there will be some incremental supply capability. Now if you look at the Board placements it\u2019s going to be at least June, July, August something like that of next year before there is significant supply and you got to remember the structural issues affecting the supply growth, Chicken house is getting built, hatcheries needing to be built, those types of things. Our hatchery capacity is about as high -- as an industry our percent capacity is about as high, I've seen it a long, long time. ","So we think that you'll probably see somewhere on the -- in an order of magnitude of about three or so percent growth in supply and I'll tell you the demand for chicken meat that type of supply come into the market and we're looking forward to our buy versus gross strategy, define the parts we need and add value to them through our further processing capabilities and continuing to drive our margins. ","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs","All right. Thanks very much. I'll pass along.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Diane Geissler with CLSA. Your line is open. ","Diane Geissler - CLSA ","Good morning. ","Donnie Smith","Good morning.","Diane Geissler - CLSA ","So you had called out in your press release that there was a negative impact from purchasing product I guess in the open market which I think obviously part of your buy versus grow strategy but could you was that a surprise to you that it just rose more rapidly than you expected it to and is there any way you can sort of quantify how much that was above your expectations?","Donnie Smith","Sure Diane, sure will. As you know in the back half of the year we had some fairly significant production issues in our fully value added retail business. And obviously we were disappointing customers with our build rate and frankly we wanted to make sure that that was the only area of our business where we were disappointing customers and so we made the choice in our tray pack business and I think you are seeing the growth in fresh tray pack with these really high beef 90s, ground beef prices at retail really have high beef price. ","There has been a shift into fresh tray pack and we just didn't want to disappoint our customers in that part of our business too. So we made the conscious choice to be out on the market buying breast meat and then using internal breast meat to put in a tray and make sure that we did not disappoint our customers particularly around the Holidays, and I'll tell you we did a great job of order fill. It cost us a little bit of money. We were out there probably buying, I think for the quarter we bought about 100 loads of breast meat, a week on average and you know what the market prices were and typically we would have been closer to the 50, 55 load a week type range but that was a constant, -- a conscious decision.","I am going to guess, maybe it cost us $1.5 million, $2 million a week something like that for that quarter and it was the right thing to do because we kept those valuable customer relationships and as we bring this new tray pack capacity and this new further processing capacity on-stream will be able to capture that market share back. So we're positive we did the right thing although it did cost us a little bit of money in the quarter. ","Diane Geissler - CLSA ","Okay. It sounds like it was more of a production issue rather than you misjudging the market which, is that a fair statement.","Donnie Smith","By and large I believe, that's correct, yes.","Diane Geissler - CLSA ","Okay, and then I wanted to ask about China where obviously the hopes are that business will get some traction and really start pulling in some earnings, especially with what we've seen in terms of growth of the QSR channel but it just -- it's been such a rocky road for those companies there with sort of quality issues, sort of one after another. I guess could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in China and what your customer base is telling you. ","I would think about with what happened over the summer with one of the large suppliers there that some of these companies would be knocking loudly on your door looking for supply but that doesn't seem to be the case. So just talk a little bit about what your customer base is saying there about their proclivity to use you as a supplier?","Donnie Smith","Without being too specific about any individual customer the issue is with these back-to-back food scares, demand for poultry is down. Now I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we remain in a bit of a holding pattern and what that means is that we have acquired land use rights and we have the capabilities to be able to build on those parcels of land whenever we start getting some demand signals that would indicate it's time to do so. We saw a little bit of light in the [indiscernible] market and then we saw a little bit of light in the market for our pricing but then this last market scare it once again decreased the demand for the product. ","So I do think it validates our model that with this safety front from the farm all the way to the retailer or to the food service customer that we\u2019re on the right track. As you can well imagine it\u2019s a bit frustrating when the demand drops like it has and certainly I think our customers understand what we have to deliver in our model and what that can do to help their business and we feel if we get any light at all in the demand for poultry that we will start seeing some improvement. ","Diane Geissler - CLSA ","Have your customers given you any indication of when they expect to see demand snap back?","Donnie Smith","We really haven\u2019t. ","Diane Geissler - CLSA ","Haven\u2019t, okay. All right, great, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Tiberio with Miller Tabak. Your line is open. ","Tim Tiberio - Miller Tabak & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Obviously your prepared food long-term operating margin guidance is well above your -- what you\u2019ve ever realized in legacy Tyson business and obviously is also a bit higher than even what Hillshire has seen in recent years. I would assume that most of this step up is coming from synergies that you outlined but can you provide us maybe with a little bit more detail frame up of the sensitivity of getting to that 10% to 12% operating profit margin range, how much is coming from synergies versus the potential for improved input costs as the hog herd expense and then finally how much sensitivity is coming from some of these new products that you\u2019ve launched, particularly in the lunch category and also in the snack categories?","Donnie Smith","Okay, Tim, so a couple of things. Number one if you remember when we closed the three facilities in our prepared foods business that began our ability to take our product mix and put it into the most efficient plan from a production standpoint and from a network optimization standpoint. So we\u2019ll continue to see that develop. So if you look out overtime in the synergy capture, if you take the traditional, call it legacy Tyson business and put it in its normalized range and then you bring the Hillshire business into that and then take the preponderance of the $500 million in synergy and do that math over you\u2019re pretty easy in that 10% to 12% return on sales. ","Plus then with the efficient MAP spending and new innovation capabilities across the business, being able to take food service innovation and have that cross into the retail channel then you\u2019re able to see some good growth synergies that will happen overtime and we\u2019ve not quantified that specifically yet but we will overtime. And so I think that\u2019s kind of the growth algorithm forward to be able to see how we\u2019re going to get to that 10% to 12%. ","Tim Tiberio - Miller Tabak & Co.","Great and just one last follow-up question, looking at some of the overlaps in the legacy, in Hillshire brands has there been any final decisions of which brands are staying particularly in the breakfast category, how should we be thinking about that as we model out that tradition going forward?","Donnie Smith","Yeah well I can tell you that we discontinued any investment at all in day starts or any of the Wright Brand sausage kind of, any of the Wright Brand sausage that we were doing all of that obviously will go into Jimmy Dean. We have been apparently successful though about not losing those slots and we\u2019ve been able to work with our retailers to be able to slot Jimmy Dean branded products into the slots that previously days starts had and we appreciate our retailers working with us on that. ","So we do have a great portfolio of iconic brands and we\u2019ll continue the growth trajectory that they\u2019ve been on. We haven\u2019t had a chance yet to go through a detail of every brand or every label that we have, that work will be done. We really spent the last three months making sure, through the integration that we\u2019ve got our teams in place, that we've got the organizational structure like we wanted going forward, that every team member knows what their role and is and that's my thing and we intend just in the next few weeks to be transitioning into the new work structure that we talked about which, by the way that is very rapid. ","So that's been our overall focus at the beginning and now that we've -- once we get transitioned into the new organization we'll certainly have our brand teams and we've got great capabilities there, to look across our business, at our brands and understand how to maximize the portfolio. ","Tim Tiberio - Miller Tabak & Co.","Great thanks for your time. ","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Piken. Your line is open, with Cleveland Research.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research","","Yeah, hi good morning. I just wanted to get a little bit more of an update for your expectations for how big of an issue PEDv might be this winter and kind of where the industry is from a Bio-security standpoint as well as the efficacy in some of the vaccines that are being worked on. Thanks.","Donnie Smith","Sure we spend a lot of time talking to our producers. We're sort of in a transition period here. Typically instances, if there are going to be a higher number of the session will begin occurring a little bit later in the fall and winter. But what we can see so far in talking to our producers, who I think, have done a tremendous job about increasing Bio-security in their locations, I feel confident through our conversations with them that the instances won't be as high in 2015 as they were in '14. Now what kind of spread, I think it's a little early for us to be able to call the kind of spread versus a year ago. ","But I will say that the reason I feel so confident about that is this has been one of our better years in pork and so with the Bio-security that we put in place or that our producers have put in place around the PEDv they've also given themselves the benefit in part. So we're confident that next year shouldn't be as bad. It's a little too early to call what we think it will be. As we round it out where you consider hog weights and our projection around sort of our first guess is around the PED and the headcount, we're looking for about 2% maybe 3% increase in overall production and certainly beef prices will be able to sustain that in the marketplace and we think hold together pretty good cuts [ph] we're looking forward to a good year in our pork segment. ","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research","Okay great. And then just sort of as a follow-up, just kind thinking about pork and really your overall business, I mean with the acquisition of Hillshire what should we be thinking about as exports in the future as a percentage of your overall sales for both pork and beef and chicken as well. Thanks. ","Donnie Smith","Roughly the same. I don't a significant shift one way or the other. The individual part may change, but I don't see a significant shift in exports. ","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Farha Aslam with Stephens Incorporated. Your line is open. ","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","","Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. ","Donnie Smith","Hi Farha.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","My question goes to consumer demand, you, throughout your call you've been very, very confident about the outlook for demand in your businesses. Can you talk about just how the consumer\u2019s approaching protein and how perhaps retailers are managing inventory differently because we're hearing the largest retailer in the U.S. has been expanding meat inventories particularly in the frozen areas because they have been seeing very strong demand. ","Donnie Smith","Farha, I can't comment about what individual retailers will do but I will say about our business. So as you know with the real hot beef prices, beef volume is down and as we look forward both at retail and at through service we continue to see that flavor in chicken. We think chicken demand will be up at least 3% next year and I would think again in '16 because we already know that beef supply, the beef herd is going to be down another 4% which portends pretty high beef prices again into the future. ","So we think that is a strong demand signal for chicken. And also there is the generational issue that we are beginning to see in the marketplace with Millennials entering the marketplace and they index quite high versus chicken and so we think that is also going to be driving consumer demand for chicken out front. Does that help?","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And then just as a follow-up as you see the combined Tyson-Hillshire business, could you just comment on going to market as a combined company have you identified yet any advantages that you can point to about that combined entity versus each company individually going to market?","Donnie Smith","","Absolutely, I mean bringing together these great iconic brands that have very strong meaningful positions in their categories and our ability to take this new innovative and insights-driven innovation and brand building capabilities that are coming into the business with the Hillshire team and being able to work with our customers to be able to drive the categories that drive their growth, that\u2019s a very meaningful change going forward. ","And as you look at the categories, particularly at retail that are growing, say just for example in frozen -- of course breakfast is growing across refrigerated and frozen, but frozen breakfast particularly frozen handheld breakfast is a great category. Frozen fully cooked chicken is a great category and we certainly have leading positions in both of those categories and great insides about how to continue to drive the growth forward. ","I mentioned in my prepared remarks the snacking platform and we look forward to the growth that we\u2019ll see in that snacking platform. We\u2019ll also have great brand building capabilities now around our NatureRaised Farms, no-antibiotic-ever. We have seen double digit growth and we\u2019re just putting together a phenomenal team of insights-driven innovators and brand builders who can continue to take this portfolio of products and grow our customers businesses and meet these consumer needs as they change. So we\u2019re very optimistic about how that will drive our future.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Fantastic and just one last question. About Mexico we continue to hear disease issues impacting Mexican chicken supplies. Is that impacting U.S. chicken availability or have you been able to, or the industry have been able to work around that in terms of supply available in the U.S.?","Donnie Smith","","I don\u2019t see it impacting the supply available in the U.S. It does at times impact the demand for export leg quarters. There are times when demand for export leg quarters from the U.S. into Mexico is rather strong and then maybe in response to some of the disease issues the market down there becomes saturated as more people bring market -- ducks to the market and it changes a little bit the demand for the exports, the leg quarters going down there but that\u2019s really about the only impact we see to the U.S. market for Mexico.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","","And thank you our next question is from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","","Hey good morning everyone.","Donnie Smith","","Good morning.","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","","So I guess couple of questions, how much of the synergies would have taken that legacy Tyson of that 225 into 500?","Donnie Smith","","A bit over 100, somewhere probably between 100 and 150, something like that. Most of those would have been in the year one. So let\u2019s call it 100 to 150 of the 225 and then going forward it\u2019s more of the incremental value of the Hillshire Tyson combination.","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","","Great and my second question what is the underlying growth outlook for Hillshire? It seems like from your ex-synergies and ex-obviously legacy Tyson business because it seems like you are just using the $400 million of EBIT from last year and just kind of rolling that forward. I would be surprising you would, planning your business, you would expect to have flat growth in the year?","Donnie Smith","","We\u2019re optimistic about the growth of the business going forward as we -- so Ken remember our comments around the incremental $140 million or so of raw material pricing comment and that\u2019s primarily around beef raw materials in Turkey which frankly the Hillshire Legacy business over indexes towards the beef raw material increase as far as is what the legacy Tyson business would have done. I think the beef and sausage and hot dogs and that kind of thing. ","So we're pricing to recover that and we will, particularly as we -- the earnings cadence will be back half driven and so in year one we\u2019re pricing to recover those raw materials certainly as we move forward and we get beyond that, then we'll be able to drive I think fairly significant incremental growth with some effective MAP spending. So we're very confident in the growth of those brands.","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","But when your turkey, I thought turkey expansion is happening. I expect that turkey prices to start to roll over the six to nine months, is that not what you expect?","Donnie Smith","Our projection for turkey raw material impacting our business will be up in '15 versus '14. ","Dennis Leatherby ","I think Ken, it bears repeating that, this is going to be a big front half, back half story as we overcome the raw material input prices. So you'll see quite a bit of lift in prepared foods, both in overcoming the raw material price increases and the synergies as they build on and the growth in legacy Hillshire. ","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","And my final question is when you talk about the outlook for pork, you really didn't touch on it that much but it seems to me that pork supplies are going to be up anywhere from 3% to 6% or so and yet you are expecting pork packet margins to be roughly within those range. What would make you feel more comfortable that the pork packet margins would be above those ranges given we do have not an expansion of hogs, I would have thought that would have been a good thing to you.","Donnie Smith","So perhaps exports would increase our confidence if we see some movements along that line. We're pretty comfortable with a 3% or so increase in supply and we think the market will easily absorb that type of supply increase particularly with this really high halo that beef prices are providing but we'll have keep to watching the dollar but we feel comfortable with the export demand for our pork, China, Russia et cetera. So I really don't view -- I feel very comfortable in our range, might see above it depending on if that develops and we hope it would. ","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","Great. I appreciate it. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Moscow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ","Rachel Nabatian - Credit Suisse","Good morning. It's Rachel Nabatian in for Robert Moskow. So my question is\u2026","Donnie Smith","Hi Rachel.","Rachel Nabatian - Credit Suisse","Hey, so my question is on chicken productivity. We like to look at the ratio of chicks placed to egg sit and in the last month this increased over last year's level. And so I wanted to know if there is something sustainable driving this, perhaps an increase in the supply of the hatching spot, that\u2019s driving a younger average age which is more productive and then as a second part from what I recall last year a good number of eggs were destroyed during transportation because of the colder than usual winter weather. So I wanted to know if there are any learnings from this and how your company is prepared if the weather this year as bad as it was last year.","Donnie Smith","Okay. Let me, obviously I\u2019ll start with your first one. Actually our hen age is sub, so I'll talk about the physiological productivity first. The hen age is probably still around 63, 65 weeks, hatch ability is probably down about a percent from what we've seen over the last quarter or so. So I don't really see the actually productivity of the flock very differently. Here's what I see. We've seen that the industry has not taken the production cuts, the cuts in sits replacement that it normally would in previous years and so the reason you are seeing sits in placements above a year ago is because you can't, because this quarter integrators could chose not to take the cut that they took last year and so there is an ability to increase this quarter. ","I think what you'll see once we get into like December-early January as we get back to about a 1% or so change versus a year ago because you don't have this ability to grow versus a year ago due to the holiday cuts. Remind me of your second question again I'm sorry. ","Rachel Nabatian - Credit Suisse","I just wanted to know if the colder than usual winter last year do you think, I feel like a lot of the supply was kind of cut because a lot of the eggs were destroyed during transportation because of the colder weather so just wondering if there are any learning\u2019s from that and what do you expect for this year from that end?","Donnie Smith","Got it. I can tell you we\u2019re in better shape on propane than we were a year ago. You\u2019ll remember we actually created a kind of a small propane delivery company to keep a lot of our growers in propane. We\u2019re much better prepared for that. We have looked forward and we do think we have adequate transportation capacity to build all the loads that -- the big thing last year was just the weather and road closures and those types of things. ","We can position inventory a little bit differently but if the road is closed, the road is closed. So those types of events are very hard to predict. I think we\u2019re in great shape going in to FY\u201915 and feel very good about demand and how we\u2019ve prepared ourselves to be able to deliver to the consumer. ","Rachel Nabatian - Credit Suisse","Got it, very helpful. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc Capital Markets. ","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc ","Good morning. ","Donnie Smith","Good morning Akshay. ","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc ","Hey congratulations on the good results. So my first, I just wanted to talk a little bit about the chicken segment and then ask you a question on Hillshire. So on chicken, it\u2019s really two parts one, you haven\u2019t really delivered a 10% or above margin even on a quarterly basis just to push back. So can you tell me what\u2019s -- how we should think of next year being above 10% and why we should feel confident about that. Perhaps you can talk about how the quarter is trending right now. I mean obviously you have the lower grain cost which will help you by about $0.03 a pound. ","But your pricing performance in the last couple of quarters hasn\u2019t been really that great or price realization, so in supply potentially increasing, I'm guessing you\u2019re going to get back some on pricing, your volumes are going to be up a little bit but I just I wanted to see why you have the comfort level to say you\u2019re going to earn above a 10% margin on chicken side? ","My first question and then the second one is you raised your normalized margin range and what we\u2019ve seen is in the bottom of the cycle when the industry is losing money you tend to do a lot better and at the top of the cycle clearly companies like Pilgrim\u2019s are doing much better than you. So can you talk about the bottom end of your range and the comfort level you have with that if and when chicken supply, the chicken industry sort of oversupplies the market?","Donnie Smith","Okay so to your first part, our pricing has not gone down. We feel very good about our pricing so far. If you remember we have a much more vertical like [ph] exposure plus a lot more FC capacity built into the portfolio. Now remember in the last couple of quarters we had some production issues that have cost us some money so kind of erase that and that we expect least our 50 plus a quarter. If you remember over the last couple of quarters I mentioned on a call or on a question earlier that we spent some incremental money, a couple millions or so a week in tray pack, to be able to make sure we didn\u2019t disappoint our customers. So kind of scratch that and then you can get to about 10% on the last quarter there. ","Now let\u2019s move forward, demand, up about 3%. We feel very good about that, where is the demand shifting? The demand is shifting towards tray pack, which is a great business for us and we\u2019re very, very good at it, and if it was to shift towards FC there\u2019s just not been enough capacity to fill the order. We are changing that dynamic this quarter. We now have full productive capability of all of our existing lines and we\u2019re going to be bringing two more lines on-stream in the spring. So on top of all of that if you include the $350 million that we\u2019ll see in incremental grain cost or grain savings than that will help us. ","So I think that gives us a lot of confidence. Going forward we\u2019ll continue to see some operational improvement throughout the year as we continue to advance ourselves in our Lean and Lean Six Sigma. So we feel good and as I mentioned in the prepared remarks we\u2019re off to a great start. So feel really good about it. ","Now as to the range you are absolutely correct. Our goal is to have consistent, stable growth and earnings growth. And so in the summer time when the commodity prices reach their peak you are right we typically don\u2019t do as well as some of our competitors but obviously in times when other parts of the year we do much better. What we want to provide is stable earnings growth for our investors and that\u2019s what our model is here to do.","So as we look forward with an increase in demand which we have not seen now for several years, if you take the market fluctuations in our buy versus grow strategy if commodity prices get fairly, let\u2019s call it cheap, if you will than we are able to buy that raw material and put it into this further processing value added production model and create incremental margin on that which gives us the confidence in the lower end of our range.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc ","And is that lower end of your range, I mean do you expect to hit that when the market is over supplied, meaning when commodity companies are losing money would you expect to be at the lower end or could you be below the lower end?","Donnie Smith","","I would say that obviously you are getting into individual scenarios how much money are they losing and that type thing and that I don\u2019t know that that is as productive. So what we can say is we feel very comfortable with the range moving up and we\u2019ll continue to look at the range and if we need to take it higher in the future we will. But we feel very confident about our ability to deliver and we think there are structural changes in our business that give us the opportunity to continue to deliver against that.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc ","And just one last one on your Prepared Foods business and the commodity outlook you have been behind the 8 ball on your legacy business it seems like for almost two years or something, it\u2019s been a long time you\u2019re always catching up on the cost and you are saying Hillshire is also going to be catching up the first half of the year. Can you just give us little bit more color as to the type of increases you are expecting in fiscal \u201815 for that cost basket for your Prepared Foods business?","Donnie Smith","","Well the incremental cost year-over-year will be $140 million. Now if you remember in my prepared remarks I said that in the legacy Tyson business we\u2019ve recovered that but we got to stay diligent to keep working on our pricing as we move forward to get on top of the incremental raw material inputs that are coming, again pretty heavily driven by beef and by turkey pricing. So we know what we have to do and we know what parts of the business we have to continue to drive that pricing and feel comfortable that this year will be a significant improvement to our previous years. ","And might I note too that the legacy Tyson business was not just plagued by the pricing lag, it was also plagued by an inefficient supply chain. And we made corrections at the end of last year to correct those inefficiencies because we had this new Hillshire production network that we can move a lot of those products in and optimize that network. So that will bring incremental benefit we\u2019ll see a lot of that in fiscal \u201815.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc ","Okay, thank you.","Donnie Smith","","You bet. So thank you all for joining us on the call today. We always appreciate your interest in our business. Follow up with John throughout the rest of the day.

Thanks for joining us today. While our business continued to grow in the third quarter, we are clearly not satisfied with our results, particularly in our Chicken segment. Intertwined with uncertainty in trade policies and tariffs are increasing supplies of relatively low-priced beef and pork that are competing with chicken.","Typically, in Q3 and Q4, we expect strong chicken demand, driven by the growing season and normal summer future activity. Instead, cool Memorial Day weekend weather curved demand, while competing proteins displaced chicken in retail and foodservice promotions. To recover, we are aggressively addressing costs and capturing new future activity. And by keeping our inventories low, we can quickly react to market changes.","Rising freight costs have been a challenge for all of our businesses. We now expect freight to be about $270 million more this year compared to last year, with a net effect for FY 2018 estimated to be around $0.33 per share. On a run rate basis, we recovered about 85%, and we plan to reach 100% once our longer-term contracts expire and new pricing terms take effect.","Our efforts to recover price are likely curving short-term growth. We are growing, but not as fast as we could be and not as fast as we want to be. Despite the current trade issues, global protein demand continues to grow. Our products are moving in the export markets albeit at lower values. We are working to strengthen our existing relationships, certain markets and build inroads into new markets.","In Q3, we demonstrated the value of playing across all proteins. We delivered strong results in our Beef and Prepared Foods segments, offsetting lower margins in chicken and pork. Sales volume of value-added products was up 2.6% compared to the third quarter last year.","We are managing costs tightly across the company. Ongoing Financial Fitness savings were $66 million in the quarter and $168 million year-to-date. We are on track to exceed our $200 million target this year and an incremental $400 million over the next two years. Having this cost program and the continuous improvement mindset already established is proving to be beneficial when facing the current challenges in the market.","While we are focused on costs, we are also making strategic investments in our people and our business. Our efforts to improve employee satisfaction are already proving results with improved safety and retention in tight labor markets. Our CapEx investments are yielding real P&L benefits by driving innovation and improving supply chain capabilities and production flexibility.","Now I\u2019m going to ask that Stewart takes us through the financials as well as our segment results in Beef, Pork, Chicken and Prepared Foods. Stewart?","Stewart Glendinning","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter EPS of $1.50 is up 2% compared to Q3 last year, excluding the $0.20 tax benefit. As we announced last week, we revised our annual EPS guidance down to $5.70 to $6 per share.","Our original forecast is underpinned by a strong fourth quarter, but we saw market weakness carry over from the end of Q3 into the first three weeks of Q4 when we had been expecting improvements.","While external factors continue to pressure our business, we believe in our ability to create long-term shareholder value. There are many positives to focus on, our business model, our diversified portfolio, and our ability to generate cash.","Year-to-date operating cash flows are very strong at $1.9 billion, which is up 33% compared to last year. Third quarter revenues were up 2% to more than $10 billion, with total company volume up 30 basis points.","Operating income was $860 million, up 8% versus Q3 last year and total company return on sales was 8.1%. Our $328 million in capital expenditure outpaced depreciation by $144 million as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering returns well in excess of our cost of capital.","Through the third quarter, total share repurchases for the year were $5 million shares for $367 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 25.2%. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.3 times, excluding cash of $170 million net debt was just under $10 billion and total liquidity was $894 million at the end of Q3. Net interest expense was $87 million in the third quarter and $257 million for the first nine months of the year. We expect approximately $275 million of incremental cash flow in fiscal 2018 as a result of tax reform.","And now I'd like to review our performance and provide an initial outlook for our business segments. The Beef segment performed a very well in Q3 with operating income of $319 million and an 8% operating margin. Compared to the third quarter last year, sales volume increased 2.7% and while average price decreased 2.8% revenue remained relatively flat. Beef results were driven by strong demand and increased availability of cattle near our plants.","Demand for our case-ready products continues to grow and we're also seeing sizable growth in our premium programs including Certified Angus Beef, Open Prairie Natural and Chairman's Reserve Certified Premium. With the Beef segment, strong performance, we believe it will finish fiscal 2018 with operating margin above 6% and similar results expected in fiscal 2019. The cattle supply appears to be set up well for fiscal 2019 and supply should be adequate into 2021.","In the Pork segment, we generated operating income of $67 million with a 5.6% margin. Revenue was down due to 2.1% decline in volume and 7.4% lower average price. A supply demand and balance compressed our Pork margins, exacerbated by reduced export values.","Pork prices are down by more than $6 per head, but how hog costs did not follow. We will continue upgrading our mix to more value added products and we're moving more Pork into Prepared Foods whenever possible.","While this will lead to higher more stable margins over time, currently the operating environment for Pork is difficult, leading us to believe our Pork segment operating margin will be around 6% for the year. We expect hog supplies to increase approximately 3% in fiscal 2019 providing a sufficient supply for our plants.","Tariffs and trade concerns could continue to affect product pricing. Based on the current market environment, we expect an operating margin of around 6%, but the Pork segment next fiscal year. The Chicken segment generated operating income of $196 million in the third quarter with a 6.6% operating margin. Revenue increased on 3.7% average higher price, while volume remained relatively flat. The segment benefited from $25 million in Financial Fitness savings in the quarter.","Chicken segment results were challenged by soft demand due to relatively low price to competing proteins. Additionally, chicken experienced export headwinds increased freight, labor and feed costs and $20 million in non-recurring charges.","We are focused on growth, innovation, value-added capabilities, and customer partnerships, which is why over the long-term our Chicken segment has demonstrated higher margins and more stability. Currently however, results will remain challenged as customers shift from Chicken to relatively lower priced Beef and Pork. As a result, we expect an operating margin of around 8% in fiscal 2018 and similar results in 2019.","Our Prepared Foods segment performed well in Q3 and is building momentum with $249 million in operating income and another 11.7% margin. Revenue increased with average price of 6.8% while acquisitions drove the 2.7% volume increase.","We are growing sales dollars across nearly all major categories and leading in competitive categories. The strong top and bottom line improvement is attributed to acquisitions, investments to drive volume, positive net price recovery, and $39 million in Financial Fitness savings. Operating income was also affected by higher input and freight costs. With Prepared Foods momentum continuing into the fourth quarter, in fiscal 2019, we expect the segments operating margin to exceed 11% in fiscal 2018 with similar results next year.","Before we go back to Tom for his views on our distribution channels and M&A activity, I'd like to offer some thoughts on fiscal 2018 and 2019. Our capital allocation priorities will continue to focus on driving shareholder value and growing the business. We will be disciplined as we pay down debt and deploy cash to grow our business organically and through acquisitions. And we will continue to return cash to shareholders through share buybacks and dividend growth.","In fiscal 2019, we expect topline sales of approximately $42 billion, which would be around 3% growth over the $40 billion to $41 billion expected in fiscal 2018. Net interest expense should approximate $345 million in fiscal 2018 and 2019. Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 24% in fiscal 2018 and 2019. We are planning approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in CapEx in fiscal 2018 and approximately $1.6 billion in fiscal 2019 as we focus on growing and improving our business.","Based on our average share price in Q3, we expect our average diluted shares to be around 368 million before any share repurchases. We plan to continue growing volume while stripping out costs, generating cash and providing good returns on capital expenditures, and we have the balance sheet flexibility to drive growth.","That concludes my remarks. Now back to Tom.","Thomas Hayes","Okay. Thanks Stewart. Our retail Core 9 outpaced total food and beverage volume though it did decline slightly. Total Tyson retail declined 1.3%, while volume dip negative dollars performance was positive, pricing that wasn\u2019t intentionally moved ahead of our peers was a primary driver of the volume decline.","Within the Core 9 volume stock, this was driven by two specific retail categories hot dogs and poultry. In hot dogs, we executed our profit improvement plan that saw expected volume declines driven by strategic pricing. Share declines were based on more aggressive competitive pricing during the Memorial Day period, but more recent share performance has been improving.","In retail value added poultry, volume declines were also driven by more aggressive competitive activity during what is traditionally the slowest quarter for this category. Our focus in the back half of the year has been on winning the strategic back-to-school season and it's already off to a strong start.","Other retail paltry volume challenges were driven by a declining frozen raw poultry category as consumers continue to move to fresh poultry. In the retail channel innovation is important and we have introduced several new products focused on convenience. In the early days in the market, Jimmy Dean Protein Packs and Jimmy Dean Eggwichs are doing well with consumers.","Refrigerated Ball Park cooked burgers that are sold next to our Ball Park hot dogs are also doing well. For the in-store deli, we have a new pulled white meat rotisserie chicken product that's a labor saver for customers. In addition, continuing innovation in a dynamic meal kits sector is showing high consumer appeal on a more convenient Tyson Tastemakers item called the One Pan Dish.","In foodservice channel, labor remains a challenge for operators, and Tyson foodservice, offers solutions to help free up back-of-the-house labor and improve efficiency with cost effective products. Our focus six products of foodservice distribution continued their positive volume trend up 2.9% over last year.","Our growth relative to our competitors has changed as we lapped strong performance period and our competitors lapped a period of decline. As the QSR burger wars heated up the summer, we saw fewer limited time offers promoting chicken, which had a temporary impact on our sales growth. Relatively low beef prices and a public focus on burgers among QSR competitors led to some customers making late changes to the promotional schedules, then opting to feature burgers rather than chicken. Looking forward to the foodservice back-to-school season, we expect chicken will return to playing a bigger role with key customers.","Finally, I'd like to talk a bit about M&A. We are refining and growing our company as part of our strategic plan to sustainably feed the world with the fastest-growing protein brands. As we focus on protein, we sold several non-protein businesses this year and anticipate selling our pizza crust business in the fourth quarter.","The acquisitions that we've made are changing our company in a positive way, and AdvancePierre Foods is a great example. The integration has gone extremely well, and APF has contributed an incremental $1.6 billion revenue in its first full-year as a part of Tyson. Together, we've unlocked savings and created new opportunities with customers and consumers.","In May, we announced our plans to acquire American Proteins, which should provide additional stability to our chicken margins. We received regulatory approval and expect to close this month. In June, we acquired Tecumseh Poultry, producer of the Smart Chicken brand. This acquisition gives us a well-known brand of organic chicken with national distribution and the ability to scale up in this fast growing category.","So as we wrap up our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to reinforce the rock solid foundation of this business. Tyson Foods is an advantaged leader in the pure growth market of protein. Our unique model allows us to activate deep insight and great brands to go all-in on the upside of value-added growth. A balanced presence in the major protein stabilizes our positions across commodity markets.","This model has consistently grown operating cash flow and we've taken advantage of the options that creates through prudent capital allocation on the behalf of our shareholders. We will embrace the reality of today while simultaneously innovating for tomorrow. Our steadfast commitment to a long game ensures we will continue to generate returns over time.","That concludes our prepared remarks, and Denise we are ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Hayes. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will be from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Zaslow","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas Hayes","Good morning, Ken.","Stewart Glendinning","Good morning, Ken.","Kenneth Zaslow","My question is, what is driving 4Q to such depressed levels, but more importantly how does it change to get to 2019 numbers? Are you being overly conservative as you pass through the freight costs, you see the hog curve, you get more synergies. Can you talk about that and frame it a little bit because it just seems like there's a little bit of a disconnect?","Thomas Hayes","Certainly, the biggest disappointment, as I said in my prepared remarks as it relates to our business, is Chicken. We can talk certainly more about that. But why don't I tackle 2019 and maybe Stewart will kick Chicken margins to you. 2019 environment is going to be very similar to what we've faced here, but I see certainly the protein growing throughout the world. One of the things that we're very focused on is continue to take advantage of exports where we can. The tariff and trade noise has impeded that a bit, particularly as it relates to Mexico, but we feel like we're in good shape.","Prepared Foods segments and Beef obviously are doing very well and I continue to see that into the future. So our challenge has really come down to pork and chicken. Pork is off to a bit of a slow start, but improving. And we see livestock supply will be plentiful. So we need the export to come through and that's the one thing that we need to make sure that that happens in order for us to really maximize the model.","Demand in chicken is soft. There is competing proteins at low prices I spoke off and we are concerned about the ability for us to continue to drive that demand up and we want to make sure that our team is focused on doing that. But that\u2019s probably the area where we are being caution because we want to make sure we deliver those results and deal with our confidence.","The value added businesses are expected to continue in our growth trajectory. Prepared Foods and Chicken will benefit from a higher value added mix, and we\u2019re happy with the mix improvement, and we expect to continue to have the financial fitness savings come through of course.","So, yes, few headwinds as we go into the year are affecting us now, but continued higher freight cost, food inflation, all those that we\u2019re used to dealing with those issues, getting the freight costs, and prices pass through certainly affecting volume, but we\u2019re conservative, by your comments, Ken, that's the reason why as we have some issues attack on or were all about tackle on it, so but Chicken\u2026","Stewart Glendinning","Yes, may be just a couple of thoughts on both of those, Ken, first of all Q4, I mean as Tom as mentioned, some of those trends we saw in Q3 Chicken and Pork, we expect those to continue to Q4. And so look at the relative performance of Q3 to last year and I think you'd see the same thing in Q4.","On the businesses that are performing well in a Prepared Foods, we feel great about it. The business I just point you to is, Beef. As you look at Q4, we've given 8% return on sale for Q3 and giving 6% guidance for the full-year and so while we expect Q4 to be really good for Beef, perhaps not as powerful as Q3.","And so I mean I think that will allow you to dimensionalize Q4. On 2019, we\u2019re giving you the guidance on all the return on sales. One of the drivers that you'll see in Chicken specifically, so is the forward curve on grains and forward curve on grains points to higher Chicken prices for next year. That's flowing into some of their estimates.","So depending on how that moves around will \u2013 our own numbers will move around, specifically in Q4 also we expect to see higher grain prices flowing through on Chicken. So hopefully that helps you with some of the detail.","Kenneth Zaslow","Very helpful, and then just my follow-up is, you guys have a lot of cash coming in a \u2013 remember that you did say that there was an opportunity for you to think about buying back stock. This seems to be a good time to buyback stock, any follow-up thoughts on that? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.","Thomas Hayes","Well, I mean I\u2019d just say, Ken, thanks for the heads up on that. We have got a great record of buying back stock. I mean we bought $120 million in last quarter, almost $370 million year-to-date. In the last three years, $3.3 billion of the share. I think you can expect to see us that are \u2013 we will continue to pull the various leavers of capital allocation and stock buyback will be part of that.","Kenneth Zaslow","Okay, appreciate it.","Thomas Hayes","I want to speak at a specific quarter of course.","Kenneth Zaslow","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson","Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess my first question. I wanted to take a little bit deeper on the Chicken business. Thinking about some of just the year-over-year declines that you\u2019re seeing in profitability and margins in the third quarter and fourth quarter.","And maybe if you can bracket those a little bit by feed cost, labor, freight, grow out expense, and there is derivative losses and then mix, and I think one of the things that a lot of people have looked at your company over time has been kind of the diversity across business segments in chicken between Small Bird and Tray Pack and Prepared, and the impact of buy versus grow and thinking that in the current environment, there would have been a more of an offset, and so any way to dimensionalize some of those pieces would be helpful?","Thomas Hayes","Sure Adam. I'll give you some headlines, and I\u2019ll talk about buy versus grow. I think there are three main categories, I think of in terms of the Chicken results are the weak domestic demand, the one-time events that we called out and then short-term headwinds that certainly are a competitive factor for us.","Domestic demand is the LTO shifts had a significant impact for us in the quarter, approaching switching. The export uncertainly \u2013 uncertainty didn't help our legs \u2013 quarters for sure. Estimate that most of that deviation in that area is hopefully behind us, but this is something that is affecting us \u2013 about I would say the weak demand in the export uncertainty about 200 basis points maybe about $0.10 EPS.","The one-time events, the fire and the shift in production capability at one of our plants which is a good thing for us long-term did have some effect as well as the mark-to-market revel, when we talk about grains totaled that's about $0.10 EPS let say.","And then the short-term headwinds that will increase \u2013 certainly we will see those as it pertains to Chicken being could compete with other proteins. So we see the value of the proteins Beef and Pork certainly coming down that's going to be headwind.","Buy versus grow, it's a benefit for sure and it is ongoing a long-term benefit, but we expected more from this past quarter. We had unusual occurrence this summer with the weakness and demand, caused by cheaper pork and the LTOs I talked about. And so our chicken volume dropped enough where we didn't have to buy as nearly as much as we normally do, so we couldn\u2019t take advantage of those lower priced products and that prevented us from fully capitalizing on the market. So that's the story in those two.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. The only thing I'd add is just to say if you look at Q3 about 60% or so is driven by feed and logistic costs, so that gives you a sense of impact of those, it impacted be helpful. It might be helpful.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. That's helpful color. And then just on the Pork segment, just be clear on the guidance. You're at 8% year-to-date on margins to get to 6% for the full fiscal year would imply the fiscal fourth quarter to be near breakeven, and then I mean I know packer margins are weak right now. I wouldn't have expected that magnitude or weakness. Can you talk about is it just the export issues with Mexico or on the tariffs beginning in July or something else?","Stewart Glendinning","Certainly the margins are tight right now. We don't expect to be exacting on our forecasts. One of the things that you can appreciate is that there is a lot of volatility right now. So we are \u2013 why we have such a wide range as relates to the full-year performance. What we have seen as we have doesn\u2019t have trouble in getting the hogs, more hogs are coming into the market, but the supply for sure there has been an imbalance demand. So we want to make sure that shows up and we have full confidence that in 2019 based on what we know today. But right now we're certainly making sure that we give you the number we think we can hit.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. I appreciate the color. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","The next question will be from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone.","Thomas Hayes","Hi Alexia.","Alexia Howard","Hi. Can I ask about the outlook for the margins on the Prepared Foods business for next year? If you're maintaining is at the 11% level despite the cost saving programs coming through, is the idea that you're going to be spending an awful lot more marketing or is that some of the offset that I'm missing? And then I have a follow-up.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. So the margins that we have in Prepared Foods, we are happy with where we are, but we want to continue to make sure that we are continuing to invest. We will make sure that our mass spending is hitting right levels in order to keep the growth as you saw in the hot dog category we had lost some shares, although we did improve the margins. Our intention is to make sure that we are continuing to get behind our brands and so there will be a bit of that mass spending. But also innovation efforts are paying back at right categories, right part of the store, but we are continuing to focus on MAP and that's the short answer.","Alexia Howard","Great. And then is the follow-up, in terms of your acquisition strategy, you've obviously done the AdvancePierre acquisition relatively recently. Do you have big appetite to do more in the not too distant future? What kind of assets are you looking for right now and what the highest leverage you'd be prepared to take on to do another deal? Thank you and I\u2019ll pass it on.","Thomas Hayes","Yes. So talk about the same cultures as it relates acquisitions or maybe talk about our leverage. So we are focused on the same areas, the assets are going to bring brands, new capabilities or new geographies to Tyson. And to the extent that they deliver some scale, so we can take some synergies that puts us in a really strong position. So those are the filters that we use.","And of course, talking about specific properties. We will be acquisitive where we believe it's going to be in the best interest of our share owners, and it's focused on continuing to try to stabilize margins, improve margins over time. And that's what we've done with APF, that's what we're doing with American Proteins and that's the strategy we're taking, talk about leverage.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. Relative to leverage, I would say there's not a specific number that we'd be willing to go to. It is sufficient, I think, to say that it will depend a little bit on the type of asset, number one. And number two, just to note that being investment-grade is important to us. And so we've worked closely with the rating agencies.","Alexia Howard","Great. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","The next question will be from Farha Aslam of Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.","Farha Aslam","Hi, good morning.","Thomas Hayes","Good morning.","Farha Aslam","On first question relates to Prepared Foods. I think 2019 is when your pizza toppings plant really comes on and starts delivering the benefits of the restructuring. Could you share with us color on where we are with that pizza topping plan?","Thomas Hayes","Sure. Things are looking good. We have the plan, it's up and running and the volumes are returning back to normal levels. We're making great headway. It's much more automated than the process that we have. Look at the product quality, most importantly in the right place that we want it. And so we're locking in some volume commitments for our comeback, and things are looking good.","Farha Aslam","And so do you expect to get the $100 million or so benefit from that revamped pizza strategy?","Thomas Hayes","We haven't broken out exactly with the margin improvements going to be fire, but surprise to say it\u2019s baked into our guidance or projections is relates to the margins for F2019.","Farha Aslam","Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up. That CapEx expenditure for next year, $1.6 billion, it's a pretty material step-up. Could you provide color on what incremental projects you're going to pursuing next year with that or break down that $1.6 billion?","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. I mean what you're seeing there is that carry-through from mostly from this year. There are a number of large projects; too, I would point to that are noteworthy. One is the new chicken plant in Humboldt Tennessee. That's a very large plant. A lot of the expenditure will land in this year, so all in one big project. The other one is project we have underway to redo our distribution network, and those are some pretty heavy investments, which have a powerful payback and are important as we move forward.","Farha Aslam","And those savings are captured in your kind of $600 million Financial Fitness? Or would that be incremental?","Stewart Glendinning","Some of the savings, yes, well; they're captured either in our Financial Fitness or in our total forecast. So I wouldn't add that to the top of any of the guidance that I've given you.","Farha Aslam","Right. Thank you for the added color.","Stewart Glendinning","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from Ken Goldman of J.P. Morgan & Co. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Goldman","Hi, good morning.","Thomas Hayes","Hi, Ken.","Kenneth Goldman","Tom, I know you don't have your long-term guidance for each segment anymore. So I'm not going to press on the specific numbers. But there was a time, not that long ago, when you were sort of saying well maybe 12% to 14% long-term is in the cards. Maybe we should we think about that. Not to put words in your mouth, but that was the rings that we were thinking about.","But now we seem to have the need for a little bit higher marketing spending than what we had in the past. And this is not uncommon. A lot of packaged food companies are talking about that. I'm just curious, is that 12% to 14% that some people still have in their mind is a reasonable range, and is that still a reasonable? Or does it cost more now to get the kind of sales you once needed?","Thomas Hayes","You're not putting words in my mouth because I actually did say it. And it is a longer-term view that we have for the potential of the Prepared Foods business as we continue to do the things that we have been doing, which is invest in the business, make smart acquisitions and continue to execute the plan that the resilient team has in place. What I've also said is that we aren't going to move margins up and to not grow the business.","So we want to continue to grow EBIT in the Prepared Foods business. So if there is a time in which we need to invest the MAP, we need to amp it up, where we need to pull back in some other areas that is going to be certainly a lever that we'll use. So that is exactly where we think the business can head, but it's going to continue to grow. And I don't want to sacrifice having a 12% or 13% margin, but having a business going backwards in terms of total EBIT because we're pushing too hard for the margin specifically.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes, I would just add on top of that, Tom, to say that really we're focused on what's the best return for our shareholders, right? And so Tom's exactly right. We could push margins even higher. The question is, is that on a growing bottom line? And is that delivering more earnings against our capital base? And I think that's the last point that I'll be leaving with you, which is our focus is driving the highest earnings against our capital base.","Kenneth Goldman","Thank you for that. And then my follow-up Stewart, I thought I heard you say the forward curve on grains points to higher Chicken prices. Was that specifically on the Small Birds where you're, at least partially, cost plus? I just wanted to get a sense of what that statement meant for the whole company.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes, so the question that it come from, Ken, was \u2013 what's driving the dynamic in 2019? And my answer was that one of those dynamics is higher grain costs. I wasn't pointing to the impact of pricing on birds. Just simply to say that if you look at the grain costs next year as compared to this year, when you look at the price curve, they're higher. And so we obviously need to consider that higher cost as we give you guidance.","Kenneth Goldman","Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","The next question will be from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Hi, thank you. A couple of questions, for fiscal 2018, I think you're saying raw material is flat for Prepared Foods compared to 2017. But for fiscal 2019, there is no guidance yet for raw materials. Now just thinking, with all this excess supply of Pork and maybe some Beef, could you foresee that being deflationary and positive to margins for fiscal 2019? Have you incorporated any thoughts into your margin guidance for 2019 there? And then I have a follow-up.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes, so I would say there are a lot of moving pieces here, some of which we don't want to break out at their lowest level. That's the reason why we give you the margin guidance. We've incorporated all the factors, including the raw material costs. And we think that's simpler and a good way for us to get that message across.","Robert Moskow","Okay, so you don\u2019t want to get into the specifics yet?","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. I don't want to break that apart, one, because I think there are a lot of moving pieces; and two, because I think there's a competitive sensitivity to talking about some of the specifics.","Robert Moskow","Okay, a different question. In Chicken value-added business, I thought I saw a lot more announcements coming of new capacity being added by competitors. And I even thought I heard of one of your competitors picking up some tray pack business at Tyson's expense. When you're talking about the demand kind of disappointment in the quarter, did any of that come from competitive intensity? And also, are you keeping track of all these capacity additions? And how do you feel it compares to demand, given that demand has been kind of soft?","Thomas Hayes","Absolutely, we are keeping track of all while the capacity expansion, and that's \u2013 for us, we're focused on our supply against our demand. And we do, certainly, win some battles and lose some battles in the marketplace. But the focus is, on the long haul, what kind of capacity do we need, not just in value-added, but also tray pack and the other businesses that we are trying to drive.","So the way to think about our capacity expansions for Tyson, what are we going to need down the road? What are the \u2013 two and three years out, that\u2019s the way that we look at it. But yes, this is a competitive business. And of course, there's going to be some areas that we will sometimes lose, but most of the time, we win.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes, the only thing I\u2019d say on Tom is that, we were expecting \u2013 when e say it's weak demand, I mean, our volume was flat, right? So it wasn't a bad outcome. It was weaker than we were expecting. We expected to see volumes up, and so it's all the matter of ways...","Robert Moskow","Okay, so no change to your capacity expansion timing?","Stewart Glendinning","No change.","Robert Moskow","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Piken","Yes, hi. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the dynamics between Small Bird, Tray Pack, and obviously, we've seen a lot of the big bird softness. But how much of the softness in \u2013 maybe recent softness in tray pack is due to weakness in big bird and just how the various segments kind of play off each other?","Thomas Hayes","Yes. Certainly, the big bird components, as we talked about or I talked about, when we go into a timing, which is countered that how it's been in the past where those supplies are coming down and we can't take advantage of it, that does hurt our buy versus grow model in terms of having the ability to maximize the potential. In terms of the other elements, we feel pretty good about the mix of our business. Although, we\u2019d always want it to be absolutely as we planned, as Stewart called out, we have big plans, and we want to make sure we hit those. But I can't give you probably, Michael, the color that you want in terms of all the individual pieces. We don't do that. Haven't done it for competitive purposes and won't break that out specifically.","Michael Piken","Okay. I guess, then, maybe let me try to swing at this one more away. Though. It seems like your Chicken business probably has more value added components between AdvancePierre, your recent acquisitions. And I guess, just even if you don't want to break out the various segments, the percentage of that Chicken business that's commodity versus value-add that you could break out without kind of segmenting tray pack versus Small Birds versus other things?","Thomas Hayes","Well, one of the things we\u2019ve talked about is what we plan for ongoing is trying to make sure that the margins are stable and growing. So we don't continue to \u2013 we continue to believe that we have an advantage model where in markets where potentially the margins are high, and they probably won't be as high as some of our competitors. And certainly when they're lower, they won't be as low. And we sort of prefer to that internally as a stabilized \u2013 stabilizing our margins. That doesn't mean we're not immune to conditions of the competitive marketplace.","So our mix is good. We are hitting the industry right now. And we are necessarily going down to that level. But as you've seen in the highs, we don't go all the way up as well. We do have some level of insulation in our business, our brands and if we talk about value-added, that is a clear focus for the team is we continue to build that and continue to drive the Tyson brand and more innovation. And I feel strong about the innovation plan that we have. Like the success. But certainly, when you have conditions like this, it puts pressure on the model.","Michael Piken","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will be from Heather Jones of The Vertical Group. Please go ahead.","Heather Jones","Good morning. Just want to clarify something you said earlier. Did I understand you correctly when you were saying that some of the short-term challenges in Chicken, specifically, the fire, things like that, et cetera, were going to abate, but you expected the demand \u2013 the pressure related to demand to accelerate into Q4?","Stewart Glendinning","Well, I think, obviously, pressure from the fire, given that it was a one-time event, certainly, that will be better because we don't expect to have it again. But just in terms of demand for Q4, I'd point you to the USDA numbers, which do show an increase for Q4. We're not speaking specifically to our demand in the fourth quarter.","Heather Jones","Okay.","Stewart Glendinning","Let me just be clear against what I said earlier. The way in which you should think about Q4 is the following: that the trends you saw in Q3 in the Chicken business, you should expect to see continue into Q4. That's probably the easiest way to just think through it.","Heather Jones","And given your 8% rough guidance for 2019, you're assuming that continues into 2019 as well?","Stewart Glendinning","That\u2019s correct.","Heather Jones","Okay. And then on the Pork side, I don't want to beat the dead horse and all, but like, when I look at the figures out there, and a lot of your plants are in the Western Corn Belt. And if you look at the spread there, I mean, it's way better than it was in late \u2013 your late Q3 and actually up year-on-year. So I'm just trying to get a sense of is this just conservatism on your part to make sure that you make the guidance? Or are you more exposed to the export markets like Mexico than maybe I understood? I'm just trying to get a sense of why we're seeing such an improvement in the markets, but your guidance actually implies a much worse Q4 than Q3?","Stewart Glendinning","Well, let\u2019s go through a couple of things. First of all, again, I go back to the point that I expect some of the trends to continue in our business from Q3 into Q4 relative to Pork and Chicken. When you take the Q4 specifically, I go back to the answer I gave earlier, which is to say that the Q3 margins in Beef were 8% and our full-year are 6%. And so the only way the math works is the Beef is that \u2013 is expected to be strong in Q4 but not as strong as Q3. And that's the easy one to overlook just because of the size of Beef.","Heather Jones","My question was on Pork. I'm \u2013 specifically on Pork because pork market, specifically, there has been a really, really dramatic improvement in the last few weeks. But yes, guidance is for it to get materially worse. And I'm just trying to figure out, is that just you all being conservative? Or is there something \u2013 is there some other factor that we can see that will drive that kind of deterioration?","Stewart Glendinning","Yes, for us, the trends that we are seeing in the market, and we have, of course, the benefit of July under our belts already, is that we see those trends continuing through Q4. There are some differences, of course, between the various producers \u2013 processes in the marketplace. Of course, we are less integrated than others, and so our price may float around a little bit. We had expected to see some improvement in Q4, and we do expect to see some improvement in Q4. But relative to last year, we don't expect to get back to the same levels we were \u2013 that we saw then.","Heather Jones","Okay. Thank you so much for the clarity.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Michael Lavery","Good morning. Thank you. Just sticking with Pork. If you are seeing some of these 3Q trends continuing, how much does a recovery for you depend on improvement in exports? And what would be the catalyst for that, if so?","Thomas Hayes","Yes. Certainly, exports are huge. And let me talk about Beef and Pork for a minute just to put some perspective there. The value of the cutout was down about 4% in Beef Q3 versus last year. Pork was about 9%-ish Q3. So that's total for Tyson of about $600 million lower Beef and $400 million lower in Pork revenue. The majority of that is due to the pressure that the issues with Mexico has created.","So for us, in the Pork business and the Beef business, having those markets return to stable, not the uncertainty that exists today, is critically important. So that's \u2013 for us, that's where we're focused on. We need to have those markets clearly open to us. And by the way, those numbers I gave are annualized numbers. But the thing that is most concerning is to have all those disruptions continue. So exports, absolutely, are a huge part of the equation.","Michael Lavery","And just to clear, your assumption is for improvement or not necessarily? What\u2019s in your 2019 guidance number for Pork?","Thomas Hayes","We don\u2019t have an assumption that they are going to improve. It's kind of the steady state that we have today and \u2013 because we just don't know. It's hard to predict. If you have an answer on that one, happy to hear it. But for us, as it relates to trade and tariffs, it's an open debate. We expect to stay open for some time.","Michael Lavery","And how much opportunity do you see for grain market adjustments or sort of third-party country workaround? Is that something you see evolving? Is that an offset that could help? Or is it too early to say or the handicap with? How much of a factor could that be?","Stewart Glendinning","That is the question actually that would be very, very difficult to for us to answer. Yes, this will tariffs seen has just sort of emerged various protein producers are trying to wrestle with it. And it would be difficult for us to give you an accurate answer on that.","Michael Lavery","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will be from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Theurer","Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to follow up quickly on Beef and the comments you put out with the expectations for the upcoming quarter. So if would put it on into context and if you take a look at the volume change performance. I mean clearly there is seems to be an incremental demand for Beef just because of pricing environment and so attractive and we seen in the quarter volume was up almost 3%, but price was down roughly 3% which brings you to that more or less flattish sales figure.","But if we take a look that on a year-to-date basis, actually, volume as up 3%. Prices are up 2%. So to get your guidance, what you talked about was that weakness into 4Q right. What are you expecting to see in terms of volume and price on Beef specific in order to actually get to the point that margins are significantly lower on a sequentially make that just 6% margin if you could clarify that would be much appreciate them.","Thomas Hayes","Thanks for the question. I think it\u2019s good one. So far we try to stay were from getting specific quarterly guidance and I think that\u2019s one of the reason why we give you that bottom line estimate so that and some of the sense of what the trends of what the trends are. But beyond that, I wouldn't want to get into sort of break out, specifically, what I see is going to happen in price and volume.","Benjamin Theurer","Okay, and the environment into next year then, I mean, assuming basically a similar environment in Beef as for 2018 full-year. Would you expect the dynamics to continue to be the ones that you have Beef as a cheaper overall source of protein becoming just more attractive and hence, the more conservative outlook on such a segments such as Chicken, but definitely a more optimistic outlook on Beef? Is that a fair assumption?","Thomas Hayes","Yes, we do have an optimistic outlook, Ben. I would say that we have good visibility into 2021. And at this point, what we've talked about in our Prepared Foods, that's good because we do see the number of animals that are out there.","Going back to the export discussion, we need to make sure that that is a continually open access to those countries, absorbing the increased production. Our business is a spread business. And so when the margins will come through and we have the calendar process and we have a good balance, and by the way, we are in the right regions, as we talked about in the past.","It's a very good environment. You might feel us be a little bit hesitant because we want to make sure that we're giving the right projections for you. But we do like where we are right now and all the way out until 2021","Benjamin Theurer","Okay, perfect. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will be from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Please go ahead.","David Palmer","Thanks good morning, just a follow up on Chicken? It looks like Tyson's margin gap to the peer processors in that Chicken segment converged margin-wise. In the past, your value-added mix, that small, midsized bird mix was helpful really as we thought versus those peers. You mentioned a couple of times in your Prepared Foods where you led off with that promotion bias by change towards burgers lately, and that's certainly been the case by a couple of the big guys.","But I guess I'm a little surprised by that being sort of your header as to a reason for the margin decline in Chicken. So could you give us a sense of sort of a ranking of the factors for Chicken? Is that really looming large? And should we think about LTOs from the big change going forward as a big factor? Thanks.","Thomas Hayes","They are big factor I mean as it relates to our forecast, we have those in and they are out. If you think about the burger LTOs, David, those were up 23%-ish, something like that. Chicken LTOs in foodservice were down 13%. So when you look at the national accounts, it was a huge number. That's, of course, a big part of our business. So that does affect - it does affect our margins. And that we need to have the right mix around us. And we are focused on what we can do to influence that, but for sure, that you're right. It is a big impact.","David Palmer","And as far as the mid-size Small Bird margins, just particularly on that side of the business, is that holding up okay? And is that going to be more of essentially a feed cost dynamic going forward?","Thomas Hayes","I don\u2019t breakout our margins by bird side, but we do \u2013 I get your comment from another angle. But we do like where we're positioned as it relates to our Small Bird business for sure.","David Palmer","Okay, thank you.","Thomas Hayes","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from Akshay Jagdale of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Akshay Jagdale","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about your value-added strategy, specifically as it relates to Chicken. In the context that the market, your forward multiple has compressed significantly where now your entire business is being valued like a commodity, right?","So in that context, I mean, what you've said so far today is there is both external and internal factors that are driving the margin to come down as much as it has, right? Like the value-added businesses that we follow don't have 30% swings in margins over a quarter, and that's what seemed to have happened in the Chicken business.","But I'm in agreement with you guys that your business long-term is actually a stable, higher-margin business. But can you just put into context how much of the guidance change going from plus 10 to 8 for the full-year is external versus internal roughly, right, ball park, just so that we can get a sense of how much this is sort of long-term versus short-term. Thank you.","Thomas Hayes","We haven\u2019t broken it down that way. Stewart's looking at the page here. What I would tell you, Akshay, is that the model is intact, but it's been stressed since stressed by the competitive marketplace. So we will continue to do what we have been doing. And I would say that the changes that we're going to be implementing will be really focused on driving even more value-added growth. We've had a bump in the road, but the model does hold up, so in terms of the breakout?","Stewart Glendinning","Yes, I mean, I'd just give you a rough sense. I'd say about relatively to the full-year change, about 35% or 40%, I'd say, it\u2019s for the internal factors, and the balance is external. That's sort of the rough numbers.","Akshay Jagdale","Got it. And just one follow-up again related to demand planning. Obviously, Tom, coming from Hillshire, I mean, that was a key competency area, competency for the company. And it's been a hallmark here at Tyson so far. But you're building a new plant, right, during the time when the demand curve has moved lower. Can you help us understand what, if anything, you're changing internally such that your demand forecasts internally are \u2013 could somewhat project the things that have happened? I know it's difficult, but are you doing anything differently?","Thomas Hayes","We are getting some more technology around this. And I would say it's not just in Chicken, but we are looking across the entire portfolio, and particularly, the more commoditized portions to understand how we can better predict what some of the performance is going to be. And it is hard. I mean, were they commoditized? They are. I would say, on the customer front, we do need to get somewhat better. And I would say, frankly, we were a bit surprised, and that's not something we'd like to be in a position of.","The overall, S&OP process, sales and operations planning process, I would say, is very sound. But there's always things we can be doing better. For us, the challenge that we have is trying to make sure that the model will stand up through difficult periods, and this is a difficult period for Chicken. And that's where we're going to continue to put the stress on our team is to make sure that we are managing every single detail as tightly as we possibly can. I do feel good that they have it in hand. But if I told you I was pleased with our forecasting in every part of the business, I wouldn't be being honest. So we need to make sure that our forecasting continues to get better.","Akshay Jagdale","Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","The next question will be from Jeremy Scott of Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Scott","Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up on that and the relationship on your margins of your value-added products versus the underlying price of the commodity, specifically in Chicken. I think there was an expectation heading into the summer that as prices came under pressure, there would be that insulation, both with your value-added as well as the buy versus grow, which you talked about before.","So I guess, the first question is, is the elasticity of your value-added pricing living up to your expectations? And if it is or isn't, what is the breaking point in breast meat prices where the marginal cost of your further processing is outpacing the marginal revenue? And then secondly, have we become too reliant on the buy versus grow model with regards to the level of insulation it provides to Tyson when you have such demand distraction as we had this quarter? ","Stewart Glendinning","So first of all, I don't think we're going to talk to kind of what point we reach marginal profitability just because, I think, that's competitively sensitive. We do think that our mix of products is positive, right. I mean, having value-added products gives higher margins. And certainly, the customer relationships that we have also provides some of that stability. But ultimately, there's no getting away from the fact that expecting the market to have \u2013 hold a certain amount of volume.","And it will ultimately have that volume because those chickens are coming through, that when there's not a strong demand that you're going to see some of the downward pressure on price relative to where you thought you would be. But still a good model we have. There's no question about that. I mean, I think if you look at our relationship within the competitive U.S. group, you'll frequently find us near the top of the rankings.","Jeremy Scott","Okay. And just maybe on Chicken for next year. I guess, I was surprised a little bit that you called out margins were going to be the same as this year, considering that you had two accretive potential acquisitions rolling in your books. Can you give an update there? And on the net [150] that you called out, because they roll through different segments, can you help us out with the gross impact of M&A next year?","Stewart Glendinning","Don\u2019t have a number specifically for the gross M&A because we didn't break out the specific size of those acquisitions. But relative to the total size of Chicken, they're not that big relative to total Chicken, which is why you don\u2019t see them moving the average so much. The external factors from \u2013 that you're seeing in the back half of this year are the ones that are going to be the most significant as we work through to next year.","Jeremy Scott","Okay. Maybe just lastly on earnings for the next year, I appreciate the visibility, it might be a bit lower for now given the issues on trade. But if you \u2013 if we assume every $1 billion sales is equivalent to about $0.25 in earnings, would you be comfortable with the fiscal 2019 number that's at or above 6.25?","Stewart Glendinning","We haven\u2019t given any EPS guidance, and I'm not going to speak to that at this point. But I think I've given you the good \u2013 the right building blocks so that you can make the right estimates.","Jeremy Scott","Okay. Thank you.","End of Q&A","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Tom Hayes for his closing remarks.","Thomas Hayes","Okay. Thanks, gang. Thanks for the questions today. I will say that the fundamentals of our business model haven't changed. We have a diversified portfolio, strong brands. We are set up well for long-term growth. We really appreciate you joining us and our team, keep focused. We are very excited about what 2019 will bring in the way of continued improvement. And we'll talk to you later on this afternoon.

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point.","Now, I would like to hand the call over to your host, Mr. Jon Kathol, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jon Kathol - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for Tyson Foods' conference call for the second quarter of the 2015 fiscal year. On today's call are Donnie Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dennis Leatherby, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our remarks today include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. I encourage you to read the news release issued earlier this morning and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of the risks that can affect our business.","This morning, we will be referring to our second quarter adjusted operating income and EPS. The company uses non-GAAP results such as adjusted EPS, adjusted operating margin and adjusted operating income to provide investors with the better understanding of the company's operating performance by excluding the impact of certain nonrecurring items affecting comparability. Please refer to today's news release for a full reconciliation of our GAAP to adjusted results.","As always we'll have a Q&A session following our prepared remarks. To ensure we get to as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, and then get back in the queue for any additional questions.","I'll now turn the call over to Donnie Smith.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased with our second quarter results. EPS was $0.75 on both an adjusted and a GAAP basis, and adjusting operating margin was 5.5%. Adjusted operating income was a Q2 record and up 53% over the same period last year. We captured $77 million in total synergies during the quarter, bringing the total to a $137 million so far this year. We initially set annual synergy targets of more than $225 million for this year and an excess of $500 million for 2017. Our progress is ahead of schedule and we're optimistic about the synergy opportunity, so we're increasing those targets to more than $250 million this fiscal year, $400 million in 2016, and $600 million in 2017.","Now, let's discuss the operating segments, and then I'll come back to the overall outlook. The Prepared Foods segment posted a record adjusting operating margin of 8.4% and record operating income of $157 in the second quarter.","Sales volume was up 70.6% with the acquired Hillshire Brands showing increased momentum through strategic pricing, brand building and innovation. These expanded capabilities, our consumer-preferred brand portfolio and a strong growing innovation pipeline will allow us to drive continued growth. We expect to maintain our current earnings trajectory and quickly move towards the new 10% to 12% normalized range indicating the strength and the relevance of the new Tyson 2.0.","I'd also like to point out that $70 million of the $77 million of synergy capture in the quarter came in the Prepared Foods segment. Through synergies, we are re-rating the cost structure of our Prepare Foods business and growing the top and the bottom lines. In the Chicken segment for the second quarter, volumes and price were roughly flat compared to Q2 of 2014.","The operating margin was 11.7%, and I'd like to point out that segment operating income for the last 12 months exceeded $1 billion. We feel really good about how we've managed our Chicken business, and I think we've positioned ourselves well. We've put our retail value-added poultry business back on track and maintained our position as the number one brand in the country. In fact, IRI four-week data indicate that our market share for frozen breaded chicken is 53.7% which is only a 1 point or 2 point below where we were when the operational challenges occurred last year.","Also within the Chicken segment, we've rightsized our small bird and the big bird business is running well. Tyson Fresh Chicken, which is still the number one brand, is outperforming its peers and the volume that will be coming from the plant in South Georgia that we're converting to tray pack is already fully committed.","As you're aware, avian influenza in the upper Midwest has affected mostly turkey and table egg flocks. At this point, the primary impact on our business is not from bird health concerns but rather from the loss of export markets for certain states and the resulting excess leg quarters in the domestic market. We've positioned ourselves well over the past several years by reducing our dependency on export leg quarters which now represent only a small percentage of our total portfolio.","We have a very good whole bird mix, especially beneficial in times of depressed leg quarter pricing and our buy-versus-growth strategy means that we're not producing leg quarters that aren't sold. We're also fast-tracking innovation to get more dark meat into value-added form at both retail and foodservice. So, we've got plenty of positives to offset the negatives.","Our Chicken business is having a great year. Adjusted for the lower leg quarter prices, we're now expecting, in the back half, we expect operating income for the full fiscal year of approximately 11%.","In the Beef segment, volume was down slightly with pricing up 9%. Operating margin was negative 0.5%. We knew it'd be a tough quarter for Beef but it was more disappointing than expected. Higher fed cattle cost and lower export volumes due to the West Coast ports slow down made it difficult to pass along increased input cost. The product is moving again out of the West Coast, albeit slower than we hoped and it could take another two to three months to clear. Orders have continued to flow in, which is encouraging for export demand. And also on the second quarter, the start-up of our Dakota City, Nebraska plant following a significant renovation project increased operating cost, but we now have the largest most modern beef facility in the United States.","For fiscal 2015, we expect fed cattle supply to be down 5% to 6% from last year. And we think we've experienced the bottom of the beef supply cycle. After this year, we believe we'll see slow incremental improvement in supply. Our Beef segment results should improve in the back half of the year, and while profitable for the year, fiscal 2015 results are expected to be below fiscal 2014. It is important to remember that we'll continue to run our Beef business for margin not market share.","In the Pork segment, volume was down 4.4% and sales price was down over 15%; operating margin was 8.2%. Our volume decrease was due to the sale of our Heinold business, and excluding the impact of the divestiture, our sales volume grew 3.2%. Demand for pork has been a little softer than expected as wholesale price declines have not been realized in the retail channel. We expect future activity to improve soon, which should improve pork consumption because a higher percentage of pork is exported than beef, the West Coast port issue had a greater effect on domestic pork supplies.","In addition, there are more hogs coming on to the market and coupled with increased weight, pork supply could be up 8% to 10% in the near term. However, we don't think it'll stay at those levels for long because that scenario isn't sustainable. For the rest of the year, we'll continue to maximize revenue relative to the live hog markets through operational efficiencies and mix optimization, and we think the Pork segment will be in the range for the year.","In the International segment, volume was down just over 30% due to the sale of our operations in Brazil and continued weak demand in China. Pricing was down 2.7% also due to demand in China as well as currency devaluation in Mexico.","Operating margin was a negative 6.8%. Segment operating losses improved following the sale of our Brazilian operations and improved market conditions in Mexico. The sale of our Mexico operations is pending the necessary government approvals and we expect to receive a decision during fiscal 2015.","Chicken pricing weakness in China persists although we're starting to see some improvement based on stronger pork pricing. We expect the International segment's adjusted operating loss to improve by about $25 million for the fiscal year. Now, let's take a look at the sales channel information. At retail, Tyson was up 3% in the latest 52 weeks, which is on track with all food and beverage retail sales through the end of March. Not only did eight out of our nine core businesses have positive dollar sales growth in both the latest year and the latest quarter, six of nine had positive dollar share growth.","In the total fresh meat and deli universe, dollar sales were up 6% for all fresh meats for the 52 weeks ended March 28. Retail prices were up 19% for ground beef and 16% for whole-muscle cuts, while pork retails were up 14%, and fresh chicken was up 4% indicating continued strong domestic demand for protein.","At foodservice, dollar sales were up 3% for all commercial restaurants. The largest growth came in QSR Mexican with dollar sales up 11% in the March-ending year and QSR chicken has the second highest growth rate.","Economic conditions for spending are the most favorable in seven years. Unemployment is down, wages are growing, consumer confidence is up, and inflation is in check. Consumers are spending less on fuel, and more on food. Although value consciousness appears to be here to stay, the consumer's ability and willingness to pay for value-added benefit is moving in a direction to afford and support protein innovation in the marketplace. We'll leverage this direction as we continue to deliver relevant innovation with new varieties for Park's Finest hot dogs by Ball Park and Hillshire Farm natural lunchmeat.","We'll also be introducing three disruptive innovation platforms in Q4, capitalizing on the snacking and freshness consumer trends with the launches of Hillshire Snacking, Ball Park jerky and Jimmy Dean's simple scrambles. We'll break into new sections of the store with these launches and while still continuing to expand our convenient meal and snacking offerings in frozen chicken. Our Hillshire Snacking launch continues to show success in test market. Within the test, category growth is up 17% with Hillshire responsible for nearly half the growth and especially important to our retail partners, over a third of Hillshire's Snacking dollars are incremental to the category.","We're also seeing successful foodservice innovation behind Chef Pierre, Layer Luxe pies, and we're looking forward to launches coming this month within foodservice brands such as Tyson Red Label Chicken, and our expansion of Bistro Collection Desserts. All this puts Tyson Foods in a solid position. Cash flow is strong, giving us options for 2016. If there aren't any strategic acquisitions of interest, we'll invest in our business and buy back stock.","Our balanced portfolio, increased synergy capture, and strong momentum in Prepared Foods, coupled with favorable pork raw material costs, give us confidence that we'll achieve our annual guidance of $3.30 to $3.40 adjusted EPS despite near-term challenges. We're very well positioned with sound fundamentals and a solid growth story.","Synergy capture is going very well. We're gaining momentum in retail brand as we make rapid progress with the integration. We have advantaged brands in advantaged categories, protein is extremely relevant to today's consumers.","According to IRI, 99% of our refrigerated product sales are in categories that are showing positive year-over-year growth. In frozen food, 92% of our products are in categories that are showing growth over last year. We are currently number two among all other major food and beverage companies in terms of dollar sales growth for the 52 weeks ended March 19.","And let's not forget foodservice where restaurant traffic is showing growth as consumers benefit from lower gas prices and improved economic conditions. We have a lot going for us and we're comfortable projecting at least 10% adjusted EPS growth in fiscal 2016 which is in keeping with our stated goal.","And now let's go to Dennis for the financial update.","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Donnie, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was another record quarter as we delivered strong financial results, demonstrating the value of the diversity of our portfolio. Our revenues grew by 10.5% compared to the same period a year ago as we produced our third consecutive $10 billion quarter. Adjusted return on sales for the quarter was 5.5% and adjusted operating income was $553 million, representing a 53% increase over Q2 of 2014.","Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 this quarter was a record for a second quarter and represents a 25% increase from $0.60 in the comparative period last year. Our rolling four quarter adjusted EPS of $3.14 reached another milestone by surpassing $3 per share and has been consistently growing over the past eight quarters. Operating cash flow through two quarters was $808 million, and we spent $435 million on capital expenditures, which was $139 million greater than depreciation, as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC.","Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 35.6%. Net debt to EBITDA for the past 12 months was 3.3 times. On a pro forma basis, including Hillshire's results for the past 12 months, net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 2.7 times. Net interest expense was $70 million during the second quarter. Including cash of $223 million, net debt was $7.4 billion. Total liquidity was $1.3 billion, remaining above our goal of $1.2 billion. For the quarter, our diluted shares outstanding were 415 million.","The sale of our Mexican operation is pending the necessary government approvals and we expect to receive a decision during fiscal 2015. Subject to completion of the sale, we will use the proceeds to pay down debt.","Now here are some thoughts on the remainder of fiscal 2015. Please note our accounting cycle results in a 53-week year in fiscal 2015 as compared to a 52-week year in fiscal 2014. Accordingly, this outlook is based on a 52-week year to make a better year-over-year comparison.","We expect revenues of approximately $41 billion for fiscal 2015, which is over 9% growth compared to fiscal 2014. This is driven primarily by a full year of Hillshire Brands offset by a reduction in our International operations. In fiscal 2015, we expect to capture more than $250 million from our Prepared Foods profit improvement initiatives and Hillshire Brands synergies.","Net interest expense should approximate $275 million for fiscal 2015. We currently estimate our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 35.5%. CapEx is expected to be $900 million, which is approximately $300 million or 50% more than our depreciation as we continue to focus on projects that create long-term shareholder value.","By the end of fiscal 2015, we expect net debt to adjusted EBITDA of approximately 2 times. Based on our average share price in Q2, we expect our diluted shares in Q3 to be around 415 million, prior to considering any changes in our stock price, which would impact the dilution from our tangible equity units.","Our priorities for the significant cash flows that our operations will generate are for continued rapid deleveraging and strengthening of our balance sheet, a sustained focus on disciplined capital allocation to drive long-term shareholder value, creating incremental debt capacity to fund acquisitions to fulfill our growth strategies and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, all while maintaining plenty of liquidity.","In closing, our Q2 results continue to demonstrate the value of our diversified business model. With the addition of Hillshire valuing up our portfolio along with the synergies we expect to capture, Prepared Foods is expected to finish strong with margins above 8% for the remainder of fiscal 2015.","Our Chicken segment has delivered more than $1 billion in operating income over the past 12 months and should produce an operating margin of approximately 11% for fiscal 2015. Although our Beef segment has faced volatile market conditions this year, we believe the worst is behind us. We expect our Beef segment to be profitable in fiscal 2015 but below 2014 results, while our Pork segment is projected to operate in its normalized range for the year.","Despite a number of headwinds coming at us, we have a great team which gives me confidence we will deliver strong results in the second half of the year to not only meet our guidance of $3.30 to $3.40 adjusted earnings per share, but also grow EPS by at least 10% in fiscal 2016.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Okay. Our first question is from Ken Goldman [JPMorgan Securities]. Your line is now open. Please proceed.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody. I know these are difficult to sort of put into numbers, but you had two headwinds in the quarter, right, avian flu and the West Coast port strike that you said didn't help, right? So, is there any way for us to quantify how much these headwinds maybe hurt margins or EPS in the quarter?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Ken, as we look at \u2013 I'm going to combine the both, probably around $20 million for Q2. And as you know, they're continuing to linger, so we're going to have to continue dealing with them over the next quarter or two. But we're hoping that the West Coast port issue should clear up in the next two to three months. There are some ebb and flows that kind of keep us from having all the confidence we'd like to have in that, but figure Q2 at $20 million, and some of that gets pushed into Q3 and on forward.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And that's $20 million to the operating line?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Call it, round numbers, $0.03 a share or something like that.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, yeah. Okay. Perfect. No, I just wanted to make sure it wasn't on the net line. And then I realize not everything is going as well as initially forecast this year, namely beef, but most of the business is doing pretty well and you keep beating consensus estimates, raising synergy targets. So, I guess my question is this, if you had to focus on one reason why you didn't raise guidance today, would beef be the primary reason or is there something else we should be looking at?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","So, yeah, as we look at Prepared Foods, we'll continue to deliver over 8% in Prepared Foods. Now, there's a couple of categories \u2013 by the way, the categories that are showing really good growth where we've given up a little bit of share and we're going to need to reinvest some of the raw materials savings in the back half to regain that share and protect those businesses for the long term.","The other categories, it's probably export-related. With the West Coast port slowdown, if we're two to three months from seeing that, then that's going to linger a little bit into Q4, and we're just uncertain as to whether or not our estimate on that is correct. And then, these AI bans we've seen \u2013 even as late as last week, we saw a couple of other outbreaks or few more outbreaks of AI up in the upper Midwest in turkey and table egg flocks. And as those outbreaks continue, it continues to push out the time when those AI bans would be lifted. And so, we're predicting a little bit more export leg quarter pricing softness in the back half than what we had thought before. So, hopefully, that sums it up.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","It does. Thank you very much.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","By the way, Ken, if we're overly conservative on these issues, then certainly our back half could improve further.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kenneth Zaslow [BMO Capital Markets]. Your line is now open. Please proceed.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, I just wanted to explore the Prepared Foods a little bit more. So, you're hitting 8.4% this quarter in margins and I guess the point that you're going to be having to reinvest some of the lower input costs. But how does it not sequentially improve throughout the year as your synergy targets go up? The at least or in excess of 8% seems like it should be in excess of 9% or in excess of 10%, can you help us understand that?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, certainly as we get into 2016, Ken, our expectation is to be rapidly approaching our new projected normalized range of 10% to 12%. And what we're talking about is just the flow of operating income improvement to get to that point. So, with the favorability in raw materials plus what we're going to need to reinvest back in some of these categories, we're going to be over 8% in the back half. If raw materials are a little more favorable than we thought, then certainly that number will improve. But you will see a sequential increase in operating income in our Prepared Foods segment through this fiscal year and then into next.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then going into 2016, the idea that you could get at least 10% growth, can you talk about what are your key assumptions to get you there because it seems again, not that it's a layup but it seems a little bit easier maybe than what you're saying, so I'm just trying to figure out exactly how you're getting to that at least 10% growth in 2016?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So, we'll be in the second year of our synergy capture and as we said a little earlier that's got a little better. So, we see improvements there as we continue to reset the cost structure in Prepared Foods. For the first time in 18 months, we've now got the capacity to increase fully-cooked chicken sales, and this \u2013 and next year, 2016, will be the first year where we have an incremental year-over-year ability to have a full-year sale growth in fully-cooked chicken.","If we're right, and we're at the \u2013 we've seen the trough in the beef supply cycle, then our beef numbers should improve sequentially next year over this. Oh, by the way, back on chicken, we're starting up the trade back plan in South Georgia this month, so we'll have a full year of those results in our number next year.","I would think that pork is set up to have a pretty good year next year, and we think that's going to provide good raw material price discourse in our Prepared Foods business. Not to mention the fact we're going to be generating a lot of cash, so we'll get to pay down debt, we'll have opportunities to continue to invest in our business, that type of thing. And again, we've got great brands, and we've got them in great categories that are growing and we'll be using our brand growth to continue to drive this expectation of having stable consistent earnings growth over time.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, is the be at least 10% just a stab to just start there? It sounds like that's \u2013 because you got to lap all of these \u2013 the $20 million this quarter probably, there's probably going to be $15 million to $20 million next quarter as well, and then you have all of these things. If you let at least 10% just as a starting point and say, hey look, this is in line with our long-term growth targets, it's not really a true projection of where we're going to go, it could be higher than that. Is that a fair statement?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","I can tell you, for us Ken, it's early. But I'm not \u2013 no, I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm taking a stab. I mean, we feel comfortable about our ability to deliver 10% EPS growth next year with a lot of reasons to do so but it's hard to get anymore granular than what we've said this early in 2015.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. Great. I appreciate it.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Farha Aslam [Stephens, Inc.]. Your line is now open, please proceed.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Just kind of building on Ken's discussion about next year and 10% EPS growth. I think why Ken is focusing in on that because you'll have probably $150 million of incremental synergies next year. So, that's 7% of EPS growth right there. So, perhaps you could just share with us your outlook in to 2016 about the performance of the core business. And clearly, there is concern that, is it only 10% EPS growth because you think that poultry is going to feel pressure from increased pork and beef on the market. Could you just kind of address your 10% EPS growth targets with relation to how your various divisions \u2013 how you are expecting them to flow into next year?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So, yeah, I'll just break down through segments. So, we would certainly see the opportunity in our Prepared Foods segment to approach our normalized range. In Chicken, at this point, if we project the current soft leg quarter prices into next year, we're still at or above the top end of our normalized range in Chicken. Again, beef should get a little bit better than this year. We think pork will improve next year over this year. So, there's good \u2013 we feel comfortable that 2016 is set out to be a very good year for us.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's very helpful. And then just focusing on operations within particularly chicken and Prepared Foods, this quarter your volume in chicken was flat year-over-year, and the market was growing. If you look out into the second half of the year and into 2016, what do you expect Tyson's volume growth to be in chicken? And particularly in your cooked divisions, are all your plants up online?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I'll start at the back and go up. Yes, we have full capacity to produce fully cooked items now. So, we're all up and online. In terms of next year's growth, I'm going to \u2013 hey, Farha, it is really, really early, okay?","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Understood.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","But I would say somewhere 1% to 2% sales volume growth, don't know that I would predict any production volume growth. Next year, my guess is we'll do a lot more of buy versus grow, which, by the way, there's some impact in that in the flat volume of this year, because this year we bought about 50% more loads a week as part of buy versus grow program than we did last year. So, we don't have the sales or the volume of the back half those birds, but that's a good thing. So, yes, we will have sales growth next year, and I would predict the revenue growth to outpace the sales growth. But in terms of production, we currently wouldn't see our production up.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Adam Samuelson [Goldman Sachs & Co.]. Your line is now open. Please proceed.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe shifting a little bit more into the Hillshire pieces, the 20% increase to the 2017 targets. Can you walk through the buckets, the synergy upside, you think it would come from? And along the same lines, if you think about $600 million of synergies, an incremental $350 million off of what you're expecting to realize in 2015, wouldn't you be at that, call it the high end of your 10% to 12% normalized Prepared Foods margin range? (29:56-30:02).","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Adam, you were cutting out just a little bit. I think I got the gist of your question, so if I miss it, please ask a follow-up. But a reminder, our synergies number is all of Prepared Foods. And so, we talked about four primary categories, that being operational improvements, procurement, let's call it logistics, and then some organizational and fiduciary type stuff. But the big three categories where in operational improvements, procurement and manufacturing, and logistics.","So, the over delivery so far in the first two quarters has been in the operational improvement, as we've been able \u2013 and this by the way primarily, but not exclusively impacted the legacy Prepared Foods Tyson business. We've seen some improvement as we've been able to move some of our product mix between plant to streamline our cost structure, streamline our operational efficiencies, and by the way, get on top with some service issues that we had in Q1. So, we feel great about our ability from this point forward to service our customer.","As we go forward, what you'll really see is some improvement in the operations category, more improvement in the logistics and in the purchasing categories over time. And those will \u2013 a lot of that becomes what we're calling a reset of our Prepared Foods cost structure. So, as we take that improved cost structure and what we believe will be improved raw materials in Prepared Foods into 2016 along with the great capabilities we have to launch new innovation and multiple levers to adjust our pricing and volume, and trade and MAP spend, we see a great opportunity to have that business up into its normalized range as we move forward.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And Donnie, just on that point, doesn't the incremental $250 million (32:20) from synergies beyond 2015, wouldn't that get you north of 12% or what do you think the new normalized range could actually prove to be conservative?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Adam, it's too early to tell because of what \u2013 of some of those types of synergy that we would use to spin back to grow volume in those categories. Remember we've got advantaged brands and advantaged categories. And as these categories are growing, we want to make sure that we maintain strong market share in them to capture the growth as we move forward.","So, we'll manage that carefully. And certainly, if there's a way to improve margins, we'll do that, but we feel comfortable now saying that a normalized range of that business should be in the 10% to 12% range.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","But it seems like (33:22-33:28) like you're implying about 10% for the chicken in the second half of the fiscal year? A, is that accurate? And B, is it (33:35)?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Adam, I'm sorry. I didn't catch 10% \u2013 I caught 10% of your message which was the word ten percent, I'm not sure.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","The second half chicken margins, it seems (33:51-34:00)?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry, Adam. Operator, we'll follow-up Adam \u2013 I'm sorry, we just can't \u2013 we just can't get the question.","Operator","Yes, sir. Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Piken [Cleveland Research Co.]. Your line is now open, please proceed.","Michael L. Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah, good morning. Just wanted to touch base with you on the chicken and just sort of get your view on kind of how we should be interpreting some of the recent pullet data? And specifically, your thoughts on how much of the boiler eggs are going to Mexico versus in the past and how much you think is staying here?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Michael. So, we're seeing about around number 7% growth in pullets. We think about 3% of that's going to Mexico, probably 8% of that is getting spent back to lower the hen age which leaves about 3% as the growth in the actual breeder flock.","And by the way, so far year-to-date \u2013 I'm just look at fresh retail but obviously we've got great opportunities in foodservice. You're seeing growth there as well. But demand for chicken at \u2013 fresh chicken at retail just using a category that we can get numbers around is up about 3%, 3.5% versus a year ago. So, there is good, strong demand growth, and we think that will continue because we don't really see beef pricing halo changing. There's ample opportunities particularly at retail to drive a lot more pork volume and not hurt chicken volume at all. So, we see a very favorable environment coming out of this year and going into 2016 in terms of demand.","Michael L. Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Terrific. That's really helpful. And then, I guess kind of following up on that. I mean, I know you talked a little bit about some of the issues with the ports and pork's reliance on exports. But it seems like with all these lower-cost hogs available, it would seem like maybe projecting into 2016 that there might be some incremental margin opportunities in pork with all that excess supply in your plants (36:08) higher utilization rates. So, how should we sort of think net-net about kind of the increase in pork supplies over your entire business? It sounds like you think there's enough demand out there to support the increased pork and chicken?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Certainly that is a favorable environment for our business. I would probably be a lot more comfortable talking about the impact to our pork margins overall a quarter from now, when we've seen some of this export West Coast port issue get resolved. And you'll start seeing freight flow more traditionally than what it has over the last 90 days to 120 days of course.","So, we'll feel better about having a lot better commentary, more specific commentary about that on our next quarter but certainly the environment is set up well for our Pork business. And again, on the chicken demand, we see strong chicken demand at least through next year and I think carrying on because \u2013 and a good reason for that is as the millennials enter the marketplace, they over-index to chicken. And so, we think you're going to see good strong chicken growth and we also think you're going to see that beef halo continue; all that sets up very well for our business.","Michael L. Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Terrific. And then lastly, if you could give us any sort of quantification on how much of a raw material benefit you might expect in the back half of the year in Prepared Foods from lower commodity prices, recognizing that you are investing more into the brands. Thanks.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, let me quantify that this way. The pork cutout is down about 40% versus a year ago and the items within the cutout that are showing the most weakness are the further processing items. So, if you look at those hams, bellies, trim, those are the items that have shown the most weakness. And certainly, that's favorable for our Prepared Foods business.","So, hopefully, that gives you enough color around \u2013 now, one thing to add, we do over-index a little bit versus our competitors on beef because \u2013 our hotdog business and others, a couple of other businesses in our portfolio. But still, this weakness in the pork cutout, particularly among the grinding meat, is very favorable for our business.","Michael L. Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Moskow [Credit Suisse]. Your line is now open, please proceed.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, Thanks. Donnie, I was wondering if I could ask you just to go a little bit deeper on the incremental step up next year on the synergies in Prepared Foods. You said it's logistic savings and a reset of the cost structure in Prepared Foods. But I guess I'm still a little unclear as to what that really means. I mean is it a function of procuring raw materials from your internal supplies that is something that you're not doing now but you plan to do next year? Is there something else happening in terms of new processes, or are you taking more steps in your supply chain footprint? Can you go a level deeper for us?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. It's not in buying raw materials or moving raw materials within the portfolio, because none of that is factored in. The big improvements are this: as we've been able to combine the footprint \u2013 if you'll think back, we had a lot of latent capacity in the Tyson Prepared Foods footprint, and when we bought Hillshire we had a perfect opportunity to then take all of that latent capacity out of the system and run more volume \u2013 by the way, more branded not private label volume, through a smaller footprint and lower our cost structure.","There're still some opportunities now to go through those facilities and increase efficiencies. Remember, some of them are running new products they've not run before, so we'll see incremental benefits as we continue to work on continuous improvement and operational efficiencies in those plants. And that will re-rate our cost structure, and then that lower cost structure, obviously, will be selling a lot more branded items than it was before, which is the big move in the Prepared Foods' normalized range from where we were up into that 10% to 12% range.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. I think I get it. And as far as new products, you mentioned the snacking platform. Hillshire also introduced a frozen platform. Are those platforms going to be running through legacy Tyson plants, and if so, can you give us a little update on how well the frozen one is doing? I saw it on shelf. Is it doing okay?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","So, overall, very well. The sandwich items probably didn't have the pull that we wanted them to. So, what we're doing is focusing that launch on the \u2013 there was a 16-item launch that might have been a little much, so we're concentrating that launch down to those items that are going to give us the best growth opportunities forward. The bowls \u2013 if you remember, we had sandwiches and we had bowls, the bowls are doing great. We still think, by the way, that that will be one of the best launches of the year. So, we feel good about it. It's not exactly like what we thought it would be, but still, we've been able to manage it to a point it's going to do very well. And we're very optimistic about the platform launches that we have.","By the way, back to the Hillshire platform, both the Naturals and the Classics are going very, very well, driving great incremental growth to the categories. We feel super about all of the innovation that we've launched and then what we will be launching in new categories in Q4.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Akshay Jagdale [KeyBanc Capital Markets]. Your line is now open. Please proceed.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So, I wanted to continue on the Prepared Foods. You're doing really well obviously on the cost side. I wanted to focus on the revenue side. Can you tell us what the organic growth was this quarter in Prepared Foods if you exclude the acquisition impact? What was, like, organic growth?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","I can tell you that both the legacy Prepared Foods business and let's call it the legacy Hillshire business, just for clarity, both were over plan on both volume and on operating income. So, we feel very good about how the Prepared Foods business is performing.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And just on innovation and more so broadly on reinvesting these cost savings into future growth, can you give us a little bit more color on the innovation pipeline? It was helpful that you'd talked about the lunch \u2013 launch into lunch, if I may, sandwiches, and that it didn't go as well as planned. Can you give us some more sort of broader and longer-term view on innovation because from what I remember one of the best parts about this acquisition was the R&D innovation team at Hillshire feeling much better about their prospects as part of Tyson. So, can you give us an update on that?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. It's been exciting to see both of the R&D teams come together combined with all of the innovation and business unit\/teams come together and find a lot of opportunities between foodservice and retail to be able to grow our business through innovation.","One of the primary tools that we use to measure whether or not we've got enough innovation in the pipeline is what we call a vitality index. What we do is we look at products that were created over the last three years and we determine our percentage of revenue that comes from these new products. So for 2015, we're expecting retail to be at about 14% vitality index. And, by the way, that's in the best in class range. And for food service, we're currently expecting more than 20%. So, these are very aggressive goals but we have a great team that continues to focus on looking at insights and create innovative solutions to fill the consumer gap so that we're always relevant. We know we're in relevant categories. In this way we know we've got relevant innovation inside those categories.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just one last one on chicken, just broadly speaking, longer term, is it your contention that the industry is not cyclical anymore? I mean, obviously, historically, the industry would over supply the market and margins would flip around within a year. It's not been the case this time around. It looks like that process might be starting now but you're saying it's not going to impact you in 2016. So, can you just talk a little bit broadly about do you think the industry is not cyclical anymore? If so, why?","And if it is cyclical, when the cycle does turn, when the industry will overproduce which, I guess, none of us really know when that'll happen. Do you still believe you can grow EPS 10% when that happens? Thank you.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Akshay. So, we're certainly working very hard not to be cyclical. That's our whole path forward. So, if you look at our business and you look at, over the last two or three years, our improvement in our sales mix \u2013 by the way, even with the operational issues we had in our fully cooked retail chicken business, our branded chicken business, we're back to within a share point or two of where we were before that happened, so that the Tyson brand at retail is very meaningful, is very resilient, and we think it's got lots of opportunities to continue to grow.","We've got a great, broad portfolio. We've got a great innovation pipeline, and by the way, new and improved innovative capability for the future. We've seen a lot of operational improvements. We've got plenty of cash flow to do whatever CapEx we need to do as illustrated by taking a South Georgia plant, and taking it from an unprofitable product mix into one of our most profitable categories, our fresh tray pack business.","So, those are all \u2013 those are some of the things that we're doing to decrease our cyclicality to give our investors a consistent, stable earnings growth over time. And, yes, we do believe we can see 10% growth.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Well, what about the industry? What's your view on the industry?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","We spend all of our time, Akshay, focusing on what we're going to do. And if you'll remember, we put a forward demand picture out 12 months to 15 months. And then we built a production plan based on that demand curve so that we know how we can manage our business and our production. That keeps us in a position to buy versus grow. So, in a period of increased industry supply, then we'll simply buy that raw material, add value to it, and as long as we're focusing on the customer and growing our value-added sales, we've got a great footprint to do that within. By the way, we have plenty of value-added capacity over the next year too. So, we're very comfortable that in the scenarios that we can paint forward, we've got a great outlook.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Hundley [BB&T Capital Markets]. Your line is now open, please proceed.","Brett Michael Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Brett Michael Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets","Donnie, I want to stay on the topic actually and maybe ask Akshay's question a different way as well. When you think about your strategy in chicken, specifically buy versus grow, can you discuss the level that you're comfortable taking your portfolio as far as buy versus grow as a percentage of your portfolio?","And as the chicken cycle potentially slides off here in coming periods, I think there's more of a view today that we could see a slide instead of that sharp fall-off that we've traditionally seen across the industry. As the chicken cycle potentially slides off or in that type of scenario, is Tyson's Chicken business equipped to return margin in line with kind of what you're looking for today, 11% or so?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","So, if I understood the question right on the front-end, we think we've got the opportunity depending on the part that we're buying. To buy up to as much as 10% of our sales, so \u2013 or the product that would go into our sales. So, we feel very good about the flexibility that we have within our network to manage buy versus grow.","If you remember a couple of quarters ago, I think, Dennis, when we raised our normalized range in chicken...","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","...and certainly we've had great favorability in the marketplace for this year, it's certainly our intention to continue raising our margin expectations. And with the work we've done, to balance our portfolio across the various bird classes, increasing our value-added sales, right-sizing our small bird business. We under-indexed big bird, but that's fine for us because there's a lot of that product available on the marketplace to buy. We have great Tyson brands. We're number one at frozen retail, number one in frozen snack and chicken, we're number one in fresh tray pack, number in IQF, number one in Cornish. So, we've got a great brand presence in categories that are very meaningful to consumers. So, that gives us the confidence to be able to look at our business forward and feel very good about our ability to deliver.","Brett Michael Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then my second question is kind of two-part here: one near term; and one longer term, higher level. First, starting with the question on your Beef business, you mentioned at the outset that results were softer than expected in a tough environment. And surely, when we look at your outperformance relative to beef industry margin that we calculate, your outperformance that we've traditionally seen has come in a little bit during the quarter.","And you mentioned a couple of different things with the West Coast port and then your plant in Dakota. Can you give us a sense of what percentage of the impact was from Dakota and maybe how long that would be expected to last? You gave some assumptions on the port clearance but can you talk a little bit more about your beef plant there?","And then longer term and somewhat related, how important and necessary is it for you, Donnie, and your team to remain a multi-protein company, offering everything that you do today? Thank you.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","So, if I look at the impact of our Dakota City start-up to the rest of \u2013 well, to our Q2 results, let's see, if I think about our index, it may have been about, I don't know, 40% to 45% of the change in how our index performed versus where we had been performing in the previous couple of quarters. And remember, in that quarter, cattle supplies were very, very tight, so that \u2013 well, we had a huge capital investment. We needed to start the plan-up. So, we did it. But we started to plan up in the quarter when we probably had the lowest cattle supply, so that didn't help matters any.","But the good news is the plant started up fine. We're working through the start-up issues on Q3, and it will help give us access to bigger cattle, which was what the whole process was all about. So, yes, that had an impact. As we look forward, we think it's very important that we have a presence in the whole broad array of meat protein and as you know in our portfolio, some non-protein items that are very complementary to protein. So, yeah, you should expect us to continue to have that in the portfolio.","Brett Michael Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets","Thanks, Donnie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is Diane Geissler [CLSA]. Your line is now open. Please proceed.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Yeah, I had a question about your comments on buy versus grow and just wanted to make sure I understood them. So, you said you had the capability of buying up to 10% of your sales on the outside market.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","For that part, I'm sorry. For that part. So, if it's breast meat, we can buy about 10% of the breast meat that we sell and run it through our plants.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. So, just thinking forward, I mean, obviously, I think it's pretty clear to everybody that we're moving through a period where there's going to be significantly more production, whether or not you think 3% of the eggs are going to Mexico, or whatever that percentage is. You raised your expectations for total poultry availability this year from the time you reported your last quarter.","So I guess, the question that I think the investors are often asking me, so how should we think about buy versus grow? Pretty clear you've probably been raising most of your own sales here recently, but as you look into the second half of 2015 and into 2016, can you talk about what your production plans are versus the industry to help give us a better idea about how exposed you're going to be to leg quarter prices here going forward, and how exposed you will be to the boneless, skinless breast meat price as we move to the summer and into 2016?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. For the year, our production this year versus last will be flat. We've been up a little bit in the front half of the year. And after July 4, our production will be declining versus year-over-year. So, for the total fiscal year, our production volume will be flat, which, by the way, to your point, does reduce risk of export vulnerability and that type of thing. Of course, let me hasten on to add, because I don't think I've mentioned this before, and I think it's really important.","Over the last three years, we've reduced the amount of export leg quarters we sell every bit of 30%. And if you go back to probably fiscal 2010, sometime in right 2009, fiscal 2010 we're probably down in half. So, we feel very good about \u2013 and these are the things that we're doing to provide a more consistent, stable return that grows over time. And so, we feel very good about our ability to maintain production flexibility and to improve our mix.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","And then in 2016?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","I think \u2013 hey, I think our production will be basically flat in 2016. We think we'll be buying more raw material in 2016 than we do this year. And by the way, we're up 50% this year over last year. We think our sales volume will be up. I think I mentioned earlier about 1% or 2%. Our dollar sales will be up a little bit higher than that. But feel very comfortable that we can buy the raw material we need and add value to it \u2013 sorry, add value to it and be able to maintain our margin structure.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And then I wanted to ask about the cash priorities which are pretty consistent period to period in terms of your list of items that you're spending your cash on. But I wanted to ask about share repo which \u2013 I'm generally not a big fan of share repo. But I think there's a big disconnect between the sell side recommending your stock and you seeming very confident in your ability to generate 10%-plus EPS growth. And the buy side, just if you look at kind of the fact that the stock has not done much over the last 12 months. Given your level of confidence in your ability to increase earnings 10% from here on out, why is share repo not sort of higher on that list of priorities if you really feel that your shares are kind of undervalued?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Great question, Diane. But remember, it's important for us to maintain an investment-grade rating. And so, what we're trying to do is get down below a net-to-debt-to-EBITDA of about 2 times, and we think kind of the sweet spot for us would be in that 1.5 times to 2 times area. So, when we get there, then, drawing off $1 billion and growing in free cash flow, that opens up the door for returning cash to shareholders in the absence of major growth opportunities.","Now, I would hurry on to say that growing is, first and foremost, most important to us. But that being said, certainly we can start buying back stock at that time. I would see that as an opportunity at the start of 2016, which should be a good time to get started at the rate we're running.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. So, you think you'd be sub 2 times by the end of this fiscal year?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, terrific. Thank you.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Palmer [RBC Capital Markets]. Your line is now open. Please proceed.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning. At your Analyst Day, you mentioned that you believe Tyson's Chicken segment margin would be 5% if the industry margin were to go to zero. Were you implying that 5% would be your best thinking for a worst-case margin for that segment? How did you arrive at those numbers? Thanks.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","So, what we did is we just looked at our incremental improvement over the last four or five years in relative benchmarking services. The real point I think looking forward is we feel great about where our business is. Yes, we benchmark ourselves consistently, but for next year, we think we'll be at or above the upper end of our range, and our guys are running a great chicken business.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","When you think about the export bans, typically \u2013 I don't know how many case studies there are or similar situations. How fast do those bans lift typically after an avian flu issue subsides?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Typically, and I'm emphasizing typically, 60 days, probably more likely 90 days. And so, for us Arkansas has been hit a little bit more than the other states because of our production footprint. And we saw a AI event in Arkansas early in the first week of March. But as we continue \u2013 those countries that banned the United States and not on a state-by-state basis, as you continue to see AI accessions in turkey and table egg flocks in the northern Midwest, you can pretty well figure a timeline no sooner than 60 days to 90 days out front before the ban will be lifted.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then one last one \u2013 removing human antibiotics seems to be a restaurant industry move, at least, that will play out probably through the end of 2016 if you're using McDonald's as an indicator. What does this mean? Will this be the new price to play for the foodservice side and perhaps increasingly in the supermarket side? What ultimately will this mean for your Chicken segment margins over the next couple of years? Thank you.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","David, it really won't have a margin impact. Our view is that by eliminating non \u2013 by eliminating the human-used antibiotics out of our poultry production by September of 2017, that is the most reasonable and responsible approach to balancing a global health concern about antibiotic resistance with our core value of taking care of the welfare of the animals that are entrusted to us. So, that was the impetus about what we're doing. It wasn't necessarily in reaction to anything any customers were doing. It was a matter of, we've been working on this effort for several years. We've reduced human-used antibiotics in our supply chain by over 80% in the last four years. And we now think we can see a point in the future, a couple of years from now, when we can not have to use human-used antibiotics in the poultry production.","But I don't think \u2013 but back to the original point, it will not have a material impact on our cost.","David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Tiberio [Miller Tabak]. Your line is now open, please proceed.","Tim Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co. LLC","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I guess, moving beyond some of the near-term export challenges, I wanted to get your thinking about, I guess, your medium-term global poultry or chicken demand growth. One of your global peers in Brazil recently stated that they felt that supply growth within Brazil, unlike the U.S., was still fairly benign. And I guess looking out in just 2016, if we're not seeing the supply growth come back as quickly from one of your global export competitors, do you think that this could actually create maybe a release valve or a window of opportunity if we can get past some of these export bans?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","So, certainly that would be a favorable development. As we look forward, we think protein demand globally is going to continue to grow at about 2% year, maybe just a tad under that. We think chicken probably outpaces the other proteins just because it's the most efficient converter of feed into meat. That could be a headwind \u2013 so, there's still time for that dynamic to change so it's a little bit too early for us to call it, but certainly that being the case, that would be helpful to the back half of our 2016 year.","Tim Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co. LLC","Great. And just lastly, USDA mentioned that they're starting, I guess, testing within animals for the potential vaccine for the AI strain. I know it's very difficult to handicap at this point, but I guess, have you had initial conversations with USDA and FDA? I would assume, and do you have a high confidence level that we could get that into production potentially before we start seeing the southern migratory path of some of the wild waterfowls which I guess has really been the issue with the spread of AI this year?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","It's really too soon to say, Tim. We've got lots of contacts in what I will call animal pharma that we work with and it's just too early to say whether or not we'll have an effective vaccine.","Tim Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Tim Ramey [Pivotal Research Group]. Your line is now open, please proceed.","Timothy S. Ramey - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Thanks so much. Just a little bit of a follow-up on the last question, but Donnie, it's been a spectacular couple of years, but it wasn't spectacular for some of the reasons we thought it would be, which kind of relates back to the feeding the world, growing middle class where we are going to see more protein demand globally. I mean, do you kind of think that's just demand deferred or is that demand denied? Is that still part of the long-term story here?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I really think it is. As we look across the globe, you've got economies in some of the key growth areas that have slowed down maybe more than we hear about. And so I think that demand growth is temporary, as we continue to look, and we've spent a lot of time over the last several months looking at population growth, income growth, those regions of the countries where that will happen, how much of the growth in food consumption, and how much of the growth in value-added food consumption is going to happen outside of the U.S., and it is significant over the next several years. So, yeah, I think maybe near-term, we've seen a little unexpected softness. But I think as we look out about three or four or five years from now, we'll look back on this time as a small dip in a period of time where we still saw about 2% consumption growth in protein worldwide.","Timothy S. Ramey - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Great. And then just on food service, wondering if you're seeing any mix change in reaction to perhaps limited supply of liquid eggs, or the beef supply being so difficult. QSRs, is there incremental shift in kind of what the menu looks like?","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","We think that, of course, 50s have been pretty soft, but 90s have remained very, very high. So, we think as we \u2013 and it seems to us that the cutout is shifting a bit, and you've seen 50s prices firm back up. So, as we look at that, what we think that's going to do is drive incremental growth particularly at QSR in chicken. We also are seeing, fortunately, and because the QSR Mexican category is growing the most \u2013 so, QSR Chicken's probably up 8%, QSR Mexican is up 11%. And QSR Mexican favors our portfolio in a couple of ways. It uses dark meat, and it also is a pretty heavy user of protease, so that's good for our business, too. So, as we look at the trend going through the summer, we feel very good about it being favorable to our business.","Timothy S. Ramey - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Excellent. Thanks.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Donald J. Smith - President & Chief Executive Officer","So, before we go, I'd like to say again that we are building momentum at Prepared Foods. We're capturing synergies, and we're transitioning to a less volatile, higher-return business that gives us the confidence that we'll achieve our annual guidance of $3.30 to $3.40 adjusted EPS this year and at least 10% EPS growth next year.","Thanks for your time today and have a great week.","Operator","Thank you, speakers.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Jon Kathol, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.","Jon Kathol","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Tyson Foods' conference call for the first quarter of our 2013 fiscal year. I need to remind you that some of the things we'll talk about today will include forward-looking statements. Those statements are based on our view of the world as we know it now, which could change. I encourage you to look at today's press release for a discussion of the risks that can affect our business.","On today's call is Donnie Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Leatherby, Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Lochner, Chief Operating Officer. Because our shareholders' meeting is this morning, we need to end the call by 9:15 Central. [Operator Instructions] We'll answer as many of your questions as we can until 9:15. I'll now turn the call over to Donnie Smith.","Donnie Smith","Thanks, Jon. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. $0.48 a share is a good start to the fiscal year and was a little better than our expectations. How the results broke out among the segments was a little different than we originally thought, but that's the advantage of our multi-protein, multichannel, multinational business model. Sometimes we run into some hurdles in one area, but we make up ground in others. It's a balanced approach that over time has led to, and should continue to, produce steadier, more consistent earnings growth.","Our sales team has done an excellent job of getting paid for the value that we provide our customers. In our poultry business, we reduced annual fixed price contracts to less than 10% of the total, improved pricing in that segment to help make up the $170 million in additional feed cost compared to first quarter of a year ago.","Looking at demand expectations for 2013. The consensus is that food service will be flat, maybe up 1%, primarily driven by population growth. With consumers burdened by sluggish job growth, the prospect of rising food costs, the loss of the payroll tax cut and uneasiness about the future, forecast could have been much worse. We believe food service demand will hold up and should stay steady this year.","The foodservice categories that are expected to show growth include chain restaurants, lodging, hospitals, senior living and contract feeders. The area expected to be down slightly include convenience stores, recreation, schools due to the new guidelines, corrections, independent restaurants and small chains.","Tyson is well positioned in all categories and especially among leading national and regional chains, noncommercial and large operators. Our area of concern continues to be the struggling independent operator segment.","In terms of addressing consumer needs, we're finding that food bought on value menus has been declining now for 2 years. Instead, operators have been attracting patrons with new products and promotions by adding servings of breakfast sandwiches, chicken nuggets, tacos, fried chicken, sandwiches and wraps. At the same time, servings of burgers, seafood, pizza, soup and pasta have declined. Our diverse portfolio and increased flexibility give us the opportunity to take advantage of these type of swings in consumption.","Overall, the need to connect the right product with the right consumer hasn't changed. We're helping our operator and distributor customers by delivering products that offer the premium quality cues that meet consumers' need for perceived value while helping restore customer margins.","Retail demand forecasts are basically flat and will depend on what happens to prices at the gas pumps and the retailers' willingness to invest. For the 52-week period ending November 24, total retail fresh meat pounds sold were down 1.3%. Beef was down 4.9%, Pork was up 2.2% and Chicken was up 1.1%. Even more importantly to us, Tyson-branded fresh chicken pounds sold increased by nearly 10%, with dollar sales up almost 12%. So overall, total domestic availability would indicate 3% fewer pounds of beef and roughly 1% more pounds of pork and chicken in 2013.","Now throwing a lot of demand information at you, but basically what this means to us is that we can't wait for unemployment to improve or the economy to get better to grow our business, and I assure you, that is not our plan. Our strategy is to accelerate our growth in domestic value-added poultry and Prepared Foods, as well as international poultry, and we're executing that strategy. You remember I said on our Q4 call that we expect top line sales growth of 3% to 4% annually, value-added sales growth should grow at twice that rate, or 6% to 8% and sales from international production should grow at twice that rate or 12% to 16% a year. Some of the steps we're taking to grow our domestic value-added sales include expanding 3 plants.","We plan to spend more than $27 million on our Sherman, Texas; Goodlettsville, Tennessee; and Glen Allen, Virginia plants. Both the Texas and Tennessee plants produce case-ready beef and pork. The Virginia plant produces further processed chicken for national food service customers. We've also recently begun operations at our new Bruss steak-cutting operation in Jacksonville, Florida after a $13 million investment there. All 4 of these plant are great locations with an excellent workforce. These are major investments to help support key customers and they'll create as many as 490 new jobs.","Turning to our progress in accelerating international chicken production, our performance in Mexico largely offset startup losses in China. That is very encouraging and gives us confidence that our international poultry operations will make the significant improvement that we expected for the year. We're making progress in building our chicken farms to supply our plants in China. We're about 1\/3 of the way toward our goal of growing all of our own birds and eliminating the need to buy any market birds, which will provide more consistent, higher-quality products for our customers while allowing us to be much more efficient processor.","I'm very pleased with the progress we're making in Brazil, too. Sales in pricing are up and value-added sales are improving, both domestically and with our exports from Brazil into Europe.","Everything I've talked about today is part of our strategy to accelerate our growth. We feel very good about our ability to produce solid earnings this year, and there are signs of strength in the back half that make us even more optimistic than on our last call. I told our team last week that they've done a great job of building a foundation that will allow us to grow this business now and for years to come. We've been working to get our sales in this position, and it's exciting to see that happening, knowing how much potential there is.","That concludes my remarks. Dennis will now give you the financial update, followed by Jim, who'll discuss our operating segment. Dennis?","Dennis Leatherby","Thank you, Donnie, and good morning, everyone. As Donnie mentioned, we reported first quarter earnings of $0.48 per share. This represents a 14% increase over the $0.42 we reported a year ago. I would also like to note that on an adjusted basis, our rolling 4-quarter EPS is $1.97. Pretax return on invested capital for the past 12 months was 17.3%. Capital expenditures were $157 million for the quarter as we continue to invest in projects for both our domestic and foreign operations that result in improved productive capabilities, labor efficiencies, yields and sales mix.","Operating cash flow came in at $190 million, and this includes cash outflows just over $120 million related primarily to an increase in inventory, plan to support our customers' promotional activities and volume needs.","I'm pleased to say we returned more than $150 million to our shareholders during the first quarter. We acquired 5.1 million shares for $100 million under our share repurchase program. In addition to these repurchases, we also increased our regular dividend rate by 25%, and combined with a special dividend of $0.10 per share, we paid just over $50 million in dividends.","Including cash of $951 million, net debt was just under $1.5 billion. Total liquidity was $1.9 billion, well above the upper end of our targeted range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Gross debt remained at just over $2.54 billion, which will continue until we retire the convertible notes coming due in October this year. At this point, we expect to pay off these notes with cash. Net debt to EBITDA for the last 12 months remained at 0.8x. On a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis, this measure was 1.4x.","We reduced net interest expense by 23% compared to a year ago to $36 million. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 36.3%. Average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter was $362 million. This reflects the dilutive share effect of options and convertible notes of $7 million. The impact of the 5.1 million shares repurchased during the quarter will not be fully realized until subsequent quarters. But I would like to take a moment to discuss the impact of our share repurchase program.","As a result of the 27.3 million shares we have repurchased since reactivating this program, our Q1 EPS was positively impacted by $0.03. On an annualized basis, we estimate the cumulative repurchases to date will impact EPS by $0.14, holding all other factors constant.","Now here are some thoughts on the remainder of fiscal '13. We expect revenues of approximately $35 billion, up approximately 5% over 2012. Net interest expense should approximate $140 million. The effective tax rate should be around 35.5%, and our CapEx plan remains at $550 million, which may increase as we move through the year.","Our priorities for excess cash remain intact with what was laid out during our last call, which include additional capital spending to improve and grow our existing businesses, acquisitions to fulfill our growth strategies around value-added products and our international footprint, and returning cash to shareholders the repurchases and dividends, all while maintaining plenty of liquidity.","In summary, we are off to a great start in fiscal '13 to produce earnings better than last year despite any challenges we currently face.","I'll now turn it over to Jim for a closer look into our operating segments.","James V. Lochner","Thanks, Dennis, and good morning. Pork segment had a 9.2% return on sales and $125 million in operating income in the first fiscal quarter. Our average sales price per pound was down 5.5% on 2.2% lower volume compared to Q1 last year. USDA reported prices and hog prices were down 8.4% and 6.7%, respectively, year-over-year. Production was up about 1% and total U.S. exports were down, resulting in more pork domestic availability. Price and volumes were down as a result of balancing supply with demand; however, the Pork segment still produced very good margins in the quarter. We expect hog supplies to be flat and total exports to be lower compared to fiscal '12. We expect our Pork margins to be close to our overall fiscal '12 performance.","","Turning to the Prepared Foods segment. We had a 3.9% return on sales and $33 million in operating income. Our volume was up 1.8%, while average sales price per pound was down 4.1% over last year, predominately from lower raw material costs. Our costs were higher in our lunchmeat business, creating margin compression as we continue to invest in that business, which reduced the whole segment.","We've talked in the past about our desire to grow sales of Prepared Foods in the convenience store channel, and in Donnie's remarks, you heard him say that we expect demand to be challenged in that particular channel of food service. That isn't a disconnect. Food traffic is expected to be down at c-stores overall, but there's still a tremendous opportunity for growth for our products simply because we're underpenetrated. Next month, Tyson will be hosting the second C-Store News Foodservice Summit to help convenience store channels enhance their prepared food offerings using our proprietary research, consumer insights and products. This is one of many ways we're accelerating value-added growth through innovation.","We were very pleased with our Chicken segment in the first quarter, and we had a 3.6% return on sales and $107 million in operating income, despite $170 million in incremental feed costs. Excluding our China startup losses, return on sales was 4.3%. Average sales price per pound was up 8.2% on 1.1% less volume versus Q1 last year. Our chicken prices were higher year-over-year as we focus on getting paid for the value we provide our customers, managing our sales mix and our value-added growth.","Our increased inventory was intentional in anticipation of promotional activities and volume needs of several large customers. USDA projections indicate chicken production will be relatively flat this year compared to last year. We currently expect feed cost to be approximately $600 million more than fiscal '12. The capital investments and operational improvements we made in our Chicken business, coupled with changes in our mix and pricing, have put us in a position to better handle rising feed cost, while maintaining our expected levels of profitability.","In the Beef segment, we had a 1.3% return on sales and $46 million in operating income. Our average sales price per pound was up 11.7%, and our volume was down 10% compared to Q1 last year. The USDA reported cut-out was up 2.7%, while cattle costs were up 1.9% year-over-year. The fed steer and heifer slaughter was down 1.6%, while carcass weights were up 2.7%.","We pull back on the number of head we processed in an effort to maintain prices and our sole position. In other words, we opted for margin, not market share. And as a result, our performance relative to USDA prices achieved a new record for our Beef division in Q1. Our boxed beef exports were up, while the estimated U.S. boxed beef total is down  for the quarter. Additionally, the contribution from premium programs was up an incremental 30% -- 37%.","This is an illustration of how we improve our overall mix and revenue. We expect to see a reduction of industry-feed cattle supply of 2% to 3% in fiscal '13 compared to last year, primarily in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. Although we generally expect adequate supplies in the regions where we operate our plants, there may be periods of supply and demand imbalance. We anticipated a B plant would close, likely come offline in the first half of the calendar year, and we saw that announcement in the third week of January. This helps to correct the supply imbalance between beef packing capacity and the declining fed steer and heifer availability accelerated by the past 2 years of drought.","We are pleased Japan is going to open to 30 month in younger cattle. Japan was historically a good market for a variety of meats, which limited -- which was limited by the 20-month age restriction. We anticipate realizing more revenues from the Japanese rising meat market the coming months. For boxed beef products, the items Japan imported were already being exported to other countries, but this news should help overall Beef export demand in future months. Our focus will continue to be on maximizing the total revenue and managing for margin.","I think our results in the first quarter and our response to market conditions demonstrate our ability to anticipate change, get plans in place and execute. I'm proud of our team and have every confidence in their ability to keep it going.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Farha Aslam.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division",",","So our first question is on Chicken. You've just finished the food service contracting season. Donnie, you'd highlighted that only 10% of your contracts are now fixed. Could you just share with us how you felt about the level of pricing and flexibility you were able to get? And what gives you confidence to be able to say that Chicken should be in the normalized range in the second half?","Donnie Smith","So we're pretty satisfied as we've come through our negotiations, not necessarily just on food service side, but also in retail and pricing. It has been very important to us to continue to work down how many annual fixed price agreements we have. And as of now, coming into calendar '13, we're at 9%, which is, if you'll remember, dramatically less than where we were, say, 4 years ago. And Farha, we've also seen an increase in the amount of product that is sold, where pricing is tied to some part of the input cost, grain-based pass-throughs, those types of things, which gives us more confidence going into the year. But I'll tell you, too, our service, our quality, our innovative capabilities, all those are part of the selling story and we're getting paid for that. So we're pleased now. A lot of that pricing will be coming into play during this quarter. Some of those contracts don't roll over until first of February, first of March, those kinds of things. So we still have to work through that in this quarter. But that's what gives us a bit more confidence in our back half.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then perhaps a follow-up on Beef. Since your last outlook, you've seen Cargill close a plant, you've seen Japan open up. But it in your release, your outlook on Beef was exactly what it was last quarter. Just could you share with us, is it conservatism that's keeping your outlook the same? Or is it something else?","Donnie Smith","No, it's conservatism. I mean, we somewhat anticipated that sometime during this year, we'd probably see some capacity come out. And we'll see as Japan comes on stream. We're hopeful to get a good share of that variety of meat demand in boxed beef. Maybe really just conservatism until the market shapes up and we have a better forward view. But it all looks fairly favorable going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Jones.","Heather L. Jones - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Real quick question on Beef. I just wanted to confirm because you said in your prepared remarks, but I want to make sure I am clear -- or everyone's clear on this. But in your guidance on your Q4 call, you talked about being below the normalized range. So you're saying that when you gave that commentary, you had anticipated some kind of capacity rationalization?","Donnie Smith","Yes, we just had no idea for sure where that might happen. But over time, as that was starting to shape up and we started to see the steer and heifer supply diminish with the calf crops, accelerated by the drought, just knowing that history would likely repeat itself, we thought it would happen. We just didn't know where.","Heather L. Jones - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then on Chicken, demand has been really strong. But if you look at the past couple of months, production has been up pretty substantially and that's even before we started seeing an expansion in the exits, and now we're starting to see some expansion in exits. Does that concern you at all? Or your outlook for chicken demand, is it so robust that you believe overall demand can absorb these kind of production increases?","Donnie Smith","Heather, this is Donnie. So I use a 6-week average. So as we look at the last 6 weeks, poultry slaughter pounds have been up 2.7%. A lot of that has been driven by weight because placements have been at about just shy of 1% other than that time period, and slaughter head has been up 1%. So we're picking up about 0.7% -- 1.7% of those slaughter pounds in weight. January is typically a pretty strong month and I think, typically, you would see weights come down during the month of January. We run a lot of Saturdays in January. It's just a good volume month. But let me give you a little bit -- and this is going to be on fresh chicken, but let me give you a little bit of recent data, which gives us some optimism going forward. If you look at the last, I'm going to go -- I'm going to start at 26 weeks, fresh chicken pounds are up 2.8%. Dollar sales are up 8.5%. If you tighten that up to a 13-week view, pounds are still up 2.7%. Dollar sales are up 9.2%. Now if you go to the last 4 weeks, fresh chicken pounds, and this would be sold at retail, is up 4.3% and dollar sales are up 10.6%. So what we're beginning to think, and it'll take a little bit more time to flesh this out and see if we're right, but what we're beginning to think is that with all of these pressures on consumers today, maybe we are now seeing a legitimate shift from red meat proteins into chicken. And if that's the case, we'll be able to absorb the 2.7% slaughter pound increase and still maintain the margins and pricing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So I'm going to focus on Chicken as well. So just on your second half outlook being more positive than before, I'm trying to get to the bottom of that. So the way I see it from 3 months ago, supply has exceeded everyone's expectations. Grain costs are flat, and prices have been much better. So I mean, just what you said 2 seconds ago about pricing being stronger tells us that demand seems to be stronger than anyone had expected. So I'd love to get some color on it. I mean, you talked talk about a share shift, but we've been talking about that for 3 years and it sort of never has happened, where people are eating more chicken now because beef is too expensive. So I just want to get more color on it. And more importantly, what are the chances that supply outpaces the demand, right? So if every chicken company starts seeing that there's a positive trend, they're going to step on the accelerator and get supply up. I know you're not doing it because you're fine in the open market, but help me understand that because I think that's maybe what's driving your more positive view on demand.","Donnie Smith","Okay. So I'm going to touch on a couple of things. If you look at our Q1 -- pricing in Q1, now remember, we do a lot of price negotiations in the fall, November, December, that time period, that will kick in, in Jan, Feb, March, too, okay? So -- but in the fall, pricing covered the incremental grain of $100. I think grain was up $160, $170 in pricing, well, not necessarily just pricing, but price, volume and mix covered that, okay? So we would expect that -- or we do expect that to continue, particularly in our business. Now you mentioned that the production is up higher than what we thought, yes. But if you look at industry benchmarking services, 75% to 80% of the industry on a contribution basis is profitable. We wouldn't have thought that 4, 5 months ago either. So it does appear, from anecdotal evidence, that pricing is covering a lot of the input cost and that had to happen. One other thing about our business in particular, and you noted that the fact that we remain a buyer of raw material and now we're buying probably 45, 50 loads a week, something like that, of breast meat, or average that in Q1 anyway. But our value-added poultry business also grew round numbers, call it, 4%. And that category was probably down close to 3% in terms of center of the plate protein frozen and frozen meat snacks. So in Q1, we grew our value-added in an environment where it was down. We have a lot of promotional activity planned for subsequent quarters. And those are -- the combination of those things are what gives us confidence in the back half. And we mentioned before, we got some costs levers that we still have to pull and other things that will be coming to fruition, too. Our guys have done a great job in live production. So I better leave it there. I could go on and on.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So just one follow-up there. So basically, is it fair to say that Tyson -- you feel comfortable today that you achieved normalized margins in the back half, basically, no matter what the industry is going to do on supply, right? I mean, there's some limitations to supply increases. We know that. But do you feel comfortable saying that? I mean, it seems like it's a more price-specific confidence.","Donnie Smith","Yes, based on what we see today, absolutely.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Goldman.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can we talk about Prepared Foods for a second? I'm just curious, you mentioned a couple of things in there that explained why your EBIT was down year-on-year. How long should we expect those items to continue to impair the margin there? Things like investing in the lunchmeat business, for example.","Donnie Smith","Yes, I think we mentioned on the last call, we're going to make a fairly significant investment in our Houston lunchmeat plant. And hey, while that's going to take a vast investment, the equipment that we're putting in there will take a few weeks, by the way, to actually put work to happen. And so we're in the process of building up and getting our product in place so we don't have any service issues during that shutdown. That always adds some incremental costs. So I'd say over the next quarter and a half or so, call it 4 or 5 months, it's going to impact us a little bit. But the results coming out of that will be very good for our business.","James V. Lochner","Yes, during the interim, we'll be less efficient than we want to be to maintain that service level.","Donnie Smith","And that lunchmeat piece in Prepared Foods, by the way, is the piece that is the drag on earnings.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just to follow up on lunchmeat as a category, it seems to be getting some good attention from some of the larger manufacturers out there, seems to be some more innovation coming. Can you talk about that category, what you're seeing there right now? Is it rational? Is there more innovation coming? Do you think it's going to be as good a category as perhaps some of your competitors do over the next year or 2?","Donnie Smith","For the year, let's go to 52-week ended, actually, lunchmeat category in dollar sales was down 1.9%. So what that means for us is innovation. And we're working on several items. Now I would spread that past just lunchmeat to, let's call it, processed meats because it may include dinner sausages and other type of Prepared Foods items. Particularly, in lunchmeat, we've got several different flavors of chicken lunchmeat, which are doing very well. And so I think you'll see some innovation in the lunchmeat, particularly. But in our Prepared Foods, don't just think lunchmeat, think a little more broadly to smoked meats and other processed meats. And we've got a lot of innovation that we're working on that we'll be bringing to market over the next 6 to 8 months or so in that category. So we feel good about that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christine McCracken.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Just -- you mentioned the higher weights that we've seen in Chicken here and maybe the seasonal effect, but we had an awfully warm winter last year and it didn't seem like there's a lot of stress. I'm just curious if you think that guys are moving back to larger weight, given the optimism in the chicken markets and what that might mean for pricing over the summer months.","Donnie Smith","I see no evidence of that, and I draw that conclusion from this stack. We, over the last year to 18 months, are typically about 20 points below the non-Tyson industry average on weight. And so we continue to be, over the last 6- to 8-week average, 21 points below the average non-Tyson weight. Now our average weight is up a little bit versus what we planned and that is a function of the good weather in Q1. But we're running hard now. We got really strong demand and we're, as we add Saturdays, we're pulling that weight down. So I would suspect -- that anecdotal evidence would tell me that industry weights are up because of weather, not for any other reason.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","All right. Just as a follow-up. You've got C test coming into the summer, presumably. Could spike here with the tightness in the grain specs.  I'm just curious if you'd comment on your exposure to grain and where you are on that.","Donnie Smith","Our Q2 cost of goods is pretty much baked in. We've got probably, as we normally do, 3 to 4 weeks of coverage -- 2 to 3 weeks of coverage in corn, about the same on meal. We view that grains probably -- grain futures are probably going to trade somewhere like a 700, 750 range and you may have some temporary moves a little bit below that or a little bit above that. So as we move closer to the low end of that range, we add to our position. And then as we get up into the upper part of that range, we grind -- what we call we grind our coverage. And so we would continue to do that going into the spring. I think we're all looking for big plannings. And as we get closer to the end of March, that's probably going to have some psychological effect on the market. But from here on out, it's going to be weather.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Can you compare and contrast the implication of Cargill's closure to the closure of your Emporia facility?","James V. Lochner","Yes. Specifically, on all the moving parts or just -- a little bit more on the question for clarity, just for me so I know where to focus my attention.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Well, I guess, when you guys closed your facility, beef packer margins from the industry standpoint moved up probably about $60 per head within 4 to 5 months and stayed pretty positive for 2 years. So I guess, what I'm trying to figure out is why that would not be the case -- or maybe it is the case and you kind of -- I know -- I sense your sense of conservatism but, again, if you compare and contrast the environment then and now, and is there the likelihood that you can have that same situation where, look, by fourth quarter this year, you guys could be back in your normalized range? Maybe you won't be there for the full year, but maybe you'll there in the fourth quarter and going into 2014.","James V. Lochner","Yes, let me add a little bit more color to that. Now I clearly understand, I think, what your question is. When we did Emporia, there was excess slaughter capacity, and we had a plant in Emporia that really was deficit cattle.","It was on the eastern end of the -- of that cattle feeding zone. And so we were inefficient at that plant predominantly from freight costs moving cattle. But what we did was we only closed the slaughter portion of that plant. And at that point in time, our other operations were fairly inefficient because they were trying to manage a very value-added mix, which was decreasing their daily efficiencies and their hourly efficiencies. So our boost to slaughter capacity wasn't just from the shift in capacity utilization and phases in that the region. It had as much to do with the fact that we were able to balance our value-added mix by moving certain products to Emporia to continue to add value to them through more trimming, boning and semi-portioning. And then our other plants, efficiency improved dramatically from both a daily efficiency and then hourly -- pounds per man hour efficiency. So we got a good boost in addition to that. But if you simply look at what's happened with this announcement, it was 4% of the fed steer and heifer slaughter daily capacity and it was 10% roughly, from my estimation, in plants in that greater region of about 300 miles zone from there. So it does a lot of good to try to adjust the excess slaughter capacity, particularly in that region. I'm just hesitant to put a number at this point in time on how much -- how favorable it will be. It will be favorable over the long run and so we're optimistic. But I wanted to give you a little bit more thought on -- there were more changes than just the pure slaughter capacity, capacity utilization that happened at Emporia because we were able to improve our operations dramatically in our other plants as we move product to Emporia for further processing. And Emporia was generally in the freight lane where that product was headed anyhow. So we have a lot of other gains from that.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And my follow-up question, which happened to be in a different division, is once you're done with the reinvestment in the Prepared Foods, why would your margins not structurally be higher? And would you be thinking about increasing your \"normalized range margin\" for that business? If you spend this much money, why would you think that their normalized margin in 2014 would be higher?","Donnie Smith","Well, we are optimistic about our business going forward. It'll be a lot -- it will have a lot more to do with -- we're putting $30 million into 1 of 22 locations. So that, in and of itself, is not going to change the whole game for us. But if you'll remember, we've expanded capacity in our pepperoni facilities. We continue to work this segment hard because we think there's a lot of growth there. And over time, we do expect it to not only grow, but to expand. But to link all of that to what we're doing in Houston would be a little too optimistic on that change. Jim, would you add anything there?","James V. Lochner","We needed to get ourselves more efficient and more productive in that change. We expect to be fully incremental. But again, that base is so big, that's why we haven't really thought about it at this point, quantifying the total impact of the whole. And again, there's other moving parts in that Prepared Foods segment. That's a very diverse segment in our company.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Oksenhendler.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you just talk a little bit about the export markets for each protein, and even specifically pork? Jim, I guess, I was surprised to hear you say that exports would be down in the year. It seems like there's plenty of pork in the U.S. and you keep hearing about Europe cutting significantly, maybe on the order of 5%, and that the U.S. would kind of pick up some market share in the export markets. So can you just talk about that and maybe what needs to happen for Chicken to get leg quarters above that $0.51, $0.52 level?","James V. Lochner","Sure. Let you talk about all 3. Specifically, in Pork, there's a gap here you got to get into our fiscal year, which included Ardneral Dee's [ph] in '12. And that looks like, at least through November, was down and I think December will be down, keeping in mind that the prior year was so big. And then Jan, Feb, March of a year ago was a very, very strong export quarter for Pork. And you're right, Europe's production should be down. My other reasons to state that I don't think it will be as great as last year, I think it will still be a very big year, probably be the second-biggest year as the current issue on ractopamine in Pork into Russia that probably will spend some -- need some time to get resolved. But if very well, I could -- I've been very wrong on projecting exports before. But against just those 2 strong first -- our first half months last year, it looked to me like it would be difficult, sort of, to equal them or surpass them, but they'll still be very strong. So that, hopefully, gives you some color on Pork. Beef, we're very encouraged with the opening of Japan to 30 months and down, predominantly on that variety meat side. But also, we think that increases the demand over the bulk of the items in Beef that were going to other countries. And we expect to see some domestic disappearance and some increase in pricing as we go forward. On Chicken, we expect to see exports to continue. We expect to see continued diversification from Russia. We see some more interest across other parts of the world, potentially Egypt, potentially Africa, the Americas. We're not anticipating a major chicken shift into Mexico. So we would consider even though chicken exports were up 4% year-over-year on the best estimate against the calendar year last year, we don't really see anything negative going forward and might see a slight increase or potentially even more increase. Again, world supplies of chicken seem to be pulled back, particularly in South America and across some other countries. So it's very possible that we could see an increase in overall chicken exports.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. Jim, I appreciate that. And then just real quickly, I was surprised by the cash flow generation in the quarter despite the inventory build and the higher grain costs. If you -- could you give us a target for the year for free cash flow or cash flow from operations?","Dennis Leatherby","No, we don't really give any kind of guidance along those lines. You can certainly expect it to continue to be strong for the year. And we get back to what we always say about our priorities for excess cash, and that's to invest in growth through CapEx and acquisitions, still on acquisitions that might help us with our value-added strategy or international and then returning cash to shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Ramey.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Jim, thinking back to ancient history, I recall how powerful some of those variety meat sales were to Japan. I mean, it seemed to me like there was a tendon that, if you sold it, it was worth $10 a head or something like that. And so the increment on just the variety meat sales was meaningful on a per-head basis. Can you just refresh my memory on how that all works?","James V. Lochner","Yes, and that's why we called out the category as a whole on variety meat because Japan, pre the closing and BSE in '03, we had very strong sales of tongues, skin tongues, leg tendons, a variety of intestine product for Japan, particularly those items were in higher demand. They were both through the -- predominantly some through the foodservice trade in Japan and some through the retail trade. But we're hopeful, particularly, that we'll see those items rebound. I think it will take a little bit of time to get those items back on the menu, back through a variety of items. Tongues, we think, will happen fairly quick. Our whole thrust during that period of time was to really try to be to the high -- get as much market share and add as much incremental value to the animal as we could. Again, try to always drive our position of being the best revenue, net cost player in the region. So I'm optimistic. And you're right, those are very good items from a contribution margin standpoint.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I mean, I've forgotten about the tongue thing, but that was like $4 a pound versus $0.40 a pound.","James V. Lochner","My memory's a little fuzzy, but I think they were -- skin tongue was north of $12 a pound at that time.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Wow. And compared to what's the alternate...","James V. Lochner","Yes, just a basic tongue would be probably -- I don't even -- I haven't checked lately so I got to guess, but I think they're under $1 a pound. But I could be wrong, I just speculate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Diane Geissler.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask you about your capital budget. I know in the last few years, there's been a -- a large percentage of your capital spend has been spent on sort of efficiencies and modernizations within your existing processing base. You probably reached the tail end of that so obviously you're doing some work in the 3 facilities on the value-add side. But could you just talk about what is your maintenance CapEx at this point and then sort of how you would break your CapEx budget by value-add, efficiencies and international?","Donnie Smith","That's a great question, Diane. As we came into the year with grains spiking late in August, Sept, we took our budget down to $550 million. As you know, Jim has recently met with all of our business leaders and approached them about going back into their capital lists and determining if they have projects that meet certain criteria, that being growing value-added, not just having a good marginal internal rate of return, but also driving that business unit's return on invested capital into the 20 range or above, which is what we're looking for, and asking them to relook at some projects and see if some of those might need to be accelerated. So there's the potential, as we go through the year, that our CapEx would be little higher than $550 million. Now I have the occasion to say, projects don't usually happen in the month that you approve the capital. A lot of those take 3, 6 months, that type of thing. So that may have a little more impact on our '14 CapEx spend than -- but it could have some effect on this year. But we continue to look of those things. It is -- we are laser focused on growing value-added poultry in our Prepared Foods business. We're -- international growth, we're trying to build chicken houses in China as fast as we possibly can. And if we get ahead of plan, we will absolutely put the capital in place to get those houses built more quickly than what we had planned to go on at the end of the year. And then as Dennis said, we still view a lot of potential in our business and that's one of those -- one of the levers we have in using our cash. But depending on how things go and what our free cash flow is, we'll continue to return cash to the shareholders as well. Does that help?","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Could you give me an idea about your maintenance CapEx is? And then, what are the percentages for the programs?","Dennis Leatherby","Yes, in round numbers, $225 million, $250 million, something like that would -- that would be pretty close.","James V. Lochner","Yes. That's pretty close because it ebbs and flows depending upon particularly rough projects. That would be a big mover in there and then freezer replacements. Our whole philosophy on those is we want to keep them current, but we don't want to basically pull ahead our maintenance spend. So we spend a lot of time managing capital on the planning side and balancing between the projects that require return versus those with purely maintenance. So our groups do a fantastic job of really planning their CapEx needs. So we look out all that, actually, over a 2-year period.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. Jim, I just wanted to ask on the flow of cattle this year. I think last year, you benefited a little bit from a shift out of Texas into the northern plains, but we didn't see El Ni\u00f1o. So I'm just wondering if you expect to see a reversal of that this year at all. And maybe that's some of your hesitancy about kind of third and fourth quarter supply-demand and kind of what's going to flow through your plants.","James V. Lochner","That key number I really watch is where the cattle placements are and what's on feeds state by state. And you are seeing numbers year-over-year down in Texas and Kansas and up in Iowa and the Pacific Northwest. So we're seeing cattle feeding shift around to some degree. I don't know how much of it is weather-related as much as it is just in combination of grain basis, cattle basis and cost to gain differentials between the regions. But that seems to be the primary driver. But you're definitely seeing some shifts when you just look at the cattle and feed by state.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Gurkin.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask about just overall production outlook in the protein with the numbers down 1% instead of 2%. Is there any risk that we'll have a build and supply and maybe won't realize pricing as much as expected? Is there any kind of cap on that, potential cap on the upside in pricing?","Donnie Smith","Well -- and is that the pricing across all proteins or...","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Across all proteins, yes.","Donnie Smith","I mean, I really think we've got a fairly good grasp of what the fundamentals are going to look like. I mean, we have not just pricing but also mixed opportunities and growing value-added that helps us get into categories that are less price-sensitive. I think that what we're seeing coming into the year is that with the payroll tax increase, gasoline prices doing what they're doing, the consumer is feeling these effects. But they're not eating less meat, they're eating different meat now. So Jim, do you want to add anything to that?","James V. Lochner","Yes, I would. Because if you -- I think, overall, proteins, we're not going to see a major shift up. We're still thinking they're down 1%. The mix is changing because beef will be down more. Pork will be flat -- up slightly and Chicken up slightly. But I think last quarter's perishable data is pretty insightful, particularly when you look at the price of beef being very high and then you look at the wholesale prices of beef being up with actually flat pounds relative because the carcass weights contributed so much to the pounds that were available. And then Chicken up, that 8.8% on price. We're 1.1% or so increase in pounds. That really starts to tell me that the price spreads will start -- are starting to be felt and noticed by the consumer and they're shifting their patterns. So Beef continues, which it's likely to increase and inflate in price with the decreased supply. And probably, the influence of exports will start to see the consumer probably continue to have some more interest in chicken. And hopefully, we'll see that pricing hold together. And then Pork, we don't really expect to see a major increase in supply, and that pricing elasticity seems to be right on target with the historical demand plans. So I'm actually -- I'm not overly bullish on price as the consumer will fight the increases, but the reality is that balance is happening.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Tiberio.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","In light of relatively flat wholesale cut-out on the pork side and lean hog futures, can you perhaps walk us through why you're so confident that fresh pork margins will remain at or above your normalized range during the fiscal year? I know that just looking at the spot processing margins, there's not always a one-to-one translation, but I'm just curious of whether you're more confident that we'll see a rally in pork prices through the year or whether you're just confident that you can outsource the market from a hedging and a hog supply perspective?","James V. Lochner","Let me answer that. Hedging has no real bearing on that. But if you look at the last 4 weeks, the cut-out has climbed up. Belly prices have come up. Some of the retail have been a little bit flat, but the overall cut-outs come up. But our focus is always watching the forward supply against our sole position and trying to make sure that we focus on adding as much revenue and keeping our cost in line. So it's always that slope of change equation that we really look at, trying to make sure that we're not overselling against what we think the forward supply or under selling against what we think the forward supply, so we can try to maintain that spread as best we can. And if you look just at Q1 versus a year ago, we still had a very good quarter but we had more pressure on the cut-out and it just took a little longer for the hog cost to correct. Right now, in this quarter, that's the way it started out and now it's starting to change as we come through January and into February. So I don't know. Hopefully, I didn't confuse you, but we're very confident that we can maintain our relativity to the market and keep our focus on maximizing our revenues and keeping our cost in line. And we really try to read that forward supply as best we can so we don't get ourselves out of balance. And that helps maintain our sole positions. I'll throw more color into it without having to get real precise.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just want to get a better understanding of this beef plant situation and just how it positively impacts your beef. My understanding, from what I read in the trade press, is that they're going to idle this plant and the cattle that they were processing at that plant is going to instead go to their other plants, which were running at lower utilization. So net, the demand for cattle isn't going to change. So -- and I don't believe that you have a plant that's terribly near where that plant closed, but I could be wrong about that. But so what are the dynamics that ultimately will help you out, if it's true that they're just going to shift the cattle somewhere else?","James V. Lochner","First of all, we do have a plant fairly close to that and, again, I reference when you look at just where our plants are against what their USDA reported daily slaughter capacities are and then you put the factor in of what's the practical, how far, if you move cattle.  Somebody has to pay the freight bill. And so that's a lot. I just took kind of a 300-mile radius, did my own research of what I've known on the area. And so that's roughly 10% of the capacity in that 300-mile zone out in kind of the greater Panhandle, West Kansas, West Texas area. So I don't know what Cargill's intention are or aren't. I just know the reality that it costs money to move cattle, and who absorbs the freight will take the hit and the loss. So it should, in theory, improve the ability of the packer or to buy a more favorable basis for a while in that area and improve the overall capacity utilization in that region for a period of time. So those are the points that just fit the overall supply-demand. Beef packing is a very regional play because, again, the limitation and the expense of moving cattle are in a great distance. So hopefully, that helps.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure. And maybe this is a follow-up. If I follow what you said correctly, you're saying they're going to be buying less cattle in that area, which will benefit you but then, presumably, they have to buy more cattle in other areas, which will...","James V. Lochner","I didn't talk what they buy; I just talked about the number in the area relative to the slaughter capacity in the area, which shifted, and then -- and again -- and the practical reality of having the cost to move cattle.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Moskow.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Regarding beef capacity and processing capacity, do you think this Cargill move is enough to get the industry back in balance? Or do you think there's other regions in your analysis that probably could have additional capacity reductions?","James V. Lochner","I'll know a lot more this afternoon as -- when the census report comes up, particularly as we look at the calf crop, estimated calf crop from the spring in 2012. But with the decline we've been on and over slaughter capacity, I think it's probable that we'll see change going forward with some regional plants not being -- having sufficient supply and they'll have to deal with it. We can't replenish the herd quick enough. And then the other thing, I think, when you look at the Cattle on Feed report that we just saw, you saw that the heifer reduction and the numbers on feed was fairly sizable. So that we are seeing what I call a mild rebuild, but it will be several years out before we realize that. So I do think there's still a slight imbalance.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And Jim, when we're trying to do the math around what the upside of Japan coming back online is, I quantify about 500 million pounds of a difference today between what they were buying before BSE and what they are buying now. But then, you and Tim started getting at the tongues, intestines and tendons, so...","James V. Lochner","Those are the good items, yes.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, I mean, should I adding up all the pounds of tongues, intestines and tendons and figuring out $12 a pound? Or should I try to think through what kind of the bigger cuts of meat that would get you to that -- back to where you were before?","James V. Lochner","Well, the answer is both, but I don't think we'll shoot tongues up to that because now in Japan, that demand has to be probably recreated to a degree. And we have to get back in and hopefully, the Japanese markets start to consume the product. I think there will be a reasonable shift back towards U.S. beef and increasing supplies. But I think it'd be very premature to try to quantify all that at this stage. Our whole approach is always to try to meet what the customers' expectations and get the innovation behind products -- providing products that they can use and just keep driving the overall revenue of beef up as best we can. So it's way early to try to start putting numbers behind those pounds and price relationships. And I think it's very difficult and not terribly meaningful to go back and look at what was pre-'03 because the dynamics into the Japanese demand structure have likely changed significantly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I have 2 follow-ups, one on Chicken. Can you talk a little bit more about this inventory build? It seems significant. It looks like a 15% increase in what's in, at least from what I could tell from your Q, year-over-year increase and it's significant on a quarterly basis. I'm just -- I don't have much insight into that, so I'm concerned that maybe that's going to hit the market and impact pricing. So that's where I'm coming from on that. So if you can give us a little bit more color and basically give me confidence that it's not going to impact pricing negatively, that will be helpful.","Donnie Smith","Okay. So yes, I'll tell you what it is and I'll what it isn't. What it is promotional volume because of capacity strengths that we have to ramp up to get in -- it's a promotional build for a retail and\/or food service promotion that will come in subsequent months. What it's not is leg quarters and breast meat that we couldn't sell. Our leg quarter inventory is in great shape. We're buying breast meat. And so we're not putting stuff in the freezer hoping for a better day. Those days are long past for Tyson Foods. And -- but we had to -- we've got to ramp up for some pretty good promotional activity coming our way.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And is that value-added or commodity, the promotion?","Donnie Smith","No. That is value-added, you bet.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just for Jim.  On Pork, we recently wrote a note on this, but the cut-out on a year-over-year basis, flat to down so far in the calendar year, hog prices are showing up in the futures curve. So if all packers do what you guys do well, which is balance supply and demand to manage the spread, that would imply that either the futures price is too high or the packers are not going to be able to manage that spread, right? So my guess is the futures price for hogs today is anticipating demand that's more favorable than what we're seeing currently, perhaps exports, China, that's my guess. But is that the right way to think about it? Because we all tend to do this because the futures price is available, right? But can you help me understand that? How do you look at the futures curve on hog and your sort of spread analysis?","James V. Lochner","The way we look at the futures curve, we go back and always check what the supply assumptions with pig crop report, et cetera, would imply going forward and see if they match, looking at really what the -- what that quarterly demand curve is against the total cut-out, against the domestic availability. If the supply looks like it's less and going down and if the price looks like it's right on the demand curve, obviously, your supply will drive it up. Then you have to anticipate whether or not there is a demand shift against your projected supply, what would shift it. Generally speaking, export change can have it or another dynamic. But generally, when you look at pork elasticity curves off of a cut-out as an index, there's very few times in history that you see dramatic shifts. Swine flu would have been one in '09. You would have seen some other shifts in '04, but for the most part, there's not a lot of deviations. So that how I look at it. And anticipating export shifts is the most tricky component of that because it can create a shift in domestic availability that accelerates or decelerates basis of supply that is forecast against pig crop report. It's a long answer, but that's how we look at it.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So bottom line, do you think the futures curve today for hogs is sort of overly optimistic or...","James V. Lochner","It appears to me to be so, simply because I don't see the supply deficit pulling the domestic availability back down.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kenneth Zaslow.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Dennis, in your comments, you made an interesting point that the rolling 4-quarter number is $1.97. And I guess, my first question on this is, why reference that? And on top of that, if I go back, the rolling 4 quarters, both Beef and Chicken are not in the normalized range. So what are your implications here?","Dennis Leatherby","So remember on the last call, Ken, we talked about thinking -- or foreshadowing for '13 that we do at least $1.90 again, we made the case. So the best way we know how to illustrate that we're going to do that is to tell you what the last 12 months was. So that would be the first part of it. And you're right about Beef and Chicken being below the normalized range, and we're performing well and we're going to get better.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And I guess the last question I have is, if I look into 2014, back half of Chicken in '13 is already going to be in the normalized range. Beef seems to be potentially moving out. Which business will not be in the normalized range in 2014? It seems like all the businesses have a reasonable probability to be in the normalized range in 2014. Am I missing something?","Donnie Smith","Nope, you're right. It's time to do that and keep improving.","Operator","And we do have a question from Christine McCracken.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Just one follow-up. Jim, you mentioned Russia has ractopamine issues and we've seen some more pushback in China and the U.S. Is there any chance the industry moves away from beta agonists? And what could that mean for industry supplies?","James V. Lochner","I don't know for sure. I wish I knew. I think there's always a possibility of those things. Let's just say what happened. Obviously, the efficiency gain and the increased carcass pounds would be gone, so you'd either have a shift or a decrease in pounds of pork produced. So that would be favorable on prices. Now whether it offsets the price -- decrease offsets the loss of efficiency and how that impacts the producer will be very dependent upon the price swing accordingly and each individual producer's case on the contribution of that efficiency gain that he gets.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","And on Beef, wouldn't that exacerbate the issues that we have right now and the weight gains we've seen?","James V. Lochner","Yes, same answer. And it's just how much beef supply comes off if the growth promotants from beta -- or beta agonist growth promotants went away, it would take pounds off the market.","Operator","And at this time, I'm showing no further questions.","Donnie Smith","Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us today. And as always, we're grateful for your interest in our company. We're going to cut out and head over to the shareholders' meeting now, so we hope you have a great day and a great weekend. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference.

Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Okay, awesome. Thanks, Jon, and good morning, everybody. It's great to be with you on the line today for the first time this year. At Tyson Foods, we're creating a modern food company with a diverse portfolio of protein brands. Building on our momentum from a record year in fiscal 2017, we're off to a strong start in fiscal 2018. We delivered solid results in all of our segments: Beef, Pork, Chicken and Prepared Foods. And our retail and foodservice sales are outpacing the industry. I'll provide more context on our performance across our segments and channels in a minute.","So looking at the bigger picture, this was our second strongest quarter of operating income in company history, behind only the same period of last year. We also delivered record adjusted earnings of $1.81 per share. That includes a $0.21 benefit from the recent tax legislation. But even without it, EPS still would've been at an all-time high. In addition, we grew volume 5% in the quarter, and notably, growing value-added volume by 9%, driven by organic sales and the recent acquisitions. We're encouraged by the position we're in to start off the year, even as we experience the typical seasonality of our second quarter.","What's constant is our mind set for growth. Tyson Foods is transforming into a modern food company with unmatched scale, and we're expanding our reach into new areas as we integrate the capabilities of AdvancePierre and Original Philly. As demand for protein grows, we're well-positioned to take advantage of this opportunity.","So as we shared last year, we're also positioning ourselves for growth through ongoing financial fitness. In Q1, we realized $37 million in cost savings. We're confident we'll achieve a net savings in excess of $200 million for the year and become a faster and more agile business in the process.","So let's talk about each of our segments. Please note my references to operating income and operating margin will be on an adjusted basis. In Q1, the Beef segment generated operating income of $257 million with a 6.6% operating margin. While solid, these numbers are down compared to Q1 of last year, which was the segment's best quarter ever. Volume was up 4.5% and revenue was up over 10%, driven by strong domestic and international demand. An expanding U.S. herd is providing our plants with ample supply of cattle and we expect this to continue through FY 2020. With strong domestic demand and robust exports of U.S. beef, the Beef segment's margin should approach 6% in fiscal 2018.","In the Pork segment, in the first quarter we delivered $152 million in operating income with an 11.8% margin. While those are very strong results, income and margin declined compared to the record results of Q1 last year. Volume was down 2.6% as we ran to manage our margin. Revenue was up 2.5% on increased hog costs. As expected, the new capacity in the industry has compressed our margins from recent record highs. That said, our margins are still above normal, and we expect fiscal 2018 to be around 9%.","Although we faced a challenging environment related to labor, freight and small bird pricing, the Chicken segment generated operating income of $281 million with a 9.4% operating margin. Strong demand in our base business and some incremental volume from AdvancePierre helped drive volume up 7.3% and revenue increased nearly 11%. Notably, the segment also benefited from about $14 million in financial fitness savings.","We continue to invest heavily to grow this segment. We invested $135 million in a new plant in Green Forest, Arkansas, to add further processing capacity as we grow with our major commercial chain customers. In line with consumer desires for fresh protein, we announced a new $300 million complex in Humboldt, Tennessee, that will produce retail trade pack fresh chicken. We expect this new plant will start up in late 2019 or early 2020. We're also exploring automation and technology opportunities in positions that are more labor-intensive or at higher turnover. We believe our sales volume in the Chicken segment will grow more than 4% this year, driven by organic growth and a full-year of AdvancePierre, and return on sales should improve to around 11%.","The Prepared Foods segment delivered a record first quarter in both operating income and return on sales with $273 million and 11.9%, respectively. Volume was up 11.6%, primarily due to incremental volume from AdvancePierre, whose product mix moved revenue higher by 21%. Notably, Prepared Foods also benefited from about $24 million in financial fitness cost savings. I talked earlier about our position as a modern food company with unmatched scale. In the Prepared Food segment, we have aligned our strategy, people and actions to build on our advantage and unlock the top and bottom line potential of this business.","We have a lot of exciting work happening in Prepared Foods and we look forward to sharing it with you at CAGNY on February 20. As we continue integrating the AdvancePierre and achieving financial fitness cost savings, we expect the Prepared Foods segment to have a strong year. Due to the seasonality of our sales, there will be the usual quarter-to-quarter variability, but for the full-year, we expect an operating margin of around 11%.","Across all segments, freight costs have escalated as trucking capacity has tightened nationwide. We expect these costs to continue to rise as carriers compete for drivers and new federal regulations come into play. We estimate this will add more than $200 million to our costs this year. At the same time, marketplace dynamics are driving wages higher, pushing up our labor cost. These additional costs are included in our outlook. However, we're assuming we'll recover the majority through pricing.","Turning from segment results to our sales channels, we continue to deliver strong retail performance, outpacing all other top 10 CPG food manufacturers. Our dollar sales growth rate was three times that of total food and beverage. Our volume grew 1.5%, while total food and beverage declined 1.1%. And our Core 9 volume grew 2.2%, significantly outpacing total food and bev.","Within the Core 9 categories, our customer-branded business or private label also drove growth. We're acting on consumer demand for retail fresh chicken. Fiscal year-to-date, the Tyson brand grew 13% in dollars and 6% in volume, which is three times the category growth rate. Our premium Tyson Trimmed & Ready line grew dollar sales 29% fiscal year to-date.","In the foodservice channel, restaurant traffic dipped negative in the most recent quarter, although check size grew. With a 4% increase in dollar sales for the quarter in our broadline distribution business, our growth rate doubled that of the industry. Tyson is very strong in the broadline foodservice area and our volume sales in tracked categories grew 3.6% over the last 12 months. Our broadline Focus 6 product lines are up more than twice that with 8% growth over the past year. But I should point out following our acquisitions of AdvancePierre and Original Philly, we've added Philly steak to our Focus product categories and that brought our Focus 5 to our new Focus 6.","In the foodservice channel, our poultry sales to major chains showed significant growth in Q1 versus a year ago with a 23% increase in dollars sales as chains promoted chicken in both limited-time offers as well as new permanent menu items.","So finally, I want to touch on tax reform. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be about 24% this year, down from 34% last year. So this is obviously significant for us. Our priorities for capital allocation remain the same, investing to sustainably grow our businesses, repaying debt, making acquisitions that support our strategy and returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. With the additional capital, we'll be able to deliver on these priorities faster.","In fiscal 2018, we expect incremental cash flow in excess of $300 million. More than $100 million will be paid to qualified front-line employees. That means around 100,000 of our team members will receive a one-time bonus in the next few weeks. Other major uses of the cash will be deploying CapEx projects faster than originally planned, employee training and development, advancing our sustainability agenda and innovation projects.","As Jon said earlier, we have both Dennis and Stewart with us this morning. This will be Stewart's first time speaking with you as incoming CFO, and he'll be providing the outlook for the rest of the year. I'm confident you'll get to know and respect him as much as I already do.","This is bittersweet for many of us though, because it's Dennis's last earnings call. His leadership has put us in a position of financial strength that we're in today, and I can't imagine where we'd be without him. Dennis, on the behalf of everyone at Tyson, thank you for nearly three decades of service and dedication. We'll miss you, but we're extraordinarily happy knowing that you'll be enjoying the next chapter of your life.","And now, I'm going to turn it over to you for the financial report.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Before I get started with my prepared remarks, I'd like to say that my 28 years here at Tyson have been a rewarding experience as we overcame adversity to not only grow, but thrive. We transformed from a chicken company to the biggest U.S. food company. It was an amazing experience and a privilege to serve as CFO. I want to thank the many great Tyson team members I've had the privilege to work with over the past 28 years, and especially my team.","With that said, let's focus on our performance. Q1 was another record quarter, highlighted by record results in our Prepared Foods segment. The ongoing investments in our businesses continue to provide consistent, stable growth as we are on track for our sixth straight record year. First quarter revenues were up over 11% to $10.2 billion as we grew sales volume by 5.2%. Excluding incremental volume from the AdvancePierre and Original Philly transactions, base volume grew a solid 2.6% compared to prior year. Adjusted operating income was $950 million in the first quarter, with our earnings profile shifting more to our value-added segments with record performance in Prepared Foods and solid results in Chicken in a difficult environment.","Total company adjusted return on sales was strong at 9.3%, as each of our segments performed within or above their normalized ranges. Our record adjusted EPS of $1.81 includes a $0.21 benefit from the impact of tax reform and is a 14% increase in adjusted EPS compared to $1.59 last year. Our operating cash flow for the first quarter was $1.1 billion, and we spent $296 million on capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $121 million, as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC.","Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.3 times on a pro forma basis, including AdvancePierre results for a full 12 months. We are committed to investment grade ratings. And with the strong cash flows we expect to generate organically, along with divestiture proceeds and additional cash from lower tax rates, we expect to bring our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to around 2 times by Q3 this year and we'll consider additional share repurchases when we reach this goal.","Total liquidity was $1.1 billion at the end of Q1, including cash of $293 million. Net debt was $9.4 billion, a reduction of nearly $500 million, as we used our strong cash flows during the quarter, along with net proceeds of $125 million from the sale of a non-protein business, to pay down debt. Net interest expense was $86 million during Q1. For the quarter, diluted shares outstanding were 371 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter was 22.1%.","We're excited about the positive impact the tax reform will have on the company, as both EPS and cash flow will be significantly impacted. Stewart will provide some additional details on the incremental cash flows in a moment.","In the first quarter, we had a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $994 million related to a re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate. This impacted our GAAP effective tax rate significantly. We currently expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 24% in fiscal 2018 and 25% in fiscal 2019. As previously mentioned, our adjusted EPS benefited by $0.21 in the first quarter due to tax reform. The full year fiscal impact of tax reform is expected to increase our adjusted EPS by an incremental $0.85 from our previously-stated guidance.","Before I turn it over to Stewart, who'll walk us through our capital application priorities and fiscal 2018 outlook, I want you to know that Stewart is a great addition to the team. And I'm confident he will take us to the next level of our potential as a company.","Stewart?","Stewart F. Glendinning - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Dennis, thank you for the kind words, and best of luck to you. I'm happy to be here and excited about the fundamentals we have to work with. Tyson is in an enviable position as the largest food company in the U.S. It has an increasingly branded product portfolio and a strong team, whose record speaks for itself. And while we expect over $300 million of incremental cash flows as a result of tax reform, our capital allocation priorities have not changed. We will continue to be disciplined in our long-term focus on driving shareholder value, as we plan to continue to use our cash to reduce debt and grow our businesses organically through sustainable operational efficiency and capital expansion projects, along with investing in innovation and brand building.","Also, we will still have the flexibility to acquire businesses that support our strategic objectives, along with returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, while maintaining plenty of liquidity and investment-grade credit ratings.","Now, here are some additional thoughts on fiscal 2018. We expect top line sales growth of around 6% to 7% to approximately $41 billion. The expected increase is attributed to base volume growth and incremental AdvancePierre sales of approximately $1.1 billion. Net interest expense should approximate $335 million.","As Dennis mentioned, we currently estimate our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 24%, which reflects the impact of tax reform. CapEx is expected to approximate $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, which is up about $100 million from our previous guidance due to incremental tax reform investments, as we accelerate spending on additional capital projects to further unlock operational improvements with a focus on sustainability and innovation. Based on our average share price in Q1, we expect our average diluted shares to be around 371 million before share repurchases.","Overall, Q1 was a great quarter, with more than $100 million improvement in our value-added segments, Chicken and Prepared Foods. The remainder of fiscal 2018 is consistent with how we viewed it coming into this year. And with the incremental impact related to tax reform of $0.85, we are now raising our annual adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $6.55 to $6.70.","To be clear, our previous guidance has not changed other than accounting for the positive impact of tax reform. This new range is approximately 23% to 26% of the fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS and represents a 5-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 24%.","In closing, our Q2 is historically choppy. And with added margin pressure and increased freight and labor, as Tom described, this Q2 will be no different. However, despite these challenges, we do expect Q2 earnings growth compared to prior year on both a pre-and post-tax reform basis as we remain focused on executing our strategy to drive long-term shareholder value.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Glendinning. Ladies and gentlemen, we will begin the question-and-answer session. And your first question will come from Jeremy Scott of Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Scott - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Thank you, and good morning. And thank you, Dennis, for everything, and best of luck to you in the future.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Thanks, Jeremy.","Jeremy Scott - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","I just wanted to ask on Prepared Foods, clearly, a strong quarter at 11.9% and you upped your synergy target for the year, but you nudged down the guidance 11% to 12%. Is this primarily the freight issue that you called out? And as you move through the year, can you give us a sense of how much that $200 million \u2013 how much of that $200 million you are going to have to eat and how much can be passed through and maybe frame it quarter to quarter? It sounds like 2Q, you're going to have the brunt of it. But if you'd help us with the next quarter and the back half of the year, that'd be helpful.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes, sure. Hey, Jeremy. It's Tom. Absolutely. It's great performance in the first quarter. We're extraordinarily excited about it. We're extraordinarily pleased and proud of the team and what they've been able to do. As you called out, freight is a tough one. I mean, it's affecting all of our business so, to be clear, not just Prepared Foods. So, we do plan to and are in the middle of pricing for it, and it's not always easy to do that. But it's something that we have to do because it's a cost. We got to pass it through.","And ultimately, the consumer is going to pay for it at some point, but it's \u2013 to say how it's going to actually hit every quarter, I can't give you that specificity. But suffice it to say, we feel great about Prepared Foods business. It's still early. It's Q1. Typically, Q4 is little bit challenging for us, as you know. So, the mix of products would be different, consumption base, schools being of season and so forth. But we think that the year is going to be fantastic. We're guiding to around 11%, and we will overcome the challenges that we have with freight.","Jeremy Scott - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great. And maybe on the \u2013 just on that same issue, you called out it impacted every segment. Can you give us a sense of the impact in the quarter across each of your segments?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Not the quarter. We told, for the year, it's about $200 million, but not specific for the quarter. We can't. Sorry.","Jeremy Scott - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. I'll jump back in. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Heather Jones of the Vertical Group. Please go ahead.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Good morning, and congratulations, Dennis. I hope you enjoy your retirement.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Thank you.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Yes, you're welcome. On Chicken margins, you mentioned a difficult environment during Q1. And clearly, we saw the dynamics in breast meat and wings. But you guys are a net buyer of breast meat. And so, I was just wondering if you could \u2013 because Chicken \u2013 if you take away the non-recurring comp costs from Q1 of 2017, Chicken was essentially flat year-on-year. So, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what you're talking about when you say it was a difficult environment.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes. So, the \u2013 it's what we talked about earlier with Jeremy, Heather. It's between the freight and weather. There were some issues, certainly, that affected us. But what I'll say is we believe it will be around 11% for the year. And it's critical that we recover these increased freight costs. We're pretty tight right now. We are very full. We have a lot going for us, and that's a good thing on one hand.","On the other hand, to the extent that we have any bumps on the road, it does cause us to maybe work not as efficiently as we potentially could have. , o it's really freight and labor. We're overcoming that. We're getting on top of whatever little inefficiency that creates. But I'll just refocus you back on the full year margins of 11%. We're extraordinarily excited about that. And then, not for nothing, you got to look at the growth. The growth in the Chicken segment is phenomenal, right, compared to our competitors \u2013 even our own expectations. I mean, I am so proud of what that team has been able to do.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","No, it's impressive that you're able to maintain your margin in the face of the freight issues. It's a difficult environment to be taking price in. And so, I was just wondering, based upon the discussions you've had thus far, I mean, what's your level of confidence that you're going to be able to recover the majority of this and be able to make the guidance?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes. It's pretty high. What I'll tell you is the sales team is great at representing what we do really well and the value that we provide. We are so focused on our customer's growth that nobody wants to take a price increase for sure, to be clear on that. However, we have partners, and they want to grow the business. They understand the value that we play in their overall growth, whether it's branded Tyson \u2013 which is growing like crazy \u2013 which I talked about, or private label products. So, not an easy discussion, absolutely. But the sales team is after it. And I feel very bullish about our prospects of getting that ball covered.","Heather Jones - Vertical Group","Awesome. Thank you so much.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes. You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tom Palmer, CFA - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. It's actually Tom Palmer on for Ken. Just had a couple of quick ones. First, wanted to ask \u2013 and I guess some of this relates to the accounting. But your decision to exclude the employee bonuses from adjusted EPS (00:26:17) ask about kind of how the tax rate flowed through in the first quarter, it looks like for the remainder of the year you're actually guiding for a slightly higher tax rate as the year progresses. So, just kind of wondering, were there certain non-recurring items in that first quarter?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","I'm going to turn it over to Stewart here in a minute, Tom. But you're in for Ken Goldman. I do have to say congratulations to Ken for the Eagles' victory. I'm sure he's at the parade today or something. Being a Pats fan, it was terrible for us. But hey, congratulations to Ken. Please pass that on for me.","Tom Palmer, CFA - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I will. He was very excited.","Stewart F. Glendinning - Tyson Foods, Inc.","I've only been here a month, but that's a big statement coming from Tom. So, anyway, listen, back to business. So, two points here. First of all, your question on why did we choose not to adjust, look, that expense is coming as we pay out the $100 million. You're going to have a huge amount of transparency to that, so whether I adjust for it, don't adjust for it, you're going to know the $100 million is there and you can decide how to put that into your models. I can commit to giving you transparency, as you say.","Relative to the tax rates, because of the timing of tax reform, we take out three quarters of benefit this year. We'll pick up full four quarters next year. There is a bit of an oddity in that the tax rate goes up next year for us, and that is simply because whilst the better rate is coming down, we do get a domestic production credit which exists in fiscal 2018 which is not there in 2019. And so, that takes us back by a few percentage points in 2019. But I would just look back at the, in total, our tax rate goes down dramatically and there will be a lot more resources available for the company. So, net-net, good result.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","This is Ken. I just heard I got called out, so I had to jump in and just say fly, Eagles, fly.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Oh, man. Congratulations, man.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. I'm sorry it couldn't be on the call. Tom is taking care of it. Take care.","Tom Palmer, CFA - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I Just had a second follow-up just on the general pricing environment across different segments, including Prepared Foods. You mentioned that a lot of the labor issues will be offset \u2013 or rising labor costs will be offset by pricing. It \u2013 we cover the retailers and have seen a little bit of compression on their end and a little bit of pushback on pricing. What are you seeing? Anything in terms of challenges? Are you seeing differentiated product that's still able to pass on that pricing?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes. Tom, I'll just start reiterating what I just said when Heather asked the question. For us, it's a matter of the value that we provide. And certainly, some customers are going to be more challenging than others, depending upon what our relationship is. The ones that are most strategic get it. If we have transactional relationships, yes, it's going to be tougher. But I'd say, overall, I'll just reiterate, we feel very bullish about our ability to price for our products because of the value we provide.","Tom Palmer, CFA - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from Farha Aslam of Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Good morning, Farha.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Question about AdvancePierre. Just wanted to understand, is your sales guidance kind of down about $50 million to $75 million? And is that an SKU rationalization program versus your prior guidance?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","No. We're not down. I think the overall is up. AdvancePierre is strong, as well. They continue to perform in line with our expectations now. Remember, the results are split, all right? It's between Prepared Foods and Poultry. And we're probably not going to be talking a lot about this in the future, parsing out AdvancePierre right with the base business. They're part of the team. I would say the integration has gone extraordinarily well.","We're really excited about the growth potential they're providing in all areas of our business on all channels. So, I wouldn't take away that the business is underperforming. If anything, I think it's having a real positive impact, not just on the product lines but also the team members that are now a part of the Prepared Foods and the Poultry business that are helping us grow.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. And then, in beef, you had a particularly strong quarter and you've had a very strong guidance for the full year. Given the latest Cattle on Feed report, we had some questions on the beef cycle. How long do we expect it to last and kind of how you're thinking about your Beef business over the next few years?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes, sure. Yes, we are really proud of our results in the first quarter. I mean, 6.6% is an excellent result. Like I said, we projected about 6% for the full fiscal year. I will hurry on to say Q2 is going to be a little choppy, right? It's exhibiting sort of the same thing since I've been with the company. And certainly, the history happens in the market.","But as it relates to where we are with the cattle cycle, the structural nature of the business, we have pretty good visibility into 2019 and 2020 at this point. We see the number of animals that are out there. Exports, a major part of the revenue stream, up 10% year-over-year for the industry.","As we say on most calls, it's not every call. It's a very regional business, and we like the regions we're in. So, as Beef changed structurally, what I'd say is the cycle correlates to long-term producer profitability. We've done a nice job expanding our revenue opportunity with premium programs. We had continued to talk about it even over this past week, the excellent progress we're making in getting our premium programs out to our retailers and our foodservice operators as we continue to margin up that part of the business. And I'm really proud of the team for the work we're doing there. But from an overall outlook perspective, we're bullish, no pun intended.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Hi. Thank you. And, Dennis, best wishes to you. Thank you for your patience over the years with us sell-siders.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Thank you.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","I have to follow up on Farha's question about the sales guidance for AdvancePierre because, specifically, the full year guidance for Prepared Foods, was $1.35 billion for the full 12 months. And now, it's $1.3 billion. And then, for Chicken, it was also lowered by about $20 million. So, I think the numbers are lower. Can you help us understand why?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes. The only thing that I could say is maybe there's some deflation in there that might be accounted. Rob, we're going to have to come back to you on that. Jon will take that with you after the call because we're not connecting the dots on the same thing that you are.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Okay. And on the Pork segment, I think you lowered your outlook for the hog supply quite a bit. Is that specifically in line with what the USDA is saying about fewer hog supplies coming to the market? And can you give us a sense of what the drivers behind it and how it affects your operations just all through the pork complex?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes. Sure. So, we do see margin compression. We talked about that. We saw it coming, or knew it was going to come when we had our call last quarter. So, it's playing out about as we expected. New players enter the market. The pie gets cut up a bit differently. They try to find supply of hogs and margin is compressed in the short run. Now, how long that lasts, who knows? It sort of levels out at some point.","I'll say that all of our assumptions are built into our annual outlook, which is 9%, which is above our normalized range. So, yes, it's not as stellar as it was last year. But certainly, 9% is a number that we're proud of. We're not having trouble with getting hogs. We're seeing more hogs coming. I think the hog supply will meet the harvest capacity. The same thing is always true. As new entrants come in, they take a while to assimilate. This is going back decades ago. It's something as it continues to build, it happens the same way. We're a great established processor, especially with the team that we have. We'll work our way through it. I'm not going to comment on anybody else's business but our own. But I'll say that we feel like we're in a good spot.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Just so I'm clear, though, you're saying hog farmers are only going to increase supply 1% to 2%. Before, it was 3%. So, is there something going on with what hog farmer intentions are for farrowings?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes, I don't know. Look, that's not something that we feel that there's a \u2013 it's going to be continuing to increase. We feel like there's \u2013 as far as we're concerned, we're going to have the hogs that we need. But I can't parse the numbers that closely, Rob.","Stewart F. Glendinning - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes. Rob, I would just say, look, the driver in the marketplace here is less about the hog supply and more about the processing capability. There are new plants that have opened. And as those new plants have opened, that's changed some of the dynamic, at least, in the short run in the industry. So, happy for Jon to pick up in more detail on the hog supply, but I would say focus less on the supply and more on the processing capacity in the industry.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","It just seems like if the capacity keeps going higher and the hog supply keeps going lower, it's a dangerous cocktail. But thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","We don't imagine that happening. I think the hog supply will be there for the capacity. Exports are continuing to be extraordinarily strong. We're not at all worried about that, Rob.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes, no worries.","Operator","The next question will come from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And let me just add on to, Dennis, your congratulations and best wishes.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Thank you.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I want to go back to the Chicken business a little bit and thinking about the outlook and really trying to understand some of the margin drivers to get to the 11% for the year. Obviously, the first fiscal quarter, we're starting below that. And year-over-year, the profit increase was fairly modest and the 11% guidance with an increased volume forecast actually points to a nice acceleration from the back half of the year. Can you help me think about that?","I mean, you talked in the Q of $30 million of freight, growout and outside meat purchase inflation, which matters, but it's not an enormous delta. I'm just trying to think about is the expectation that you're going to get significant acceleration in pricing, much better mix, productivity on the cost side, layout of feed costs? Just help me think about kind of the drivers that point to a nice acceleration in profit growth in Chicken over the balance of the year.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes. Sure. So, FY 2017 came in $1.1 billion thereabouts, and we have consistently been working on improving our cost structures. That's maybe an element that may be discounted in your model, I'm not sure. But that overall improved cost structure will deliver about $150 million as we roll out the Tyson productivity system throughout the entire business. It's been extraordinarily successful. This is something that we've talked about a bit, maybe not in as much detail. APF adds, in terms of Chicken margins, it's a bit smaller. But there are other financial fitness objectives that we have beyond just the TPS that are procurement-related and so forth that are not small, probably $70 million, $75 million. And then, as you call out, the volume mix is going to contribute. So, for all those reasons, we're confident about that 11% margin.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And I just want to kind of follow up. On the quarter, I think, Tom, in your prepared remarks, you made an allusion to small bird pricing being challenging. Maybe expand on that. And just the volume mix in the quarter was quite healthy and you didn't see the leverage in the fiscal first quarter. Just trying to understand why.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes. So, similar dynamic to what we've seen in the past. Small bird margins can be challenged. A lot of small bird production that's come on. We feel like we're in a good spot to create value, but we also see that those rotisserie, that rotisserie bird business \u2013 the deli business \u2013 is a challenging pricing dynamic, as that becomes, adds more supply against it. So, yes, it's been a bit of an issue for us. But as I said, nothing that we're going to \u2013 it's going to cause us not to overcome that with other areas. And I would add \u2013 to point you back to my comments on the value-added business, both the retail and foodservice, which was predominately the big bird side of it, our experience has been extraordinary.","So, the Green Forest plant that we spent on last year, $135 million, came up running well. And I would say that we will be fully taking advantage of that and be prepared to build new capacity because we need to support the growth there. But, yes, we're going to have from time to time parts of our business that are going to be difficult. There's no question about it. But over time what you should see is our margin variability is not something that you should be concerned about. It should be overall sort of moving in the right direction. But there will be some areas that will be tough from time to time.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. I appreciate the color. I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning, and congratulations, Dennis. Just wanted to touch a little bit here on beef. The margins have come down. And obviously, there's some seasonality to that. But in terms of your outlook, it sounds like you took your guidance up for the year. And if you could just sort of talk about kind of the cadence, maybe even looking further out in terms of how you see the cattle supply evolving. And is there any chance that some of the previously idle capacity might come back online?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes. So, I can't talk about the previously idle capacity. What I can say, Michael, is that we have, like I said earlier, good visibility into the cattle that's out there. We see the number of animals, so that's certainly good for us. The Cattle on Feed report looks good. And they have to come to market, so that's what causes us to be in the space we are as it relates to our margin profile, which is 6%, is good on that business, as you know.","Now, as it relates to the quarter-to-quarter cadence, I can't get into that because it's just something that you can't predict with that level of certainty. What I'd take you back to is how we've been describing our business overall. I mean, we're a powerful engine for growth as the largest U.S. food company continuing to grow past the industry in almost any area. You need to look at what our business is in the first half and in the second half because we will have movement quarter-to-quarter. But the cattle cycle, we feel like we're in a good spot. And it's going to be a choppy Q2, as always. But we feel great about the balance of the year.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And as a follow-up, maybe if you could talk a little bit about your expectations for export demand, really, for all three proteins over the remainder of the year and any concerns maybe over NAFTA. Thanks.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Export demands, we don't have concern. But for \u2013 I will talk about NAFTA but we feel really strong about all of our exports continuing to be double digits. We're very excited about, not only let's say, just the overall export environment but, in particular, how Tyson performs in that environment because our customers enjoy our product, enjoy our service. And our team has built tremendous capability there.","As it relates to NAFTA, we need \u2013 there's no secret, we want it to be sort of left as is. And certainly the areas that need to be modernized as it relates to elements of the agreement, absolutely, and we fully support that. However, Canada is a large trading partner for us, maybe fourth or fifth largest. Mexico is large as well. And so we want that to continue, and we're hopeful that we'll get to a place that is win-win for everybody.","And certainly as it relates to agriculture, do no harm. That's a message that we've been talking about no matter where we are. I've been around the world talking about it, we have been with team members that I've talked to as many as people as we can get a hold of to \u2013 it's got to support agriculture through making NAFTA, keeping where we are.","Operator","The next question will be from David Palmer of RBC. Please go ahead.","Kevin Lehmann - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning. Kevin Lehmann in for Dave. I just want to say, Dennis, congratulations and good luck, and, Stewart, welcome. Welcome aboard.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin.","Kevin Lehmann - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I want to ask about the core branded retail business which, excluding an SD there, the data is going to be showing around down 2% in the quarter, I think that's because of some noise in the numbers lately, particularly from the frozen trade backside. So can you help us understand better the true run rate for U.S. retail now maybe without stealing any thunder from CAGNY, consider maybe introducing a pipeline and maybe some early winds from already launched innovation at resale? Thanks.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes, so you just hit the nail on the head. The CAGNY presentation, if you happened to attend, probably most of the analysts on this call will, but we're really excited about talking to you at CAGNY. We've got a lot of good stuff, not just innovation, by the way.","But in the IRI Nielsen data last month, there was a coding error in our data set. A large customer has changed UPC codes and data providers just hadn't picked it up. So it was sort of a, say, a one-time glitch. It affected our prepackaged ground beef business. So the volume for the year and the volume was in last year did not pick up there year, volume runs at a rate of about 10% of our total retail sales volume, without the error relatively flat.","Got a few losses occurring in some categories. I told you about last quarter, we took some pricing. So importantly, we're now lapping sort of huge comps from a year ago, but as we took the pricing that's going to have an effect. Our data providers expect all this to be cleaned up next month by March. But Core 9 Tyson volumes were not affected. And as we've talked \u2013 looked through all the data on the Core 9, the areas where we took price and we were going to see some share, we did, and areas where we wanted to continue to be on the same track, and we've actually met or exceeded the growth we have. Again, going back to the year-over-year comps were tough.","And I've got to point to Jimmy Dean. If you continue to look at Jimmy Dean frozen protein breakfast, unbelievable. The growth there has been best in class for helping drive the total frozen category. And to finish with CAGNY as I started, you'll see some new things there that hopefully you'll be as excited as we are, because that business is on fire.","Kevin Lehmann - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from Akshay Jagdale of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Thanks for the question and, Dennis, congratulations, and thanks for everything you've done. My first question is on Chicken. Can you help us understand what's embedded in your outlook as it relates to the demand and supply in the industry? Just trying to get a high level view of are you expecting to operate in an equally tough environment that you saw in this quarter because it was a tough environment, and you outperformed the industry very nicely. So just wanted to get a sense of, does your plan assume the industry gets better, or it stays the same?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Akshay. The USDA estimates about 2% growth. It's in line with consumer demand growth. Our demand has been, like we said, extraordinarily strong this year. Because of demand strength, we're building the new plant in Tennessee, but that will not be in the short run, that's certainly for the long run. What I'd say is, we're more focused on what is our supply versus our demand. We love where we're positioned. Our demand is very good. If production rises, it will help with the economics and buy versus grow program, which you know. You called out how we performed in the industry. We are extraordinarily excited about it. The breeder flock seems to be less of a leading indicator than it used to be for \u2013 I think some people have probably looked at that, but for us, the environment looks good and relatively balanced.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. And then just one on the increased CapEx spend as it relates to the tax. The lower tax rate, it's more of a longer-term question. So can you give us a sense of where you're spending this capital? I mean, not necessarily the incremental $100 million but you mentioned technology a couple of times here in your press release and your remarks. Can you give us a sense of what you're seeing out there in terms of technology enablers and how meaningful they might be in unlocking even more savings than what you've announced? Thanks.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Sure. I'm going to ask Stewart to answer that. I'm going to come back to your first question just a bit, too. Remember, Q2 is choppy and Q2 on all of our businesses, we've had tough weather and certainly that doesn't help with our people are trying to get to plants and they have production that is not what it needs to be. So Q2 is certainly a challenge, just to make a footnote there. And then, Stewart, do you want to take the capital question?","Stewart F. Glendinning - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes. Look, Akshay, we \u2013 first of all, let's step back. This company has very, very strong cash flows and has the benefit of being able to pull a wide range of levers as it relates to capital allocation and tax reform. By adding another $300-plus million, it's going to do nothing but help that scenario. When you look at where we're deploying the cash this year, yes. You point to the $100 million of one-time bonuses. The additional money that we expect to spend that we've talked about is around what we call high-return capital projects. Some of those involve technology, and you're right. Technology makes a big difference in this business; whether that's our automation in plants or whether that's systems in the back of the house that allow for greater back-house efficiency, both of those are included in our project. But what I've been really excited about as I've come into this company is to see that the long backlog of very powerful, strong ROIC capital returns, and this extra cash is just allowing us to drive that a little bit harder and faster.","Operator","The next question will come from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","John Colantuoni - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. This is John Colantuoni for Morgan Stanley. Thanks for the question. My question is on guidance. Guidance went up in line with the benefit of lower taxes, but it sounds like you're expecting to sell the two remaining non-protein businesses later than originally expected, and at the same time, guidance doesn't include the $100 million in cash bonuses planned for the second quarter. Can you just explain how you're thinking about all the dynamics of guidance? I'm just trying to understand whether you're being conservative here.","Stewart F. Glendinning - Tyson Foods, Inc.","John. Okay. Well, let's take the $100 million first. The $100 million will be part of our adjustments as we give you adjusted earnings. Why do we do that? Because we've got a set of rules that we've used around adjusted earnings that we're following consistently. As I answered earlier in the call, you'll have the benefit of the full transparency around the $100 million. So you know that it's there. It is not included in the adjusted guidance, so first point.","Second point, your second part of your question was what happens with Frozen Foods, such as the Sarah Lee business. Yes, that will be in our numbers for longer. But when you look at the moving parts around that transaction costs \u2013 holding cost. Actually, the number's not really material to the total guidance range. And for that reason, it's embedded in our outlook.","John Colantuoni - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So just to confirm, the sales from those two businesses were included in the reported sales for this quarter? And there will be a portion of them included in sales for the upcoming quarters as well, is that right?","Stewart F. Glendinning - Tyson Foods, Inc.","What I'm saying is, yes. We don't expect to see any dramatic influence on our guidance around EPS related to the holding of these businesses.","John Colantuoni - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then I just had a quick question on hog prices. We observed hog prices that are up, were up about 20% year-on-year since September. And even despite this increase, they remain significantly below the 5 and 10-year averages. Can you discuss your expectation for hog prices as the year progresses and whether the price movements thus far this year are consistent with your initial expectations?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","No, let me just say that what we can talk about is the spread. As prices move, we are in a spread business and we continue to like how that plays out for us. And I'm just going to repeat, we're not having trouble getting hogs. We're seeing more hogs coming. So when you're in a spread business and you have good supply equals good results for us.","John Colantuoni - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you for the questions.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah.","Stewart F. Glendinning - Tyson Foods, Inc.","I would just add by saying that I mean that's why we give the guidance and our expectations are currently embedded in that.","Operator","The next question will be from Brett Wong of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my question here. As you spoke about, obviously, we're seeing higher costs impact margins right now. But as you look longer-term, I just wanted to get your thoughts around what you think normal margins will look like. And it seems there needs to be some aspect of a reset here, specifically for Beef and Pork. And then just on top of that, when do you think we can get to the 12% to 14% Prepared Foods margins that you've talked about and what will drive that? Thanks.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Sure. So, Brett, I would say the margins that we guided to is what we expect for 2018. And we had talked about last quarter after the close of Q2, we'll come back and probably share what we think the margin ranges should be longer-term given where we see those businesses. And we're happy with where we are, certainly on Beef and Pork.","As it relates to Prepared Foods margins, I expect it's going to continue to go north. So that business, we're fueling it with capital and the innovation that Sally Grimes and the team are driving is spectacular.","So I'd say that to be in the 12% to 14% range feels right. When that is, I can't commit to if this is going to happen exactly this quarter or this fiscal year. But our innovation efforts are really kicking in and paying back, which we're extraordinarily excited about. Being in the right categories, in the right part of the store, we're competing in the fresh perimeter, integrating assets like AdvancePierre and Original Philly. Certainly, we have done extraordinarily well integrating those assets, looking for more to bolt on should be in your thought process.","Now, on the synergy capture and financial fitness mindset that we have in continuous improvement, certainly plays out in all of our businesses but in Prepared Foods, that's no small matter. The team has does extraordinary work. George Chappelle and the group in the operations team has continued to make our operations even better and we're well diversified. We've got a great consumer business, great foodservice business, customer brands and private label. So like we said, 2018 will be around 11%, but longer-term, you should be thinking of that business in the 12% to 14% range.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","That's very helpful. Thank you. I just want a quick follow-up on that. You talked about kind of some of the synergies as you've integrated AdvancePierre, and I know you're not really going to break this stuff out kind of going forward as much, but just wondering kind of what revenue synergies you're going to be seeing as you're integrating that? Obviously, you've talked about the cost synergies in the past.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes. So I would say there are some retailers that we have been working with that we weren't in some private label categories, which we are now in. We didn't have the capacity. We didn't have maybe the products. And so that's point number one.","Point number two is, on the foodservice business, we are extraordinarily excited about now the breadth of offering that we play. We were a valuable, certainly, supplier before as collective Tyson Foods, and now even more valuable. Philly steak is a huge product. It's got tremendous tailwinds. People are eating it. They like the protein value. They like the taste, which, oh, by the way, always matters.","And so the revenue synergies we're starting to see come in the form of foodservice and foodservice convenience. I would say retail, customer brands and also the perimeter of the retail store. So what's nice about it is it hits almost every single channel that we do business in, which that breadth really helps our portfolio. It allows us to continue with the earnings power that we have.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks so much.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from David Carlson of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Carlson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Thank you for taking my question. Hey, Tom, the Beef segment operating results were substantially better than we were anticipating during the fiscal first. And then also the guidance, you nudged a little higher for the full-year. You mentioned overall beef exports, I believe, up 10%, but can you give us a sense of the export volume growth for Tyson during the quarter? And are you seeing exports accounting for a higher mix of sales and profits in the Beef segment? And then any commentary you might have related to China which, I guess, in all reality, is still relatively early stage. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah, so I'll start with China. China is still small. We're hoping for something bigger, but certainly exports are up and it's part of that overall revenue stream. I think I mentioned this, but maybe I didn't. It's up 10% year-over-year for the industry, so we don't necessarily give specific guidance as it relates to our import growth.","But let me go back to another thing I said. As you were happy with the margins, so are we. There is so much work going on in attributes, so Open Prairie, and the team has focused on how do we take attributes, move them into the marketplace, hit a higher margin, continue to brand the beef products that we sell either to retailers or foodservice customers, and that's really helpful.","And what I would continue to have you look at is quarter-to-quarter, our progress in that area. We'll probably be more specific about what those growth rates look like in our branded beef business and our specialty cuts, certainly, on an export basis, give us a great position to continue to take advantage of that strong export volume.","David Carlson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Welcome.","Operator","And the final question this morning will be from Ken Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Hey, Ken.","Stewart F. Glendinning - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Good morning.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Morning.","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So you've gone through a lot of issues from the increased cost structure, from fuel and all that, but yet you're keeping your guidance largely in line with what you previous is, so what's actually going better?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Well, what I'd say is everything is going well, but we have the areas of our business that just continue to accelerate based on what we put in place in the last 12 or 18 months. You've heard us talk consistently about innovation and brand building, right? And so, Ken, if I were to point to one thing, I'd say that. Those efforts are paying off and they're paying off not just with the volume of those products, but also how customers are interacting with us. They look to us for growth and we are partnering with them. And so, yes, if I were to point on one thing, it would be that.","And then coming back to the costs, those two things work in tandem. The ability for us to overcome cost that hit us, not just us but sort of industry-wide thing, it's easier for us to deal when we have those relationships with the customers. And good question, I'd point to innovation.","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And just my follow-on is can you give us some anecdotal changes that's happening because of AdvancePierre?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Anecdotal changes? I think you're talking about like just...","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","How is your outlook changing? What is the addition of AdvancePierre, how is that affecting the \u2013 what are some \u2013 you talked about cost savings throughout, but what are anecdotes of like what is actually \u2013 how were the costs been coming out? What is changing? Are you changing how Jimmy Dean sandwiches are made? Are you changing \u2013 what's going on that's changing?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Okay. Yes.","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","On a more realistic level that we can relate to?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Okay. Procurement. We have stronger contracts with our suppliers and so the procurement certainly has been a big area of focus for us. The sandwich-making, what it's allowed us to do is bringing what AdvancePierre did really well in sandwich-making, particularly on customer brands, and what we have done historically well with Jimmy Dean. There are some things that they were doing much better, and there are some things that we were doing much better. So, as a specific example, as we design the network going forward, we're taking the best of both and making sure that we're executing those.","You've heard us talk about the approach to operational excellence that AdvancePierre had. They call it the APF way. We have taken the APF way, embraced it, and the team and led by George Chappelle, is running the entire Prepared Foods business now with that in mind. The accountability, the focus on lean, and so making sure that we take out any non-value-added costs. I'd say that's number two.","And number three is the agility. So we haven't talked about this in a while, but the agility that the AdvancePierre team brings. They are constantly pushing us to make decisions faster, to be as customer-focused as we can be, and it's had an impact. Sally is running the business. They're doing things that are different and so I think being more agile for the customer, more focused on growth we already were, but I think that's making sure that customers' at the center of the table, that's a strong part of this.","Kenneth Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Hey, you're welcome.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Tom Hayes for his closing remarks.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Okay. Well, thanks for the great questions.

I will say thank you to all of our team members that are listening around at the plants and also in our headquarters locations. We have had a fantastic start to the year. We've got work to do. I know we've got the best team to do it. Very excited and I will say we are off to a great start. Another record year.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I'll turn the meeting over to Jon Kathol, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Jon Kathol","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Tyson Foods Conference Call for the Second Quarter of our 2013 Fiscal Year. I need to remind you that some of the things we'll talk about today will include forward-looking statements. Those statements are based on our view of the world as we know it now, which could change. I encourage you to look at today's press release for a discussion of the risks that can affect our business.","On today's call is Donnie Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Leatherby, Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Lochner, Chief Operating Officer.","[Operator Instructions]","I'll now turn the call over to Donnie Smith.","Donnie Smith","Thanks, Jon. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. About a month after our Q1 call, we announced that our second quarter was going to be tougher than we anticipated, and it was. We achieved record sales for the quarter but our earnings fell short of our expectations and will impact -- the reasons for that in a minute.","Looking at adjusted earnings for the first half of the year, we're at $0.84 compared to $0.86 last year, off by $0.02. And as you're all aware, we're predicting a strong back half of the year. We are still projecting full year adjusted EPS better than fiscal '12, primarily due to the performance we expect from the Chicken segment.","As I said many times, I think our multi-protein, multichannel, multinational model provides for a balanced approach that enables us to take care of our customers and grow over time.","Now looking at the macro environment, according to the perishables group, at retail, breast meat dollar sales were up 3.5% for the 52-week period ended March 30 while pounds were flat, indicating higher pricing. In Pork, prices were down 2.6% while pounds were up 3.4%. Total Beef dollars sales increased nearly 2% but pounds declined nearly 4%. Chicken benefited from customers who move away from beef. Pounds sold were up 2%, while dollar sales were up 7.6%. Tyson, the #1 brand of Chicken in the U.S., drove category growth.","In the foodservice channel, February sales growth was negative, down 1.2% for the first time in 3 years. NPD reports traffic was flat for Dec, Jan, Feb with QSR up slightly and full service down slightly versus a year ago. NPD's preliminary report on March indicates QSR traffic was down by 1% versus last year. Higher gas prices and payroll taxes, bad weather and economic uncertainty all weighed on consumers.","So overall, foodservice traffic is about flat. But people are ordering fewer items when they visit a restaurant, which means volume is contracting by about 0.5%. However, many of our core categories such as Chicken, soup, tacos and wraps have gained annual servings in this flat market.","NPD CREST predicts restaurant traffic in 2013 will not be as high as 2012 levels, even in QSR. And given the slow rate of economic recovery, traffic is expected to be relatively flat through '14 as well.","So in this environment, how do we grow sales? In addition to the quality and service Tyson is known for, we must continue to provide product innovation to drive traffic and sales for our customers, whether they are QSR, a mid-scale restaurant, a big-box retailer, a small grocery chain, a convenience store, a club store or a school district. Because of the weak demand, operators are more interested than ever in our new product ideas and business building opportunities.","Year-to-date, we've grown value-added sales by 3.3% as we started filling up the innovation pipeline. As a reminder, we set an ambitious goal of growing value-added product sales 6% to 8% annually. We believe we'll get there.","Our goal is to understand our consumers' needs and provide foods that meet those needs in every day part. Our focus this year has been on 3 categories: handheld or on-the-go, gluten-free and no antibiotics ever.","For a couple of quick examples in support of the handheld category, we're extending our current line with new whole-grain items and bold flavors. Also look for gluten-free chicken nuggets and other gluten-free breaded products in response to the growing number of consumers who are following the gluten-free diet.","In the no antibiotics ever category, we'll build on the NatureRaised Farms brand of fresh chicken, which is successfully launched in February. We just started shipping frozen, fully cooked items under this new brand that features the attributes of no antibiotics ever, a 100% all natural, vegetarian-fed with independent third-party animal welfare certification. The NatureRaised Farms fully cooked line includes whole-grain and gluten-free offerings to meet the needs of a growing category of consumers who are looking for chicken with no antibiotics ever in their convenience foods.","These are a few examples of the 90 new retail products you'll see this year in our aggressive product launch schedule. We're supporting these products through a significant amount of highly targeted MAP spending, and we're already seeing good return on our spend.","I'll highlighted some of what we're doing at retail but I don't want to leave you with the impression that innovation is only in one channel. Working alongside our foodservice customers, we play a key role in developing many of the QSR new product features and promotions you've seen and you will see this year. We'll be introducing well over 100 new products in fiscal '13 in the various foodservice channels, including QSR, national accounts, distribution, schools, deli and convenience stores.","Speaking of which, as we mentioned previously, we're focused on expanding our presence in deli and c-stores. We recently hosted the c-store foodservice summit here at our Discovery Center. It was a big success. We didn't just highlight our existing product capabilities, we bought in new concepts and products to help c-store chains expand their offerings and drive new and increased sales. Several participants said it was the best industry event they had ever attended.","So to wrap up my thoughts on new product innovation, we've got a lot done. We've got a lot going on and we've got a lot planned for the next few years. We're in a very unique position in our industry. We don't just sell our products. We help our customers meet new opportunity in what our products can do for them.","In the area of new product innovation, we're excited about what we do, about how we do it and most especially excited that our customers value what we do. I look forward to being able to give you more news in this area in the future as we achieve value-added growth while meeting our customers' needs.","Turning to our international business. I'm really pleased with our growth strategy and how that's taken shape. Our international operations have improved significantly compared to a year ago, primarily driven by great results in Mexico and Brazil. Now obviously, the avian influenza outbreak in China is troubling and is detrimental to protein consumption in the short run. But I think long term, this validates our business model in China, which emphasizes biosecurity, supply-chain integrity and food safety.","Now you may have noticed in our earnings release this morning that we had a $56 million impairment of noncore assets in China, and I want to explain what this is. Our team in China conducted a thorough assessment of our long-term strategy and concluded that the capital investment needed to upgrade one of our older poultry complexes would be better spent in other ways. As a result of the change in expectations for this facility, we took an impairment this quarter. But I want to be clear that we are still committed to our strategy of company control birds in China, and we're looking into how best to use that capital.","My final thoughts are that we got this tough quarter behind us and everybody here is focused on what lies ahead, not just for the rest of the year but the next 3 to 5 years down the road. Whether it's new product launches, new categories, new distribution channels, training our people to perform at their highest level or succession planning to ensure we always have a high performing team in place, Tyson Foods is in a good position. And while our plans are ambitious, they're also realistic and attainable, which is why I'm so excited about our future. Q3 is off to a really good start and I believe we'll finish the back half strong and take a lot of momentum into FY '14.","So that concludes my remarks. Dennis will now give the financial update followed by Jim, who will discuss our operating segments. Dennis?","Dennis Leatherby","Thank you, Donnie, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported Q2 earnings of $0.26 per share or $0.36 after adjusting for the $56 million impairment charge on noncore assets in China and the $19 million currency translation gain. These adjustments had essentially no tax expense or benefit. And as Donnie said, adjusting for these 2 items, year-to-date earnings per share is $0.84, down $0.02 compared to $0.86 last year. Adjusted pretax return on invested capital for the past 12 months was 16%. Capital expenditures were $133 million for the quarter and $290 million through the first 6 months of fiscal '13 as we continue to invest in projects for both our domestic and foreign operations that will not only result in improved productive capabilities, labor efficiencies, yields and sales mix but also increase our ability to innovate and produce new products to our customers.","Operating cash flow through 2 quarters was $230 million, down from fiscal '12 due to increased accounts receivable from an uptick in sales at the end of the second quarter. This past quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for $50 million under our share repurchase program. This brings our total repurchases over the past 8 quarters to 29.4 million shares for $550 million under this program.","Including cash of $762 million and short-term investments of $47 million, net debt was $1.6 billion. Total liquidity was just under $1.8 billion, remaining well above the upper end of our targeted range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion.","Gross debt remained at just over $2.4 billion and we still plan to pay off convertible notes due in October with cash on hand.","Net debt to EBITDA for the last 12 months was 1x. On a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis, this measure was 1.5x.","Through March, debt interest expense is down 26% compared to a year ago at $70 million. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 33.2% or 27.7% excluding the impairment of the noncore assets in China and the currency translation gain.","Our average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter was 366 million. This reflects the dilutive share effect of options and convertible notes of $13 million. The impact of the 2.1 million shares repurchased during the quarter will not be fully realized until subsequent quarters.","So now here are some thoughts on fiscal '13 as a whole. We expect revenues of approximately $34.5 billion, down slightly from previous guidance. Net interest expense should approximate $140 million. The effective tax rate should be around 35.5% to 36%, and we've widened our CapEx plan to a range of $550 million to $600 million.","Our priorities for excess cash remain first toward additional capital spending to continue innovating, improving and growing our existing businesses, such as the new products Donnie mentioned in his remarks. Second, acquisitions to fulfill our growth strategies around value-added products in our international footprint. As you know, we acquired Don Julio Foods in the second quarter and we continue to look for opportunities that can contribute to our growth goals and finally by continuing to return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, as we've demonstrated recently with our share repurchase activity and increased dividend rate.","In closing, I would like to reemphasize our confidence that our team will deliver strong results in the second half of the year and that we will carry that momentum with us into fiscal '14 with our sight set on at least 10% EPS growth.","I'll now turn it over to Jim for a closer look into our operating segments.","James V. Lochner","Thanks, Dennis, and good morning. The Pork segment had 5.5% return on sales and $72 million in operating income in the second fiscal quarter. Our average sales price per pound and volume were both down 2.2% compared to Q2 last year. Pork exports softened during the quarter, which increased domestic availability by about 3.5% versus a year ago, negatively impacted wholesale pricing.","In response, we chose to run reduced volumes in an effort to improve margins. We expect industry hog supplies to be flat but sufficient and pork exports are likely to decrease slightly compared to fiscal 2012. However, we expect 2013 will be another strong year for our Pork segment.","The Prepared Foods segment had a 3.5% return on sales and $28 million in operating income. Our volume was down 0.8%, while average sales price per pound was up slightly at 0.3% over Q2 of '12. Volume was down due to reduced foodservice demand, although we maintain market share. To offset demand, we're going after other business across the multiple channels we service, which we believe will improve our volume in 2014.","Also in Prepared Foods, our lunchmeat plant in Houston is undergoing a renovation project, and it should improve our results in fiscal '14 but it will be a drag on the segment in 2013. Our Chicken segment is performing well and reported a 2.5% return on sales and $78 million in operating income. Volume was essentially flat, while pricing was up 6.2%. Without the impairment from our Chinese assets, the Chicken segment has made $241 million the first half of fiscal '13 compared to $177 million in the first half of fiscal '12. This is despite an increase of $335 million in total feed cost year-over-year, showing how much our Chicken business has improved.","We continue to improve through capital investment and significant operational efficiencies. In the second quarter, we drove more than $10 million out of our cost structure through operational efficiencies, bringing the total to $39 million so far this year. We still expect to achieve $100 million in operating efficiencies for the year.","We position ourselves to better adjust to rising feed cost by changing many of our sales contracts, which are now formula based or shorter term in nature, allowing us to more readily offset rising input cost through pricing.","Our annual fixed price contracts are in the single digits and declined further in Q2 compared to Q1. Additionally, foodservice promotion of chicken throughout 2013 should help drive volume of highly value-added products that are less susceptible to commodity pricing. This, coupled with strong demand at retail for chicken, are positive indicators for the strong back half of the year in the Chicken segment.","Although our production has not been directly affected by avian influenza in China, demand has softened for the entire Chinese poultry industry. Concerns over AI, along with an antibiotic residue problem by competitors, have caused Chinese consumers to question their food safety. We believe our modern methods and processes will make our chicken the preferred product, and we'll be in a position to benefit in the long run. Our team in China continues to improve. And apart from this delay in demand, we remain on target with our production goals.","Turning to the Beef segment. We had a negative margin of 0.8%, with an operating loss of $26 million. Volume was down 3.9% while price per pound was up 6.5%.","We have several issues that contributed both positively and negatively to our results. There is a regional disparity in cattle cost, followed by the closure of the Texas plant. Our Southern plants had an improved relationship between beef prices and cattle cost, which did enhance our margins and improve our utilization. This was positive to our results. However, in some of our Northern plants, we had margin compression from the increased demand for cattle relative to the price of beef, which is negative to margins.","We expanded and increased our operating cost compared to Q2 last year. These are driven by labor cost, resulting from product mix changes and higher wages. We also had operational challenges, primarily in 2 plants, and we've taken steps to rectify the underperformance in these operations.","Although demand for ground beef was good, overall beef demand was soft, apparently from the higher prices and the resolving consumer movement towards chicken. This was particularly noticeable in our premium beef programs. We were not able to realize optimum revenue for steak and roast cuts because supplies exceeded consumption. To rectify this situation, we have adjusted our cattle procurement strategies to reflect the softer demand and excess supplies from the premium grains.","Looking ahead in Beef, we still expect industry-fed cattle supplies to decline by 2% to 3% in fiscal 2013. There should be adequate supplies near our plants, although there could be periods of supply-demand imbalance. The operating environment and our performance have improved and our Beef segment was profitable in both March and April.","In conclusion, we come to the toughest part of the year and are nearly equal to last year. We believe Q3 and Q4 will be significantly better than Q2, but they're not in a bank yet, so we can't and won't let up. Our teams know what they need to know. Now we just have to go about the business of day-to-day execution.","That is the end of our prepared remarks. We are ready to begin Q&A. Operator, we're ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We do have our first question, Ryan Oksenhendler, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just want to ask, regarding the outlook for Chicken, as I look out for the back half of the year, can you see pricing accelerate as you've seen breast meat move here? And I know some of your contracts didn't really get priced until February, March, so we didn't see as much of an increase in the second quarter. And then is there any reason that that can't continue into fiscal '14 given that supply seemed to be disciplined here given the recent pullet placement trends?","Donnie Smith","Yes. A couple of parts. Let me take the first one. Yes, we do expect to see pricing improve in Q3 versus Q2 and forward into 4. Certainly, market's given us a good bit of help there. Looking on into '14, if you look at the pullet numbers -- and by the way, the amount of eggs that are going to Mexico, really don't see that supply is going to change much until -- timing would tell you sometime around late Oct, Nov and then of course, then you're going into the Thanksgiving and Christmas market slowdown. So it wouldn't make sense for us to do anything on supply going into that period. So really feels like you'll carry a lot of momentum into '14 and on end of -- front half of the calendar part of the year.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. And then just one follow-up on the international regarding bird flu in China, in terms of impacting your business, I know consumption has slowed. You originally had planned to be breakeven, I think, in the fourth quarter -- fiscal fourth quarter of this year. Has that changed? And I guess, kind of can you give us an outlook for fiscal '14 and how that will impact that earnings for next year?","Donnie Smith","Yes, it sure has, Ryan. I'd say it probably pushes out that breakeven mark for a quarter or 2. Still in our sights, though. In terms of the business operations, we're getting our houses built on time just like we thought we would. By the end of the year, we'll have about half of our production in company-owned housing. That will feel really good going into the plants. So whereas I thought maybe we'd be there in Q4, it's likely to be maybe Q1 or Q2 now '14. But you should expect sequential year-over-year continued improvements in international. This year, our international results minus the impairment in China, so let's call it an adjusted international results number, will be markedly better than last year and then you'll see another improvement, we believe, going into '14.","Operator","Next question, Heather Jones, BB&T Capital Markets.","Heather L. Jones - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","My first question is on Beef. Using Hedgers Edge as a proxy, you guys' sequential and year-on-year performance in Beef deteriorated pretty dramatically. And some of the things that you discussed in your prepared remarks were company specific but some were issues that the whole industry struggled with. So I was wondering if you could give us a sense of magnitude of the company-specific issues you referenced and how soon those will be resolved so we could expect you to get back to your typical spread to the industry.","Donnie Smith","Let me address that. First of all, the north style does make the Hedgers Edge, which is one number, a little bit more difficult to interpret. But yes, we did have some specific, particularly related to our normal premiums for what we call the premium grades. And we saw the softness in demand, which put pricing pressure on that. And we usually lag how we pay for cattle based on what the lagging premium grades warrant. And we weren't rapid enough to correct that and pushed that premium for the higher-end grades, the Angus approach, as even the prime were all soft. And so we didn't adjust that fast enough and that was particularly as well in the northern tier where the cattle did trade higher. So we really got hit specifically in our northern tier plants with higher price beef relative to what the beef warranted, as well as paying more than we should have for the premium grade. So we've got -- we've had that corrected. And then we're working through getting our operational cost issue that I referenced in a couple of plants. I'm comfortable that we'll get our arms around that and push forward to get ourselves back where we normal are in Beef.","Heather L. Jones - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And as a follow-up, you talked about being in your normalized range for Chicken in the back half. And I understand, given the structure of your business model, that your magnitude of improvements is not going to track like when the industry is improving as quickly as it is now. But given what we're seeing with breast meat, given what we're seeing just with demand, there seems to be an acceleration in demand, should we anticipate you guys being at the high end of normalized in the back half? Or you -- I mean how are you thinking about that?","Donnie Smith","We're expecting, yes, to be in the high end, and we expect domestic Chicken to do very, very well on this back half of the fiscal year. Again, we're seeing the pricing where we want it, our operational efficiencies were set up very well and understanding our demand and supply, so we're in very good balance -- at least, we anticipate to be in very good balance on what we know today. We're seeing a tremendous amount of features at foodservice on chicken products and we're also seeing the same follow-through so far into early Q3 here with chicken at retail continuing to show a demand shift away from beef. So we're very encouraged with the back half on Chicken in fiscal '13. And I do believe it will carry right on into '14 the way the supply structure is set up currently.","Operator","Next question is Tim Ramey, D.A. Davidson.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just wondering if you could give us any color on Japan and the increasing age and some of the specialty cuts that you might be able to ship into there at greater margins. Is that starting to flow? What -- were we seeing any real impact there?","Donnie Smith","Well, it is now, actually. And if I think back a mere quarter ago when that was just announced, the enthusiasm was very high. And I fully well know that the lag time to get the supply chain and get the customer base reestablished into Japan would take some time, and it did. So we didn't really see any positive benefit through the Jan, Feb, March period to speak of, although in March it started to heat up on the shipment side and we're starting to see supply chain be reestablished. In fact, the U.S., when I look at March, popped up 28%. Now we got a very high share of that. In fact, when we track our numbers, our Tyson share into Japan was up at -- up 95%. So we feel pretty good, as well as the market for the non-muscle cuts starting to -- the interest is starting to expand there. But it's going to take a little bit more time than what everybody originally thought and markets never move and demand never moves as fast as one wants. But I'm very encouraged with what I see going forward from the Japanese market on beef exports.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And if I could just follow up on China. You obviously have a great story to tell there, and I just don't know whether you can tell that story. I mean, it's always hard when you have these, maybe an influenza outbreaks, nobody wants to hear about chicken at all. But at the end of the day, your story is one that should be well received. Who's going to lead that charge? Is that kind of the YUM! brands of the world that will do that? Or does everyone just want to be quiet a little bit for a while on chicken?","Donnie Smith","Tim, I think early, there's just a consumer issue around AI and don't buy chicken, don't buy -- and so demand has really dropped a lot, particularly in the Shanghai area, which is where our operations are. I think that's temporary. We believe that whenever the number of confirmed cases quits growing that, let's call it a time clock, if you will, will begin, and then a few months after that consumer acceptance of poultry will be right back to where it was. The one thing that this unfortunate event has done is absolutely validated our model for extreme biosecurity, the best in food safety. Our supply chain is very, very well protected, and that's getting recognition. And so over time, I believe that will continue to validate our model and we'll see the value from that. It's just, right now, we're a little bit overwhelmed with kind the, don't want to say fear, but folks backing off of chicken. Jim, anything to add?","James V. Lochner","Yes. The only thing I'd add is yes, the short term here, we've seen demand but there's some sort of long-term structural changes that appear to be in place, particularly when you think about the wet market eliminating all live bald chicken and other follow other market. And you're seeing that fragmented independent producers that got hurt hard and the antibiotic issues in November, December followed with this, so we expect to see a reduction in that independent fragmented supply chain, which actually will position us on the rebound very well because we haven't backed off anything on our company-owned control production. So actually, the silver lining will be out front yet. So we're comfortable with it.","Operator","Next question is Christine McCracken, Cleveland Research.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Just on a follow-up to the discussion on Beef. You talked about some of the regional challenges and the pressure on margins there. Do you think there was any impact from the snow in May or the really cold spring we've had, I guess, in terms of the grilling season? And then how big a deal has this trade disruption been with China on the beta agonist?","James V. Lochner","The snow in May is a surprise to everybody. But I don't think that's really negatively impacted the cattle supplies, if anything, maybe slowed down the availability slightly. But that will quickly rebound. We'll have those clearly available through the balance of May, June, July, August. So I expect actually Beef to be much like last year with a very, very strong back half and it certainly set that way -- set itself up that way. And I do think the cold weather has hurt consumption until recently when we've seen the cutoffs start to rebound here in the last week or so. So yes, I think the demand and again, we always make money in the slope of change. So when Beef revenues are under pressure and they're declining, the cattle costs have to correct down to it. And vice versa, when the positive revenues are going up, the cattle costs tend to lag it up. So we're in that mode right now with fairly ample supplies coming at us. The ractopamine, any time you lose a market and you create more domestic availability, you put pressure on wholesale prices, and that did have some impact on Beef and it clearly had some impact on the Pork wholesale prices because that domestic availability, as I referenced in Pork, did go up 3.5% on a nominal increase in production pounds. So a loss of markets does influence those wholesale prices, which ultimately influences the value of hogs and cattle.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Just as a follow-up, talking about that Pork, that situation doesn't seem like it's going to get a lot better; inventories are growing. How should we be thinking about it as we look forward? And seasonally, I think you'll get a little tighter supplies here over the next couple of months. But then looking into the -- later this year, it seems like that growing inventory of pork and the inability of the U.S. market to take that is going to be a big problem. How should we be thinking about pork long term?","Donnie Smith","Well, I think the -- from our margin perspective, I'm very positive. Again, once we get through this typical April, May is usually your tighter supply, there may be some pressure on the wholesale prices. But I think that's largely built in that lack of domestic disappearance. Your exports has already adjusted. So I think the balance will be there. And I actually expect us to come through and end the year very strong in Pork margins. But there won't be -- I don't think we'll see the robust pricing that we saw in prior years either.","Operator","Next question is Ken Goldman, JPMC.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On Chicken wings, we continue to see frozen stores numbers climb, and there's a theory out there that inventories are rising in preparation for a pretty major national launch by a QSR. But at the same time, prices are soft for wings. So it's not like all these wings going into storage instead of market are driving these -- the price on shelf higher. So can you give us a bit of color as to what's happening there? And specifically, are there enough wings for a QSR to do a major national launch all at once? Or does it kind of have to be piecemeal region by region, in your opinion?","Donnie Smith","Well, I probably shouldn't comment on what a QSR might do. But let me talk about wing supply. Typically this time of the year, prices are going to fall. You get out of the past March madness, you're going to see prices drop. I'm grateful wings currently trade, what, upper 120s, low 130s, that kind of number. And that's probably $0.25, $0.30 a pound above what the 4-, 5-year average would be for this time of the year. So I still think -- I like where wings prices are. And typically what will happen, Ken, is folks like us, you get into the kind of the latter part of the summer deal and you know you're going to have a big wing season coming up, so you call it -- these through March. Folks will start buying wings and further processing those and putting those in inventory to get ready for big retailer, foodservice features that are going to be coming during the next wing season. Because you're going to sell a whole lot more wings during wing season than what you could produce. So it gets a little soft this time of the year. It firms up. I'm sure if there's a QSR that's working on a promotion that there's going to be plenty of wings to supply that, it may mean that wing prices are firmer next wing season, but we'll deal with that then.","James V. Lochner","The only thing I'd add is the strength in the breast meat term prices probably are also long term going to be supportive of the wing because you won't have the ability to go chase a lower meat lock-in in the boneless breast meat contribution to the boneless wings.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Interesting. Urner Barry has jumbo wings at $1.10. You guys are seeing actual prices trade well ahead of that it sounds like?","Donnie Smith","Yes. Most of what -- well, what I was quoting was probably the medium wing market, which is what we do. Yes, jumbo would be about $1.10.","James V. Lochner","It's $1 to $1.10.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then on Pork, in the last month or so, we've seen hog and pork prices jump higher. And I realized, of course, part of it is seasonality, right? But the growth rate is higher than we usually see this time of year. So maybe seasonality isn't the only driver, right? We're still seeing -- I guess, I'm curious, right, we're still seeing a very unfavorable dollar-yen translation rate and export debt is not great. So I'm curious in your opinion why we've seen sequentially pork prices rise maybe more than what some of us would have expected lately.","Donnie Smith","A little bit of that rise, when I look back at it -- because we got hurt in the margins in Feb through March on that decline, and then they start to shore back up and that relationship came back together. But as of late, bellies were running. They corrected back. They were running up fairly sizable on increases as well as those hams, and loins were starting to show kind of a seasonal increase. So I was actually very -- maybe not surprised but, I guess, gratified. I'm seeing the shore up in pricing and the increase suggesting again maybe that the retail consumption and overall demand were starting to show some strength, particularly as we said before because this cold spring I do think has had a very negative influence on just purely the grilling rates. So maybe that's the sign.","Operator","Next question is Diane Geissler, CLSA.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I wanted to touch back on the China issue and maybe take it from a different angle. Just the Chinese consumer seems to me has just been beleaguered with bad news about protein between the feed issue, avian flu, dead hogs in the river and now rat meat. I have to believe that the multinationals that are operating there and the government itself is eager to move the professionalism of that industry -- variety of industries that are hogs and poultry a little bit more quickly just because it's been, I think, a little scary for the Chinese consumers. So what is the biggest impediment, in your view, to really ramping up what you have going there in terms of the biosecurity protocols and the vertical integration? And then I guess, can we talk a little bit about the margin structure? Because I know you've said in the past that you're aiming for margins in that business to be in excess of what you experienced in North America. And if you could just talk about -- I think on a normalized basis, if you look at your current revenue base in the U.S. in the poultry business, normalized will be somewhere $600 million, $700 million, $800 million in total operating profit. Do you see China as that kind of opportunity over the next 5 years?","Donnie Smith","Diane, so let me go over the first part. You're absolutely correct, and I like your term \"the beleaguered consumer\" there. And remember, a lot of poultry consumers in China are still -- they are readily capable of moving back to a vegetable-based diet, and so that's what's happened. Now I do believe that there's increasing concern on the part of everybody on getting to a more biosecure supply chain, as well there should be. So we think that portends a great future for our business. That industry is very, very, very fragmented. The number of true integrated suppliers is an incredibly small percent of the poultry in that supply chain. There are still white bird versus yellow bird, pretty good disparity between the amount of white bird sold in the market versus yellow bird. So that market is pretty fragmented, and it's going to take several years for that industry to consolidate and integrate, but I believe it will because of the biosecurity concerns. So that portends well for our business. What hinders us is we're building chicken houses as fast as we can, and that frankly is our bottleneck. Our processing plants -- we've got 2 big beautiful processing plants. And our profitability, by the way, will improve dramatically when we are running those with company on birds at a much higher rate than we are today. Now let's talk about our margins. If you look forward, we'll probably be somewhere around $3 million head a week when we look out into the latter part of FY '14 and FY '15 and our plants will be full, and we expect, then, our margins to be above -- in a mature complex, we would expect our margins to be above the normalized range here in the U.S. Beef, think in low-double digits. Now also though, we do intend to grow our China poultry business fairly rapidly. And so you may not see a recognized double-digit margin continuously if we're bringing on new complexes because we're layering in, if you will, some efficiencies building for the future -- inefficiencies as we're building for the future. So -- but we do believe though that on a per bird basis, our customers in that region will pay for the added value and the added biosecurity and food safety and that type of thing that we provide. We are seeing our margins to wholesale in areas that we expect them to be. But I think maybe a lot of people underestimate currently the demand destruction in China. But I do believe, as I said little bit earlier, that will correct itself as soon as the number of cases quits going up. That help?","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","It does. Can I just ask a follow-up on the chicken house construction?","Donnie Smith","Sure.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that's a fairly specific question. Is the biggest bottleneck there the siting process, in other words, negotiating the rights to use the land? Is it your own construction capabilities? Is it training the people who are going to raise the birds? Or is it all 3 those?","Donnie Smith","You got really 2 things. Number one, the construction process, we can build the houses. There's plenty of folks over there, plenty of construction companies that can build the house. Obtaining the land use rights is a bit of a bottleneck. And then when we opened up a new farm site, which may have up to 8 to 10 chicken houses on it, we'll double staff that site, and then train the next, if you would, live production crew for the next farm site that will open. So we're handling our training issues. It does impact cost a little bit, not dramatically, but it does impact our cost a little bit. But the land use rights is the most difficult bottleneck.","Operator","Next question is Farha Aslam, Stephens.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","On just, first, continuing on Diane's question on China and Chicken. Could you just share with us, going into the second half of the year, how you think about Mexico versus China? Do you think the improvement year-over-year in Mexico profitability will offset kind of the level of weakness you're seeing in China?","Donnie Smith","Oh yes, definitely. Our Mexican operation is having a really good year. By the way, Brazil is profitable and doing very well, still pretty small but doing very well. So yes, that's -- what we were expecting to see was the China group being breakeven or profitable at the -- during our fourth quarter. Don't look like that's going to happen now, but we do believe Mexico and Brazil will be more than making up the gap.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just turning to Beef in the second half of the year again, do you expect it to reach your normalized margin levels for the second half of 2013?","James V. Lochner","Yes. We're clearly headed into that zone right now. And I expect it to be similar and maybe even a bit stronger than the back half last year, just because April started out so much better than a year ago. A year ago, April was a real tough segment in Beef. If you recall, we had some issues relative to the ground beef segment and overall demand. We're not facing that this year. The biggest obstacle we've had is cold weather and consumption. But that -- again, that seems to be turning around now. And we came through March and April in very good shape. That's why I'm very confident back end of the back half of -- or the second half of the year that we'll be very comparable or probably perhaps better. A lot of moving parts, but I certainly don't see any impediments on Beef. And then the strength, I think, I'm a little more encouraged with Japan going forward than I would have been a quarter ago because we were early into that game. So I'm seeing enough positive signs.","Operator","Next question, Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I went to a conference for the chicken industry a few weeks ago. And I thought that the message there was that the top chicken companies are making money right now, but the majority of the industry is not. I look at spot margins; it doesn't look quite that bad. It actually looks like everyone's doing pretty well. Can you give us a sense about your quarter and whether you think you were like in the top 1\/3 of performers or not, and whether you think that there's an increased probability that the bottom 1\/3 might be unable to increase production as the year goes on?","Donnie Smith","Rob, I -- as I look at industry benchmarking data, which we've participated in, I would tell you that the majority of the industry is making money. Probably 80% or so of the industry ought to be profitable, at least at the operating margin level. And we continue, and now for months and months, operate in the top quartile of the industry.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And a follow-up on China, maybe the ninth question asked. But you said that you chose not to invest in a noncore asset. Is -- what is a noncore asset in China? It's not your processing facilities. Is it something else?","Donnie Smith","We have a complex that, as we looked at it, in order to get that complex to, let's call it perform at a level that we would have been happy with, the capital required to do that was going to be better spent in other ways. So our team over there did a thorough analysis of what it was going to take to get this complex to a level that we would have been happy with it long term. And it just -- it felt like to us -- or it didn't feel like to us, the numbers showed us that money would have been better spent put into other areas, so that's what we chose to do. But when we did that, it forced us to take an impairment on that complex.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But Donnie, is it -- what kind of complex is it? Is it 1 of these 2 big processing facilities? Or is it something else?","Donnie Smith","No, it's an older complex.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","An older complex. Okay, are you going to shut it down? Or are you going to keep operating?","Donnie Smith","Too early to say. Undetermined at this time. We're working through all of our options.","Operator","Next question is Akshay Jagdale, KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So Donnie, just looking at where you are today versus 3 months ago, your grain cost guidance is roughly $0.26 to EPS better than before. Boneless, skinless breast prices, if I'm not wrong, are the highest they've been since '04. And Chicken makes up 50% of your business. And so isn't the year shaping up net-net to be better even though you had a weaker quarter? That's the first question. And to elaborate on that, can you just be more specific about this quarter being off to a good start?","Donnie Smith","Yes. So the answer to your first part of your question is, yes, very much so. If you look at our quarter on an adjusted basis, year-to-date, we've absorbed $335 million in incremental feed ingredient cost. And I think on an adjusted basis, we're probably...","Dennis Leatherby","$241 million year-to-date.","Donnie Smith","$241 million year-to-date. So $64 million better than the runway from a year ago on an adjusted basis. So that's -- in my opinion, that's really, really good. We're taking a lot of momentum into the back half of our year. Pricing feels good now. We're not a commodity player, but we do have features and lots of things that price off higher commodity market. So in a summertime kind of environment, we may not ever get to the high of pure commodity players, but you also won't see the lows during the other parts of the year either. But, yes, Akshay, I think, you've got a good read on it. We've got a great back half lined up. And when I say we're off to a really good start, what I'm talking about is that our margin structure is better than what we planned it would be going into this year. We've been saying since, well, since a month after the -- our last call when we started talking about Q2 being a little tougher than we thought, we've been talking about a strong back half since then, and our margin structures came in a little better than that. So we feel really good.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So where is -- and just to follow up on that, where are Chicken margins today?","Donnie Smith","I can't answer that, but they are better than we planned.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just again, on the Chicken business, I mean, it was a good quarter. But what I'm seeing, and maybe I'm just reading this incorrectly, is the revenue per pound sequentially was not as good as it typically is. So one, am I reading that correctly? And two, was -- can you explain what might be going on there? I mean, from the December to the March quarter, typically your revenue per pound goes up a little bit more than it did this quarter.","Donnie Smith","Yes, you are reading that correctly. And here's the deal. There's been a mix change, with the economy being a little softer, we've seen our mix change more chopped and formed than whole muscle, what we would normally see. And so that mix change, the products sell for cheaper, but don't think that translates necessarily into the cost -- into the margin structure because it doesn't. So while our revenue per pound is down, our margin per pound is not. It's just a mix change to a more chopped and formed basis. And also, too, although we've had significant pricing improvements in our fresh business, our fresh items, which might not carry the same revenue per pound as further process, fully cooked, whole muscle breast item, for example, still, we're running a great business there. And so the revenue per pound might not be up but our margin structure is really good. So I'm very happy there.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And one just last one on Beef, if I may for Jim. So you said you are tracking in your normalized range right now for Beef. So should we assume that even if the cutout remains in the 180, mid-180s, high-180s on Beef, you'll still be able to do as good or better than last year?","James V. Lochner","In Feb, we thought the back half would track there. And if the cutout corrects because of any demand issues, which I don't anticipate we're going to see that degree of correction. But if it does, you're coming in at the time of the year with the most plentiful supply. So you get the price of Beef to the price of cattle relationship, this is the best time of the year to be doing that with the supply coming at. So the cutout will be, as it always is, really a function of what the consumption is against the weekly supply. And that's why we really pay such close attention to what meat is disappearing and try to keep our offering as -- in balance with what we have within our plants and what we see our cattle supply and what we see the beef supply or beef demand and consumption going forward. But this is the time of the year generally and historically, if you look back, this back half is usually our -- the Beef packing's strongest time frame. So even if the price pressure is on there, I think we'll get back into -- in the back half approach what I said on normalized, or get within normal.","Operator","Next question is Tim Tiberio, Miller Tabak.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Just a very quick question on Brazil. You're mentioning that results are performing very well there. Does this give you more confidence to maybe accelerate your investment in that market, especially as feed costs are falling a little bit quicker than even in North America on the soy mill side?","Donnie Smith","Yes. And one of our emphasis there is growing our value-added sales. So yes, very much. We're happy with our Brazilian assets and are going to grow them.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just one last follow-up question. In lunchmeat section, you mentioned that there was some cost pressures because of new ramp in the facility, but are you also seeing any increased competition that would be impacting those results that we should be aware of?","Donnie Smith","Not so much. Our lunchmeat issues are wholly our own. We're spending a lot of money down in Houston getting that facility to a point that we need it to be. And when you're going to have an extended shutdown to change a lot of equipment out, we're having product co-packed and working through all the supply-chain issues to make sure we take care of our customers and all that. And that adds quite a bit of cost into the supply chain. We'll work through all that over the next 4, 5, 6 months. And we think by the time we get into Q1 of '14, our lunchmeat business is going to be operating where it needs to.","Operator","The next question is Ken Zaslow, Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Let me ask, in terms of 2014, do you think that the back half of 2013 is more representative of what you're going to be able to produce in 2014? Is there any businesses that you don't think will be in the normalized range?","Donnie Smith","The answer is yes and no.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So no, you don't think there'll be any businesses that will not be normalized range in 2014?","Donnie Smith","That's correct. And I do think that the back half of '13 is indicative of the kind of performance that we should certainly carry into '14 and probably sustain. Now you know, Ken, you know all of the fundamental issues and corn crop and all that stuff. But what we can see, there we go.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Great. In Prepared Foods, you kind of gave a little representation of what in Beef is being corrected. You continue to say that there's going to be a drag on Prepared Foods. Can you give a quantification of what that actually is?","Donnie Smith","Say that again? I missed your question.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","You said that in Prepared Foods that there is a drag on the earnings in the back half of this year from last quarter to this quarter and continuing on for, we don't how many quarters, but for a period of time. How much is that? And when will that go away?","Donnie Smith","Well, hard to quantify because our team is busy minimizing that impact as we speak. But I can tell you in the Prepared Foods, there's 2 things that are really impacting that segment. Number one and the biggest majority of it is our lunchmeat business, which we're working on. Number two is we had pretty soft foodservice demand in Q2. And it felt particularly heavy in our Prepared Foods business. Now we've got an -- a lot of new products that we're working on and a lot of things we're doing there. I tend to think that, I would say -- I tend to think that our Prepared Foods group will perform a little bit better in 3 and 4 than it did in 1 and 2. When we went through our quarter, I told them to quit digging a hole, and I think we're there. But it may -- as we start into the quarter, it -- I think they're just now at the point to where they're getting the grip on the rope like we need them to. So I think the worst is over there, but I don't think we're going to fill in the hole very much in the back half.","James V. Lochner","Now the big change is in Houston as we modernize that. But the other lunchmeat plants in that group have also added some new modern equipment to improve yields and labor efficiencies. We really just needed to get more equipment, get -- to get our sales more efficient and improve our yield and improve our overall quality. So that also applies to a less dramatic way in the other plants other than Houston. So I expect, like Donnie, to improve into this back half.","Operator","Our final question comes from Ann Gurkin, Davenport.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to review a question with the outlook now for a 1% increase in domestic protein and from discussion of global demand and domestic demand, maybe a little softer for different protein classes and now looking for Chicken production up 2% to 3% and Pork exports down. Can you just walk through what is the biggest driver giving you the confidence to maintain guidance for '13, look for '13 to grow modestly maybe versus '12?","James V. Lochner","Let me start. And that still boils back down to what we've seen in the perishable data and other sets where beef consumption has been dropping, which has put price pressure generally on the wholesale cuts but not necessarily at the retail. So that's been the strength of chicken's demand. And I don't know that I agree with, personally, some of the forecast I saw on the overall because they're all predicated on exports being down. I don't particularly see chicken exports declining going forward. And I think pork decline in exports has already been built in. So -- and I believe we've seen those wholesale prices adjust. So in other words, I think the beef-chickens switch has happened, and that will continue to support the Chicken segment.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","So the Chicken -- the outlook for the Chicken segment, what gives you really great confidence for the year?","James V. Lochner","Yes, that and the fact that if you look at the infrastructure, the pullet placements and the ability to rebound supply quickly, it isn't in there. And you look at the egg sets to hatch, the egg sets to hatch and you're seeing more aged hens and less productivity as well. So you're seeing enough signs that the supply chain will struggle to keep up. And even though the -- again, the real wildcard has been on the pork exports but I think that's largely built in.","Donnie Smith","Before we I go, I just want to reemphasize that we're still on track for an adjusted EPS that exceeds last year's. For the first half of the year, we're at $0.84 adjusted versus $0.86 last year, and we've done that with an incremental $335 million in feed costs. Tyson Foods is on pace for another very good year. So I want to thank you all for joining us today, and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference.

On today's call are Donnie Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dennis Leatherby, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our remarks today include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

I encourage you to read the news release issued earlier this morning and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of the risks that can affect our business.","Because of our Annual Meeting of Shareholders takes place this morning, we'll need to end the call at the top of the hour to get to the meeting on time.

If you have additional questions, please get back in the queue and we'll get to as many of you as we can before we have to go.","I'll now turn the call over to Donnie Smith.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Fiscal 2016 is off to a great start with record EPS of $1.15, up 49% over Q1 of 2015's adjusted results. All of our segments performed very well with Prepared Foods and Chicken producing record operating income for the quarter, Pork had its second best quarter ever, while Beef showed significant improvement over Q4 of 2015 and Q1 of 2015.","In total, we produced record operating income of $776 million, up 38% over Q1 of last year. We had a record operating margin of 8.5% and record operating cash flows of $1.1 billion. Revenues were down due to the deflationary environment of the raw materials, and the divestiture of a few non-core businesses. Excluding the divestitures, sales volume was down just over 1% in Q1 as we sold more higher-margin value-added products, upgraded our mix to more profitable sales and processed fewer cattle. We're very pleased with the total synergies, capturing $121 million in Q1, $61 million was incremental to Q1 last year, and we're on track to achieve more than $500 million this fiscal year. These synergies are a major source of funds for Prepared Foods growth.","In the Prepared Foods segment, operating income was $207 million with a 10.9% return on sales, which was a record. Returns benefited primarily from declining raw materials and synergy capture. Volume for the quarter was down 7.7% with pricing lower by 3.6%. The lower volume was a result of optimizing the sales mix by reducing private label products at retail and to a lesser extent, the impact of avian influenza on our turkey lunchmeat business and a slower than planned price reduction reflected on retail shelves.","For the balance of fiscal 2016, we anticipate continued savings on raw materials as well as synergy capture and we'll invest a good portion of these savings into pricing, innovation and brand building. Our margin outlook for Prepared Foods is near the low end of the 10% to 12% range.","The Chicken segment produced record operating income of $358 million with a record 13.6% return on sales. Volume for the quarter was down 0.5% with 4.7% lower pricing. The slight sales volume decline in Chicken again is a reflection of upgrading our mix. Results in the Chicken segment can be chalked up to solid execution. We're outperforming the industry and widening the gap.","I believe we've demonstrated separation from the commodity players in large part due to the disproportionately high mix of value-added products in our portfolio as well as the production flexibility created with our buy versus grow strategy, which also reduces commodity exposure. Remember on the last call, I broke out the categories of how we sell chicken and only 15% is pure commodity. As we continue to grow our value-added sales, produce less than we sell, execute extremely well and gain some benefit from lower grain costs, we now expect the Chicken segment margin to improve to more than 11% for the year, up from our previous estimate of more than 10%.","In the Beef segment, operating income was $71 million with a 2% return on sales. Volume for the quarter was down 3.8%, while price was down 14.4%. Volume was down due to the Denison plant closure. Retail pricing has declined significantly, but Beef is still expensive for consumers with the beef-to-pork and the beef-to-chicken price ratios at record levels. I'm pleased with the turnaround from the losses we sustained in Q4. Some of the improvement can be attributed to the mark-to-market and LCM from Q4. We've got about half of it back in Q1, and the remainder will come over the next year or so. Better cattle supplies in Q1 coupled with the realignment of our Denison and Dakota City plants moderately improved our capacity utilization.","We feel good about our Beef business and the team is executing very well. Cattle supplies appear to be growing and the recent semi-annual cattle on feed report indicated that total inventory is up 3.2% over the previous year. However, there is still regional disparity in the location of the cattle. Q2 can be a little uneven due to the weather and consumption around lent. So, we're going to remain conservative with our guidance of an operating margin at or above the low end of 1.5% to 3% normalized range. I'll add that I'm pleased about the repeal of mCOOL. Our contention was that it added incremental cost with no real consumer benefit and now that it's been repealed, we're able to reduce the complexity of our business by eliminating around 800 SKUs.","In the Pork segment, operating income was $158 million with a 13% return on sales. Volume was down 2.2% with pricing down 19.5%. Volume was down due to the divestiture of our Heinold Hog Markets business in Q1 of last year. Excluding this, Pork volume was up 5.5%. There were plenty of hogs on the market in Q1, which lowered our hog cost as well as our average selling price. With more hogs, we improved capacity utilization, which helped widen the margin spread and Prepared Foods segment benefits from lower pork raw material prices as well.","We expect hog industry supplies to be up around 2% to 3% for the fiscal year, so we should be able to continue with good capacity utilization. We haven't seen any significant improvement in export markets. However, domestic pork demand is good. With near-record results in Q1, we are increasing our Pork segment outlook for the fiscal year, which should produce returns above 8%.","Now let's move from the segments to our view of consumer demand. Lower gas prices and unemployment at the lowest level since 2008 are translating into some growth into the perimeter of the grocery store and more consumer spending on eating away from home. With the diversity of our portfolio, we're prepared to respond to these shifting consumer behaviors. In the last three months, foodservice traffic was up 1% while check size was up 2%. While we play across all areas of foodservice, we're especially well aligned with the categories in the national food service chains that are showing the most growth.","On the retail side, overall grocery trips are down, but shoppers are spending more on our Core 9 product lines compared to total food and beverage and overall packaged meats. This is important because our Core 9 product lines are the primary drivers of sales and profitability within our package retail offering and includes brands like Jimmy Dean, Tyson, Hillshire Farm, Ball Park and Aidells.","I'd like to talk a little more about volumes, specifically at retail, and what you might be seeing reported by Nielsen and IRI. Although the top-10 branded food companies, including us, lost volume in calendar year 2015, our Core 9 product lines grew 1.2%. We are now seeing the price investments we've made begin to take hold as sales volume was up 2% in the latest 12-week period, but accelerated to a 4% increase in the latest four-week comparison.","I also want to point out that the Core 9 product lines in aggregate grew in Q1 ahead of the categories. In total, our share of these categories was up and where our leading brands grew the most, the categories performed the best. Additionally, our volume growth improved through the quarter and on into January. I feel really good about our retail brand and expect to see the recent trends continue for the remainder of the year as we see the full impact from pricing, recovery from AI and strong brand support.","So all that's to say, a volume decline at the total Tyson level isn't indicative of the health of our business. And I think the overall returns we delivered this quarter and the optimism around our outlook, give us confidence for another record-setting year, which is why we're raising our fiscal 2016 EPS guidance by $0.35 on the low end to $3.85 to $3.95. We have a consumer-relevant portfolio packed with advantaged brands in advantaged categories. We have a superior supply chain. We have a high-performing team focused on execution. I like the position Tyson Foods is in, I like where we're headed and I like the momentum that's building towards fiscal 2017.","Dennis?","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Donnie, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2016 is off to a phenomenal start. We've been repeating over the past several years the value in our diversified portfolio, which has been evident in strong steady returns. With our first quarter results, you can see our earnings potential when all segments perform well and finish within or above their normalized ranges.","With record EPS, record operating income and record operating cash flows, we were able to repurchase 6.4 million shares for $300 million in Q1. So far, through the second quarter of this year, we've repurchased 3.9 million shares for $200 million. In total, over the past seven months, we have now repurchased 16.2 million shares for $750 million. I'm also pleased to announce that yesterday our board of directors increased the shares authorized for repurchase under this program by 50 million shares, underscoring our commitment to continue returning cash to shareholders.","First quarter revenues were $9.2 billion, which is a decrease of 15% from Q1 a year ago due to significant declines in beef, pork, and feed prices. Sales volumes declined 7% as reported. However, when excluding the divestitures of the Brazil and Mexico Chicken operations and the Heinold Hog Markets business, our total company sales volume decreased 1%. Despite this small decline in volume, we are continuing to execute our strategy of growing in value-added categories, which is evident in our first quarter results.","Total company return on sales was a record 8.5%. Operating income was a record $776 million, representing a 38% increase over adjusted operating income from Q1 a year ago. Our record earnings of $1.15 per share represents a 49% increase over $0.77 adjusted earnings per share in Q1 last year. I would also like to note that on an adjusted basis, our last 12 months EPS is $3.53. Our operating cash flow for the first quarter was a record $1.1 billion and we spent $188 million on capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $37 million as we continued to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 35.2%, net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.7 times, and on a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis, this measure was 2.1 times.","Including cash of $1.2 billion, net debt was $5.5 billion. Total liquidity was over $2.4 billion, significantly above our goal of $1.2 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the first quarter was enhanced by cash held for payments to livestock producers deferred to calendar 2016, as well as cash held for the retirement of $638 million in notes coming due in the second quarter. When these notes are retired, we will have paid down $2.4 billion of gross debt since the acquisition of Hillshire in August 2014. Our rapid leverage reduction in only 19 months reflects our commitment to maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. Net interest expense was $65 million during Q1. For the quarter, our diluted shares outstanding were 400 million.","Now, here are some additional thoughts on fiscal 2016. We now expect revenues of approximately $37 billion, which includes the impact of fiscal 2015 divestitures and expected declines in beef, pork and feed prices. We expect to capture more than $500 million of synergies in fiscal 2016, which includes more than $200 million of incremental synergies over fiscal 2015 from our Prepared Foods' profit improvement initiatives and Hillshire Brands synergies. Net interest expense should approximate $245 million. We currently estimate our effective tax rate to be around 35%. CapEx is expected to be $900 million as we continue to focus on projects that will create long-term shareholder value. Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases subsequent to this call and based on our average share price in Q1, we expect our diluted shares to be around 394 million.","As we've demonstrated, our capital allocation priorities are governed by our disciplined focus on driving long-term shareholder value. Our priorities for deploying the significant cash flows that our operations generate are for: growing our businesses organically through operational efficiency and capital expansion projects, along with investing in innovation and brand building; acquiring businesses that support our strategic objectives; and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, all while maintaining plenty of liquidity, investment-grade ratings and continuing to expand our debt capacity.","In closing, our Q2 should beat last year but will be less than Q1 due to our typical seasonality. And third quarter and fourth quarters are expected to be strong. As mentioned in this morning's release, we are raising our EPS guidance range to $3.85 to $3.95 for fiscal 2016, up from $3.50 to $3.65. This represents a four-year EPS compounded annual growth rate of more than 18% annually. With each of our segments demonstrating tremendous overall performance, we view Q1 not as an exception, but as a new foundation, which provides momentum for our continued growth.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready to begin Q&A. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Mr. Brett Hundley from BB&T Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open.","Brett Michael Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets","Morning. Congratulations on what you've put together here.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Brett.","Brett Michael Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets","Donnie, one question for you. A number of packaged food companies, both large and small we've seen, have talked this earnings season about the macro becoming more challenging. Snacking has been one area highlighted in particular, and then conversely it looks like U.S. frozen categories seem to be improving some. Companies are also talking without the need to up brand support spend, in an effort to contain volume deterioration. Your Prepared Foods volumes were down in the quarter, but you talked to the reasons behind that. Your profitability was solid.","Can you give us your view of the packaged foods macro? You touched on it in your prepared remarks. But can you give us your view of the prepared packaged foods macro from your vantage point? And within this question, can you specifically address this Core 9 effort that you're talking about this morning? And how Core 9 insulates you, not only within the broader macro, but also within packaged meats specifically?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Brett. I'm going to try to take that like from snacking through frozen into the Core 9 to kind of give you the full feel. So, not all snacking is created equal, right? What continues to grow in the snacking category is protein snacking. If I've got my numbers right, total snacking is probably growing at around 6% or so year-over-year, and as you know that's a major focus for us in our innovation this year. Looking on into the frozen categories, breakfast and value-added poultry are two categories that are growing faster than total frozen and total food and beverage, and that's our key focus. But also if you look at 84% of the refrigerated categories in which we compete are growing, and then 87% of the fresh categories in which we compete are growing and it really reinforces our statement around having advantaged brands in advantaged categories.","So now, let me loop over into the Core 9. So, if you look at the Core 9 brands, or product lines really, those are so important because that's where we have the greatest value potential over the long term. Within the Core, we have the highest growth potential, we've probably got the strongest position with both consumers and customers and great margins. So, that's why we focus on what we call the Core 9 and we spelled those out in the last call because they are categories in which are growing faster than other refrigerated meats and faster than total food and beverage over the long term. And then we have advantaged positions within those categories.","Brett Michael Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets","Very clear. Thank you. And then Dennis, I just had a follow-up question on liquidity, use of cash. You touched on it there at the end. You're driving really strong cash flow right now, you do traditionally anyway. Your debt is in a very manageable position. You talked about the notes in April. But getting outside of that, you've been choosing to repurchase a lot of shares here. And can you give us any insight into this strategy? Why the heavy share repurchase now and you talked about some of your priorities for cash, but how might your priorities for cash change in months and quarters ahead? Thanks for taking my questions.","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thank you, Brett. As I said in my remarks, we do have $638 million notes coming due. We'll pay that off. We have more than $300 million in cattle and hog deferrals that we've already paid off. But you're right, we're throwing off a lot of cash, and it leaves us a lot of options. As we've been saying for the last year or so, we wanted to put ourselves in kind of an enviable position in that we wanted to maintain investment-grade ratings. We wanted to keep really strong debt capacity for M&A, which we do and we have lots of capacity for M&A. And in the absence of that, if the right target doesn't come along that fits our strategy, then we're going to return cash to shareholders while still growing organically through capacity expansion projects and investing heavily in our brands and innovation. So, we really like where we're at and you can see us continue with that.","Brett Michael Hundley - BB&T Capital Markets","Thanks, guys.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Farha Aslam from Stephens, Inc. Sir, your line is now open.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Congratulations on a great quarter.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","I have a question on poultry. Your poultry margins were exceptional this quarter, and you spoke constructively about your outlook. Could you just give us a little bit more color about your thoughts around the second quarter? That is seasonally a bit weaker in poultry, but the macro trends around poultry are getting better. Should we think your margins for the rest of the year, you're being very conservative with your 11% guidance?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, we feel great about the second quarter. We're off to a good start. If I look at our mix, we continue to improve our value-added mix. We've got a lot of capacity to continue to grow in those areas. That gives me a lot of optimism to continue with a favorable outlook. It feels like to me that the categories, retail frozen is certainly growing. The retail frozen poultry is growing faster than frozen, and certainly that category is growing faster than food and beverage, and it feels like that we've fully overcome problems we had in the past, and that we are back in business and growing.","Our volume has been good in January. So, feel good about that. And as I look forward, there's a couple of things that we still want to see. While we have quite a bit of a grain book, we don't have it all, so it's hard to paint the full picture for the year, but I do believe that the changes we've made in the portfolio, the changes we've made in the pricing strategy, certainly the advantages that our supply chain gives us are creating a long-term view of much more consistent stable earnings in our poultry business and in Prepared Foods and other parts of the business.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","So kind of conservative you'd say, given the strong start in the second quarter?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I like where we are, and we're off to a good start.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. And then a follow up perhaps for Dennis, you had \u2013 and Brett's question answers your desire to repurchase shares. Could you share with us a little bit more color on M&A? And your outlook of what you're seeing in the market right now?","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Farha, I understand why you'd want to ask the question, but you know we can't comment on M&A.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's fair. Just in terms of longer-term kind of areas of interest where you would look to build Tyson's position in terms of M&A in particular, if there's areas of interest?","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Farha. I mean, value added poultry and Prepared Foods international growth, those are the areas that we intend to focus on continuing to grow our branded presence here and internationally, that's the focus of our strategy going forward.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning and congratulations on the quarter.","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, David.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Question on \u2013 good morning. The Beef segment, that was particularly impressive to us given the fact that you're perhaps entering a cycle there. How are you thinking about \u2013 perhaps go back and talk about how that margin happened with as much detail as you can? And how are you now thinking about the long-term of that differently? Is the long-term future for that business really one where you're going to be bouncing around the low end of \u2013 low single digits? Or perhaps can we think about that being a healthier margin business going forward? Thanks.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So let's talk a little bit about the quarter. So if you go back as far as Q3 when the feedlots started extending the turns, if you will, and keeping cattle in the feedlot longer, coupled with the heifer retention and the reduction in cow slaughter that we saw as the beginning parts of the supply chain and the cow-calf operator began the effort to expand the herd, cattle supply dried up and strained margins.","So as we moved out of Q4 into Q1 \u2013 there was some regional disparity. But overall, the feedlots began to market those cattle and become more current, if you will, with the inventory they have in the feedlots. That provided us the supply we needed to be able to improve our margins. Plus if you'll remember back at the end of Q4, right in the last couple weeks or so of the quarter, we had a lower of cost or market adjustment and a mark to market adjustment that we made. And so we got about half of that back in Q1.","Now the rest of that will keep coming back to us as we progress on through the year because you had beef sold out front and then you bought live cattle futures against it to hedge it. So put all that together, we're kind of in the \u2013 well, we were at 2%, sort of towards the low end or getting towards the middle of that range. As we look forward, Q2 is always a tough quarter for us. You've got a lot of weather issues around as we're seeing this week up in the Midwest. Lent is kind of a low demand period for beef particularly. So I want to see us get through that, but then it feels like that after Easter, should see cattle supply improving, and the back half ought to improve. So, I think longer-term our beef margins should stay within that 1.5% to 3% range. Feel good about that.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So this is really about the capacity utilization side? And I know you have some easier comparisons in Q3, but I'm just wondering longer-term if these margins can be built upon and maintained? Is there anything about these recent developments that make you think significantly different about the longer-term for beef?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, David. So I guess my headline would be, look, the worst is over in terms of the cattle supply. We expect \u2013 I don't know \u2013 3%, 3.5% cattle supply increase in the back half of the year, and you should see \u2013 it's a little bit hard to tell at the very beginning of a herd rebuild, but you should see something on the order of 1% to 2% more fed cattle available per year I think for the next 2 years, 3 years. And so as the supply of cattle improves then we should see our margins improve as well. So that's the reason for the confidence in our outlook that Q1 is not an aberration. Now remember, Q2 is going to be Q2, but looking at it over the year, I'm comfortable that we should be in the range \u2013 the 1.5% to 3%.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line now open.","Adam L. Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning.","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Adam L. Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I want to pick up on something, Dennis, that was at the end of your prepared remarks. You talked about this quarter being a new foundation for future performance, rather than a peak. And I wanted to maybe follow-up on Farha's question a little bit on the Chicken business in particular, because the margins here are very strong and now running well above your normalized range of 7% to 9%. And I'm trying to think about what would be the drivers of margins going back to that normalized range if you remain confident on the value-added mix and the operating momentum that you have. and maybe think about that trajectory a little bit? Thank you.","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Great question. We feel very good about our Chicken business. It's really set up well. It's largely a pull business, from 85%, 90% pull business. We've got our mix set up straight. We are in the position where we can grow even more, especially in the further processing side, take advantage of oversupply situations where we can buy meat really cheap, put a nice spread on it. So \u2013 and our Tray Pack business, with the conversion of our plant in South Georgia, is really starting to take off at an even higher level. And we're just going to continue to improve our value-added mix over time.","Adam L. Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. That's very helpful. And then maybe going on to this Core 9 concept. And A, I was hoping, can you talk about how much of Prepared Foods and Chicken actually \u2013 sales are driven by the Core 9 at this point? And then second, maybe a little bit more color by categories and areas of inflection that you've seen off late. Sausage in particular I think, has improved in the last couple scanner periods, but a little more detail by category. Thanks.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Sure. So when we look at our Core 9, I'm just going to run through that real quick, We're really talking about Hillshire Farm Smoked Sausage, Aidells Smoked Sausage, Hillshire Farm lunchmeat, Jimmy Dean frozen breakfast, Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage, and then our core branded bacon, then Ball Park hot dogs, our retail value-added poultry, and then State Fair and Ball Park corn dogs. So those are what we call the Core 9 where we have the disproportionate ability to grow faster than the categories, and they're very meaningful categories.","So if I look \u2013 and what we've really been focused on is the recent trends in our volume versus the category volume. I think I mentioned in my comments, I think I said this, that we were a little bit slow in seeing the price declines reflected at retail. And now, through the last four weeks or so, we've pretty much seen the pricing get reflected on the retail shelf, and volume is responding. If I looked at say smoked sausage, in the last four weeks, our volume growth is up 4% versus \u2013 that's the last four weeks versus 2% for the 52 week and 2% for the 12 weeks. And last week it was up double-digits like 10% or so.","If I look at Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage, for example, we're up 2% in the latest 52 weeks, but 11% in the latest four-week comparison, and that's what we've been looking for to see momentum in volume as we see the price reflected on the shelf.","So we feel really good about the core of our business. Also one on hot dogs real quick, we did see a little bit of impact I think from the IARC announcement in hot dogs, but we are seeing a response there. We feel great about the brand support for the summer grilling season and we're really, really anticipating a very, very strong grilling season this year. So feel great about that. Hope that helps.","Adam L. Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great color. Thanks very much.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet.","Operator","And the next question comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is now open.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody. When I look at retail margins on chicken, beef, and pork, at least as implied by USDA data, they're very strong right now, kind of across the board, and we're seeing some indication, I guess, of minor slippage in those retail prices but not a whole lot. So I'm curious from your perspective, what are your expectations for meat prices on shelf going forward. Are you seeing any indication they'll really start to fall further from here which could help your volumes going ahead?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's hard, it's really hard during this time of the year to get your best feel for what retail meat prices are going to do through the year because next week we're going to enter into Lent, and it's just a difficult season to predict prices. But if you just look at the macro fundamentals, right, we've got the lowest unemployment we've had since 2008, we got really cheap gas prices, and that is returning disposable income to the consumer, and we are seeing traffic up a little bit at food service, not a lot, and we're not expecting a whole lot. But we are seeing a movement to the perimeter of the store which is where we have great strength.","So I'm optimistic that the consumer will respond well to what should be fairly favorable prices. If you look at the supply of cattle coming to market, supply of hogs coming to market, supply of chickens in the market, you should have reasonable pricing structures, and certainly pricing structures that would allow us to continue to flourish, so.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then my other question is you are guiding to a pretty significantly bigger benefit from feed cost than you did three months ago, I think. But as I look at corn and meal, I'm not seeing much of a change over that time in spot or futures prices. I mean, there's some, but not a huge amount. So maybe you talked about this and I missed it, but I'm just curious what's driving this degree of change in your outlook for feed?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we had about a \u2013 I think, it was round numbers, wasn't it, Dennis, $100 million change from...","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","\u2013 from our previous quarter's guidance to this one. And it just reflect \u2013 if you look at just corn futures all Q1 long, and I think meal futures too, the market just continued to decrease. We stayed really short and were able to just basically buy it as we ship it, or price it as we ship it. And that's allowed us to have a cheaper cost structure. And when we talk about, by the way, our outlook, we're talking about what's in cost of goods. So we feel good about how our year is going to shape out. We've got quite a bit, not all but enough to feel very comfortable about our cost structure in chicken already priced throughout the year. So feel good about that.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you so much.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mr. Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is now open.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. One of the reasons I've been skeptical on Tyson and maybe others too, and obviously very wrong, is that there's the thinking that the chicken cycle would end up turning and hurting the business. But you're seeing two things this year in your guidance, or I am, is your feed costs are better, so that's a reason to take up the number. But you're obviously benefiting from the lower chicken cost commodities as well. Can you give us a little bit of a more color on the extent to which the lower commodity chicken cost helped you in the quarter, and how that is factored into your guidance for the year? Thanks.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Rob, I'd add \u2013 you know, not knowing what chicken prices are going to do for the rest of the year, it'd be hard to quantify it for the year. But I can give you a very good feel. During Q1, we probably bought on the order of 75 loads a week of poultry raw materials, maybe more than that. But say round number is that, and we're buying that meat well below a dollar instead of selling it well below the dollar. Plus with our buy versus grow strategy, we don't have that excess leg quarters, so we are selling fewer leg quarters today, and I've been here a long time. I can't ever remember us selling fewer leg quarters than we are today.","And the buy versus grow certainly plays a part of that, but with great innovative capabilities, we're finding ways to upgrade that raw material into value-added high-margin opportunities, and that's a real key. So when you combine the strength of our value-added portfolio, the strength of our brands both at fresh and frozen, when you look at the diversity of the portfolio between small bird and value-added and fresh, and then you combine that with this great marketing and innovation engine that we've got, it really does help stabilize the earnings of our Chicken business over time. It's not the same Chicken business that it was a few years ago.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yep. That's very clear. And then a follow-up on Prepared Foods and the Core 9. I guess your guidance really hasn't changed that much even though as you said the volumes are starting to improve on your Core 9. Are you expecting volume growth in the Prepared Foods segment for the rest of the year? Can we expect to see a very strong volume number in second quarter? Or is it going to be kind of negative for a while and then eventually kind of lap the challenges in turkey in the back half?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, you should expect growth. We are very intent. And obviously with the raw materials where they are, with synergy capture we have, we have the dry powder, we need to get the pricing right, to drive growth, to support these brands to drive growth. We have, matter of fact, we're preaching our investment in innovation to be able to drive long-term growth in these brands.","And the early read \u2013 during November and December, frankly, we didn't get the price realization on the shelf that we needed to, to drive volume. During the month of January, the pricing gaps were reflected on the shelf and we saw the volume response that we were looking for. So I feel great about our growth going forward for the year. We have advantaged brands and advantaged categories, and we fully intend to take advantage of that because that's what the consumer wants us to do. And you're right, we will be lapping the AI problems. We've got to get some points of distribution back, but we've got a great sales team working on that. We continue to improve the mix. One of the volume issues in Q1 was that we didn't repeat some private label volume and frankly it's like \u2013 I don't know \u2013 spiral sliced hams and private-label bacon, and we just have so much more opportunity in branded consumer pull categories that it was the right thing to do for our business and for the customer to not repeat those very low, if not negative margin private-label sales and improve that into a \u2013 but as you can tell...","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, Donnie, I get all that. But your sales down 11% in first quarter, if you can help us model out what you think the sales growth for Prepared Foods this year? Are you still down because of the private-label decisions? Or are you going to go back to positive pretty quickly here?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I think, no, you're going to see positive sales growth as well, absolutely. We got to get the volume to support the lower pricing to get the total dollars up. But yeah, we're headed that way.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sorry. I misunderstood your question.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, and congratulations on a really outstanding quarter.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Akshay.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","So let me ask about the chicken margin sustainability in a different way as well. Obviously you outperformed what the commodity markets did in our estimates by about 1,000 basis points. So I think what I'm seeing is, and just help me if I'm wrong here or if I'm reading it incorrectly, but relative to the market your portfolio is more stable, higher-margin products and that's starting to play through on the revenue line. And clearly this quarter we saw that. Right? And I think what we're seeing clearly is your big bird segment, if I may, where you're taking a lot of this cheap meat out of the big bird plants and adding value to it, that's been a great strategy.","So my question really is more on the retail tray pack side of your business and potentially on the small bird side. Can you talk about the sustainability of the margins on those two sort of subcategories? Like a lot of people think your Tray Pack business is not as \u2013 it can't maintain these margins at these levels if supply increases, right. So if you look at three segments for the chicken market, it seems to me that whatever supply increase has been coming into the market, it's been on the big bird side. So what happens if and when the retail tray pack supply industrywide increases? What does that do to your margin structure? And then similarly on the small bird. I mean, I know, it's not happening right now, right? We know that there's no new capacity coming in on those two segments, but just help me think through that for a second?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, sure. So first of all, as evidenced in South Georgia, we have the flexibility within our supply chain to move our mix to where the consumer is going. If you look at a macro view, although recent volumes \u2013 because at fresh, for example, because you've got so much pork, price is way down and pork demand is up, but in general, remembering that Chicken is twice the size of the category of Beef or Pork, Chicken demand is really good. And it over indexes to the Millennials, as they enter the workplace and begin in earnest consuming food.","So we feel great about the macro trends and where they're leading us. We have the flexibility within our supply chain to move within small bird, fresh, whatever we might do. Certainly it's not in our business model to oversupply big bird. We'd rather buy that meat and add value to it, as you mentioned.","The thing about our business to remember is we've got the number one fresh brand at retail, we've got great penetration across a broad segment of customers nationally, and we have phenomenal quality, service and innovation. So I feel good that we will remain the leading fresh supplier as we move out front, whether it's a small bird into the retail deli or fast food cut-up, or whether it's at retail. Plus we've got a lot of innovation that we can continue to innovate in these fresh categories, and our customers rely on that. So I think that is a big portion of what stabilizes our fresh Chicken business, if you will, for the future.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just on Prepared Foods, how much of the revenue guidance cut is related to, let's say, the Prepared Foods business not doing as well as you thought previously? And then your margin guidance on Prepared Foods, although pretty solid in light of the $250 million commodity tailwind and the roughly $200 million incremental synergies seems a bit light. I think what it means is you're spending or planning on spending a lot of money on brand building. But why do that when sort of volumes, if you look historically last 12 weeks or so, haven't been as robust?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. So, I'm going to start kind of at the back end and work my way back up, is that the reasons the volumes haven't been as robust as we want them to be in our Prepared Foods, there's really two things in that. Number one, it depends on your view of everything that you look at in Nielsen or IRI about our data. Because there's two categories that if you do kind of a macro view of everything, Tyson and IRI, you've got two categories in there that would be IF chicken and then the UPC ground beef chubs also show up. So the one and three-pound rolls of ground beef, which is a huge portion by the way of the volume decline or a huge proportion of the volume decline, that meat is going fresh. And frankly for us, if the consumer would rather have that breast meat in a fresh tray versus having it in an IQF bag, we're going to go where the consumer is because frankly its margins is up a little bit. Same thing on ground beef, if they'd rather have it \u2013 that volume not in that UPC, but in a non-UPC tray, we're going to do that. So first of all, bear that in mind.","Now backing up to your other question, the big revenue issue overall for the company really comes in three places. Beef and Pork commodity prices are down a lot, and then the other thing is the divestitures of the Mexican business, the Brazilian business and our Heinold Hog Markets business. So that is the overwhelming majority of the revenue decline quarter-over-quarter, and it's driven primarily by Beef prices, and by the way, will be for the year. So \u2013 well, we would expect it to be for the year. Does that help?","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Yeah, I know that some vast majority, going from $41 billion to $37 billion is those three issues...","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","...but is it fair to say Prepared Foods you're expecting lower sales than you previously were? And how much so roughly?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. I don't think it's fair to say that. Now in our Prepared Foods business, about half of it is food service, and those do use pricing formulas and the deflation in the raw materials does take some of the pricing down, but it doesn't affect the margin. If you look at the Retail business, we are seeing the response that we want to see from the pricing and the brand support that we're giving these brands. And we will continue to do that all year because we've got a great opportunity to grow.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Perfect. I'll pass it on. Thank you.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Sir, your line is now open.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you, and congrats on a good quarter. If we could just shift over to Pork, there's been a lot of talk about the sustainability of the Chicken margins at these levels, and just wanted to get your thoughts as we move through the year on Pork, and in particular could you stay at these elevated margins if the export markets pick up?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, we do have one eye always kind of on the export markets, and we're not seeing a lot of improvement in that yet. Could still happen, if it does, it's certainly upside. If you look at the macro picture here, you're probably going to have somewhere on the order of about 2% to 3% more hogs for the year. We should have very good capacity utilization. I feel good about where we are in terms of where the hogs are, so we should be competitive there. So I feel good about margins and certainly it's a little bit too early to predict what might happen in the back half of the year, but yeah, it feels like we've got a good pork year coming.","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Certainly off to a great start.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Maybe if I ask it a little bit in a different manner. I mean, I guess, obviously the expert outlook is a little bit more uncertain, but just judging by how you did in the first quarter, should we sort of think about the rest of the year as being \u2013 if the hog availability is still strong, and the domestic demand kind of remains where it is, everything else, I mean, you said kind of above 6% to 8%, but I mean is it double-digits? Is 10% possible for the year? What are we sort of generally looking at because there's a lot of room between above 6% to 8% what you did in the first quarter? Thanks.","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, there is. And I think Q1 and hogs is always strong, and I wouldn't want to predict the whole year based on Q1, but it feels very good to us that this should be a good pork year.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from Patrick Chen from BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.","Patrick Chen - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. This is Patrick in for Ken. Just a question about Prepared Foods. Just wondering how long will the reinvestment of all the synergies will go on? It seems like it's been, I guess, holding your margins back, I'm just try to figure out what the timing is as to when margins will improve from these levels, especially with chicken margins kind of potentially doing better than Prepared Foods this year. Thank you.","Dennis Leatherby - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so with advantaged brands and advantaged categories, we're really built for growth. We've got a great innovation pipeline that we're investing in for the long-term, and so there's always a balance, right, between margin and growth. And our intent is to make sure that with the advantages that we have, that we continue to grow. Frankly, the retailers depend on us to grow these categories, and we're going to continue with strong brand support. We spend a lot of time understanding the consumer and using those insights to build the right kind of innovation pipeline for the future. And so we will always balance growth and margin. Obviously in Q1 we didn't get the growth that we wanted, and the reason we didn't get the volume, growth we wanted, we didn't get the prices reflected on the shelves in the time period that we had predicted, so that our price caps would be right. That is now fixed, or pretty much fixed. And I think you're going to see the volume growth that will support the overall dollar of margin growth over time.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Patrick, from my perspective, what I like that I'm seeing is our vitality index numbers are really strong and that's a good sign for volume growth in the years ahead that really excites us to keep that margin solid and growing.","Patrick Chen - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our last question comes from Ms. Diane Geissler from CLSA. Ma'am, your line is now open.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Diane.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Congratulations on your quarter.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","I have a question, so the guidance range for this year if we exclude the extra week last year, is sort of 22% to 25%. And I guess when I look at it, I mean, look, breast meat is at $1, leg quarters are at $0.25. You're going to have margins in the Chicken segment above the, way above the top end of your normalized range. So as we look into fiscal 2017, appreciate we don't know what's going to go with pricing, et cetera, but it seems to me that with the way the Chicken business is set up now, you should be able to sustain margins above the top end of the normalized range, and therefore earnings next year should be up 10% plus. Am I thinking about that wrong?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Diane, we are very optimistic about this year and the foundation that we've built for next. If you look at it, next year we've got more synergies coming. I think we're going to prove decidedly in the next few weeks in the quarter or so that we've got great brands that are well positioned. I think protein demand is going to remain pretty strong. I know we have great consumer relevance. It's really hard to predict what input prices will be a year from now or whatever, but if you just look at the macro view, it feels pretty good that they'll be reasonable and certainly within our ability to manage, should have plentiful supply of livestock. We've got a great innovation pipeline, great cash flow as Dennis talked about. If I look at \u2013 anyway, so yeah, we're really optimistic.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. So I guess the short answer is we can make money when breast meat is at $1 and we can also make money when breast meat is at $2?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, we can.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Is that the takeaway?","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That is the takeaway.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Donald J. Smith - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Jon Kathol - Vice President-Investor Relations","So, listen, we appreciate your interest.

Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. I\u2019d like to begin with a recap of another record year. With record adjusted earnings of $3.15 a share, it was our fourth consecutive year of EPS growth. Adjusted sales were $40.6 billion, a record for the sixth consecutive year. Adjusted operating income was a record $2.3 billion, an increase of 37% over last year and the third consecutive year of growth. Cash flows from operations were a record $2.6 billion, nearly doubling our previous record set in 2010. And the three-year compound annual growth rate for adjusted EPS is 17%. We\u2019re certainly pleased with those accomplishments, especially in light of knowing we achieved them despite unusual challenges throughout the year.","The West Coast port slowdown was a significant disruption for Beef and Pork exports, resulting in a $90 million negative effect. There was an avian influenza outbreak that closed several export markets for our Chicken business and affected our turkey operations for a total impact of $139 million. And in the last couple of weeks of the fiscal year, there was an unprecedented decline in the live cattle futures market, resulting in $70 million in losses from mark-to-market positions and an LCM inventory charge. We did not adjust our earnings for the nearly $300 million of these challenges costs and we still produced record adjusted sales, earnings, operating income and cash flows. Meanwhile we paid down debt, bought back $250 million of our stock, and successfully integrated two companies into Tyson 2.0, while capturing $322 million in total synergies. We have a great team at every level of the organization, and I want to thank them for staying focused and delivering despite all the challenges and distractions.","Now, I\u2019d like to give you some color on our operating segments. But keep in mind that adjusted operating income and adjusted return on sales for the fourth quarter and for the year exclude the impact of the additional week in fiscal 2015. Please refer to our press release for non-GAAP reconciliations.","The Prepared Foods segment produced fourth quarter operating income of $171 million with a 9.2% return on sales. Volume for the quarter was up 74%, reflecting the addition of Hillshire Brands, and average sales price was up 15%. For the fiscal year, operating income was $636 million with a return on sales of 8.3%. Volume for the year was up 78%, again reflecting the additional volume from Hillshire, and average sales price was up 20%.","The majority of our synergies were captured within the Prepared Foods segment as a result of operational improvement, $81 million for the quarter and $285 million for the year. And not all those synergies are falling to the bottom line because we\u2019re investing some in the MAP spending and pricing to grow our brand and launch new platforms.","In fiscal 2016, we\u2019ll ramp up our MAP spend even more behind the Hillshire Snacking and Ball Park jerky launches and the new Jimmy Dean Shine On marketing campaign. Also, in the fiscal year, we\u2019ll continue to work on optimizing our Prepared Foods operations, as you saw in the press release last week. And we expect return on sales for the segment to be near the low end of the 10% to 12% range in fiscal 2016.","In the Chicken segment for the fourth quarter, operating income came in at $344 million with a 12.3% return on sales. Volume for the quarter was up 3%, while average sales price was down 2%. For the year, operating income was $1.3 billion, with a return on sales of 12%. Volume for the year was up 2%, while pricing was down 1.6%.","We\u2019ve proven that by purchasing up to 10% of our chicken meat on the open market and further processing it into value-added convenience foods, we can produce strong, stable returns even in times of falling commodity chicken pricing. Our Chicken business model is primarily value-added as a large branded component and is anchored in consumer insights and demand and has only a small amount of commodity exposure.","To help you understand the value-added nature of our Chicken business, I\u2019ll break it down into the categories on a sales dollar basis. About 52% is consumer retail. This includes products such as fresh tray pack, deli rotisserie, frozen strips and nuggets, any\u2019tizers, Tyson Grilled & Ready and IQF portions. Demand for these products is driven by three factors, brand, convenience and freshness. About 16% of our chicken sales are in foodservice national accounts and include products like eight-piece cut up and batter breaded, par fried and fully-cooked tenders, wings and breast strips. Demand is driven by quality. These are prep and flavor and national account consumers are often on the leading edge of our innovation.","About 17% of our sales are in foodservice value-added and like national accounts include batter breaded, par fried and fully-cooked tenders, wings, breast strips and patties. These products are typically sold through broad line distributors to foodservice operators and brand is very important to them as it signifies quality and consistency.","Only about 15% of our sales are commodity products such as bulk leg quarters, CDP [ph] breast, meat and renderings. Our commodity leg quarter volume is less than half of what it was a few years ago and we\u2019re working to continue reducing our commodity exposure through growth in consumer demand for dark meat and our buy versus grow strategy. Had we grown all the birds we needed, rather than buying parts on the market, we would have had an additional 4 million pounds of leg quarters a week to sell.","Our Chicken business is balanced and diversified and we have the flexibility to move where the consumer is going. We\u2019ve created a model that\u2019s about 90% customer and consumer pull with only about 10% of ourselves being pushed out into the market. Our customers value our innovation, consumer insights, broad product portfolio and category leadership, all of which help them grow their businesses. This is how we\u2019re building long-term growth and stability and why we believe our Chicken segment will produce returns exceeding 10% in fiscal 2016.","Turning to our Beef segment, in the fourth quarter, operating income was a negative $20 million resulting in an operating margin that was negative by 0.5%. Volume was down by 1.5% and average sales price dropped by 6%. For the year, operating income was a negative $53 million, with return on sales of minus 0.3%. Volume was down for the year about 2.2% because we processed fewer cattle. The average sales price was up 7% for the year.","We saw improvement and a return to profitability in Beef in the fourth quarter, but then an unprecedented dramatic decline in the live cattle futures market occurred in the last two weeks of the quarter, resulting in the $70 million loss, I mentioned earlier. With cattle supplies flat to perhaps slightly higher in fiscal 2016, the Beef business should approximate the low end of the newly revised normalized range of 1.5% to 3%.","Our Pork operating income was $88 million with a 7.2% return on sales in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of our Heinold business sold in Q1, sales volume was up about 7% while sales prices were down 23% for the quarter. For the fiscal year, Pork operating income was $373 million with a return on sales of 7.2%. Volume was up about 4% for the year, excluding Heinold, while average sales price was down 16%. We\u2019re expecting fiscal 2016 to be another solid year for the Pork segment with returns in the 6% to 8% range.","You might have noticed in our press release this morning that we\u2019re now reporting our Chicken operations in China and India in other results. The business in India, while very small is profitable and has good potential. While we still believe in China\u2019s long-term potential, its operations haven\u2019t achieved profitability. Given the ongoing losses generated in this business, record low chicken pricing, the slower economic outlook for China, and our changing strategy, we recorded an impairment charge of $169 million in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve been doing a significant amount of work on our go forward strategy for China and India, and we\u2019ll share our plans with you in the coming months.","Let\u2019s move on to our view of domestic consumer demand and our innovation efforts. At foodservice, traffic is expected to be flat to up just slightly. Non-commercial and fast casual are driving traffic growth, while breakfast and snacking continue as the growing daypart categories. We\u2019re diversified across all dayparts, all types of foodservice operations and across the types of products we sell. We have several new product launches and platform expansions planned for 2016. Because they\u2019re customer specific, I can\u2019t go into details but it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re broadening our thought process within Prepared Foods and value-added chicken to provide some exciting innovation for our customers that will meet consumers\u2019 breakfast and snacking needs.","In the retail channel, we are seeing increase featuring of Pork as pricing has come down. For the most recent year-over-year comparison, fresh Pork volume was up 6% on 2% lower pricing. Fresh chicken volume was up 1.5% on 3% higher pricing. The difference becomes more pronounced when looking at the past month, with Pork volume up 11% on 13% lower pricing. And fresh chicken volume down 2% with about a 2% increase in pricing. Whole muscle and ground Beef saw volume increases in the past month, as pricing finally began to ease up.","In our Retail business, we have advantaged brands in advantaged categories, and we\u2019ve regained share in Tyson\u2019s value-added poultry following operational disruptions last year. We\u2019ve also worked on closing pricing gaps to competitors in core Jimmy Dean and Hillshire farm items to regain or to maintain share. When we look at our retail IRI data, we focus on what we call our core non-business lines, which are the Hillshire Farm smoked sausage, Aidells smoked sausage, Hillshire Farm lunchmeat, Jimmy Dean Frozen Protein Breakfast, Jimmy Dean Breakfast Sausage, Wright and Tyson brand bacon, Ball Park hotdogs, Tyson brand value-added poultry and State Fair and Ball Park corn dogs.","These are the biggest volume and dollar driving categories for our Retail business, and we focus our resources to ensure these brands and categories stay strong. Looking at the core none, sales dollars for the period ending November 8, whether you\u2019re looking at data for the latest month, the latest quarter or the latest year, grew in the 1% to 3% range. Volume, while flat for the year, grew 2% to 4% for the latest month and the latest quarter.","So, we feel good about the health of our core retail branded business, and we\u2019re adding new platforms and sustaining innovation on top of the core. I mentioned the Hillshire Snacking and Ball Park jerky launches and both are doing very well.","The end market performance of Hillshire Small Plates is far exceeding projections; and the velocity of Hillshire grill chicken bites is up substantially and performing well against competitors. The Ball Park jerky lunch is going very well too and we believe we have a superior product that will drive repeat purchases. We kicked off heavy C-store channel selling in mid-October and also began a national media and PR last month. Innovation will be our growth driver in 2016 across our retail categories, and we\u2019ll talk about specific products at our CAGNY presentation in February. But one thing I\u2019d like to tell you about now is the upcoming launch of Jimmy Dean bacon in early calendar 2016.","Of course, we have Wright brand bacon, which is our premium, stack-pack, thick-cut bacon and we also have our Tyson bacon, which is a very good quality mainstream product with a loyal following. But we see there to expand loyalty for our premium L-Board bacon behind the Jimmy Dean brand bolstered by our deep capabilities in sourcing, making and selling bacon. Positioning Jimmy Dean in the bacon category is a great revenue synergy that came out of the integration of Tyson and Hillshire. And to be clear, we don\u2019t include revenue synergies in our total synergy numbers.","Speaking of total synergies, that is going extremely well and we see more opportunity. We\u2019re raising our synergy estimates for fiscal 2016 to more than $500 million and for fiscal 2017 to more than $700 million. The additional synergies will allow for more investment in innovation, new product launches and strengthening our brands.","2015 was our first full year of having Tyson Foods and Hillshire Brands together as one company. At the time of the acquisition, I\u2019ve said one plus one equals three and we\u2019re seeing that in our results. The integration has gone extremely well; we\u2019re just scratching the surface on what we can accomplish. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a food company that\u2019s better positioned than we are. We will capitalize on the opportunities we\u2019ve created. 2016 should be another record year with projected adjusted EPS of $3.50 to $3.65 a share. Dennis?","Dennis Leatherby","Thanks, Donnie and good morning everyone. Fiscal 2015 was another record year as we proved our diversified business model can generate strong steady cash flows. Our operating cash flow of $2.6 billion allowed us to invest in our businesses, reduce debt and resume meaningful share repurchases as we bought back $250 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter and $200 million so far in Q1 of fiscal 2016, for a combined total of $450 million and more than 10 million shares.","Fiscal 2015 adjusted revenues were $40.6 billion, representing 9% growth compared to prior year driven by a full year of Hillshire Brands results, offset by reductions from divestitures in our international operations. Total company adjusted return on sales for fiscal 2015 was 5.5%, and adjusted operating income was approximately $2.3 billion, representing a 37% increase over fiscal 2014. Our adjusted earnings of $3.15 per share, represents a 7% increase over our previous record of $2.94 last year.","As we described in our press release this morning, live cattle futures experienced a large and rapid decline in September. This negatively impacted us in the fourth quarter by $70 million from losses on mark-to-market open derivative positions and lower cost or market inventory charges, which cost us approximately $0.11 per share. To be clear, we have not added this back for adjusted EPS purposes. We expect $218 million on capital expenditures for the fourth quarter and $854 million for the full fiscal year. This outpaced our depreciation by $245 million in fiscal 2015, as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high return on invested capital. On a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate in fiscal 2015 was 36.3%. On an adjusted basis, this was 34.3%.","In the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of our Mexico operations and received $374 million in net proceeds, which were used to retire the 2015 notes. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA for the past 12 months was two times, as expected. And on a gross debt to adjusted EBITDA basis, this measure was 2.2 times.","Net interest was $69 million during the fourth quarter and $284 million for fiscal 2015. Including cash of $688 million, net debt was $6 billion, down $1.7 billion from Q4 of 2014. Total liquidity was $1.9 billion, well above our goal of $1.2 billion. Our average diluted shares for fourth quarter was $411 million.","Now, looking forward, here are some thoughts on fiscal 2016. We believe sales should be around $41 billion, which represents approximately 1.5% organic growth as we offset the impact of fiscal 2015 divestitures. We expect to capture more than $500 million in synergies, primarily from our Prepared Foods profit initiatives and Hillshire Brands synergies. Net interest expense should approximate $255 million. We currently estimate our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 35%. CapEx is expected to approximate $900 million, as we continue to focus on projects that will create long-term shareholder value. Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases as well as changes in our stock price which will impact the dilution from our tangible equity units, we expect our diluted shares in Q1 2016 to approximate 403 million based on our share price at the end of Q4.","This morning, we reported our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 50% from $0.10 to $0.15 per share on our Class A common stock payable on December 15. This increase brings our dividend to $0.60 per share annually for Class A shares from $0.40. Beginning in fiscal 2017, we expect to increase future dividends for Class A shares by at least $0.10 per share annually. This increase and our commitment to steady future dividend increases, demonstrates our confidence in the enduring strength and stability of our cash flow.","As we have demonstrated, our capital allocation priorities are governed by our disciplined focus on driving long-term shareholder value. Our priorities for deploying the significant cash flows that our operations generate are for growing our businesses through organic growth in operational efficiency capital projects with attractive returns, acquiring businesses that support our strategic objectives, and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, all while maintaining plenty of liquidity, investment grade credit ratings and strong incremental debt capacity.","We are confident that we will deliver continued growth in operating income and EPS in fiscal 2016. Chicken margin should be above 10%. Prepared Foods margin should be near the low end of our 10% to 12% expected range. Pork margin should be in the normalized range of 6% to 8%. Beef margin should approximate the low end of the new normalized range of 1.5% to 3%. Net debt to EBITDA should remain around two times as we return most of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $3.50 to $3.65, which represents 11% to 16% growth compared to fiscal 2015.","In closing, this has been an amazing year for Tyson 2.0. I would like to thank our team members for delivering record sales, record operating income, record EPS, and record cash flows. I am proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished together and look forward to our continued growth.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Donnie for some closing remarks.","Donnie Smith","We\u2019ve wrapped up a record setting year at Tyson Foods; we\u2019re off to a great start for 2016. From where we sit today, it looks like it will be another record year as we continue to deliver on our goal of at least 10% annual EPS growth over time. We\u2019re capitalizing on the benefits of our diverse portfolio and our branding power. Our Prepared Foods business is performing very well and we\u2019ll be capturing even more synergies this year giving us fuel to drive growth. Our Chicken business is strong. Pork continues to do well. And we think the worst is behind us in Beef. We bought back $250 million of our stock in Q4 and $200 million so far in Q1. We\u2019re projecting strong cash flow and a positive outlook that will allow us to continue buying back our shares through 2016. And as Dennis said, we\u2019ve just increased our regular dividend by 50% and plan to continue increasing it by at least $0.10 per share annually. We\u2019ve got a lot of reasons to be confident. And we think 2016 is going to be another great year of producing strong shareholder returns.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we\u2019re ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Adam Samuelson at Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson","So, I guess my question, Donnie, on guidance and a couple of different pieces here. First, I want to understand the guidance for the Prepared Food margins near 10% despite the fact that you\u2019ve got about $175 million of year-over-year synergies and very sizeable year-over-year raw material tailwinds. Can you help us think about the scale of SG&A and reinvestment that you\u2019re doing in the business? And then second, in Chicken, help us bridge the 12% margins you did this year to around 10% plus that you\u2019re expecting for next year?","Donnie Smith","Sure, Adam. So on the Prepared Foods part, will take that first. We will be -- typically, we spend about 5% of sales in MAP. We\u2019re going to be spending a little over that in this year, as we focus on the Hillshire Snacking and the Jimmy Dean launch and the new Jimmy Dean marketing campaign. We\u2019re also investing in price gaps versus the competition. We\u2019ve got some room in Jimmy Dean Roll Sausage. We\u2019ve got price gaps in Hillshire Farm smoked sausage. And we need to get our lunchmeat business. We\u2019ve just moved back the line pricing there as now we\u2019ve got the turkey raw materials coming back to us from the AI. So it\u2019s very important for us that we regain our volume growth in these categories. So, we\u2019re going to be investing in trade and investing in MAP spending to drive our growth in those categories.","Switching over to chicken, you\u2019ve got a pretty cheap environment now with fresh meat trading pretty regularly below $0.90 a pound delivered. You\u2019ve got leg quarter markets trading sub $0.20 and depending on how disjointed your logistics are you\u2019re probably FOB the plant somewhere in the $0.12 to $0.13 range. That\u2019s a pretty soft environment for pricing. We\u2019ve got a lot of volume that is in RFP now. And so we feel very comfortable that we\u2019ll be better than 10%, but we want to be cautiously optimistic until we get through this RFP season on our chicken business. But let me hasten on to say that our brands give us a good bit of insulation from our competition, plus our quality service and innovation helps set us apart. And we\u2019ve done a lot in the last four years to optimize our poultry portfolio and to structure the pricing models within each part of that portfolio to deliver stable results. And that\u2019s what we think will happen again this year.","Adam Samuelson","It\u2019s very helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, can you help us think through the export assumptions that you\u2019re thinking about for really chicken, beef and pork, and how those are influencing your margin outlook?","Donnie Smith ","Yes. So, in chicken, we\u2019ve actually forecasted sub $0.20 leg quarters for the rest of the fiscal year inside of our projection. So, if we get a feel of these AI closed markets to open up, that could be a little upside for us but we don\u2019t have that baked into the plan. As we look at pork and beef, we\u2019re going to continue to see based on a strong dollar competition from other regions around the world. You might think that we\u2019ll have maybe a little bit of growth in the beef\u2019s export volume for the year, probably not expecting very much in pork, but -- and then maybe you see chicken exports improve. So one thing to note though, I think we mentioned in the last call or two that we were taking a lot of our beef items like Short Plates and those kind of things, and rolling those in to the trim stream; those are now going back out into the export markets. Now they\u2019re going back into those markets at much lower pricing than they were before, but it is better than the trim stream.","And then one thing that -- I said one thing, there\u2019s been about three things. Sorry. One last thing I\u2019d like investors to think about is we have not projected any impact for MCOOL. [Ph] So, depending on whether or not Congress fails to act or acts and there are retaliatory tariffs, those would provide some cautionary note in our export sales. But we don\u2019t have anything forecasted for that, and we also don\u2019t have any AI impact built into our projection. So that\u2019s the view.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Diane Geissler of CLSA. Your line is open.","Diane Geissler","First of all, congratulations on your quarter and just really your operations, all year long. I wanted to -- and thanks also for some of the details on your value-add portfolio and the breakdown on consumer retail versus foodservice. I guess, I just want to come back around on the chicken outlook and say that I think in the press release, you\u2019ve said it was 2% from the USDA, but you actually expected it to be up a little bit more than that and that foodservice could possibly see demand lower than supply. So when we think about these breakdowns that you\u2019ve given us, how much of that is sort of already booked in with a guaranteed margin? So, you\u2019ve priced out a contract with the national account, you know what the margin on that will be in 2016. Can you provide us some color on what you know you\u2019ve already booked versus maybe what is a little bit more open to the market as we get later in fiscal 2016?","Donnie Smith","It\u2019s difficult to answer with a lot of specificity. I don\u2019t know how to say that word specificity. You know that word, right? But let me say this, so as far as what we would have booked today that has pricing set and has perhaps the cost in commodity futures underneath it, you\u2019re talking sub 20% of the portfolio but we have a lot of our portfolio that is line priced; we have a lot of the portfolio that has very short volume windows. So, if you ask me what is my expectation about how well we will do through pricing season and how well we\u2019ll be able to maintain at least 10% margins or better, I feel very good about that.","A couple of reasons, we\u2019ve got the largest brand at present out there in the U.S. in Chicken. Our value-added portfolio, now we\u2019ve got capacity around us to where we can continue to grow that. And by the way, our buy versus grow strategy in a year like this is a competitive advantage because we\u2019re able to buy very, very cheap raw materials and then further process that into value-added items for predominantly foodservice, but also some at retail. And we\u2019ve got best-in-class quality; we\u2019ve got best-in-class service. And I think that drives our customers to us to ask us to help grow their categories. And we\u2019ve got the innovation capabilities that they\u2019re looking for to continue to grow their business. So that sets up very well for us. And I\u2019m very positive about our Chicken business for 2016.","Diane Geissler","Have you finished most of the fall contracting with the foodservice?","Donnie Smith","No, it\u2019ll take us about another 60 days or so to get through it. I can tell you that the early read is it\u2019s going pretty good.","Diane Geissler","And just on the export -- to follow-up on that question, I mean it\u2019s been awhile since we\u2019ve had an AI case -- a new AI case discovered on the back of the high-path that happened earlier this spring. So, based on your experience, how long does it take for the trade partners to open the doors? I mean, at what point will they look at it and say, okay, there\u2019s -- no new cases, we don\u2019t expect any more cases and now we\u2019re going to think about taking products from the U.S. again?","Donnie Smith","Historically, it\u2019s been around six months to nine months, although I can tell you we haven\u2019t had very many. We\u2019re about nine months past March 5th now and we haven\u2019t had very many regions open the doors yet. There is a lot of trade negotiations going on. TPP is up in the air, you\u2019ve got MCOOL [ph] up in the air. There\u2019s just a lot going on around trade. I don\u2019t know how much that\u2019s impacting. Whether or not these countries open up, we feel very safe about our supply chain. So, I don\u2019t see any reason there for there to be any reason not to want to take great part of it from the U.S. So I\u2019d really hesitate to try to guess on when these things will open up. So what we did, Diane, is we just put the current pricing in our year for the whole year. And if anything breaks lose, then it will benefit us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brett Hundley of BB&T Capital. Your line is open.","Brett Hundley","Just two questions for me. Donnie, I can certainly appreciate you\u2019re lowering your normalized range on beef just given challenges in recent years. But maybe to put this move into Wall Street jargon, I wonder if you\u2019re downgrading the segment at the bottom here. One of your competitors in the space fairly recently was more bullish than I would have expected on the beef market going forward. And I\u2019m just wondering as you add up the pieces, if you guys could potentially find yourselves above that new normalized range and back within your old range by 2017 or so?","Donnie Smith","So, first, let me explain why we took the action we did. We really did feel it\u2019s important for our investor base to have a really solid understanding of what we feel the margin environment is going to be that we face out over the next few years. You\u2019ve got relatively low cattle supply, you\u2019ve got too much -- well, not to say too much, probably not the right way to say it, but you\u2019ve got excess industry capacity. And that limits our ability to drive margins above the 1.5% to 3%, we think. I would say this though is that are there likely to be quarters out in those future years where we would see margins in the previous. Yes, I think you should expect that. But overall, for annual guidance, as we look forward for the next few years, this is the environment we think we\u2019ll be operating in.","Brett Hundley","And then, my last question is just on your Prepared Foods business. Just to maybe help me with modeling that top line better, going forward, I was wondering if maybe you would separate out your legacy and Hillshire areas or maybe even talk to the different parts of your Prepared Foods business, more about volume and price expectations going forward. You have a very vast business there. And when I walk to stores here in my area, I see a fair amount of competitive behavior amongst all the participants. And you talked about your wanting to push volume growth. You\u2019ve mentioned the synergy capture that you guys are garnering which I think gives you a lot of fire power there. But I just want to understand top line dynamics better on a go forward basis between different areas of your business there?","Donnie Smith","So, as you look at our Prepared Foods business, and I\u2019m going to be painting with a fairly broad brush, it\u2019s relatively evenly split between retail and foodservice. So if you think about our foodservice Prepared Foods business, so let\u2019s look at that first. You\u2019ve got predominantly a pizza toppings business and other ingredient meats combined with the portfolio of breaded products, tortillas, flat breads, that kind of thing, and the former, if you will, bakery and sweet goods business from Hillshire Brands. So, a lot of the meat in that portfolio is priced on a trailing basis to the markets. So, as the markets go down and we do expect cheaper pork raw materials, typically our pricing in Prepared Foods would go down as well, but we would hang on to the margin. And it would recover in some period of time. We\u2019ve tried to shorten that window from 90-plus days down to 45 to 60 days or so and that should help stabilize the margin regardless of which way the market is moving.","The bakery and sweet goods business has a very stable, low double-digit margin. And so, again, there is opportunities for us to grow a bit in that category. Although we do think that the largest potential is to continue to grow the meat business inside our Prepared Foods on foodservice side.","Now let\u2019s switch over to retail. We talked about the core nine on the script. And what we\u2019re seeing -- let\u2019s take it apart just a little bit. Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage, Hillshire Brands smoked sausage and our Hillshire Brands lunchmeat have been the three categories where we need to drive volume. We have seen -- let\u2019s go from the bottom-up. So Hillshire farm lunchmeat. Obviously, our shortage of raw material and turkey has hurt our volume in that business. Now frankly, we\u2019ve been able to replace some SKUs with some additional ham SKUs; we\u2019ve been able to replace some of those SKUs with chicken lunchmeat SKUs. But overall, the absence of turkey has hurt our volume.","We\u2019re now in a position where after the first of the year, say late Jan, something like that, we\u2019ll be back to full production in our turkey operation after the AI problems, and we\u2019ll have the raw material around as we need to reset our pricing in our turkey lunchmeat to line pricing and then grow our promotional volume from there. So, we feel great about our ability to get our price gaps right and grow that business. In Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage, the issue there is really around reestablishing price gaps to the competition to drive volume. We have a lot of promotional activity going on during this holiday season, and we feel very good about our ability to drive our volume by getting these price gaps right.","Frankly, we had some of our retail partners who are a little bit slow in reflecting our pricing gaps at that level. And so that has slowed our volume a bit, but we\u2019ll get there. And now on growth, frankly, we\u2019re seeing unprecedented growth in competitive pricing. We lowered our pricing gaps, but probably need to do that again. And fortunately, we\u2019ve got lower raw materials and we\u2019ve got increased synergies that gives us a lot of power to fuel the growth in these categories. So, I feel very comfortable that Andy and the team have a great focus on how to get the volume back and regain the share that we\u2019ve given up. And I could not be more optimistic about our Prepared Foods business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Farha Aslam of Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.","Farha Aslam","Donnie, could you talk about the synergy targets that you\u2019ve set out? You\u2019ve increased your long-term synergy target by $100 million. Could you share with us what gave you the confidence and where you\u2019re finding that extra $100 million of cost savings?","Donnie Smith","Sure, Farha. So operational improvements through fiscal 2015 were more than we thought and we see increased opportunity as we get into 2016 to -- in the operational improvement. We\u2019re just getting started on some of the network stuff. That\u2019s probably going to be more of a 2017 answer for us. The purchasing synergies, as we work with a lot of our great supply partners, we\u2019ve worked on several packaging innovations and just rethinking a lot of the categories. And together with our supply partners, we\u2019re finding ways to lower our cost in a lot of these purchasing categories. And that has really been the increase that we see the most of in 2016. So, it\u2019s really a good story and it provides a lot of fuel to fuel our growth.","Farha Aslam","And just to be clear, are you including sort of internally sourcing your meat for Hillshire in this 2017 number now?","Donnie Smith","No, not yet, Farha. We\u2019re still under contract with other suppliers with our Hillshire -- former Hillshire Brands raw materials. And until those contracts run out and that could be anywhere from 12 months to 24 months, we\u2019ll still be buying raw materials for that business from other folks.","Farha Aslam","And just as a follow-up, if we can think about Tyson\u2019s longer term kind of ROIC targets and how beef fits in with those targets with your new reduced beef margins? That would be helpful.","Donnie Smith","I\u2019ll take a break and get a cup of coffee. Dennis?","Dennis Leatherby","Farha, this is Dennis. Our longer term goal would be to be at 20% ROIC overall. And just to give you a little bit of a perspective around Beef, even at a 2% return on sales, we have about a 15% ROIC. So, 2.5% gets you pretty close to 20%. And we see no reason why we can\u2019t work our way toward it.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Kenneth Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Kenneth Zaslow","Just a couple of follow-up questions. You recently closed one of your plants, your beef plant. How much operating profit or cost reduction will you get from that and how much of that adds to your margin structure? I know that you took down the beef packer margin outlook, but I would think that would be at least somewhere between 30 basis points and 40 basis points incremental. How do you think about that?","Donnie Smith","Ken, you\u2019d be higher there. It obviously depends on the fundamentals in that region about the cattle that come to market and that kind of thing, but 30 is too high. As I think through it, it\u2019s hard for me just to put a number on it, but you\u2019re high at 30. I promise.","Kenneth Zaslow","And then the $139 million associated with the bird flu and turkey, how much of that get recuperated next year and the year after and how do you think about that?","Donnie Smith","So quite a bit of that\u2019s caught up in the export markets, not being able to ship. Obviously -- I don\u2019t know the breakout of the 139, how much is the Chicken export number versus how much is the actual turkey problems. But the turkey part of that should rebound as we get the plant full and we have the raw materials and we regain those sales. And that you should see that start flowing in. We\u2019ve got it modeled in Q2, so you should see that flowing in then.","Kenneth Zaslow","And just talking about pork a little bit, the pork packer outlook, it seems like we\u2019re flushed with plenty of hogs out there. The reason I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re keeping it within the guidance range is because the export markets are still in flux; is that a fair way of thinking about it because the domestic side of the pork outlook seems exceedingly strong; how do I look into that?","Donnie Smith","You\u2019ve hit the nail on the head, Ken. We feel very good about pork. There\u2019s going to be good hog availability which by the way provides good cheap raw materials for our Prepared Foods business. But this is just a cautionary note on exports and the high dollar and competition from other regions in the world for some primary markets. So that\u2019s the cautionary note there. If some of that changes, then obviously there\u2019s upside in our Pork segment.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Piken of Cleveland Research.","Mike Henry","Hi. This is Mike Henry actually in for Mike Piken. Thanks for taking my question. You highlighted some of the near-term contracts that I guess are more under negotiation with Chicken. I was wondering if you could comment on what percent of the contracting has already been completed for the year that might be a little bit of a tailwind as you go in over the next several quarters.","Donnie Smith","It is hard to say, Mike. My guess is of the volume that is RFPed, maybe 10%, 15% at most, something like that. You\u2019ve got to remember there\u2019s a lot of different pricing models that we have, some where we have guaranteed volume, and we really look at the price every 30, 60 or 90 days. We\u2019ve got a good bit of our Chicken business that\u2019s just right priced. But of that volume that will go through RFPs, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re in those low-double digits. There is a lot yet to come there, yes.","Mike Henry","And then just one follow-up, if I may, going back to the question on the market being oversupplied potentially for Chicken. Given where prices are today, do you think that we\u2019re seeing this? And then, when we\u2019re in this oversupply situation, how is Tyson kind of adjusting and reacting?","Donnie Smith","So, our reaction is to ramp up our buy versus grow strategy. We are buying a lot of raw material these days. We\u2019re buying breast meat sub $0.90 delivered to our plants. So, we\u2019ve got the opportunity to take advantage of this outside raw material in an oversupply situation to supply our value-added businesses. And as we said in the script, about 90% or so of our volume is really consumer pull and only about 10% is pushed out. We don\u2019t sell very much CDP [ph] breast meat. We\u2019re working hard every day to value up our leg quarters and not have any leg quarters to sell. So it\u2019s a time like this when our buy versus grow strategy really helps us maintain our stable margins.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Moskow","Couple of questions. So, hey Donnie, when you say only 10% of your volume is pushed out, is that kind of a good proxy for saying only 10% exposed to like commodity pricing on a regular basis? So, like if I just made like a blanket statement that commodity prices are going to be down 25% year-over-year, could I apply that to that 10% to figure out commodity exposure for chicken? And then, I had a quick follow-up.","Donnie Smith","Sure. So, I think I\u2019d rather you think about the 15% of our sales that our CDP [ph] breast meat, leg quarters and our rendering products. Those are the ones that have the most commodity exposure. Now, there is also a minority portion, for example, of our fresh tray pack business that gets priced off the Georgia Dock. So there are some market influences in those businesses. But in terms of just commodity exposure, probably think of the 15% of our portfolio and not the larger percent.","Robert Moskow","And then the follow-up, I guess it\u2019s kind of two-fold. But you said about 20% of the volume you\u2019ve got good visibility on in terms of locking in margins; I think that\u2019s what you said. Is that typical for this time of year, are you ahead or is that about average; how does that compare to last year? And then also, how do I think about the $100 million improvement in your grain costs; how much of that are you able to drop to the bottom-line?","Donnie Smith","So, two great questions, yes. This year is about like every other. So, we\u2019re going through about the same amount of RFP that we went through last year. And again, let me reiterate that it\u2019s going pretty good so far. Still got some room to go, but going pretty good. Let\u2019s see, the second part of your question, remind me of that again.","Robert Moskow","$100 million grain?","Donnie Smith","Yes, the grain. One thing that we always do is look at opportunities to lock in margins when we do get pricing contracts established. So, we\u2019ll look at that. But it\u2019s hard to say this early about how much of the impact of that $100 million will drop to the bottom-line until we get through this big RFP season, because if we can get the chance to lock in our margins underneath that we will. But that\u2019s probably not.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from again Ken Goldman of JPMC. Your line is open.","Ken Goldman","Forgive me if this was asked, I didn\u2019t hear it. But industry-wide, we are seeing some extraordinarily strong beef and pork processing margins in the last few weeks, if not more. And I recognize that just as we saw this past quarter with beef, sometimes it\u2019s hard to translate what we\u2019re seeing industry-wide to what a specific company\u2019s margins will be. But, as we model out the year, is it reasonable for us, at least in these two segments, to sort of give a little bit more juice to the first half of the year or at least the first quarter just given some of the timing and what we\u2019re actually seeing in the market today because some of the margins we\u2019re seeing are just extraordinarily high and unusual for this time of year?","Donnie Smith","Probably able to do that in pork, I\u2019d be cautious about doing that in beef. We had pretty good October, but here in the middle part of November, beef cut-out has dropped quite dramatically. I don\u2019t know what Friday\u2019s close was, but it\u2019s probably going to be around 2.05 or something like that. And kind of depending on where cattle are north versus south, sometimes it takes a little while to get that change reflected in the cost of the cattle. Beef, my guess is that you\u2019re probably backend loaded. Cattle, we saw the cattle and feed numbers Friday, our estimates would be that the increase in fed\u2019s cattle coming to market this year would be in Q3 or Q4. So, you\u2019re probably a little frontend loaded maybe and pork a little back and loaded and beef is kind of where I\u2019m thinking about it.","Ken Goldman ","And then a follow-up, if I can on Beef, it\u2019s obviously been an unexpected, at least from my perspective, drag on earnings in the last two quarters. I think you guys have hinted and this is my interpretation you haven\u2019t said it, but if you wanted to divest it, if you decided, this business is an albatross on our valuation; let\u2019s just punt it. Do you think there would be a robust, even diverse group of suitors for the business or would it be really challenging to find someone interested in and maybe even able to take a look at it from an antitrust perspective? I\u2019m just curious what the market might be for something like that out there, if you can even answer that.","Donnie Smith ","No, I can\u2019t answer that. No.","Ken Goldman","Alright. Well, I gave it a shot. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tim Ramey of Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.","Tim Ramey","Donnie, you mentioned getting started on some of the network stuff to be a fiscal \u201817 event. Can you flesh out a little bit what that means for us?","Donnie Smith","Yes. That wasn\u2019t such a technical term; was it, Tim? So, we\u2019re in the process now, you saw our announcement last Friday, of optimizing the production footprint. We\u2019ll be moving lines of products within that footprint to optimize the logistics around the raw material and optimize the cost of the production. From that point then, the next move is to really look out into the distribution network and make sure that we have the right nodes of distribution, both from a hub-and-spoke and from a forward positioning basis to optimize our transportation cost and our service offering. So, once we get the production footprint established, largely it won\u2019t be perfect. But then we will begin working on the distribution network. There is a couple things that we\u2019re starting to focus on now around rationalizing some of the SKUs. We\u2019ve got some end-to-end opportunities between primarily our pork business, but to some small extent our beef business and our Prepared Foods business to continue to work to optimize cost inside that network. So all of that will be -- we\u2019ll begin working on that in 2016, but largely the effect of those changes will happen in 2017.","Now, let me hasten on to say too that we\u2019ve got work inside our Chicken business as well. We\u2019ve just completed the conversion in South Georgia to the tray pack. We\u2019ve got a lot of FP capacity around us now. And so, we\u2019re able to go out and bid on business that we weren\u2019t able to bid before. Our antibiotic-free business continues to grow. So as those grow, that will help us optimize the production and the distribution network as well. Hope that clears it up a little bit.","Tim Ramey","Yes. Just to follow on, on Beef, with the timing difference relative to the price decline in the futures market, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re saying that\u2019s recouped in the 1Q. Is it more of a -- we should think about that as coming back into the numbers throughout the fiscal 2016 year or how should we think about that?","Donnie Smith","Yes, I would spread that cost throughout the fiscal 2016 year. So, we sell boxed beef out front and buy cattle futures against it to lock in the margin and so, some of those contracts are fairly well out through the year. And so, just kind of spread that cost on through the rest of the fiscal year.","Tim Ramey","And just we used to talk a lot about the pie season back in the day. Anything to say about the sweet goods sales?","Donnie Smith","It\u2019s going well. We did have a problem which, Tim, you know my background; it\u2019d be hard for me to think about a sweet potato problem. But the flooding that we had in South Carolina actually disrupted our supply chain a little bit on the sweet potatoes. We had a great team around that work through it very well and I think did as good as we could to get as much of our volume into the marketplace, as we can, really just some heroic efforts on the part of that business in our supply chain. So, yes, it\u2019s going pretty well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Palmer","As you talk about buy versus grow, you mentioned the purchase mix can shift up to 10% or so over time. Any sense of where that stands now; and has that been evolving already, as you head into 2016?","Donnie Smith","We\u2019re a little bit shy of the 10% now. It\u2019s pretty easy for us frankly to buy about 100 loads a week. Most of that will be breast meat; some will be breast meat portions. And then, if wings were to soften up and we had good promotional volume for next spring\u2019s wings season, we\u2019ll always be out there buying wings and a few tenders when they\u2019re available. Typically, the size of tenders that we need aren\u2019t very readily available. So, mostly, I think breast meat but yes, we do spread that around to the other raw materials when we can use them.","David Palmer","Has your team guessed where the chicken industry profit margins would be around as we exit 2015; is the segment up low-single digits in margin or so?","Donnie Smith","David, honestly, we spend all of our time just focusing on our customers and our margins. We don\u2019t spend a whole lot of time trying to figure out what the industry is doing.","David Palmer","And then just one small question about the dollar, it feels like the strong dollar. And we often talk about the AI trade restrictions. But strong dollar is perhaps holding back your earnings in indirect ways like limiting chicken export and encouraging beef imports from Australia. Could you comment on that? And if the dollar does stabilize, is that at least the removal of a negative?","Donnie Smith","Very much so, removal of the negative, and I would say that today the dollar impact is probably having more of an impact on pork and beef exports than it would chicken. I feel comfortable that if the export restrictions based on AI were relieved, then we could increase our exports in chicken pretty readily. So, dollar wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact the chicken as much, but on pork and beef, yes.","Operator","Thank you. And that ends our Q&A session. I\u2019ll hand it back over to Donnie for closing comments. Thank you.","Donnie Smith","Thanks everyone for joining us today and certainly for your interest in Tyson Foods. We wish you all a very happy Thanksgiving. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining.

Fiscal 2019 is off to a solid start with earnings of $1.58 per share and 8.3% operating margin. As we evolve from a protein producer to a modern food company, we are reaping the benefits of our established diversified business model. Yesterday, we reached the definitive agreement to acquire the Thai and European operations of BRF. The purchase includes four poultry processing facilities in Thailand. One in the United Kingdom and one in the Netherlands. This deal furthers our growth strategy by expanding offerings of value added protein in global markets.","We completed the Keystone acquisition on November 30th and have provided us with the scalable platform in the Asian poultry market. The acquisition of the BRF facilities will help strengthen our presence in the Thai poultry industry and serve the high growth markets in that region. BRF assets in the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands give us a stronger foothold in Europe where we are currently under penetrated.","I am confident in our ability to integrate the BRF operations in part due to the pace and level of team working taking place with the Keystone integration. Keystone is already playing an important role in our growth strategy, and we look forward to maximizing the opportunities inherent in the combined business that benefit our customers as we strive to meet their needs and grow together.","As part of the integration process for Keystone, a few weeks ago we announced several organizational changes. This refinement of our team will help us make the most of our biggest growth opportunities which are value added foods in the international markets. I am glad to have everyone on board and the team is eager and motivated to deliver results.","I'd also like mention that Fortune magazine recently included us on the list of the world's most admired companies, ranking Tyson Foods number one in the food production category for the third straight year. The rankings are based on key attributes that are important to us as we execute our strategy to grow our business through differentiated capabilities that deliver ongoing financial discipline through continuous improvement and to sustain our company and the world for future generations.","I am committed to our strategy and our team members are committed to deliver results based on the strategy. Moving to our segment performance in the first quarter. In short, strong organic growth in prepared foods and strong beef fundamentals led the performance while pork and chicken performed well given market conditions. The dynamics across the different businesses highlight the advantage of Tyson's diversified business model, but they work together to provide balance and opportunity for long-term growth.","In the Prepared Food segment, it was a record first quarter with $268 million in operating income and a 12.5% return on sale, building on the momentum of the record year in 2018. With quarter performance of Prepared Foods is obscured by divestitures of several non-core businesses last year. When those are excluded Prepared Foods delivered over 3% revenue growth and double digit profit growth in the first quarter and modest volume increases. This demonstrate the effectiveness of branded value added multi-channel Prepared Foods model.","Looking back to Prepared Foods, we've grown the business from $4 billion in sales but basically 1% return in 2014. The business that is in fiscal 2019 is projected to produce over $8 billion in sales and 11% to 12% return and approximately $1 billion in operating income. We've grown this business organically and through M&A and operational improvement.","And we are building on our strong portfolio brand. This is best evidenced by the performance of JimmyDean, a $1 billion brand with strong historical growth and high market share. We've increased our brand investment and partnered with strategic customers to drive growth. As a result, in the latest 52 week period JimmyDean frozen protein breakfast volume was up 7% and sales dollars were up nearly 8%. While we continue investing in our traditional meat protein businesses, we are also committed to incremental growth in alternative protein.","We are combining our creativity, our scale and our resources to make great taste in protein alternatives that more accessible for everyone both domestically and internationally. We will be leveraging all the resources we have at our disposal. Our insights, our innovation, manufacturing, sales, distribution and a global platform. And in the weeks ahead, you'll be hearing more from us as we announce new products in the alternative protein space.","We've also invested in our operations network. We've completed the turnaround of our pepperoni business and is fully contributing to Prepared Foods growth and possibly impacting our food service business. With capacity utilization percentages in the high 90s and margins strengthening in Q1, we expect the improvement in the pepperoni business to carry us through the balance of the year. We will build on the momentum of the profitable growth for prepared foods, and we are increasing our projection for operating margins to be 11% to 12% range in fiscal 2019.","Rising input cost for pork bellies, beef and pork trim and turkey breast are expected to present year-over-year cost increases. But we designed this business to manage headwinds and I am confident in our prospects. We've a great team and the right plan for Prepared Foods to continue driving earnings growth and stability for the enterprise.","In the Beef segment, our largest segment by revenue, we produced operating income of $305 million with the 7.8% margin. Average price was up 1.9% compared to the first quarter last year as both exports and domestic demand remain strong. Volumes were down slightly due to typical occasional winter weather disruptions, which have continued in the second quarter.","Demand for beef remains strong globally. With visibility in the cattle supplies for 2021, there appeared to be a plenty of cattle available for the next few years. And there are ample cattle supplies projected for the regions where we operate. This gives us confidence in our expectation on operating margin near 7% for the year which is somewhat higher than our previous guidance.","The prolong period of strong global beef demand combined with relatively constant global supplies, experts they analyze and quantify the apparent structural shifts in the beef industry. This is an addition to the margin expansion we have created through value-added and premium programs. We intend to understand the dynamics of these two factors to better predict the enhanced margin structure that our beef business could generate in the coming years.","Moving onto the Pork segment, operating income was $95 million with an 8.1% margin. Average price was down 4.6% versus Q1 last year, associated with lower livestock costs. Volume was down 3.6% as we remain focused on margin management. We are working to enhance revenue per head through premium programs as well as growing our export business. With hog supplies expected to increase at least 2% for the fiscal year, we are maintaining our guidance for a margin of around 6% for the year.","Meanwhile, across the Company, we are benefiting from record high retention or keeping team members safer than ever, as a result of proactive measures to promote a culture of safety and carrying in our plants. Work schedules are changing and provide a more [Indiscernible] 0:11:09.3 work life balance, which not only results in improved attendance but also makes our operations more efficient. This practice has made Tyson the employer of choice in a number of labor markets and has improved our performance relative to industry benchmarks.","Turning to the Chicken segment, operating income was $173 million with a 5.6% margin. Volume was up 17% and average price was down 13.1%, mostly due to incremental volume from acquisitions. As a reminder, we acquired American Proteins last year, which is a rendering business and added considerable volumes that impacted pricing within the segment.","However, we did face some pricing pressure in some categories, along with cost pressures from tight labor markets in some locations and more expensive feed ingredients. Unfortunately these pressures are offsetting the benefits from acquisitions and new product innovation. For the year, we expect the operating margin for our Chicken segment to exceed 6%. This is lower than we anticipated in November. But I want to be clear, our Chicken business is fundamentally strong, with a highly value added product mix, it's diversified across bird sizes and sales channels. Our Chicken business is well positioned and our continuous improvement efforts and efficiencies, product mix and cost will keep us well positioned. And while there has been pressure on tray pack pricing, our business model is sound and our operations are solid.","Despite the pressure in tray pack, I'd like to point to a new piece of that business is doing exceptionally well and that's Smart Chicken brand we acquired last year. Distribution is growing and demand remains strong for this higher margin product. And one final point I'd like to make on our operations, we are expecting a substantial improvement to our legacy international business, which is reported in other. As a result of adjusting our business model and increasing sales of value added products, we're expecting the legacy business to be breakeven by fiscal year-end on a run rate basis, before the positive impact from Keystone's international operations.","South Korea is a great example of the shifting dynamics. Our business with them is up nearly 50% year-over-year and now totals nearly $600 million per year. This is an example of what a competitive trade agreement can do for both parties. This concludes my commentary on the business segments, now Stewart, if you take us through the financials.","Stewart Glendinning","Thanks, Noel, and good morning everyone. First quarter EPS of $1.58 was down 13% compared to the record Q1 in 2018. Revenues were roughly flat at just over $10 billion. Volume was up 3.3% and average price was down 3.7% as acquisitions and divestitures affected sales volume and changes in product mix affected pricing.","Operating income was $841 million, down 11%. Total company return on sales was 8.3% in the first quarter. So overall, it was a good quarter, but we were up against last year's strong comparisons. The Keystone acquisition performed as expected for the one month we owned it in Q1 and it was right at breakeven on a cash accretion basis. Operating cash flows were $868 million and our ability to generate large amounts of cash gives us the flexibility to make opportunistic choices. In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares for $83 million. We also directed $318 million toward capital expenditures, as we continue to invest in growth and efficiency projects with expected returns greater than the cost of capital.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 22.7%, net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.8 times, including cash of $400 million, net debt was $11.6 billion and total liquidity was $1.4 billion at the end of Q1. Net interest expense was $97 million. Weighted average shares outstanding in Q1 were approximately $366 million. Looking at the remainder of the fiscal year, we will maintain our capital allocation priorities to drive shareholder value and to grow the business. We'll be paying down debt from the Keystone acquisition and deploying cash to grow organically.","Now that we've announced the agreement to purchase BRF Thai and European operations, we're ready to go to the bond market to secure permanent funding for both the BRF and the Keystone deals. Interest rates have been more favorable since year-end. We feel confident in the quality of these assets and we're happy with the purchase price of a little less than 10 tons. And finally, I'll give an update to our outlook for 2019, which includes Keystone, but doesn't yet include the BRF operations.","In fiscal 2019, we expect sales to grow approximately $43 billion with the addition of Keystone. Keystone is expected to be accretive on a cash basis and breakeven on a pretax basis for the year. The additional amortization for Keystone will be about $26 million for the 10 months of fiscal 2019 and approximately $35 million per year in fiscal 2020 and beyond. CapEx should be about $1.5 billion in fiscal 2019. However, our planned spending for 2020 is expected to decline to the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion range.","Although we're are scaling back on CapEx, it will remain higher than depreciation. Net interest expense should approximate $450 million. Liquidity is expected to remain in line with our $1 billion minimum target. Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 23.5% for the year. And we are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $5.75 to $6.10 per share as we grow our business, drive out costs and create shareholder value.","Now we'll return to Noel for additional commentary. Noel?","Noel White","Thank you, Stewart. In summary, we remain focused on stabilizing volatility and growing earnings in Prepared Foods, as well as our value-added and the international businesses. We are facing several challenges this year, we do every year. And we have successfully managed them while continuing to thrive and grow the company. We're also aware of circumstances that could provide upward potential and we will maximize those opportunities.","For the long term, our growth prospects are intact. Our Chicken Prepared Foods and Fresh Meat businesses, are now each earning approximately $1 billion a year. We have the mindset of continuous improvement and continuous innovation. We have a strategy focused on protein, whether that's animal protein or plant protein. We have the products and the brands, consumers demand. We have plenty to be excited about, as we continue to grow this Company","Our fiscal second quarter is typically our most challenging. The pork and chicken environment is very different than a year ago and we won't have the earnings benefit from the divested businesses. So we have a tougher comparison versus Q2 of last year, though we haven't encountered anything unexpected so far in the quarter. We're looking forward to a strong second half of the year, and we're confident in our ability to deliver on occasions of $5.75 to $6.10 per share.","And finally, Stewart and I regret that we won't be at the CAGNY Conference, we apologize for canceling on late notice, but we will be handling the BRF Thailand-European acquisition and the upcoming bond offering.","That concludes our prepared remarks and we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Thank you, Mr. White. The first question will come from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson","Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So maybe first, I was hoping I could dig in a little bit on the updated guidance in the Chicken segment. You've changed the margin outlook by, something on the order of 150 basis points to 175 basis points from kind of near 8 to above 6. And I'm trying to just understand how much of that is the increments of Keystone layering into the business versus a change in the outlook for the legacy or existing business that you were guiding to in November? And so far, as the legacy business guidance change, can you help us understand what has changed from a pricing cost perspective that has caused you to remain in the forecast?","Noel White","Yes, sure, Adam. The change was in fact to almost entirely to our legacy business. In the November call, there is a lot of pricing that was not complete, particularly on the tray pack side. That business is largely complete and that is by far the best reason that we've revised the guidance for the corporate segment. So Keystone had little to no effect on the change.","Adam Samuelson","Okay, that's very helpful. And just maybe then digging in on the tray pack pricing, is it purely tray pack pricing? I think on the prepared, for the process pricing and maybe just a little bit more color around the tray pack pricing environment that led to a more tempered outlook?","Noel White","Yes, sure. It is the tray pack pricing, Adam. So within the businesses that we operate, whether it's our value-add businesses or small bird business or big bird business, pricing outside of tray pack was almost exactly as we expected. There was some pressure on the tray pack pricing, that was greater than what we expected, and that is what has led to the revision in expectation.","Operator","And the next question will be from Jeremy Scott of Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Scott","Hey, good morning. When you stack up all the acquisitions you've made in the Chicken industry in the last 12 months or so. Can you give us a sense of what's a reasonable synergy capture, as you start to roll these businesses and when can we expect to see that in the coming years?","Stewart Glendinning","Well, Stewart here. I'll pick that up. I think really, we've sort of announced that acquisition by acquisition, as you know, in Keystone, we announced $50 million worth of expected synergies, that's been our biggest acquisition. We're off to a strong start there, and I can say that we feel confident about delivering those synergies. So to get through each of the following acquisitions, we're happy to talk about those. Specifically on BRF, that's both Chicken and International. Synergies will be smaller there because of the size of the business, but we think that's a great opportunity for our Company.","Jeremy Scott","Great. And just wondering if you could maybe assess the impact of African swine fever on each component of your business. Obviously there is some puts and takes that you might see if things are to get really bad, maybe just give some color there?","Noel White","Yes, sure, Jeremy. The African swine fever, I mean, the different analysts have different outlooks, as to how it could potentially impact your business. I think the general consensus would be that - it's probably a little worse than what's reported. And that would certainly provide upward potential. We do not have built into our forecast effects from African swine fever. But if we do see, particularly the Chinese back in the market, there could be sizable upside benefit to our pork business.","But aside from that, with that increase in exports, we consider the domestic disappearance of protein in total. So if there is more import, it's exported, it also helps both our Beef and our Poultry business as well.","Operator","The next question will be from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Rob Moskow","Hi, thank you. I had a question about all the international activity that's going on here, in terms of acquisitions, and then Donnie King coming back to the business. It's just in my experience that the Tyson has never done a particularly good job of leveraging its domestic experience to buy and operate international businesses. There is been some false starts along the way. And now you've made two acquisitions in the past 12 months and Donnie is going to be running international.","Can you explain why Donnie wanted to come back to run that business segment? How his expertise carries over from domestic to international markets? And I guess, why the change in strategy, what - why now in terms of all this international growth?","Noel White","Yes, sure. So Rob, first of all, we are extremely happy to have Donnie back with us. He's been a talented performer for us in many different parts of our Company. We are always looking to deepen our bench and that's exactly what Donnie brings, is a much deeper bench. Doug Ramsey, who is running our poultry business, now running our McDonald's business, did a great job and that is a growing segment for us. So we look forward to Doug's contributions in the McDonald's. And then we have Chad Martin, who just recently relocated from our Beef business, did a great job in managing our Beef business as well as Poultry.","So we have three extremely strong individuals in running those businesses. On the International side, Rob, you mentioned that we may not have done a great job historically. That's not to say that we cannot do a great job moving forward. In the last quarterly report, I mentioned that 90% of the growth in protein demand is going to occur outside the United States. That is the reason we are establishing a presence in those markets. So we have all the companies in the world that we can deliver the expected results both domestically, as well as internationally.","Rob Moskow","And maybe you could help me, the Brazil Foods assets that you are buying, what's the synergy between those assets and the Keystone Asian export assets or just the Asian assets in general?","Noel White","A couple of things, Rob. We talked about the European business that gives us not only a manufacturing base in Europe, but also sales, distribution and licensing platform to bring product from Southeast Asia, Thailand in particular to Europe. The facilities are also complementary, the Keystone assets that we owned in addition to four facilities that come with BRF. They are also complementary to each other. And let me go back, Rob, and make one other point. In your question you asked about a change in strategies. There has been no change in strategy.","In the last call I said that the strategy that was in place was based on value added products and international. And that's exactly what we are executing is what I told you in November.","Operator","And the next question will be from Heather Jones of The Vertical Group. Please go ahead.","Heather Jones","Good morning. Quick question on your domestic chicken business. So you mentioned that tray pack pricing came in, the contracting came in lower than expected. I was wondering when would those contracts be renewed and given that contracting, how much exposure do you have in your domestic chicken business to benefit if pricing does come in better than expected for 2019? The markets rallied, you mentioned the potential positive impact ASF could have on domestic protein availability. So how are you positioned to benefit now if pricing does improve as we move through 2019?","Noel White","Sure, Heather. Tray pack pricing, there is not one common date that pricing becomes effective for all customers. It's over roughly a six months period of time that would start away from late fall and winter through spring. Each customer pricing begins to have an effect at a different time. As far as the strengthening in pricing, we have in fact seen some strength in pricing over the course of the last 30 days or so. We were at historic lows in the month of December; we've seen some strengthening since then. So that is in fact a benefit to us. We have put some volume back around us, that I talked about in November that needs to be done. So our sales organization has done a very nice job in putting that volume back around us, which does help us in our buy-versus-growth strategies. So that's been helpful.","And then on the pricing side, with what we are in the market buying, we are back in the markets, looking to buy product as well. Demand through the month of January was extraordinarily strong due to what we believe a number of factors where that continues into February is yet to be seen, but demand in total was very strong.","Heather Jones","Okay. Thank you. My follow-up is on, just thinking about your Chicken business, so you've done two international acquisitions. Just when you're looking at that business holistically on a global basis, do you believe there are any deficiencies in the domestic platform that need to be sold in or is your focus solely on building out the international piece of that business?","Noel White","No. Heather, we'll always look to stabilize our earnings within poultry itself. So if opportunities become available, we will certainly look at them, but the primary focus is not either poultry or international, it's value-added foods into a lesser degree international. We've made, obviously, most recently a number of acquisitions on the international side on poultry-based, but primary focus is going to be in value-added foods in growing that sector. So we will be opportunistic in looking for those opportunities, but it's focused on prepared and to a lesser degree on the international side.","Operator","And the next question will be from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Piken","Yes, hi. I know you guys had mentioned last quarter that you weren't going to specifically call out the Financial Fitness savings, but are you guys still overall on track and is the $200 million per year still the right run rate to use?","Noel White","The short answer will be yes, Michael. That we don't have the depth and detail of the tracking. Stewart mentioned on the last call that, we do follow, but not in significant detail like we were doing before. But yes, all the initiatives, all the efforts, all the tracking is still there, and we are in fact delivering.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes, just a couple of things to add, Michael. Basically, what we did is we took all those run rates and we bake them into our budgets this year. So we know that the teams are still accountable to deliver the results. We're making sure that at the bottom line they're showing up, and of course they're tracking the projects to make sure that they're delivering the savings.","Michael Piken","Okay, great. And then my follow-up is, if you could talk a little bit about kind of the margin stability of Keystone, and some of your recent acquisitions, in rendering and even BRF. Are these going to be a little bit more margin stable and more volatile relative to the rest of your Chicken portfolio? Thanks.","Stewart Glendinning","Okay. Yes, Michael, the margins would be more stable than other parts of our poultry business, just by the types of businesses, whether it's domestic or international with Keystone. We have a number of large customers that we work very closely with them and we won't see the highs, we won't see the lows. So in general, I would say, the margin structure is much more stable. And the same thing would be true with some of the other acquisitions that we've made, such as API or rendering business are relatively stable margins. And then in my prepared remarks, I talked about Smart Chicken, which is also more stable in their earnings profile as well.","Operator","The next question will be from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Theurer","Yes. Hi, good morning and thank you very much for that. So just to understand quickly on the segment reporting. So is it right to assume that Keystone is going to be fully, basically reflected within the Chicken segment? But it did not impact the level of profitability, the downward revision. Just to confirm that.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. So two things. First of all Keystone is split, the US portion you will find in Chicken, the international portion will be baked into other, along with our existing international operations. What we said in the guidance is that, for the year, we expected the profit would be about flat, after adjusting for some of the integration expenses.","Benjamin Theurer","Okay, thanks for that. And then on the financing needs, you mentioned you're going to go out now with two acquisitions done, Keystone, Brazil Foods to do a proper bond market financing. So you've said something about the $100 million and then obviously you have some maturities this year, they're going to be paid down, you're going to refinance them within the bond. Just to get a little bit of a sense what your outlook on debt capital markets, what we should assume for that in terms of what - that's going to be raised and how interest expense is going to look out into next year then.","Stewart Glendinning","You got it, okay. Well, couple of things. So first of all, of course, as you'll notice from the past years, we have been focused on ensuring we get the right deleverage and that you will see that continue. In terms of the upcoming financing, we wanted to get through this BRF deal, so we could go to the market on a clean way to raise funds, both for Keystone and for a BRF at the same time. So you should think about amounts that sort of approximate that as we go to market. We do have some tranches coming to maturity later this year, and we haven't taken a specific choice on how we will refinance those, but you can expect that they will be refinanced and not all paid-off.","Operator","And the next question will be from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone. Coming back to the BRF deal. Can you characterize that in terms of what proportion of that is more value-added products versus how much of it is more commodity poultry operations. And given that, what's that likely to do to the margin structure of the Chicken segment. Thank you, and I'll pass it along.","Noel White","Yes. Sure, Alexia. The mix of the BRF business is almost entirely all value-added, very little raw commodity type products. So, almost all of that is value-added product.","Stewart Glendinning","And in terms of the impact on Chicken overall, remember this actually will sit in the international segment. So it won't affect Chicken at all relative to, yes relative to International, it will be a nice add to that business and will help drive both synergy growth internationally along with growing profitability. You refer to Noel's remarks in which he talk to our existing business in which that business is profitable is improving, you layer on Keystone, and then you layer on top, this acquisition, we start to have a good looking international business.","Operator","The next question will be from Rebecca Scheuneman of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Rebecca Scheuneman","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I was wondering if you could share what the organic volume and price dynamic look like within the Chicken segment?","Stewart Glendinning","Rebecca, we will need to get back with you, and the reason that I hesitate is because we made an acquisition with API, which has sizable volume impact, which also affects the overall pricing, I noted. So I think what you're looking for some specifics of the businesses outside some of these other areas of required. I suggest, yes, Jon Kathol can follow-up with you and give you more detail on that.","Rebecca Scheuneman","Okay, that would be great. And then my follow-up would be just on the margin impact. On the API business as well, I assume that, although I know it's more stable that it would also be a lower margin business and that would be another hurdle for that segment to overcome in 2019?","Noel White","No, not necessarily, Rebecca. We do have some, you know a bit of depreciation - we will be paying for a while. But now it is - it is not dilutive to their return on sales. The rendering businesses has been good for us. API was a very good company and now it should not be expected to be dilutive to their return on sales.","Stewart Glendinning","Particularly once we consider the synergies that are going to be coming from that business.","Operator","The next question will be from Ken Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Zaslow","Hey, good morning everyone. Just one quick one. I know in your opening remarks you said that there you look to optimize some of the opportunities that might come your way and create upside. I think that's --I didn't write it down perfectly clearly, but I think that was the implication. What opportunities were you looking or thinking about that would create more upside or that you would be able to capitalize on? I don't remember the exact wording but that would seem like the implication.","Noel White","Yes, I think, Ken there is a couple of them. One would be, and the question was asked earlier about African swine fever and\/or other trade opportunities, I would say that from a trade standpoint in the last couple of years it's been difficult, whether it's with Canada, or with Mexico or current disadvantages that we have with Japan, within Asia. So I would say anything that is beneficial on the trade side could provide substantial upside.","Our exports continue to grow year-over-year, but they can grow a lot more than that. So it's those specific areas that will enhance global disappearance that can provide upside to us. At this point, we're not building anything in, on the grain side, it's our assumptions, we use a forward grain curve of what the futures market look like. So that can be an advantage, it can be a disadvantage. But right now we're not assuming any benefit at all.","Kenneth Zaslow","Okay. And then might my second question is, can you talk about your resource allocation to integrate for acquisitions? That is usually not a recipe, an easy recipe, so can you talk about how your resources are allocating to ensure that you have these four acquisitions, that are going to be integrated without any execution issues? And does this leave any opportunity to do further acquisitions that we kind of like - let me digest this, and how do you think about that?","Noel White","Right. Ken, we put together a very strong Integration Management Office that we have fully dedicated resources and everything is following the plan. So we fortunately have some experience now behind us in doing it well. The team that we have in place is delivering exactly what we expected to deliver both from an integration standpoint, synergy standpoint. So there is been no surprises. As far as continuing to make acquisitions, as I mentioned, we do look for going to the bond market, we will be very disciplined in what we would take a look at.","Next, it would have to deliver a strong financial return, being a geographic area that might be attractive. But we are fully committed to integrating what we have bought, there are financing in place and then take a very structured, disciplined approach on anything else we might consider.","Kenneth Zaslow","I appreciate it.","Stewart Glendinning","So one other thing, Ken is that, when you look at the kind of acquisitions that we've done, there is a strong overlap with the kind of business that those companies are performing and our existing business and that frankly just acquisition a lot - integration a lot easier.","Operator","And the next question will be from Akshay Jagdale of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Akshay Jagdale","Good morning. Thanks for the question. So first question just on Chicken, stick a step back as you assess the business in its current form. How would you say investors should think about the linkage between your margins and the commodity margins that everyone looks at, right? I know in the past there was some talk about like, okay we will do 600 basis points, 700 basis points better than the market et cetera, but what's a good way for us? There is so many moving parts, it's very complicated but how would you say we should think about the business?","Because you started at 10% margins a year ago and now we're guiding to 6%, so there is clearly a step down. Trying to understand how much of that is, just the market being really, really weak versus your operations? So help us understand that. And do you think maybe that relationship is going to get better over the next 3 to 5 years?","Noel White","Yes, I'd talk about the way that I think about, Akshay, and it's been several years since we've talked about, the spread that you referred to in your question. And what we said at that point in time is that we were not going to hit the high of the highs when the markets are very strong, very high. And we're not going to be at the low of the lows, when the markets are down, around breakeven. And the numbers are very close to what you just described. I think what we said is that we - our expected spread was between 500 and 600 - closer to 500 basis points when markets were down or around breakeven.","And when a couple of years ago the markets were very strong and there were commodity companies that we were generating a 15 plus percent return. At that point in time we were generating around a 12% return. So we weren't hitting the highs and we are not hitting the lows. So the fact that we're around six right now and from what we can tell, many others in the industry and in the commodity space were around breakeven. It's very close to that historical spread that you describe.","So it's not much different than the expectation I think the Stewart has a comment. I think before we go on I think that this is the part of the store that's being missed is what the performance of Prepared Foods has been. They had a record 2018. They had a record first quarter. You go back four years ago it was $4 billion business at about a 1% return. Today it's an $8 billion business that's generating a $1 billion right. So I understand all the questions on poultry. However, the stories that you should be taking away from this is the remarkable performance of what our Prepared Foods Group has done.","Akshay Jagdale","And just if I can follow up you know the opportunity is there an opportunity to make the chicken business more like the Prepared Foods business long time and how are you addressing that.","Noel White","I'd say that that's what we do every day, Akshay, is to try and increase margin increase the mix stabilizes those earnings so that that is a process. I wouldn't tell you that that's something that you should expect to see over the course of the next 12 to 24 months but that is what we do every single day is to try and grow the earnings within our poultry business as well as provide more stability within that business as well.","Operator","And the next question will be a follow up from Heather Jones of the vertical group. Please go ahead.","Heather Jones","Thanks for taking the follow up. Noel you mentioned that it looks as if ASF could be a little worse than and I don't know what you're referencing but you mentioned a little worse. We've things we've read and people we've spoken to with feet on the ground and all the numbers are now moving closer to 15% to 20% other hurt with that no shock you or do you think that could be close to reality.","Noel White","Heather, to be honest with you, I can't answer that. And even within the analyst group within two days I saw two different reports. It said is this worse than what's expected on the other hand it's not as bad as what's been reported. So I think, Heather, re-speculation on my behalf to say it's either better or worse. And I'm just, I'm not comfortable speculating exactly what the situation might be.","Operator","And the next question will be a follow-up from Benjamin Theurer of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Theurer","Yes. Thank you very much for giving the opportunity just on Brazil Foods just quickly following up with. I remember right, in your prepared remarks, you said something like the transaction price something like a little under 10x. So does that mean you assume something like whatever $30 million, $40 million of EBITDA because just checking to the results of the company used to report in the assets. It looks more like $50 million to $60 million. So just to understand what's the base of your assumption is that normalized EBITDA, is that something that is a trailing EBITDA, just to understand what we're number came from.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes, you've actually hit the nail on the head. It is a normalized EBITDA. If we use the trailing number, the multiple would look much, much lower, but that would include periods before the ban on shipments from Brazil. So we normalized the number. I'll tell you that we feel really good about the price that we paid, we feel great about the overlap with our operations in Thailand and our ability to drive Foods that our value-added this goes right along with the comments that Noel has already made around Prepared Foods as companies looking at taking the margins up and this is, this is not only part of an international strategy but also part of that value-added approach.","Benjamin Theurer","Okay. So, if I may, just on that, so Brazil foods used to run the European operations per shipments from Thailand to Europe, but also from Brazil into Europe and then basically for processing and selling and using the distribution network, they had in Europe. So now, you obviously have the footprint in Asia, acquired through the Brazil Foods transaction, you have the Keystone assets prior to that is pure way of thinking order certain of your plants from the US. That could also kind of feed into the European distribution networks which is using what you can potentially export from US into Europe or is that not an option.","Noel White","It's at this point, it's not an option. There is very little if no poultry being exported from the United States to Europe. At some point in time, could that be case certainly. What we were looking for is not only the manufacturing capabilities within Europe. But the ability for us to ship from other low-cost supply regions globally into that market. This provides both from a manufacturing standpoint, as well as the sales and distribution standpoint. Any opportunities that we see would simply be additive to that which could at some point, the United States, but that's not currently the case.","Operator","And the final question today will be a follow-up from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson","Thanks, I appreciate the follow up. I'm just a clarification on M&A and make sure I understanding, kind of, the messaging, you are going to the bond market to finance Keystone Brazil Foods. Can you talk about what you view as your incremental kind of acquisition capacity or dry powder after these acquisitions are completed? And is this signal that you're going to the bond market that you're not actively pursuing additional M&A right now. I just to make sure I understanding, kind of how that ties together.","Stewart Glendinning","Well, I mean I'd say that the first of all, we never comment on any prospective acquisitions as you know, but clearly we want to go through the bond market in a clean way for our investors.","Adam Samuelson","And just as you look at the dry powder that you would think you have after the pending bond. How much capacity do you think you could take on?","Stewart Glendinning","Look, I don't want to pin down to a specific number, because it's going to be the little dependent on rating agencies. The kind of acquisition, et cetera, but it would be measured in the several billions.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Noel White for his closing comments.","Noel White","Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in Tyson Foods.

Thanks for joining us today. At Tyson Foods, we continue to grow our business through differentiated capabilities and deliver Financial Fitness through continuous improvement as we seek to the feed the world with the fastest growing protein brands.","Overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made in the second quarter and the first half of the fiscal year. As we shared our on our Q1 call, we knew we are facing challenging conditions and despite these challenges and additional headwinds we delivered solid second quarter results in all four segments.","Based on the hard work of our resilient team we are in a good position in the second half of the fiscal year and we expect to reach our annual adjusted earnings guidance of between $6.55 and $6.70 a share.","As international demand for protein continues to increase, we are positioned to meet it with well established network of global offices. We have $1 billion brands and rapid growth brands and we continue to build capabilities across each of our supply chains that serve our segments.","With our at home or away from home we serve consumers wherever they eat with breadth and depth that give us unmatched insights into consumer behavior, we are partnering now more than ever with our customers to drive growth together.

We are on track to deliver at least $200 million in fiscal 2018 and we are building momentum for fiscal 2019.","In Q1 we spoke on transportation cost challenges. Increased freight costs affected all four segments that had a net impact of about $0.14 per share for the quarter. Also as I mentioned on our last call, we took early action in the form of pricing to mitigate the impact to our margins.","While we were climbing the hill, the grade steepened and now we are estimating the full-year impact to be roughly $250 million. We will be working nearly cover the increase for the remainder of the year through pricing and additional cost reductions program such as improving truck weights, lead times and continues improvement projects.","We are expecting the cost impact in Q3 to decline and in Q4 we should be close to full recovery. However, the gap on cost recovery for the fiscal is estimated to be $155 million or about $0.31 in EPS. Our guidance includes these variances and assumes no additional cost increases.","Going forward, product prices much reflect the true cost that we cannot subsidize the increased freight. In addition freight, we are seeing increased labor cost as we invest in our team members to increase productivity, efficiency and yields.","We have already had positive results from our programs to reduce team member turnover and improve both safety and productivity. These types of initiatives are added cost now, but we expect to return on our investment overtime in addition to simply being the right thing to do for our team members.","Moving to my commentary on each segment. Please note the references to operating income and operating margin will be an on adjusted basis. In the Beef segment in Q2, we generated operating income of $120 million with a 3.3% operating margin. Volume was up 1.8% and that\u2019s a good outcome, especially considering poor weather conditions which prevented us from running some of our plants during the quarter.","Revenue increased 5.6% as domestic and international demand for U.S. Beef remain strong. Our Beef exports were up 22% versus the same quarter last year and despite all the conversation about trade and tariffs, we haven't seen a significant impact on our Beef business. That said, trade flow is incredibly important to Tyson Foods and we continue to urge our political leaders to support our efforts to provide certainty in the markets.","As we look for more ways to add value in our Beef products in domestic markets, our premium programs continue to do very well. Our Open Prairie Natural line of Angus Group, Angus Beef grew volume of 26% compared to second quarter last year.","Barring any disruptions we anticipate the favorable operating environment in Beef to continue into 2020. The U.S. cattle herd expansion is slowing, but there is still ample supply of livestock and demand for U.S. Beef continues to be robust. Given supply forecast of the regions in which we operate and our continued focus on productivity, we expect the segment\u2019s operating margin to be above 6% for the fiscal year.","In the Pork segment, we generated second quarter operating income of $79 million with a 6.2% margin. Revenue was down 2.8% as livestock prices fell, we slightly reduced volume to balance our production with customer demand. Winter weather was a challenge in our Pork segment as well creating staffing difficulties and at times also preventing us from running some of our plants.","We are innovating within the Pork segment to grow our margins and we are seeing success in our branded and premium Pork programs. In Q2, our Chairman\u2019s Reserve brand, grew volume by 12%, which includes our new Chairman's Reserve prime brand extension and our Open Prairie Natural line grew volume nearly 75% versus Q2 last year.","Customer demand for our Case Ready products overall has continued to grow, the market dynamic support an expansion of our case ready capacity. For the year, we believe our Pork segment will continue to execute well, hog supply is expected to be up to 2% to 3%. However there's still a significant amount of new production capacity that has pressured margins.","We are projecting that our operating margin for the year should be around 8% and we expect more hogs will be available in the fall, which should be supportive of the strong operating environment in Pork heading into our fiscal year 2019.","The Chicken segment operating income of $288 million generated in Q2 with a 9.7% operating margin. The volume was up 2% on strong demand and an incremental volume from AdvancePierre, while revenue increased nearly 6%. Segment benefited from $23 million in Financial Fitness savings.","Our Chicken segment also faced challenges in Q2 consistent with USDA reports a production and hatch were down pressuring supplies. However, demand for our Chicken was so strong that created supply inefficiencies.","Nevertheless, we are committed to getting customers and consumers to Chicken they want, which in some cases meant adding staff, moving products and running plans on weekends. But most importantly, we were successful in meeting and in some cases exceeding our customer\u2019s expectations.","Also within the quarter to optimize returns on Tyson Any'tizers wings will reduce the package rate, knowing it would result in a temporary volume decline, which is evident in the IRI Nielsen Data. It also resulted in a temporary decline in share that\u2019s beginning to rebound. There is a right move to get an appropriate margin for a branded product with strong consumer demand.","Despite the challenges, our Chicken segment operating income was up nearly 15% year-to-date versus last year. Giving us confidence in our expectation of an operating margin of around 10% for the year and carrying momentum into fiscal 2019.","Moving to Prepared Foods, the segment produced $222 million in operating margin with the margin of 10.3%. The nearly 11% volume increased for the quarter is primarily attributed with the incremental volume of AdvancePierre, which also contributed to the revenue increase of nearly 23% in Q2.","The segment benefited from $38 million of Financial Fitness savings. Of importance to the Prepared Foods segment, is a significant milestone we achieved 2 weeks ago. We successfully completed the integration of the AdvancePierre and Original Philly businesses ordered to cash process into our systems allowing us to pursue synergy capture on scheduled and additional providing customers the ability to combined Prepared Foods orders.","An inherent advantage in our Prepared Foods business was access to protein from our Beef, Pork and Chicken segments, we are building on that strong foundation to upgrade our product mix to more value added proteins and deliver long-term sustainable growth.","In doing so, we incurred several one-time costs in Q2 related to certain purchasing contracts, exiting non-protein businesses and expanding capacity at a plant. Even with those events, the Prepared Foods segment delivered strong results and is on track to deliver an operating margin of around 11% for the year.","Let\u2019s move from our segment results to our sales channels. Price in retail continues to outperform total food and beverage in all but two of the top 10 CPG retail food manufacturers in both sales dollars and volume over the last 52 weeks. Of note, the two confectionary companies ahead of us benefited disproportionally from two week search in the 52 weeks period.","Tyson Core 9 retail product lines continue to grow albeit at a slower pace as we lapsed strong comps but we are achieving our goal of outperforming category growth. In particularly, the Jimmy Dean brand continues to drive significant growth and Hillshire Snacking was named the Top 10 IRI New Product Pace Setter for the year. It\u2019s also worth noting that we increased our customer brands volume share within the Core 9 categories through strong customer partnerships that are focused on growth.","In food service, check size maintained the steady 2% increase we have seen for the past several quarters, which continues to drive growth in food service. Within broadline distribution, Tyson\u2019s Focus 6 product lines are up nearly 6% in volume over the prior year, which is more than three times of growth for the total distribution channel and five of the six are driving growth in their categories.","Innovation continues to fuel our growth engine, and today we are bringing innovation to our retail category that hasn\u2019t seen in years, individually frozen Chicken. Using consumer insights, our team identified an opportunity to disrupt this category by providing a meal solution.","In April, we launched Tyson Dinner Kit that consists of frozen raw Chicken, precut vegetables, a starch and a sauce and they are found in the case for raw frozen Chicken is sold. We have also launched fully cooked dinner kits positioned in the freezer case alongside of fully cut Tyson Chicken products and snacks. These products are on trend and because they are frozen the shelf life is extended substantially for both the retailer and the consumer.","We are adding to our snack line as well with Tyson Any'tizers Snackers. These are twist on a loaded potato skin using crispy Chicken instead of potatoes. With this product, we are beginning to transition to new packaging as we refresh the Tyson brand.","We are carrying the mindset of innovation across the business and becoming more agile. We are transforming the model where we launch, learn and then tip it quickly and that starts with our innovation lab where we are developing new products that solve for sustainability challenges.","At the same time, we are working with two business incubators that directly connect us to the startup communities in Silicon Valley in Chicago. In short, we are giving people reasons to think differently about Tyson Foods.","Looking ahead, we see significant opportunity to continue to grow our business. We are building on a strong foundation and we will keep challenging the status quo to drive growth across through our iconic brands and our customer\u2019s brands. Our team is excited and motivated to deliver a great fiscal year in 2018 that will set us up for an even better 2019.","And now Stewart will take us through the financials. Stewart.","Stewart Glendinning","Thanks Tom and good morning everyone. We delivered record adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS for the first half of fiscal 2018 despite the challenges that Tom discussed. Each of our segment's performed well as our diversified portfolio of protein brands and ongoing investments continue to provide strong stable growth.","Revenues for the first half of fiscal 2018 were up nearly 10% compared to prior year and were up over 7% in our second quarter to $9.8 billion as total Company volume grew 1.9%. Adjusted operating income for the first half of fiscal 2018 was a record $1.6 billion up 2% over the strong comparable period last year. Adjusted operating income for Q2 was $694 million up 11% over the last year.","Total Company adjusted return on sales was 8.2% for the first half of the year and 7.1% in Q2. Our record adjusted EPS for the first half of fiscal 2018 was $3.08 which includes a $0.38 benefit due to Tax Reform and results in an 18% increase versus the strong comparable period last year.","Our operating cash flow through the first two quarters was over $1.1 billion and we spent $559 million on capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $206 million as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering returns well excess of our cost of capital.","During the first half of the year, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $180 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the first half of the year was 22.8% and for the second quarter was 23.8%.","Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.3 times on a pro forma basis, including AdvancePierre's results for full 12 months. We expect to resume share repurchases once our leverage nears our target of two times, which we expect to occur during the fiscal 2018. Including cash of $198 million, net debt was $9.8 billion and total liquidity was just shy of $1 billion. Net interest expense was $170 million during the first six months.","We expect approximately $300 million of incremental cash flow in fiscal 2018 as a result of Tax Reform and in the second quarter, we invested $109 million of our tax savings in one-time bonuses for our front line team members. This investment was adjusted out for EPS purposes. Please see the reconciliation in our earnings release for the impact by segment.","As we have demonstrated, our capital allocation priorities are focused on driving shareholder value and growing the business. We will remain disciplined in our long-term focus as we deploy cash to reduce debt and grow our business organically through sustainable operational efficiency and capital expansion projects along with investing in innovation and brand building.","We also have the flexibility and the investment grade credit ratings to acquire businesses that support our strategic objectives. And of course, we will continue to return cash to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividend growth.","Now, here are some additional thoughts on fiscal 2018. We expect top line sales of between $40 billion to $41 billion, which is growth of around 6%. The expected increase is attributed to base business volume growth as well as incremental AdvancePierre sales of approximately $1.1 billion.","Net interest expense should approximate $340 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be around 24%. CapEx is expected to approximate $1.3 billion as we focus on capacity expansion and operational improvements that create long-term shareholder value. We have a great pipeline of capital projects, but due a slower rate of spending than originally planned, we have reduced our projected CapEx this year by $100 million.","Based on our average share price in Q2, we expect our average diluted shares to be around $370 million before share repurchases. Last fall, we mentioned, we would evaluate our existing normalized ranges for our segments and I want to provide you an update on our conclusion.","As we transform into a modern food company, we believe our historical normalized ranges are no longer reflective of our long-term growth opportunities as we continue to reshape our business with a prudent capital allocation strategy and execute strategic acquisitions.","As a result, going forward, we will provide an annual outlook for each segment focused on our margin expectations rather than be indexed to a historical range. We are reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of $6.55 to $6.70 even with the challenging conditions we experienced in the first half of the year. Note, many of these will continue to be headwinds in the back half as well, we will continue to pull all the levers to mitigate these costs and pursue recovery through pricing.","This concludes our remarks. Operator, we are ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Glendinning. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will be from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Goldman","Hi, good morning, everybody.","Thomas Hayes","Hey, good morning, Ken.","Stewart Glendinning","Good morning.","Kenneth Goldman","Tom I\u2019m not going to congratulate you on the Celtics for the series over, so we have to wait on that. I just wanted to make sure I understood you right. I think last quarter you expected $200 million in higher freight costs and you said the majority of which is going to be recovered through pricing. I don\u2019t think you mentioned the specific gap. Now you are talking about 250 in higher costs, you call that $155 million gap. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what the gap was you were expecting last quarter and maybe where you are making this up in your P&L? Because it sounds like pricing, I\u2019m just doing this quick math here is not going to be quite the offset you expected, but it sounds like your EPS guidance is being where it is, if your EPS guidance is being maintained. So I guess, I\u2019m trying to figure out where the other offsets are? Or maybe I\u2019m just not reading this, right?","Thomas Hayes","No, I think you are right Ken. We said last quarter that it was going to be about $200 million and I have said in my prepared remarks, it\u2019s up to 250 and so there is, you know what was it difficult situation as it relates to transportation as we saw it emerging, actually played out and then it got that worse. We knew it was going to be a drag in this quarter. I don\u2019t know how much more clear, I could have been on that at CAGNY and even the Q1 call.","And we said that for this quarter, about $0.14 in EPS. Nobody likes to take in the cost increases, and we go to answer your question about how we get it back, it\u2019s through pricing. And our brand strength matters also how we partner with our customers is important and it really is something that we are focused on getting phenomenal through pricing, but then also we have to take costs out.","As I mentioned again in my prepared remarks, truck weights and lead times and smoothing out the supply chain, there are other continuous improvement projects we are pursuing. So we are simultaneously pulling the lever of pricing as well as all the cost reduction levers.","There is quite a bit of focus on this, as you can well imagine, inside the Company. Yes, we are maintaining our guidance. I do believe that we will be sort of on that low end of the range, given what we have seen, the cost coming on freight and that is all baked into the forecast, but it is causing us to stay closer to the lower end of the range.","The other thing that I would like to just to make sure that everybody takes away is that Q4 will be much stronger than Q3. So as get a lot of these pricing moves in place as the projection very strong Q4, much stronger than Q4. And like I said maintaining that full-year projection, but certainly at the lower end of that.","Kenneth Goldman","Okay. Thank you for that. It very helpful. And my follow-up would be on AdvancePierre. You tweaked your guidance down lower for AdvancePierre sales. I think you did last quarter as well. I also recall last quarter, you really weren\u2019t concerned, I think the reduction had to do with costs and pricing, a really like a lack of demand. Can you just update us, if that\u2019s the same dynamic this quarter?","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. I will pick that up. I mean certainly the same dynamic this, think if you go and look at the volume, we are up over 1%. And if you looked at dollar volume were up more than twice. So we feel good about AdvancePierre.","Kenneth Goldman","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson","I guess my first question, maybe continuing on some of Ken\u2019s question and really just wanted drill down to understand what has changed in the outlook versus prior, I guess specifically in Chicken. You took the volume guidance in Chicken and came down marginally, the margin guidance came down about 100 basis points for the full-year. Can you help kind of just bridge kind of how those expectations have changed between freight, feed, the volume mix, et cetera?","Thomas Hayes","So hey Adam. What I would say is we feel really good about our delivery in Chicken so far this year, so we feel great about the full-year. We meet our expectations, just to see around 10%. It\u2019s going to be a fantastic year for Chicken because we are also growing volumes. So EBIT year-over-year should improve.","The thing that is obviously a challenge for us as called out in prepared remarks, certainly we have hatchability. It\u2019s been an issue for us and we expect that we are going to continue to make progress on that. And the challenge that we do see for sure is that overcoming this first half where we had some weekends, where we just weren\u2019t working, the weather, I don\u2019t like to use that as an excuse, but it actually had an impact on us. Those were things that were just following, so the back half looks much stronger.","The higher feed cost environment, at this point everything is sort of based on forward curve, but are certainly its included in our estimates, we do have higher feed costs. So we need to overcome that with pricing. As we have said previous calls, previous years, it takes us a bit of time to overcome that a quarter or two before the pricing goes into the market, but certainly we want to get that back.","And then, I would say in terms of the volume growth, I couldn\u2019t be happier with how the team is progressing. They are doing an excellent job and certainly, we have had a tough second quarter, but that just makes the team that much more excited and engaged to kill it in the back half.","Adam Samuelson","Okay and maybe just thinking about that in a probably different light. It seems like more of the pressure is on the fresh and the live side. I mean, can you talk about, any way you characterized the profitability of the prepared for the process poultry is in the Chicken segment versus first is the live operations and how those two might be working differently. I think there is a lot of concerned in the market related to weaker kind of commodity poultry prices and the impact that would have what some of yourselves. But you do have this large further process businesses that does have that offset and how those two are moving in tandem or in opposite direction at this point?","Thomas Hayes","Yes. So for competitive reason, I\u2019m not going to go into too much detail, Adam. As you can well imagine, we want to make sure we maintain that for our investors, but certainly we are focused on matching our supply with our demand .So as we have great further process business cuts and par fried, we are seeing massive growth there. We have a new plant that came up and that\u2019s is fall.","However, we like where we are positioned as it relates to total demand. There is no question that different parts of the business are in different amounts depending upon the year and so that is not something that is new to us, but we feel like we are demonstrating is regardless of that, we continue to deliver strong margins.","So we deliver 10% margin. The rates that we have and continually driving, they fluctuate a bit, but we say are stable. And so that mix that we really focus on and that maybe a little bit unsatisfactory to you to not have the break out of the individual pieces, but you know I like where we sit. Stewart do you want to add?","Stewart Glendinning","The only thing I would always say is that you look at the performance of the business, the business had some challenges in the first quarter, Tom called those out, sorry in the second quarter had some challenges, but I think when you look the way the business is positioned from the back part of the year, it\u2019s going to be serving both parts of the market. What is great about our business and the reason why the margin is so strong is exactly the piece you have called out, it\u2019s that further process part of our chicken business and that part of the business is strong.","Adam Samuelson","Okay that\u2019s a helpful color, I will pass it on. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will be from Farha Aslam of Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.","Farha Aslam","Hi good morning. Tom, could you share with us some color on your beef business. It\u2019s look like you anticipate a very strong back half in order to hit your 6% plus margins. What are the current dynamics that you are seeing that gives you confidence on that number?","Thomas Hayes","Yes. Farha, it\u2019s definitely the cattle on feed. So we know there is going to be in our regions. So cattle on feed overall, but certainly in our regions we feel like we are well set out. As expected Q2 was tough, like it was really choppy and 3.3%, even though it\u2019s above sort of historical rates not what we were playing for. To be about 6% for 2018, it\u2019s really on the back of those cattle on feed reports and knowing that the supplies in our regions are exceptionally good.","Farha Aslam","That\u2019s helpful. And then bigger picture question going into next year. Currently, Tyson\u2019s stock is trading at about five-year low, largely because there is questions about your ability to grow earnings for next year. You have moved way from giving kind of segment level margins outlook. Could you give us some bigger picture color on where you expect to drive growth into next year without of course giving particular guidance for the year?","Thomas Hayes","Yes. So Farha, when we have talk about this historically there has been - almost like we are bound between in these ranges and that\u2019s something they do, you are a very commoditized company. I understand the purpose that they served in the past. But we want to continue to at the best margins, while we are continuing to grow the business. So we can deliver year-over-year improved EBIT.","As a relates to 2019. Clearly too early to totally quantify, but we see some really strong themes developing across the portfolio. Certainly the value added businesses are expected to continue on the growth trajectory, we are in great categories. We have great businesses both Prepared Foods and Chicken will benefit from a higher value-added mix for sure.","Strong demand is supported by the continuous improvement in our Financial Fitness program that we have, the more volume that we drive, the stronger the cost reduction is going to be and we continue to go faster in the categories we plan. As I said in the prepared remarks, getting the businesses on one IT platform is enormous because it not only allows customers to place one order, but that also with the distribution centers, everything just starts to kick in.","So another tailwind for us would be accelerating cost improvement into 2019. We expect strong back half which will certainly us a momentum as I called up before Q4 better than Q3. Not for nothing. Any M&A benefit will be incremental to that. So there certainly we have a strong balance sheet and we sure we can talk about capital allocation, but we feel great about where we are positioned as it relates taking advantage of M&A.","And the last thing I will say is that commodity businesses, Beef, Pork and parts of maybe the Chicken business will benefit from increased supply, counterbalanced certainly with global and domestic demand increases, have get a lot of noise as it relates to tariffs and so forth. But all the things that we are seeing in terms of themes developing for fiscal 2019 are all very positive and we are excited.","Farha Aslam","And it capital allocation. Your share repurchase program, do you anticipate starting that in the third quarter or fourth quarter?","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. So let\u2019s be clear on that. Of course, we have always had couple of aspects to share repurchase, it\u2019s been ongoing in respect of offset through our long-term incentive programs and nothing has changed in that. So we will have a share repurchase ongoing there. Relative to more discretionary share repurchase, we are not saying specifically when. We are saying we like to see our leverage come down. We expect that to acceptable levels, and we expect that to happen in the second half. I don\u2019t want to make myself prudent to say it\u2019s going to happen in Q3 or Q4. I would like to have the flexibility to make that choice.","Farha Aslam","Appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be Heather Jones of the Vertical Group. Please go ahead.","Heather Jones","Good morning. A quick question. I was wondering, you mentioned earlier in the Chicken segment, you talked about egg production hatch. I was wondering, if you could give us a sense of the magnitude of headwind that\u2019s been, because I would think that that\u2019s something that would abate potentially into 2019. And just wondering, if we could get a sense of how much that\u2019s been a headwind for you guys?","Thomas Hayes","It\u2019s definitely has been a headwind, and it is, our intention is that it will abate by 2019. We haven\u2019t put a lot of emphasis on that because it\u2019s still a bit of an issue, like we are still working through it. And that\u2019s been the best I can say as we are managing through it. It\u2019s not solved yet, but that is getting better.","We expected some decline in egg productivity with a bit of this the trade off in the breast meat yield to go into different breeds. But decline in hatchability has been a bit more than expected. If we just point to the USDA reports, it sounds like the whole industry has seen the same thing, but we feel really good about what Tyson is doing, the progress that we are starting to see, which gives us confidence about 2019. But it is something we continue to work.","Heather Jones","Okay, perfect, thank you. My second is on the Pork business. So this was the lowest margin, both per head and percent since Q3 of 2013. And when you look at the cut out and hog costs during the quarter, that wouldn\u2019t suggest that kind of year-on-year decline you guys had and I know labors up and freights costs are up, but the magnitude was very surprising. So I was just wondering, has been some in how you price that product into Prepared Foods? Or has there been some change in your longer-term hog contracts that aren\u2019t priced off the spot market? Just trying to get a sense so we can know because it was a very big year-on-year change and so I\u2019m just trying to understand that better.","Thomas Hayes","Yes. So remember last year was incredibly high on Pork. And so it was just a exceptional year and so we wish those margins would continue with us. They will not. Our assumptions that are built into our annual outlook of around 8% are strong margins. So certainly, there is nothing that's changed, Heather. We haven\u2019t modify our approach or anything like that. What you are seeing is equilibrating to what will be sort of the new normal.","So that continues to play out about as we expected as new players enter the market. We are not having trouble getting hogs or seeing more hogs coming. That\u2019s also something that gives us a lot of confidence for 2019. The hog supply will meet the harvest capacity. This is something that we just have work through the turbulence, but heading into 2019, we feel really good about the supplies that we anticipate coming into the market in the fall.","Heather Jones","Okay. Thanks so much.","Thomas Hayes","Yes.","Operator","The next question will be from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Couple of questions. The first just getting back to freight and pricing assumptions. Tom as you get into fiscal 2019, I think you said that, that you and the industry will need to keep taking pricing in order to offset these costs going forward. Is your assumption that freight cost inflation could happen again in fiscal 2019, or do you think it will be kind of flat? And are you also saying that, everyone needs to take some more pricing in fiscal 2019, because as it stands today, you have take it some pricing, but you had to offset a lot it just through your own kind of productivity. Is that really the message?","Thomas Hayes","The message for 2019, I would ask you to take away is that we are that going to have the pricing that we need, based on what we see today to have us net to zero if nothing else changed in fiscal 2019. So do I think there is going to be more constantly, it doesn\u2019t feel that way as it relates to the drivers. I think we are doing, everything we can do to get on top of that, and it feels good. What I don\u2019t know is fuel. Like what is going to be the fuel situation in that, to the extent it goes up will look to price with that as well.","As it relates to pricing overall, as you well imagine, I can only speak to what we are facing in Tyson versus the industry. This is an input costs you to recognize by the customers and hopefully the consumer. And we want to continue to provide value and we don\u2019t want this to hurt our earnings, we can\u2019t continue to do the investments that we would to drive growth that we have been driving.","So we are going to play to have it net to zero by the end of Q4 and if costs stayed the same Rob, you should expect that would be overcome. Like, I don\u2019t know about what happens with oil and so forth into 2019.","Robert Moskow","Okay. And a quick follow-up. This is a more esoteric question. There are some byproducts that get exported to China in the pork complex, things that would not get absorbed here domestically. I heard that the value might be $3 ahead. Have you seen those types of exports cutoff and has influenced your Pork margins at all? Or is anyone talking about that internally?","Thomas Hayes","I think it\u2019s a good insight. It hasn\u2019t affected us Rob. If you think about our total business, we sell, we, Tyson less than 0.5% in total sales to China in pork. So it\u2019s about 150 million-ish, I think in 2017. So the tariff and everything that\u2019s going on has created some issues. And certain, demand would be backed up into the, or the supply would be backed up in the U.S..","As it relates to byproducts not a big factor given the small base that are already is that we rely on. The big thing with traffic is what happens to other companies and therefore you know the cost of the supply in the U.S. goes down. That\u2019s not so much byproducts, but I think that\u2019s a good question.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Piken","Yes, hi. Just wanted to touch base a little bit more on the red meat side in particular as we look to the outer years. How much of a big deal is the labor potentially for people to add workers to add second shifts and the ramp of some of the capacity and you have been able to maintain your shifts as high as you want just in terms of labor from a labor perspective?","Thomas Hayes","We have been taking wages out from labor cost is going up. The other things that we are doing is, we are definitely putting more and more emphasis on safety and also something we called upward academy which is bringing skills and training into the plants to train and focus on English as a second language, it could be basic financial skills, things that are allowing us to retain team members more.","Those relates to whether it\u2019s second shifts, we said that we want to do it or just overall sort of labor challenges, I think we are well position to make sure that those don\u2019t affect us. The other thing I would say on this Michael is that, we have been spending quite a bit money on automation and robotics. I would say probably less focused on beef more on probably Chicken and Prepared Foods.","But we also have been spending it on for safety reasons and for otherwise. So the net is feeling that we are in a good position such that we needed to add incremental labor or incremental shifts, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s anything that I feel nervous about.","Michael Piken","Okay, great. And do you expect like those investments in robotics. Is that being done primarily for safety or is that also margin accretive overtime?","Thomas Hayes","Both. Yes. Margin accretive overtime, again we reduced the turnover. Frankly we are not necessarily obtaining that massive reduction in headcount, because what we are doing is as we grow and as putting those automation projects in place those two for transferring and other parts of the plan and just the natural turnover goes down and we like that, that\u2019s a good outcome for us.","Michael Piken","Okay, great. And then the last question is just any updates on the pepperoni plant and any type of accretion you might expect in 2019? Thanks.","Thomas Hayes","On track on the pepperoni projects and it would be nice when we don\u2019t have to talk about it anymore, but I'm happy to talk about it. We have everything in place that we wanted to have in place. Let's say probably on track with a little more optimism as I hear the team talk about what they are going after in terms of bringing new customers or customers that we have back on, the operations they are going really well. So I feel like that is going to be a non-issue after 2019 if we maintain this, they are going to be solved in 2019. But its touch wood things are going really well there.","Stewart Glendinning","Michael the only thing to add is that your question relative to sort of how much, we don\u2019t break that out separately, but what I can say is that's baked both into EPS guidance for this year and of course will be baked into that guidance for next year.","Michael Piken","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will be from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Theurer","Hi good morning Tom, Stewart. Thank you very much for questions. I just wanted to go back a little bit on trade and you mentioned that you are baked on exports and volume growth is very strong. So two things I wanted to check with you. So obviously you mentioned China is not important for you, but clearly for some of your competitors. And we know that the U.S. has always been a very significant exporter of pork products to China. So could you quantify if you have seen a little bit of the headwind by just products that\u2019s not being able to shift or just overloading the market to China and is that to a certain degree as well affecting an oversupply situation in your domestic market where you basically struggle in and then I have a follow-up question on trade.","A - Thomas Hayes","Yeah. Sorry, this is not a little bit of repetitive, but because it is relatively small part for us. I hate to talk a lot about total industry dynamics rather than just talking to what effects Tyson done. But certainly the certainty will help us getting this behind us and not having to be in a situation where we are talking about this a lot.","Question whether or not we will actually be in a situation, where this is an effect. When we had this whole situation emerge where the trade war was looming and pork was going to back up into the U.S. in terms of supply was limit down. Like that day I think on a total hog cost. So the hog cost can way down certainly it backs up to the producer.","I will just reminds you as you well know that we are in the middle and we make our money on the spread. So if we have lots of supply that is generally good thing for us. I guess I will just finish with, its I\u2019m involved in this a lot [indiscernible]. But it seems like it's just as hard to pin down where it's ultimately going to wind down. And I guess being as a person cautiously optimistic I feel like it's going to sort of fine.","Benjamin Theurer","Okay perfect. Thank you very much. And then just on Chicken globally. As you know maybe that well some of your Brazilian competitors on the international market were having some restrictions in terms of trade currency to the European Union. So is that something - I know that you need special certifications in order to be able to export to the European Union but is that something you would consider as an opportunity to further grow and also to basically endeavor into other market and to grab some share there? Just some thoughts on that high level would be much appreciated.","Thomas Hayes","We would love to, we would love to ship more Chicken to the EU for sure and to the extent that opened up, we will be all about it. That\u2019s not something that is necessarily available to us today, but we do believe that it could be certainly very supportive for the companies like ourselves for Tyson, we really take advantage of our worldwide offices and we have been doing a great job under Noel White\u2019s leadership, understanding what are the opportunities beyond where we currently sell.","So opening up new markets on all products, prepare foods by the way, not just Chicken and pork. And so, yes, if the EU opened up for Chicken and other products of course, we would be ringing the bell here. So that\u2019s good.","Benjamin Theurer","Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will come from Akshay Jagdale of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Akshay Jagdale","Good morning. Yes. I wanted to talk about value added business, so Chicken and prepared foods, and just what I'm really trying to understand is how much of your guidance change on those two businesses, is really transitory versus something competitive or structural? It sounds to me like a lot of it is transitory related to commodity costs and some operational issues, right. So, that's what it sounds like, but I just wanted to run this by. So it looks like your grain costs are higher by about $100 million, prepared food raw material costs are up by $30 million relative to your previous guidance and then freight, overall guidance is up by $50 million, but let's say half of its assigned to these two businesses. That's $150 million plus sort of headwind relative to your previous guidance and your expectation for EBIT on both those segments is, it\u2019s not down as much, right. So that\u2019s how I'm looking at it, the majority of the change in your guidance primarily in Chicken is related to sort of timing issues as to when your costs are going up versus when the pricing is going through. So there is some looks like issues in terms of operating perfectly that tend to happen that's also included, but it doesn't sound to me like there's anything competitive that's changed dramatically, that's causing the guidance to be slightly lower. So am I understanding that correctly?","Thomas Hayes","Based on what you have laid up for me, it sounds like you are pretty well on the mark Akshay. I would say that as it relates to transitory, they are, some of them are more sort of immediate and acute than sort of will last a little bit longer, right. So as we look at the fore curve on grains who knows that\u2019s sort of where we are looking today. But to the extent that we just talk about tariffs, it really backs up in the U.S., we could be in a situation we are not as - the costs are very low.","But the overarching comments that you made, I would align with I would say that $100 million, yes, in terms of grain that's about the right number, $30 million up in raw material for prepared foods, but I would caution you on that one just that given where we are based on our current projections that's what we see.","Going forward, there's I think that probably a strong argument that those prices could go lower and so that those costs could be less for prepared foods, which is a good thing and then freight, yes, we are just going to go to top of it it\u2019s a battle, it\u2019s something that should be once we get through it, it would be fine, but they are as we call out sort of transitory issues.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. The only thing I would jump in on is, you just say that if you look at some of the challenges in Q2 and then look at the back half of the year. Those things starts to diminished, I know for one thing it\u2019s not going to snow this summer. And if you look at some of the production challenges we have with them on in Chicken in Q2 that we are going to be on top of for the back half of the year.","Think about freight, from a freight perspective, we told you about our approach pricing there. So those things all start to move with us and when if you add on top of that the sort of favorability we expect to see a beef in the back part of the year. All of those things start flowing through certainly to our Chicken business and to our prepared business.","Akshay Jagdale","Perfect and then one follow-up please Stewart on the comment you may on normalized earnings. So we obviously appreciate all the guidance we can get, we are not that smart to start off, but that\u2019s great. But just trying to get a little more color on what you are saying and the expectations your setting. So the way, I\u2019m interpreting what you said is, we are going to give you guidance annually, but basically what you are saying as we are going to grow off of the base that we have right. Is that sort of the higher arching message that we should away? Is like you, you are not managing the businesses to some percentage number? It\u2019s just, you are going to keep growing off of this space. Is that a fair way to interpret the normalized range comments?","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. Let me just a step back. I think normalize ranges are not a good reflection of our business, because they effectively pigeon hole us. This is a business that we are trying to margin up, that we are trying to grow, that we are trying to increasingly brand. And all of those things are not consistent with static set of margins.","This is also a business as you really point out, because a lot of guidance to the analyst community help you peg where we are going to end up. And in desire to sort of help me that helpful to you. At the beginning of the year, we will say, this is what we see, this is how we see the margin for Chicken, for prepared, et cetera for the year and that will be normal for that year. And so each year you will get to see what that looks like and of course our desire to use that is the base to build on sequentially.","Akshay Jagdale","Perfect. I will pass it on thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Michael Lavery","Good morning. Just tolling up on that, I know from CAGNY, you gave the total picture company level margin look of an 8.6 to 8.9 range. Sorry, if I had missed this, but I didn\u2019t see that, the segment detail is great. But when you add it all up, is that still what you would give as your view for the total company picture as well?","Thomas Hayes","Well, we have given you the EPS guidance and we have given you the top-line. So you ought to be able to drive the numbers by using that math.","Michael Lavery","I guess, just in terms of within the range. Are you expecting the sales - when you give the updated, is it just that the EPS is at the lower end in part because the sales coming down, or do you expect such a strong in the second half margin outlook that you are putting that up towards the higher end or would everything be set maybe a little towards the lower end. Where is the right kind of way to think about in that range I suppose?","Stewart Glendinning","Well, I think what Tom called out relative to our range. Is that a number of the pressures that we felt the first half of the year, like freight principally labor. These will be with us in the back half of the year and of course we are working to offset those. But with the kind of $155 million that Tom called out. That will push us to the lower end of the EPS guidance range. No question about that, but we have it all in the forecast and pulling the levers to get there.","Michael Lavery","Okay that's helpful. And just on the frozen meal kits. What sort of shelf space incrementality does that have? Is that swapping out for other items or are you getting new placements incremental to the portfolio already?","Thomas Hayes","So there are new placements. Some of it will be replacing some of these products we have, but it's just generally new placements. Now the insight there is that consumers are not - I\u2019m assuming you are talking about in my prepared remarks that frozen Chicken. Yes, so the insight is that consumers want more convenience, the individually frozen Chicken as it exists historically is not a particularly exciting product.","And we are trying to come up with what can we do to sort of reinvest and disrupt that category, but to the extent that those facings when those distribution points win over classic IF products Individually Frozen products that wouldn't surprise me. But our play should be net incremental and to derive more velocity on those distribution points is a key thing as well as margin and brand.","Michael Lavery","Okay thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will be from Eric Larson of Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead.","Eric Larson","Yes. Good morning everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just to push a little harder on kind of the whole net pricing impact. You know Tom this goes back to your Hillshire days in 2011 and 2012 when we had our last real bout of inflation and I think the industry was taking 5%, 6%, 7%, 8% pricing and that's when you have all the elasticity issues, et cetera. But when you kind of net it all out, it looks like a point, maybe 1.5 points of pricing across your value add portfolio is what is needed to kind a cover your cost increases here, which I know that has got some near-term pain, but this is not an unmanageable problem. Would that be a fair way to frame this?","Thomas Hayes","Well. Yes is it. However, just go back to - it's not easy as customers want to maintain their cost, certainly it's hard for us to go to them and say look your cost is affecting everybody and push that through. Nobody breaks out the party hat and we come in with a price increase on anything. But freight is - they are trying to make sure that they maintain their cost. So we are trying to do all the things we can from a Tyson margin perspective, we are passing on the cost, but we are also making sure that we are doing everything we can to lean out our system, making sure that trucks are full, we don't have more stem miles in the system than as needed that continuous improvement projects are accelerated. So your opening question is that reasonable to assume that we should be able to get that? Absolutely, that's our job, but that's doesn't come without a lot of hard work is I guess the point I want to make.","Eric Larson","Yes, I know it's not easy to go to your customers for pricing, but I think everybody is or at least the majority of your competitors are across the package through the group or the cost the consumer group, whether it would be a CPG company or food companies, I think they are all attempting to do something on that front. So it's not like you are the lone ranger in that.","Thomas Hayes","I don't expect - exactly you are right, yes.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes and I would say dimensionally, you have framed it right. I mean, it has the size to be managed, but to Tom's point, it comes with a bit of the difficulty pattern.","Eric Larson","Yes. Then just the only follow-up, if that type of price increase that I have quoted out maybe its high as 2%, maybe it's not that high. Does that lead to any significant negative elasticity or what your competitors follow do you think. I mean, how do you look at those sales impact on that?","Thomas Hayes","What I would tell you is the sales impact should be relatively flat, if we have more cost coming in the price goes up, that's certainly going to be effective, but as we are talking about maybe units or volume that should be flat, it shouldn\u2019t stop us from growing. Our competitors like I said who knows what they are going to do. They don't pass thoughts on and their margins are going to take a hit.","So how elastic our categories are, or not depended upon which category you are talking about and is it branded or not branded, or do we have an exceptionally strong partnership with customers that they understand these things are things that we have to get back, we have to make a proper margin as a partner to them.","So there is a lot of factors that work - that\u2019s going back to the dialogue that we have with our customers, certainly where we have strong partnerships with strong brands, it\u2019s certainly easier than if we are in commoditized, non- strategic partner relationship which we have fewer today than we had yesterday, but you are calling out all the right stuff I think.","Eric Larson","Alright. Thank for your comments.","Thomas Hayes","Yes, sure.","Operator","The next question will be from Jeremy Scott of Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Scott","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. I just want to ask again on the beef margin, I appreciate your comments that it was choppy in the quarter, but it seems at least on our numbers that there were more up chops and there were down chops. So I wanted just and maybe give the opportunity to specify whether or not there was - how much of that weather impact, if you can quantify that separately if there was any hedging issues and then third, maybe you can quantify the freight impacts specifically for that segment and then maybe the same three questions for the pork segment as well.","Thomas Hayes","So, let me start with the freight, Jeremy. We are not going to price that out individually, because there is competitive aspects of that and I want to make sure that we are remaining as competitive as possible for our shareholders. What I will say is that I don't know how other people are affected in our regions, we have to stop production, we have closed plants, several times in the quarter, not every plant, but several plants in the quarter and that just hurt you. And so as Stewart said hopefully we are not going to get any snow this summer, but I think that it definitely was maybe something versus - larger said that it hit us disproportionately, but I don\u2019t know, I just know what happened to us.","Jeremy Scott","Okay, is there any way to quantify that for the quarter?","Thomas Hayes","We won\u2019t quantify that as you can understand that's something that's just not something we are willing to do based on the competitive approach, but I appreciate the question.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes, I mean, look Jeremy, I think you see the results for the quarter, so certainly you can take some - based on public day you can take some calculation what you think that looks like. I think more importantly we are giving you guidance for the back half of the year and we are telling you that we think the back half is going to look a lot stronger and that's positive for our business.","Thomas Hayes","Yeah.","Jeremy Scott","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Zaslow","Hey good morning guys. So I think we could continue on that line, but I\u2019m just trying to figure out a little bit bigger picture. How much of the issues in 2018 will not recur in 2019? If you are recall labor issues, the hatchability issues, things like that. How do we frame that, that is non-recurring?","Thomas Hayes","Yes. It\u2019s a difficult question to answer entirely. But I would say that the headline should be that these were a lot of issues that our specific to 2018 now. I don\u2019t know, if the same weather issues are going up play, there seems to be really increasingly difficult wild card to predict. But as it relates to hatchability and some other things I spoke of. We believe we will be pass those, we believe we will be pass freight. So if barring any sort of crazy events, we feel like 2019 is setting up really well to be again another year of improved earnings and that\u2019s what we are most excited about.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. Ken maybe just one other thing Tom called out in his prepared remarks. He referred to some inefficiencies as we ran our Chicken business really hard this second quarter. That\u2019s another example of something I think we will be totally on top off in the back half of the year and certainly into 2019.","Kenneth Zaslow","Right. That was exactly my point. So I\u2019m trying to figure out, call it is it 100 basis points of reduction in the Chicken margins and is it probably another 50 to 60 basis points in beef. Just conceptual, because I think as you are saying most of it is just one-time in nature and I know everybody is trying to circle around it. I just didn\u2019t know if there was some sort of framework that we did kind of use for 2019 and 2020?","Thomas Hayes","Yes. So we don\u2019t have that for you today Ken, but let us take down on board on future calls as we get closer to 2019 and we get more specific on the segment margins. We will do our best declare and what was one-time in 2018 that wouldn\u2019t repeat in 2019 as we present our case.","Kenneth Zaslow","Great. And then my last question. Given where your stock is, why hold yourself to the two times leverage. Like that seems just an artificial number like why not 1.9, why not 2.3 or why two is such an important number. And if it\u2019s not an important number, why not just stop buying back stuff as is and say you know what we are in good shape, because we have a good financial outlook, our stock is probably undervalued. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s what you are thinking. Why not just buyback the stock and hold your stuff not to the two times leverage?","Stewart Glendinning","Thanks for Ken. First of all, the view from the rating agencies is important to us, because it allows us of course to drive financial funding for acquisitions, et cetera. That\u2019s where the two times comes from. I never said that it was sort of hard line in the sand. In fact, I think if you recall in an earlier question I answered, I said that specifically wanted to have the flexibility to decide Q3 or Q4 based on the way that we see our stock and our ability to drive a return for shareholder. So it\u2019s not hard and fast for me.","Kenneth Zaslow","Great. I appreciate it. Thank you guys.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen that will conclude question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back to Mr. Tom Hayes for his closing remarks.","Thomas Hayes","Okay. Thanks again for all the questions. And thanks for bearing with us on a choppy quarter. And thanks for owning our stock and analyzing our stock as we are a great Company to own, well into the future long-term big bet. I appreciate your interest. We are encouraged by the performance halfway through our fiscal year. We know we are sitting up for a great 2019 as we talk about.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jon Kathol. You may begin.","Jon Kathol","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Tyson Foods' Conference Call for the first quarter of our 2012 fiscal year.","I need to remind you that some of the things we'll talk about today will include forward-looking statements. Those statements are based on our view of the world as we know it now, which could change. I encourage you to look at today's press release for a discussion of the risks that can affect our business.","On today's call is Donnie Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Lochner, Chief Operating Officer; and Dennis Leatherby, Chief Financial Officer. Because our shareholders' meeting is this morning, we have to end the call by 9:15 Central. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Donnie Smith.","Donnie Smith","Thanks, Jon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Our first quarter earnings were $0.42 a share compared to $0.78 for the first quarter of 2011. Now keep in mind that our Q1 last year was the best quarter in company history. And although the comparison is unfavorable, Q1 of '12 is still equal to our second best Q1 ever.","Our biggest challenge in Q1 came in our Beef segment, which had an operating margin of only 0.9%. There are a lot of moving parts to what's happening there, and we'll have Jim get into those details in his remarks. ","The Chicken segment's improving with a 1.2% return on sales. And although that's still well below the normalized operating margin range, we're pleased with the progress from Q4, as lower supplies have supported pricing. Supply and demand appear to be in balance, and we have positioned ourselves well from that perspective. So we're staying cautiously optimistic for now, but we need to keep a careful eye on the impact price increases may have on demand, and remain flexible so as not to overproduce consumer demand for our products.","Our Pork segment continues to do exceptionally well and had an 11.2% return on sales in Q1. Our outlook remains favorable for our Pork segment to continue to perform very well.","Prepared Foods has made a lot of progress, even while facing high raw material pricing, and earned a 5.9% return on sales for the quarter, which is at the top end of our normalized range. ","Now taking a look at the macro environment, consumer confidence and spending improved in the last part of calendar 2011 as expected. According to the Conference Board Consumer Research Center, consumers are more optimistic that business conditions, employment prospects and their financial situations will continue to get better. But it's still too soon to tell if this is a rebound from earlier declines or a sustainable shift in attitudes. ","According to the Perishable Group data, while dollar sales of fresh meat at retail were up 3% versus last year, volume was down a little over 5%, led by beef and pork, down 8% and 7%, respectfully [ph], while chicken pounds were about flat. Our view is that this trend will continue. Bacon and lunchmeat sales were stronger in Q1 versus last year, again driven by price improvement. And the frozen breaded category showed a slight decline. Industry indicators show that modest improvement and potential for food service in 2012, however.","Real sales growth has been consistently positive for the last 2 years. Forecasts for 2012 call for a 0.7% growth in commercial traffic. Major QSR change, supermarket delis, education and hospitals are the sources of growth and are expected to continue to grow faster than the rest of the industry. ","Operators are leveraging dayparts, including snacks and breakfast. And we have been and will continue helping our customers develop products to fit into those meal locations. The ideal proposition is offering better food at a better price. Consumers seem to be moving away from the dollar menu to more moderately priced items such as nuggets, strips, breaded chicken sandwiches and pizza, and the industry is providing the quality cues that justify paying a little more. Our product development opportunity is to deliver good and better for an acceptable value, and we've positioned ourselves to be on a leading edge as we see changes in the marketplace.","Now turning to international. We're excited about the progress we're making, especially in China. As we mentioned last time, our CapEx plan in 2012 is larger than previous years, in part to build company-owned live production in China. We began operations in Jiangsu in November, and the start-up is on schedule. We're very optimistic about the prospects for our China operations. We have a great customer base there, and we're building the team to execute our operating and selling strategies. ","Another part of our CapEx plan includes adding a second shift to our Brazilian plants, and we're executing that plan. We're very pleased with the progress of our operations in Brazil. In addition, good economic conditions are supporting domestic prices, as well as increasing demand for more value-added products. And with a favorable foreign exchange rate, export sales from Brazil are becoming more cost competitive.","As for U.S. domestic protein availability, our view is largely unchanged as the global demand for protein continues to grow, and U.S. exports remain strong. The production cuts in the poach industry made in the past year, along with the decline in beef supplies, will be partially offset by an increase in pork and turkey availability, leading to what we think will be a 1% to 2% decline in domestic availability of protein in 2012.","Now moving on to the total company outlook. On our previous call, we forecasted our earnings in 2012 to be in excess of $2. We still feel pretty good about coming in around the $2 mark, but we think it would be overly optimistic to say \"in excess of\" at this point because of the headwinds we're currently facing in beef, not to mention the volatility in the grain markets. Several things have to go right in our segments, but we're optimistic and we've positioned our business to make things go right for us more often than not. We're more flexible, and with our strong balance sheet, we're better able to react to change and seize opportunities. And that's what we're focused on now. ","That concludes my opening remarks. I'll turn it over to Jim for a review of our segment results and then followed by Dennis with the financial report.","James V. Lochner","Thanks, Donnie, and good morning, everyone. The Pork segment continued to perform very well with an 11.2% return on sales and $165 million in operating income. We continue to manage our revenue to operating cost through mix, price and efficiency while managing the total revenue to hog cost spread. We believe export demand will remain strong, and we think hog supplies will increase slightly to 1% to 2% year-over-year. We expect our Pork segment to continue to perform well throughout the balance of year, but it is unlikely for the results to stay at the Q1 levels. ","Our Prepared Foods segment had a very good quarter with a 5.9% return on sales and $51 million in operating income. One of the standout products in Prepared Foods is Wright Brand Bacon. We increased points of distribution by nearly 10,000 locations across the country in fiscal '11, and given the strength of the Wright Brand, we plan on extending it to other categories in the next few months. Although input pricing for Prepared Foods will continue to be an issue, we expect ongoing operational improvements and increased sales prices to offset rising raw material costs. We expect our results for the Prepared Foods segments to be in the normalized range for the fiscal year.","Turning to the Chicken segment. We continue to see improvement as a result of pricing and mix as we grow value-added and shrink our commodity sales. We had a 1.2% return on sales and $32 million in operating income, compared to a negative 2.9% and a loss of $82 million in Q4. Chicken should gain momentum throughout the year, and we still expect to achieve $125 million in operational efficiencies this year, including live production improvements. If supplies stay in line, we have the potential for our Chicken segment to be at the low end of the normalized range in the second half of fiscal '12. Egg sets continue to be down 5% to 6% year-over-year in recent weeks, and pullet placements were down 7% on average over the past 3 months as total supplies remain pulled back. We expect to remain disciplined in our placements and production to manage our supply relative to our demand forecast and manage the overall revenue relative to the new norm in feed input costs.","In the Beef segment, we made $31 million in operating income or 0.9% return on sales, compared to $118 million and 3.4% in Q4. I saved the Beef segment for last because there's a lot to cover and it's important to understand what drove margin compression in Q1 and why we think it will recover. While you're listening to this industry data, keep in mind that Tyson still has the same people and plants that lead us to raise our normalized margin range in May 2010 and the same focus on execution that produced results in and above that range every quarter until now. So I have every confidence in our team's ability to deal with the current circumstances.","First, let's cover some obvious observations about Q1. USDA reported beef carcass revenue increased 1.8% over the fourth quarter, while cattle costs increased 7.1%. Year-over-year, beef carcass revenue increased 15.9%, and cattle costs increased 22.2%. The major driver behind the revenue increase was choice and higher middle meats. This increased the choice select spread to an average of $17.30 per hundredweight compared to $7 in Q4 and $8 in Q1 of last year. Demand for choice and higher middle meat cuts usually increases before the holidays and decreases just after the holidays. This fall of spread was driven by -- was driven higher by a 3.6% reduction in the total steers and heifers process and a 1% lower grading of the whole population. This resulted in 5% fewer choice animals available.","The choice select revenue spread increases because higher grading meat was in greater demand. Market prices for the higher grading cattle drove up the average price for all cattle, even for the lower grading cattle where the revenues did not warrant price paid. The quality and yield grade of cattle vary tremendously from lot to lot. The price paid needs to reflect the value difference, but spot market prices did not reflect the true value differences. Simply put, the select cutout did not keep pace, and the average cost of cattle increased beyond what the select cattle revenue justified. This compressed margins in Q1. Tyson actually processed 4.6% fewer head than a year ago in an effort to maintain overall margins.","Let's look at what's happening in Q2. The choice selects difference quickly adjusted back to the $5 to $7 range. Cattle costs declined, reflecting the decreased overall cutout, and then margins expanded. The next week, the cutout declined faster than expected and cattle costs increased, creating margin compression again. In a spread business like beef packing, the revenues ultimately determine what the raw material cost will bear. We attempt to forecast revenues 2 to 3 weeks in advance and project what cattle should cost to manage the margin. This current revenue cost aberration will correct as weekly slaughter rates adjust. ","We originally expected to see fiscal '12 fed steer and heifer slaughter decrease by 1% to 2% based on the 2010 calf crop trend and the trend line in heifer retention. Since the industry processed 3.6% fewer animals in our first quarter and the cattle on feed report implies they are still in the pipeline, we anticipate availability of fed steers and heifers to be adequate or even greater for the balance of fiscal '12. As a result, we expect our beef margins to improve through the quarter and throughout the year.","I would like to comment on the January cattle inventory report. It showed a 2011 calf drop of 35.3 million, which is our fiscal 2013, a part of our 2014 fed steer and heifer supply. This was close to analysts' forecast showing a 1.1% decline. We did see a 1.4% increase in the beef heifer numbers, implying some modest herd rebuilding. The beef cow inventory, however, was down 3.1%, reflecting the drought-accelerated losses the last 6 months. The declining future supply suggests probable changes in the feeding and packing industry in future years. Again, our plants are located in the historically competitive feedlot regions in the country.","In conclusion, I'll say that our Beef business -- excuse me, I'll say that all our business units understand the revenue and cost drivers. They are projecting forward demand scenarios and revenues in all segments and matching supplies to demand to manage margins. I want to thank them for their attention to the details and focus on quality and customer service. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Dennis.","Dennis Leatherby","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Donnie mentioned in his remarks, we reported Q1 earnings of $0.42 per share. Return on invested capital for the last 12 months was just over 15%.","Capital expenditures were $182 million for the quarter, reflecting numerous capital projects that will continue to benefit us in the future in both our domestic and foreign operations with enhanced production and labor efficiencies, improved yields and sales mix. Our operating cash flow remained strong at $338 million for Q1. Including cash, net debt was just under $1.4 billion, down nearly $100 million from fiscal 2011. Total liquidity was $1.7 billion, well above our minimum goal of $1.2 billion. Gross debt remained at $2.2 billion. Gross debt to EBITDA for the last 12 months was 1.4x. On a net debt to EBITDA basis, this measure was 0.9x.","During the first quarter, we acquired 1.8 million shares for $35 million under our share repurchase program. To date, we have repurchased 11.5 million shares since we reactivated this program, which is about 3% of our outstanding shares. Over time, we are likely to repurchase the remaining 11 million shares under the current authorization of this program, which would bring the total reduction of our outstanding shares to about 6%. Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 35.8%.","So let's review our outlook for fiscal 2012. Revenues are expected to exceed $34 billion, driven largely by raw material prices and continued tight domestic protein availability. We expect net interest expense to be approximately $185 million, down $46 million from fiscal 2011. The effective tax rate should be about 36%.","Our average diluted shares outstanding for the first quarter was 376 million. This reflects the dilutive share effect totaling 5 million for options and 4 million for convertible bonds, which will fluctuate depending on our stock price performance. CapEx should be around $800 million to $850 million. This reflects continued spending focused on improving the efficiency and competitiveness of our domestic and foreign operations, while also continuing to build out our foreign businesses, especially China.","In closing, 2012 is off to a solid start given the challenges we were faced with involving chicken industry fundamentals and difficult beef market conditions. All segments were profitable in Q1 despite those challenges, and we are pleased to see our Chicken business return to profitability and continue to improve. We are confident we will come through this year strong as we continue to focus on our areas of our business we can control: our cost structure, efficiencies and our desire to help our customers innovate and grow their business. ","This concludes our prepared remarks, and I'll ask the operator to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm still a little bit surprised though, given how few cattle are out there and how low capacity utilization around the packing industry may be, that you're guiding within your normalized range for the back half of the year. I'm just curious, is there something else in your guidance maybe beyond the return to normal in that choice select supply and gradings and prices in the other items you mentioned? Or maybe you're expecting a competitor to close a plant. Do you see some year-on-year comparisons maybe we don't? Any, I guess, further insights there would be appreciated.","James V. Lochner","Well, let me start with your comment that cattle supplies are markedly lower or the implied that they are markedly lower. A lot of times, what people miss is, we're dealing with a 2-year lag of the calf crop. And if you really look at what the calf crop has been, we're dealing right now with the remainder of '12 or calendar year's '10 calf crop, which is 35.7 million. That's not a big decrease compared to the last 2 years. It's what we've been saying, in that range of about 1%. And that will always be dependent upon also what cattle are imported, as well as heifer retention. And -- so I don't see this big decrease. And then I wanted to point out furthermore we saw in acnodes [ph] in that period, we saw substantial pullback in industry numbers. We also cut back 4.6% year-over-year. So those cattle on feed are still in the pipeline. We didn't process them to the same rate we had in prior years, in the Q1 period. And then in the last 5 weeks, we're also running substantially below a year ago. So we're pushing cattle out front. And what really happened is, cattle got higher-priced than the revenue was warranting. Part of that was really driven -- when you look back in arrears, that the choice select spread got wide. We had a false sense of security of what the revenue on the wholesale prices was bringing as the normal choice, middle meat choice and higher middle meat, which is the rib meat, strip meat and tenderloin meat, increased. And then when it seasonally correct, we were out of balance, and that's what caused this margin compression. So I'm not as concerned in the fiscal year of '12 that we're going be tight in supply. But as we look forward and we look at the calf crop of 2011 and we look at the projected calf crop for 2012, that's my comment basis. We'll probably see some adjustments going forward. So hopefully that answered the bulk of that question, why I'm fairly very optimistic we'll get this back, because we don't see the year-over-year big declines and we process fewer head in the acnodes [ph] in the last 5 weeks.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That is helpful. Just as a follow-up, are you -- the implication there may be -- and then we're looking way too far out here, but for fiscal '13, we should see a steeper decline. Or is it just too early to tell?","James V. Lochner","Well, fiscal '13 was last year's calf crop of 35.3 million, which was down from the prior year of 35.7 million. So, again, it will be dependent upon imported feeder cattle, which I don't see adjusting appreciably, and then whatever heifer retention shifts there are. And that's what we'll be monitoring.","Operator","Our next question is from Christina McGlone-Hahn from Deutsche Bank.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, I understood what you were saying about the calendar fourth quarter, but I don't really understand what happened then as we came into January, why margins are so bad. And if the cattle -- if you've been running short slaughter schedules and the cattle are there, then why is it so tight? And why are margins so bad right now? And then, won't heifer retention just make the situation worse in '12?","James V. Lochner","Let me answer the back half of that question first, which heifer retention or the fed steer heifer supply, those decisions were made quite a bit earlier than -- those cattle are in the feedlot, not out in the field as replacement heifers. So we were watching that. That didn't show a major shift in the last 6 months. We're seeing a shift in the animals killed the last 6 months but not the animals placed. Now why did margins get so out of whack in January? Again, we came through tighter margins, pulled back supplies through the November-December period and a very high choice cutout that quickly corrected, which set, all through the acnodes [ph] period, a higher cattle cost that was built on the premise that the choice select spread was higher. That also drove up the average cost of all cattle. And, again, the mandatory price reporting groups don't always reflect the true value differences in cattle. So simply said, the overall cattle costs were higher than the revenue bear-ed and -- or warranted throughout that whole time frame. And when we came through the first couple weeks of January, the kill came back up, and it appears that we all missed the revenue. We missed it. It declined a lot faster, and all of a sudden, cattle went up. In 1 week, the revenue declined and the cattle costs went up. And now we're starting to fight through how to get that back in line. But, again, the promising component to me is, we're coming through. We're building up cattle. We're not short supplies out front, and we'll just have to watch what the revenue will bear. And we did see the choice select spread quickly compress back down into the $4 to $5 zone -- $4 to $5 a hundredweight zone. So when you have that margin compression like we had, it takes a couple of weeks' lag time for it to correct that. And we've got our kills way pulled back in an effort to manage margins. So hopefully that gives you a little more explanation on that.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","No, that's really helpful. I mean, I guess just my follow-up is, what do you think in terms of beef prices if you look at the scenario that Donnie laid out with meat availability? It should augur for higher beef prices, but yet it seems to hit a wall on the choice, maybe at around 195 or a little bit lower than that. Do you think that demand just stops there? Or will we eventually get above that level? Because you need it well above 200 for people in the chain to make money.","James V. Lochner","Well, as I said in my comments and a couple of times, in the end, we're trying to forecast what we think the revenue will be and buy cattle accordingly. In the end, what happens on wholesale prices is if meat's clearing the system and there is more -- the pipeline is empty, prices go up and vice versa. And I know most analysts and charts I've seen have shown some pretty strong resistance on a choice cutout of 195. So we'll have to see. A lot of that depends upon domestic availability and what the domestic and the export disappearance are looking like. So right now, it looks like there's been some price resistance, keeping in mind that all through '09, '10 and '11, we raised prices substantially.","Operator","Our next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess my question would just be -- I appreciate all the detail on beef, and you obviously have a lot of conviction in your outlook. But if it's 2 or 3 or 4 quarters from now and things came in differently than you expected, when you guys sit around and do your plan, what are you worried about could happen that could make your beef forecast not correct?","James V. Lochner","Well, we had a long list of things that I was worried about, and that's what we try to anticipate, a variety of different scenarios relative to how we're managing our forward sales, our pricing risk, our buying strategies. And we're looking at the big picture. That's why we spend a lot of time looking at the real supply chain drivers and the lag times that are out there. But as I've pointed out, we've seen this 0.5% to 1% decline in the calf crop. The biggest thing that bothered me was simply that the beef cow inventory dropped fairly quick. The beef cow slaughter numbers didn't -- were only up 175,000 the last 12 months, yet the overall cow number dropped 967,000. So we'll feel that in 2012's calf crop, which will be 2014's fed steer and heifer supply. So -- and we got plenty of time to look at adjustments and how that influences the overall psychology of the market and the overall supply chain.","Operator","Our next question is from Farha Aslam with Stephens Inc.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","When you look at beef, Feb and March tend to be the weakest demand months for beef. Feb and March tend to be sort of the calendar weakest demand periods for beef. So as you're trying to push up prices, seasonally that's going be tough. Do you anticipate you can get the margin turnaround in time to report a positive beef number in the March quarter on the operating line?","James V. Lochner","We started January, as you know, with a tougher scenario, and again, that's the whole component. We're not projecting robust beef prices in this time frame. And so, again, in this business, the key is that the raw material costs, that we have to get them down to what the revenue will warrant. And that's the push that's going on. And we do that the way we manage the volume we have every week. So we pull back volume, try to shore up pricing and decrease demand for fed cattle. And that's the way the business works and always has worked.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","So if you had to kind of think how long that's going to take, is that going to be sort of a 2-month process, 2-week process? Is it going to be like June, July?","James V. Lochner","I envision -- we have that extreme margin compression in a 1-week period. And I always like to think we can get it back in the same time frame, but it usually doesn't work that way. It's definitely not out over 2 months. So we, again, have our hours pulled way back and trying to hold pricing, get pricing increases and be very selective in our procurement strategies.","Operator","Our next question is from Christine McCracken with Cleveland Research.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Just looking at another protein. The chicken markets specifically seem to be lagging a little here to start the year, only in breast. Meat, wings and leg part is obviously doing very well. But I'm a bit curious with this discounting that's happening in the current market and what you think might be driving that. And whether or not it has any significant implications for what you seem to lay out as a pretty good scenario as we head into the spring and summer and more seasonally strong demand. I'm just curious, what could be behind that?","Donnie Smith","Sure, Christine. Breast meat pricing is a bit of a two-edged sword for us. Let me try to explain that. When we build our supply plan, we make sure we balance on whole bird increments and then build in the flexibility to buy some parts as we need them, rather than grow a whole bird when we would only have a good sale for part of the bird. For example, in your scenario, we wouldn't necessarily want to grow a bird for wings and leg quarters and not have a good sale for the rest. So what we do is we balance on a whole bird basis, and that gives us the flexibility to buy breast meat when the breast meat market is soft. And then, of course, when the whole bird revenue model indicates that margins are appropriate, we can grow the bird. So on the buy side, we're currently able to take advantage of these weaker prices. Now, of course, that sword cuts both ways. And the weaker breast meat markets have somewhat of an opposing impact on our finished product sales. But our model differs from commodity models in that across our total portfolio of sales, we experienced more financial impact from changes in dark meat and whole bird prices than we do with breast meat prices. Now that, of course, is in large part due to the stabilizing effect of our greater proportion of value-added sales, which again affirms our strategy of continuing to accelerate growth of our value-added business.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","All right. Then just as a follow-up to that, as you look at your export business, are you still pretty optimistic that we'll maintain these kind of levels based on kind of the short protein supplies that you're seeing in global markets?","Donnie Smith","Christine, there's always intervals at times when pricings are soft, pricing is softer or stronger. But in general, yes, for the rest of our year, we're optimistic about export demand for poultry and feel like that portion of our sales will be favorable for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Diane Geissler with CLSA.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Can we talk about pork? The margins there were much better than I was looking for versus sort of what we track internally on the cutout. Could you talk about what happened there? I know you're guiding for that to be above your normalized range in the back half of the year, but to what extent are exports -- are you benefiting from the exports directly? And just kind of frame what we should expect on pork for the year.","James V. Lochner","The overall benefit on the export, obviously, is the domestic disappearance, and it drove -- that it contributed to drive up wholesale prices because we had a very strong year. We get our fair share and slightly above on the export market, and we try to work very hard at promoting U.S. pork abroad, as do a number of our competitors. And so we're really -- as we manage through our margin, we're paying very close attention to what we think the forward export disappearance looks like, how that fits into the domestic demand and really trying to maximize the revenue for the whole. And, again, our business, we really just put a lot of focus on managing the mix, managing the yields, managing the quality, customer service and staying very close to the market and working through that process. But I do think exports in pork will continue be very strong throughout this fiscal year, and I don't see a major drop-off. I'm hopeful we'll continue to see an increase as we go forward.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. Well, that's not what the USDA is predicting. So what you're seeing right now, in the current market, exports are still robust.","James V. Lochner","USDA, I noticed, was predicting down, but I don't see any major shift other than perhaps in Korea. But I do see other parts of the world picking it up.","Operator","And our next question is from Ryan Oksenhendler with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was just -- I was curious, in terms of your outlook for chicken prices this year, I guess in response to Christine's question, it doesn't sound like you're that bullish on breast meat. You're trying to balancing your model there. But, also, I'm just surprised to see -- when you look at some of the national restaurant accounts talking about their pricing, I mean, Darden said it's going to be down in calendar 2012. I think Wendy's announced that they only expect a 5% increase in chicken prices. So I guess how does that square with you guys getting to normalized margins in the back half of the year?","Donnie Smith","Okay, Ron, while I can't comment on what others might be saying about pricing, I can comment on what we're experiencing. And during this round of pricing, which really is the fall and early winter, we were able to secure higher pricing. And in general, when we were forced to lock in a price for a period of time out front, we were able to build in some kind of relief mechanism, whether that be a grain collar or whatever. So we feel comfortable about our value-added mix and the opportunities that, that gives us to insulate ourselves a little bit from the commodity swings in the market pricing. We get paid for the value that we add to our customers' business. And our quality, our service, our innovative capabilities are really industry-leading. And we are building great customer loyalty, and we're getting paid for that. So I think that's why maybe we sound confident, because we are. Because we feel very comfortable that in concentrating on a customer and adding value to their business, that in turn will add value to our business and our shareholders.","Ryan Oksenhendler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So I guess what would be the biggest risk, then, for you guys getting to that target in the back half of the year?","Donnie Smith","I probably would have to say grain, although I could tell you, in the current range, we think grain is kind of trading in the upper end of its value range now. And you got to remember, you're probably facing probably a 95-million-acre planted crop coming in front of us, and that's going to be kind of a heavy weight on old crop prices. So I think that is a bit muted. And then we just got to continue to remain focused on providing the innovation and the market solutions that our customers need, and continue to help them grow their business and get through some of these difficult times. And we'll get rewarded with that, with more business and getting paid for the value we add.","Operator","Our next question is from Tim Ramey with D.A. Davidson.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","The -- Jim, the pork margins have just been so surprisingly good for so long, and I know you increased the target range recently. But maybe you can give us your thoughts on why, in that particular protein, with supply up a little bit, we just seem to continue to sustain much better margins as opposed to chicken that -- where supply is tightening. And just maybe for Donnie as a follow-up, too. Just this sort of more holistic approach that you've espoused before, where the world's going be tight on protein. And not clear whether you're going to make your money in this one or that one, but overall, the world is going to be tight on protein, and that will firm up margins. Can you kind of touch on that point again, Donnie?","Donnie Smith","Yes, let me jump in there first, and then I'll let Jim obviously talk about pork. But yes, very much, our multi-protein, multi-channel, multinational strategy is, we think, very important. I mean, our model is going to be very successful. As we look around the world, as global demand for protein increases, it gives us great opportunity internationally to grow those businesses, and we're off to a good start. Those are somewhat fledgling businesses but have a very bright future in front of them. And then domestically, I think the beauty of our model is not every protein has to be just perfect all the time for us to deliver great value for our customers and our shareholders. So what we do is, we look to operate every segment of our business, absolutely the most efficiently -- certainly as we can. And our objective is always to be the industry leaders in every single segment. And we have made remarkable progress, I think, in the last 3 years towards getting there. And so if a segment, maybe at the current moment like Beef might be a little bit out of favor, the good news about our business is we've got a great Chicken business, we've got a great Prepared Foods business, operating at the top end of its range. The pricing environment has improved. There's raw material prices have stabilized a little bit. Jim mentioned our growth in our Wright Brand business and our ability to make that brand extensible into other categories. And those are all the things we're working on to continue to deliver this balanced approach to our customers and help them find the solutions they need. So that's my part. Jim?","James V. Lochner","Just real briefly on pork. I mean, the big answer is, we saw the quantities decreased from '08 down into '10, '11, '12. And the whole pork complex is in a reasonably good balance with export, domestic and supplies. And we've always had plants in very good locations. We're very efficient. We know how to manage the mix. We know how to work through our overall yield, our overall quality issues and stay focused on that. And so there's a good balance in the industry, but -- and we really understand the details. I mean, that's why it's worked very well.","Operator","Our next question is from Heather Jones with BB&T Capital Markets.","Heather L. Jones - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Quick question on Tyson, specifically on its Pork and Beef businesses. For some time, you all have been able to generate pretty large outperformance relative to the industry in both of those segments. And in Q4, that outperformance seemed to narrow pretty significantly. But in this quarter, it widened considerably. And so I guess going forward, I'm just trying to get a sense of, how should we think about this outperformance? Like on an absolute magnitude basis, do you think you can maintain the outperformance this quarter? Or is it going to fluctuate significantly? I just -- if you could give us some color on what you're foreseeing going forward.","James V. Lochner","This is Jim. I'm not sure really how to answer that, other than we really focus on the details and what the forward revenues, what the demands are going forward, and really try to match what we think we're going to run from a supply standpoint and really what we think the raw material or the commodity warrants from a price standpoint. There will be quarter-over-quarter where certain things shipment [ph] adjustments. But we got very good teams that really are very experienced, and we've put a lot of good CapEx on our plants and we stay very efficient. And our plants -- keep in mind our beef plants are located in very good states where there's very good supplies of fed cattle, and same thing in our pork plants. So we have some good location advantages, which has been a long-term strategy from years ago.","Heather L. Jones - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","So you don't anticipate anything that should change your performance relative to the industry from Q1.","James V. Lochner","No, I don't.","Operator","Our next question is from Akshay Jagdale from KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So I wanted to focus on chicken, because I think we've talked about beef enough. So can you help me understand sort of sequentially a couple of moving parts? One is the revenue line and the other is costs. I mean, costs were up seems like $0.10 a pound, $220 million. Would love to know what your projection is on costs as we sit here today. So maybe you can answer that first. And my guess is, sequentially, you're not going to see as much of a drag from higher feed costs. But what is your projection for the year? And how far are you hedged?","Donnie Smith","Okay. Akshay, the overwhelming majority of the cost increase was grain. Now quarter-over-quarter, if you'll remember last Q1, we had a fairly significant increase in hedging for the quarter, and this quarter, we were pretty much flat and with a very, very minimal hedging line, I think $3 million or something like that. So the overwhelming majority of the increased cost in chicken is in the grain. Now offsetting that is our increases in price; improvement in our mix, in other words, selling more value-added items; and then continuing in cost efficiencies. I think we mentioned last quarter that we anticipate another $125 million or so in cost efficiencies for this year. And in Q1, we delivered something on the order of just shy of $25 million of that. So as you look forward, our pricing -- as you can see in this last quarter, our pricing was better, and we feel like that will continue. I agree with you that the year-over-year increases in feed costs are likely to stabilize. And so it's a matter of continuing to improve our mix, continuing to grow our value-added sales, continuing to drive operational efficiencies, and that will, in turn, continue to drive good margins and give us that opportunity in the back half of our year to get our Chicken business back into its normalized range.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","But what's the -- how much of your grain cost -- feed and grain cost, which you said were up $220 million in 1Q, what is the order of magnitude for the year? Last year, I think they were up 500. So my guess is we're going to see a major drop-off starting this quarter.","Donnie Smith","No. Actually, the comparison will -- and, hey, what we're using is current basis levels, current futures prices versus a year ago. So just taking the forward curve on futures and basis today and projecting that out for the rest of the year. The impact for our year is an incremental couple of hundred million dollars, which is frankly what you saw in Q1. So for the balance of our year, we really see that impact flat. We don't have projected in a decrease in feed costs because remember, for the 4 quarters which would end in September, the last of those grain purchases are made in July. And so it takes about 8 weeks from the time you ship a train of grain to our feed mills for that to work its way through our cost of goods. So just kind of keep a mental picture that we buy grain through the end of July to secure our cost all the way through Q4. And by the end of July, we have no way to predict at this point what the grain situation is going to look like. Will it be dry or what have you? There's just no way to tell. So we just take the forward curve, and projected forward basis levels are really high right now. Railroads are still charging significant fuel surcharges in the freight rates. So the delivery basis of corn is still really high. So factor all that in, the year-over-year change, we think, is going to be about $200 million.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just on the revenue side, can you help -- I mean, the revenue per pound realized in my estimation was up double digits this quarter, which was just truly exceptional. Can you -- on a year-over-year basis, I mean, is it going to come even close to that? Because if it does, I mean, it looks like to me you could be at the high end of your normalized range if you're going to get 10% increases in revenue per pound, which is what you got in 1Q for chicken.","Donnie Smith","Okay. So there is some portion, although a relatively small portion of our business, that is susceptible to the commodity market pricing. So I can't, with all certainty, tell you what our revenue component is going to look like. I can tell you though that we are getting paid for the value we add. We feel good about our ability to add the value that we need to, to our customers' business to get paid for what we do for them and the solutions we provide them. So I feel good about the revenue. I can't necessarily call it. But I can tell you, we have been able to secure higher prices, and we feel good about our opportunity to continue to do that because of the way we're delivering for our customers for the rest of the year.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Sequentially, if spot market prices improve, which is -- there's a lot of industry observers who believe that will happen. So spot revenue per pound improves from now until the summer, sequentially your revenue per pound realized should also trend that way, correct?","Donnie Smith","Yes, sure.","James V. Lochner","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jim, I was hoping that you could just go back to some of the comments in your prepared remarks about how the beef industry is likely to have to change around some of the dynamics you're seeing in supply pipeline, given shorter cattle supplies down the road. Just maybe you can expand a little bit on how you think the industry might look in 2, 3, 4 years down the road.","James V. Lochner","Sure, I will. The alarming number -- and I was watching very carefully with the drought that we experienced last year, what the impact to the supply, the base of the supply chain being the beef cow herd, would do. And, again, if you're watching beef cow slaughter numbers, you thought, well, will decrease about 175,000 over the last 12 months. But then all of a sudden, we saw this big decline of 967,000, down to a 29.9. And you saw Oklahoma and Texas cow numbers decrease. Now a lot of people think that those states then will have some issues relative to availability of the cattle. Keep in mind, the cattle are fed still in feedlots that are close to the grain with good weather, good water and a good environment. And so we won't see -- we'll continue to see competitive feedlot source feeder cattle, and that's where our plants are located. And if you look at the feedlot placements and when it was all said and done, with the total number, you saw that the upper mid-east region was down considerably. And Texas was up 104. I think Kansas was flat. Nebraska was up. So where I'm headed with this is, the competitive feedlots will continue to feed cattle, and the plants located close to those will continue to have good sources. And that's where, again, we sit in a pretty good relationship to cattle on feed and where the cattle will be available. But long term, that cattle decline will have a structural change on both the feeding industry, likely, and the packing industry.","Lindsay Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just also as a follow-up. Hoping maybe you guys could shed a little bit of light on some of the trade issues in the chicken industry that are currently in the press with respect to Mexico. Do you see any issues arising with the challenges to chicken exports?","Donnie Smith","It's too soon to tell. Obviously, we're engaged. Our D.C. office is actively engaged in those conversations. But it's too soon to tell.","Lindsay Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you maybe help us frame what's at risk here?","James V. Lochner","I really can't. I mean, obviously, Mexico does buy chicken from the U.S., and an anti-dumping duty would hurt the margin on that. I could tell you from our standpoint, our export sales, I'm going to call it customer portfolio mix, has changed fairly dramatically over the last 12 months. And we're not overly dependent on any one particular market for margin in our export sales. I mean, we've done a great job of diversifying our portfolio. So it may have an impact. I think the impact on our business would -- certainly, there would likely be one, but I don't want to overplay its magnitude.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a couple of questions. I know everyone's been talking about beef. I just have a couple of really quick ones. One is, are you guys actually capturing cattle or getting cattle outside of your typical range of where you normally get it? I guess it's my first question. My second one is, over the next 10 to 20 months, does capacity actually need to come out from the packer industry in order to restore margins, given -- again, I know you're saying it's a slow cattle decline, but I'm assuming over time though that something has to change in the industry. And then third is, I mean, you guys say you're in a soft spat -- spot. What does that actually mean?","James V. Lochner","I didn't follow the third part.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Well, when you say you're in a soft patch for beef packing margins, do you actually lose money? Are you still making money? Are you profitable? I guess just kind of magnitude of what we're actually seeing. That's what I just want to know. But that's actually the least of the 3 important questions.","James V. Lochner","To answer your first question. Are we going outside our region? No. To answer your second question, again, fiscal '12 is interesting going forward. I don't see that we're going be deficit cattle, particularly after we and the industry, looking at the industry number in the Q1 period, process the 3.6% fewer cattle. We processed 4% fewer cattle year-over-year in that quarter. And then in January, the industry's kills have been way pulled back. So we got to be pushing them forward because they are in the pipeline. Now when you go out beyond that, again, the key number I watch is the calf crop projected out for 2 years, and then try to factor in what we think heifer retention is going to be. So do I think the industry is in overcapacity? It's been there before. And looking at the long range out a couple of years with the implied 2012, this calf crop this spring, I'm guessing we'll start to see some adjustments.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So you guys are not...","James V. Lochner","And the third question, yes, this was a rough patch, and I've explained that a number of times. That 1 week, when revenues dropped and cattle costs went up, the spread got way out of whack and it can get messed up like that in a week. And it takes some time, 2 to 3 weeks or more, to get it back in line.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Are you currently in a rough patch? Or are you out of the rough patch?","James V. Lochner","We're currently in a rough patch.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, currently. And then is there...","James V. Lochner","Oh, I'm starting to hear that. That will be our new technical term. How is that?","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, I'm not sure exactly how to model it. I was just going to put \"RP\" [ph] on it, I guess. But in terms of the -- do you think the industry right now -- you don't think the industry is overkill, and you think right now the -- like are you guys running 40 hours a week? Is the industry running 40 hours per week? Can you just talk about what people are actually -- what the industry is actually doing on an hourly basis right now? It seems like, again, from people that I know, it seems like there is a potential that the facilities are being run a little bit harder than they should be.","James V. Lochner","We have not run 40 hours. We've been between 32 and 36 in every plant throughout the year here, through January. But I just looked at the fed steer and heifer kills the last 5 weeks, which I watch very closely: 429 the first week, 493 the second week, 484, 472 and 471 projected for this week. Now that's a good 20,000 to 25,000 lower than a year ago. So the industry is clearly not running anywhere close based on that. I know what we're running, and I can look at that inference and get pretty close. But the industry's running considerably less than 40s and probably considerably less than 36s. And again, you're looking at that additively. Those cattle will have to get -- at some point, get processed. So, again, just really watching the acute numbers and what's going on week-to-week, which is how you really manage these businesses.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","You don't think capacity over the next 10 to 20 months has to come out of the industry. You don't think anybody is going to close down or anything is going to change structurally, like what you guys did in, what is it, end of '08 or '09 where you guys actually closed down a facility. You don't think something like that has to happen over the next 10 to 20 months for a restoration of normalized margins.","James V. Lochner","I can't comment on what our competitors because that decision really gets to, is your plant competitive in the region from a revenue cost, size, scale, mix standpoint? And there's a lot of variables. The ones we shut down were knocked -- in '06 and '08, weren't competitive in the regions, and they weren't competitive within our structures. And so that really becomes a key component that you have to look at. And again, looking at the macro play, which I've covered a number of times, I'm just really watching the numbers going forward. In the next few months, it doesn't appear so, but I -- if I had a noncompetitive plant, I'd be looking at it. I mean, that's all I can say. We're looking at our competition and what -- excuse me, our plants from a competitive standpoint on a continuous basis.","Operator","Our next question is from Ann Gurkin with Davenport.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just wondering, given the challenges that we've obviously been talking about in the Beef segment, is there any need to adjust production in the Chicken segment in order to make sure that remains profitable and hits that low end of the long-term targeted margin range?","Donnie Smith","Speaking for ourselves, we have a pretty good taste of what oversupply looks like, and certainly we will pause before we risk returning to an oversupply situation. But we really like where we stand. Our supply and demand is very well balanced. We have an opportunity at times to take advantage of buying the parts we might need. So I could tell you that currently, our forecasted demand and our supply plan does not need adjustment. But we look at that constantly, and we will make adjustments as needed.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two questions. One is, have you seen any signs that this plant by Northern Beef is going to open in Aberdeen, South Dakota or not? And then secondly, an international question for Donnie. How much capital have you put into China and Brazil over the years? I'm coming up with a number of about $400 million. And I want to know if I'm close. And when do you think you could get like that 15% kind of return on capital that you said that you've been doing for the rest of the business?","James V. Lochner","I mean, yes, I know that plant in Aberdeen is in some phase of construction. I've not been tuned in to what the projected opening date or startup looks like. I have no idea. I just know it's being built.","Donnie Smith","Rob, on the capital piece, you're really, really close. I mean, that's -- you're all over the number. And I would tell you, on the return, I figure 2 or 3 years or so, we should be at that point. And our Jiangsu plant has started up. The ramp-up is on target. We feel very good about our model. We feel very good about our customer mix in China, who we will be serving, and the product portfolio that we will be serving them with. We're doing a good job so far in getting our production supply chain built out like we want to. So it's going to take some time, but we think 2 or 3 years out, we're there.","Operator","Our next question is from Farooq Hamed with Barclays Capital.","Farooq Hamed - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick question for you. I just wanted to walk back through the pork exports expectation, and maybe if you can walk us through -- you made a comment that -- I guess that 2012, they're going keep pace with 2011 export levels. And I'm just wondering how you get there or if you can walk us through the different major regions where you think that the exports will hold pace, just because we had significant disease issues in Korea and China last year. I'm just wondering, could we still see the same export levels this year? And how we get there?","James V. Lochner","Well, that's a good question. But I'm just really looking. And when I referenced, I'm talking our fiscal year and sometimes, people get misaligned a bit because they'll look at the calendar year, which a lot of the other data. But October and November were up 40% year-over-year. So that -- we still saw that strong strength. Now I do think Korea might adjust. But keep in mind, there's a big, long lag phase once you have herd reduction to correct a disease problem like they had. You can't fill that pipeline. In the case of hogs, that's a 19-month recycle. That's why I'm saying it. It's the same thing in China where they had to correct some -- or are doing some liquidation to control some diseases. So that's why -- where I'm at. And a lot of people think you can turn that production cycle back on that quick. But when you just look at it, it's a 19-month to see an increase. And then I'm seeing the residual carryover in October and November numbers that are still very strong. Now do I think they're -- so I'm not pessimistic that we're going to see a decline at all. I'm optimistic that we'll see a gradual incline because those numbers -- those supplies can't be replenished that fast.","Farooq Hamed - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. But then I guess looking at the 2011 and then maybe the 2012 export levels, longer term or bigger picture, would we see that as kind of being the peak for pork exports in this industry, and then maybe 2013 onwards, we're going to start to see some declines as those herds catch up?","James V. Lochner","I had a really great crystal ball because it's being managed in the business. But the reality is that the U.S. is still a very competitive place to produce pork, and if the dollar and the relativity, the global protein supplies -- or demand continues to increase and outstrip the ability of the supply chain to catch up.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I have one for Donnie and one for Jim, if I can. Donnie, how happy are you with the Tyson brand's ability? Obviously, it's a great brand, but its ability to succeed across the entire packaged meats aisle in the supermarket. And the reason I'm asking is you have a lot of cash in the balance sheet. There may be some attractive assets coming to market that neatly kind of complement what you do. And I know you can't discuss anything in particular. I'd really just be interested in your thoughts on your current portfolio's ability to play and win, say, in retail breakfast meats, lunchmeats, things like that.","Donnie Smith","That's actually a great question. We have a tremendous amount of confidence in the Tyson brand and its brand promise and our ability to deliver on its brand promise. Now we also have a stable of other regional and national brands that have a brand promise. For example, Jim in his remarks talked about Wright Brand. Wright Brand has really grown in acceptance. He mentioned 10,000 points of distribution last year. That's amazing. And so that brand delivers very well on its brand promise consistently over and over again. So I would not want you to think that we would only use the Tyson brand or the Tyson logo to extend across the meat category. But certainly, you can tell from our comments that having a broad, diverse portfolio of products is very important to our strategy. Now I think -- and I'm going to add a little bit. Maybe it was in the question, maybe not, but over the last couple of years, we've done a great job of strengthening our balance sheet and our balance sheet gives us the flexibility. We use the term around here, \"optionality,\" to be able to buy or to build. And so we have the opportunity to look at any channel, any category, any type of product grouping and decide whether or not we want to build our current assets and then build through that particular category that way, or whether or not we want to buy that -- buy a business that might fill that gap. So I like having those options. It gives us an ability to keep our return on invested capital forefront as we grow our business. And certainly, both of those are very important to our strategy to both grow our business and to keep an acceptable return on invested capital.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, Jim, you mentioned you're pulling back somewhat on your hours in beef packing. Have you thought about the possibility of maybe going the other way? That is, running your plants even faster to temporarily drive margins down and force a competitor to shut a plant more quickly. Or is that just way too risky a strategy? I realize it's easy for us on this side to think about that. It's a lot harder to actually pull the trigger and it may not even be the right strategy long-term. I'm just curious how you think about that.","James V. Lochner","The simplest answer to that, no. We really try to manage. Over a long run, you got to manage margins. You work on, again, your sales mix, your forward sell, your customer, your premium programs and then you really try to project what the revenues are going to be and what the raw material costs warrants basis that revenue projection. We manage our own business. We don't have a market play in that whole scheme. So I should have just stopped with no, but I gave you a little more color.","Operator","Our next question is from Diane Geissler with CLSA.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Jim, do you have any -- is there -- do you think we might get a few cattle coming across the border with the Wheat Board decision this summer? Or is it too early to tell what's going to happen there?","James V. Lochner","The economics, I think that changes the dynamic. That's a really good question because we really watch these feeder cattle import numbers, and they supplement that and have been in the pipeline. In recent years, the Canadian number has declined. And so as the Wheat Board decision changes the dynamics of feed wheat availability and the competitiveness of feedlot in Canada versus the U.S., it may. I don't know. It will depend upon what that front-end economics at the point in time, the calves and the cost of gains versus what the deferred futures are looking like in the revenue. But it changes the dynamic. That's very worth watching.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Well -- and just as a second point on that, just given where your plants are, if we do see more cattle coming from Canada, would you say you're better positioned than the rest of the industry because most of your plants are in the North?","James V. Lochner","Well, that will be where the feeder cattle -- I'm guessing it would be a greater -- the issue will be, will there be more imported feeder cattle? And Washington state, as one example, was up appreciably, which we have a plant in Washington. And those cattle would be a lower delivery cost to the upper Midwest from a feeding standpoint. So it would be favorable.","Operator","Our next question is from Christina McGlone-Hahn with Deutsche Bank.","Christina McGlone - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just quickly, Jim, I wanted to confirm that your outlook for pork is still -- you said it's still above normalized because recently, margins have really narrowed, particularly since the fall. And we're showing at times negative on a spot basis. But you still think you can do above -- not only better than the industry, but above normalized.","James V. Lochner","Well, I think what I said was I didn't think we'd be permanently as strong as Q1. But, yes, we expect to be above normalized. Again, I don't see a major shift in that fundamental at all going on.","Operator","Our next question is from Farha Aslam with Stephens.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to get some more color on Prepared Foods. That segment performed extremely well. Is it packaged meats? Is it tortillas? Is it pricing, capacity utilization? And in terms of normalized, do you expect that segment to perform at the higher end of normalized as it was this quarter? Or kind of mid to lower? Just some more color on that would be helpful.","Donnie Smith","Farha, your answer is yes. It is a factor of all of those. The great thing about our Prepared Foods business is that it is so diversified. Our tortilla business is doing very well. Great business in pizza toppings. I would tell you, maybe a weaker part of that segment has been our lunchmeat results. But I'll tell you, we've got a great team around that business. They have absolutely anchored themselves in the fundamentals of the business and are making very, very rapid progress. So we think there's a segment within the segment that has not been performing, that will continue to improve and perform ever -- even better, which makes us feel even more positive about our Prepared Foods segment. So it's coming in all forms. Our mix has improved. We've changed our selling strategies. Our food business has improved. We've -- of course, for a lot of that business, the raw material is beef and pork. And as raw material prices have stabilized, that's allowed some of the lagging pricing mechanisms that we have to catch up. And certainly, that's improved. So it really is a combination of multiple things. But I guess the bottom line to that whole business is a great diversified portfolio, being run very well by an extremely competent team, meets tremendous customer needs. And we feel very positive about our results in that segment.","Operator","Our final question today is from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just want to follow up on chicken. Just Donnie, if I understand it correctly, so you had a $220-million increase in feed costs. Sequentially, you won't have that going forward. So that's about an 8% margin impact, right, on your sales. So my understanding is, going forward, the cost side is getting better sequentially. And on the revenue side, I have a question for you, which is, if I say breast prices are going to be at $1.85 in the summer and leg quarters remain at $0.50 and the whole bird price goes into the mid-90s, is there any reason to believe then that Tyson would not be at the high end of normalized range by the end of the -- by the summer? Or am I missing something in the mix or fixed price contracts or something like that?","Donnie Smith","No, you're right on your market prices. We feel great. Akshay, one thing on your cost model. Think stabilized, not improving. ","So listen, we have to run, but thanks for joining us today and obviously for your continued interest in and your support of our company. We've got to head off to the shareholders' meeting right now. So we just hope you all have a great day. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference.

Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Thanks, Jon. Having grown up in New England, I want to start by saying congratulation to the Super Bowl 51 Champion New England Patriots. They set some records last night and we're setting some records ourselves here today.","On my first earnings call as President and CEO, I'm thrilled to share great results that Tyson Foods family delivered in the first quarter of fiscal year in 2017. It's an incredibly exciting time at Tyson as we position ourselves for the next stage of growth and I'm looking forward to leading our team as we seek to improve the value of our company for all of our stakeholders.","Let's talk about our Q1, which is the best quarter in the company's history with record earnings, operating income and cash flows. Return on sales was in or above the normalized range for each of our segments and total company operating margin was a record 10.7%.","In the first quarter, we capitalized on favorable market conditions in our Beef and Pork segments and the cash generated is providing fuel for growth in our value-added Chicken and Prepared Foods segments.","As we outlined in our year-end 2016 call, our earnings were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter by $35 million in mark-to-market and lower cost-to-market accounting treatments. This benefited our Q1 results as we started getting this back.","Synergies for the quarter were $161 million, with $40 million incremental to the Q1 of 2016. Total synergies to-date are $620 million. And now for an update on our operating results which illustrates the advantage of our balanced portfolio with strong performances across the board. We'll start with Fresh Meats.","In the Beef segment, our operating income was a record $299 million, with a record operating margin of 8.5%. Volume was up 4.5%, while average price was down 6.6% reflecting the lower cut-out.","Plentiful cattle supplies and lower consumer pricing that stimulated both domestic and export demand contributed to the record results. Our Beef business has been challenged in the past few weeks with typical seasonality, however with cattle supplies expected to increase 3% to 4%, the remainder of the year should be very strong. At this point, we're estimating Beef segments operating margin for the year to be around 5%.","The Pork segments operating income for Q1 was a record $247 million, with a record 19.7% operating margin. Volume was up 4.3%, while average price was down 1%. Demand was strong and especially in the export markets. The USDA recently issued a report stating that China will likely remain a large importer of pork given its rising production costs, constraints on land use, and stricter environmental regulations. While Tyson Foods doesn't export a significant amount of pork to China, other U.S. packers do, which creates domestic disappearance. We're certainly aware of the additional capacity coming online, but there appears to be enough hog production to support these plants, and continuing export demand should absorb the additional supply.","At this point, we don't know how any changes in the U.S. trade policy might affect exports of pork or other proteins, but in general, trade restrictions that impact export demand also can affect domestic supply. We're planning for different scenarios and will be prepared to adapt if there's any change in policy.","Now turning to our Chicken and Prepared Foods segments. In our Chicken segment, our first quarter operating income was $263 million, with a 9.7% operating margin. Average price was up 1.4% and volume was up 1.3%. Value-added volume was up 5%, while commodity volume declined, demonstrating that we're growing where we want to grow with products carrying higher, more stable margins.","Sales price was up due to these mixed changes offsetting general market declines. Costs increased in part due to additional mass spending to support growth in the Tyson brand. We expect more pricing pressure from competing proteins for chicken while our feed costs are projected to be flat with last year. With our predominantly value-added mix, the Chicken segment should be in the upper end of its normalized range of 9% to 11% return on sales for the year.","In our Prepared Foods segment, operating income in the first quarter was $190 million with a 10% operating margin. Average price was down 2.9%, reflecting lower raw material costs passed through to customers, volume increased to 2.9% offsetting lower pricing.","Synergies within the Prepared Foods segment were $127 million for the quarter, with $32 million incremental to Q1 of 2016. As a reminder, not all of the synergies flow to the bottom line as we invest in the long-term health of the business. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect flat input costs, but we also expect a more competitive pricing environment given overall protein availability.","Something very important to me, in seeing our company along its path to achieving its fullest growth potential is investing in our facilities to support that growth. As such, I want to make you aware of an important investment initiative we've undertaken that will affect the Prepared Foods segment for approximately 18 months.","Within Prepared Foods, we have two well-developed businesses in both retail and food service channels. These channels are complementary in reaching all consumers. Our scale in both channels provides a natural volume hedge as consumer eating behavior shifts between channels. This leadership position is increasingly critical as channels blur chasing rapidly growing convenience and on-the-go occasions as exemplified by the rise of e-commerce meal kits.","Our retail channel consists of primarily category-defining branded products and is propelled by industry-leading marketing capabilities as well as a well-supported asset base. It has gross margins as robust as any in the industry and growth rates that lead the industry. The food service channel is also characterized by industry-leading share positions across more than 10 categories. In contrast to retail, in food service, we play in primarily unbranded price-driven categories that are highly competitive and can be volatile as they absorb swings in commodity. These category and channel positions are strategically important for long-term growth, but generally operate at margins below those realized by our retail brands.","Network investments to upgrade capacity and throughput for long-term growth have increased the cost structure in our plants that serve the food service channel and further pressured margins. As the capacity investments translate into improved efficiency and volume growth over the next 18 months, these pressures will abate, but in the interim they will continue to compress margins possibly dropping the segment below 10% return on sales for the year and around 9% for the second quarter.","Let's now turn to a view on total company growth. Our sales volume across all segments rolled up to 2.4% growth. Our retail channel showed the most volume growth in the company versus Q1 last year with a 6.6% increase. IRI data for the 13-week period corresponding with our Q1 showed Tyson Foods, both Core 9 and all Tyson products sold at retail, were leading sales volume and sales dollar growth among retail food manufacturers.","As you'll see in the slides posted on our website this morning, we were only \u2013 we were, of the top 10 branded food-only companies, the only one with positive sales volume and one of only two companies with positive sales dollar growth.","For the most recent 13-week period, IRI reported total Tyson retail volume was up 6%. Core 9 volume was also up 6% with 1.2 points of share gain. Despite the deflationary pricing environment, dollar sales were up 2% for total Tyson and 3% in the Core 9. Our retail branded business experienced continued strong growth in the quarter behind base business momentum, excellent retail execution around the holidays and new product launches.","The Hillshire Farm brand drove growth across smoked sausage, lunchmeat and cocktail links categories. Jimmy Dean's Stuffed Hash Browns, Jimmy Dean Delights Frittatas, Hillshire Snacking, and Tyson Premium Select Nuggets are examples of innovations that are meeting or exceeding our expectations.","We continued improving ROI on our advertising spend behind new campaigns utilizing more precise media buying and effective advertising execution. I should note, we're about to start lapping some more difficult comparisons in the next few months, our growth however should still outpace the industry.","In our food service channel, Q1 volume was flat to slightly up in an environment of three consecutive quarters of declining food service traffic as consumers moved towards retail channels. Our segmentation strategy and advantaged customer positions mean a large share of our volume is in accounts where their sales are outperforming industry traffic trends. This can be seen in the performance of some critical food service categories and will set us up well for long-term growth.","On our Q4 call, we introduced new analytics to give you some insight into our broad line distribution portion of our food service channel, which serves predominantly local and regional food service operators. These analytics, based on NPD Supply Track data follow five critical broad line categories prioritized for growth. These categories are value-added chicken, breakfast sausage, dinner sausage, bacon and pizza toppings.","Like our Core 9 or retail, these are key indicators of the overall health of our protein businesses within food service distribution. Our Focus 5 categories grew volumes 12% in October, the most recent data available. With more work to do, we are pleased with our progress in the Focus 5.","In our earnings call in November, we talked about the investments we're making in innovation, consumer insights and brands. At our CAGNY Presentation on February 21, we'll do a deep dive on those efforts and share with you examples of our innovation pipeline. The opportunities we see for long-term growth and how we're inventing new solutions to meet the evolving needs of consumers and customers are exciting.","Another investment we have made for the long-term health of our company is in our people, and I want to provide some insight on what this means and the scope. As a part of the integration of Hillshire brands, we standardized the holiday and vacation policies across the company and transitioned to a singular competitive compensation structure. This incremental expense of $58 million in Q1 impacted Chicken by $23 million and Prepared Foods by $22 million. The investment is front-loaded in our fiscal year with a lesser impact later in the year and was not adjusted out of our reported earnings. While it is a significant amount of money, it's imperative to invest in our team members for long-term growth and stability. We want to keep Tyson Foods as a preferred place to work with a compensation package that attracts and retains the best people in the industry.","We're investing where it matters, while heightening our focus on lean and continuous improvement to provide fuel for these investments. We are becoming more disciplined at driving out non-value-added costs across the company to focus our precious resources on growth. There will be significant dollars attached to those cost savings and I plan to be more descriptive about this in the future.","So at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Dennis to walk you through our financial results. Dennis?","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Thanks, Tom and good morning everyone. Q1 was our best quarter yet as we delivered record earnings due to strong results across each of our segments, particularly record results in our Beef and Pork segment. The balance of our portfolio and our ongoing investments in our businesses continue to provide consistent, stable growth as we are on track for our fifth straight record year. With record EPS, record operating income and record operating cash flows, we were able to repurchase 8.1 million shares for $520 million in Q1.","First quarter revenues were up slightly to $9.2 billion, as we grew sales volume across all segments, partially offset by declining beef, pork, and raw material prices. Operating income was a record $982 million, representing a 27% increase over Q1 a year ago. Total company return on sales was a record 10.7%, as each of our segments performed within or above their normalized ranges.","Our record EPS of $1.59 represents a 38% increase over $1.15 in Q1 last year. I would also like to note that our last 12 months adjusted EPS is $4.83. Our operating cash flow for the first quarter was a record $1.1 billion and we spent $200 million on capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $44 million, as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC.","Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 34.9%. Net debt to EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.5 times. Including cash of $300 million, net debt was $5.7 billion and total liquidity was approximately $1.6 billion. Net interest expense was $56 million during Q1.","For the quarter, our diluted shares outstanding were 373 million. Pre-tax ROIC for the past 12 months was 19.9%, rapidly approaching pre-acquisition levels, illustrating the strength and stability of our overall earnings as well as our commitment to creating incremental shareholder value.","Now here are some additional thoughts on fiscal 2017. We expect revenues between $36 billion and $37 billion as we grow volume across each segment, offset by the impact of lower beef prices. Net interest expense should approximate $230 million. We currently estimate our effective tax rate to be around 35%. Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases subsequent to this call and based on our average share price in Q1, we expect our diluted shares to be around 371 million. CapEx is expected to approximate $1 billion, as we focus on capacity expansion and operational improvements that create long-term shareholder value.","Last quarter on our call, we mentioned that fiscal 2017 is going to be about building for long-term sustainable growth. We're making significant investments in not only CapEx, but also in warehouse and distribution optimization and talent development, and we're raising the bar in improved worker safety, animal well-being, and food safety.","Q1 came in better than we expected due to strong performance and favorable market conditions in our Beef and Pork segments and was a record quarter including the incremental $58 million investment in our team that Tom mentioned earlier.","The remainder of 2017 is consistent with how we viewed it coming into this year, and therefore, our strong first quarter results gives us confidence in stepping up our annual EPS guidance to a range of $4.90 to $5.05 from our previous guidance of $4.70 to $4.85. This new range is approximately 12% to 15% over fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS and represents a five-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 20%.","In closing, our Q2 should be similar to last year due to our typical seasonality, and the third and fourth quarters are expected to be strong. As we continue to make investments to drive long-term growth, we believe our balanced portfolio can deliver value to our shareholders that will sustain our growth in the future.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Leatherby. We will now begin the question-and-answer session And the first question will come from Heather Jones of the Vertical Group. Please go ahead.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Good morning.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Good morning.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Good morning.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Very nice quarter. I guess, my first question is on the overall growth outlook. So your raised guidance implies flat to up 5 percentage roughly EPS growth for Q2 through Q4, but you mentioned 2017 being sort of an investment year positioned for growth going forward. So I was wondering if you could help us think about how we should think about earnings growth beyond 2017.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Sure. Let me talk about growth overall, then we can talk about sort of EPS over time. You know, yes, we are going to \u2013 we will be making investments for the future of the company in terms of growth, but we are also going to deliver growth in 2017. So, you know, it's key, it's our quarter (21:13) \u2013 our fiber, it's our story. We are consistent. We want sustainable growth. That's our objective.","And I'll say a few things. One, you know, we continue to invest where we want to grow and we're demonstrating growth on value-added products versus the commodity elements of our portfolio, and I'd say that's particularly in Chicken and Prepared Foods we see that very prominently. Beef and Pork are also benefiting from livestock supply and very strong markets, but I would say, Chicken and Prepared Foods is where you'll find us investing heavily.","Prepared Foods is in a fantastic position to take advantage of innovation and brand strength. We've seen the results of the innovation coming through volume, and we are prepared at CAGNY to show you some pretty fantastic progress we've made on our innovation pipeline.","So as it relates to, Heather, the EPS growth expectations, you know, the range that we're guiding to now puts us in the 12% to 15% for this year. Ongoing, that's, you know, where we've talked about continuing to guide as a high single digits EPS growth, and you know, I'll turn it over to Dennis for anything else you want to add there.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","I think that's good, appropriate.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","So high single digit EPS growth is what you feel comfortable with going forward. Did I understand that correctly?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Correct.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","That's right. And think about that...","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","...Heather, there would be healthy volume growth in Chicken and Prepared.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay. And my question is related to Prepared, because that's clearly the primary driver, expanded multiple for the shares, and so you've given us good color as to why margins are going to be pressured for the next 18 months. But beyond that, how do you think we should think about EBIT growth for that segment beyond mid-2018? I mean is a high-single digit, low double-digit EBIT growth number doable for that segment once you get beyond this investment period?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Without giving you specific guidance for 2018, I mean that's too far away for us, what I'd say is we're making the right investments for growth. If you think about the Prepared Foods business, it's really, like I said, two separate businesses. Predominantly in the legacy Tyson organization, it was a food service business and in the legacy Hillshire business, it was about 75% retail, 25% food service. The margin profiles are very different in those businesses. The assets were in different condition. And, so going forward, we want the mix to turn out to be as profitable growth \u2013 continuing profitable growth within the 10% to 12% range. However, we have some work to do as it relates to supporting those assets that serve the food service business. Growth, we feel really strong about in the long-term, and like I said, we'll talk more about that at CAGNY.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question will be from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody. And, Tom, I would wish you congratulations on the Patriots, but that would be somewhat insincere on my part. I just wanted to follow up, because for a long time, management's guidance was for \u2013 again, not for a single year, but really for over the long-term, 10%-plus EPS growth. Now you're talking about high single-digits. To me, frankly, that's a more reasonable range, so I'm not grudging you for it, but I just wanted to get a little bit deeper into the reasons why you feel that that's more of a range that you're comfortable with rather than something in the low double-digit range maybe.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Ken, if we deliver low double-digits, that's going to be awesome. But we're focused on high single-digits, because for us, we believe to continue the growth algorithm of this company, we have to invest. We're going to simultaneously invest. We're going to also amp up our continuous improvement program as I talked about. That feels like the right place for us to continue to drive growth, Dennis.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","I would agree with that entirely.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Okay.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then a quick follow-up from me. Is there any impact to you at all from the avian flu yet? I know it's somewhat early and it doesn't sound like there's a whole lot, but I'm just curious how you're thinking about that, what you're looking at, and what your expectations are maybe, again, more from the export side, obviously?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah, no, I got it, great question. We're constantly paranoid about avian influenza, because it's certainly is something that can wreak havoc on our company. What I'd say is, 2015, we amped up our bio-security. We had good bio-security to begin with, but we amped it up to an all-time high level of discipline and scrutiny, frankly, and it hasn't stopped. And so, that we feel confident about our position, and right now it appears to be, as you called out, a non-U.S. issue, but certainly we remain diligent in our efforts to make sure Tyson is protected.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just quickly, are there any benefits to you from the exports standpoint right now in terms of more countries needing U.S. chicken, or is it \u2013 again, is it just too small an issue to really notice at this point?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah, really it's too small an issue at this point.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah, you're welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from Jeremy Scott of CLSA. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Scott - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Good morning.","Jeremy Scott - CLSA Americas LLC","So I just wanted to ask about Hillshire and follow-up on some of your comments and maybe if we can circle in on a net synergy number. I think one of the things investors are grappling with is, what portion of that $700 million will eventually flow to the bottom line, and to what extent is the investment in innovation that you flagged just the cost of doing business? Is there a market share, whether it's in retail or food service that you're targeting, at which point we'll see that inflection in margins? I mean, the reason I ask is because it seems like Pork and Beef are going to more than cover you for 2017, but when we look out to 2018, 2019 to get to your high single digit targets, Prepared Foods is going to have to carry a larger share of the weight.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Agreed. Yeah, so, Jeremy, as we talked about synergies, the one thing we need to come back to is those numbers that we have continue to talk about, those are gross numbers and there's a lot of expenses beneath that that, you know, net out to a smaller number, and there's a significant amount of investment that we are making in the cost base for sure. The way I'd have you think about it is that, yes, predominantly those have gone to make it more attractive margin in the business, but that's something that will continue on. So as we stop the sort of synergy discussion, we're going to continue to talk about lean and continuous improvement, that's going to, you know, provide the fuel for growth for the business.","Over time, we expect margin expansion. We talked about 10% being the number that we're comfortable with right now. But you should expect margin to expand toward the higher end of that range and continue to experience greater than industry growth.","Jeremy Scott - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And I just wanted to ask about Chicken, go ahead.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","I would just add, just look at the Core 9 and the Focus 5, they have some good growth factors around them and we expect them to continue. So as the margins gap, you can expect the volume growth to contribute to that in a healthy way.","Jeremy Scott - CLSA Americas LLC","Got it. On Chicken, (29:00) your production growth estimate and feed cost outlook remains the same, but your margin guidance came in a little bit softer than last quarter, really as pricing is soft to start the year, but is there anything else structurally changing that would cause you to be more conservative or is it just the elevated supplies of competing proteins and the compensation that you flagged?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah. It will be, you know, our guidance is in that upper-end of the normalized range, 9% to 11%. We expect it to be growing in both, you know, Frozen and Fresh segments. What I'd say is, you know, we're taking advantage of the low cost of raw materials right now and we've added cooking capacity, which is \u2013 we don't talk about that a lot, but that is something that we have made tremendous progress on, as we've added capacity, we've sold that capacity and so we're in a position where we're, you know, looking to add more capacity.","So the mix is improving. We're focused on reducing the cost structure as you call out, but we continue to see that we're doing the right things in that business, and outside of a massive grain shock, we feel like we're in a great, great position.","Jeremy Scott - CLSA Americas LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Good morning.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Maybe first going back to Chicken in the quarter and I just want to make sure we're thinking about kind of how the mix of business is changing and some of the profit drivers. The Chicken EBIT in the quarter was down $95 million year-over-year. You flagged the $23 million higher compensation expense.","At the corporate level, you had about $20 million of higher marketing, I suspect a decent amount of that leaked into the Chicken business. Your feed costs were down. But could you help bridge some of the balance of that? Is it just declines on the Fresh or the more commodity, the values, some of the commodity items, I mean, like quarter values are actually up year-on-year. So, I'm trying to just make sure I'm understanding the margin drivers in the Chicken business correctly and the implications for the balance of the year.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah, sure. You know, pricing is competitive. There's a lot of protein available, so pricing is a big effect, Adam. And, you know, that's not going to abate in the near term, and we see that being an issue that's hanging with us. We also see, as we've discussed, some of those costs rolling through. Now, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's mostly the one-time nature that has rolled through, but that is something that we are investing in to make sure that the margin holds up over time. But I'd say the biggest thing that we're facing right now is just pricing as it relates to overall availability. Dennis?","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","And I'd add just one thing. Remember, last quarter, Q4 of 2016, operating earnings were $219 million and a 7.8% return on sales. This quarter we're up $44 million, $263 million and 9.7% return on sales, and that's what we had foreshadowed that we were moving back into the range and strengthening the business.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. That's helpful. And then, maybe just on the guidance. I'm just trying to make sure for the balance of the year \u2013 I think it was Heather's question at the beginning, with the outlook for Beef that you've given and the already completed share repurchases, I mean, those two factors alone to me would deem to encompass all of the EBIT or the EPS growth that you've contemplated for the balance of fiscal 2017.","And so I'm just trying to think about the components of the outlook that are down, I think, you're losing some heavier investments in Prepared Foods. Chicken, maybe for the next quarter or two might have some year-on-year pressures, but you still are also comping, what was a tougher fiscal fourth quarter, both in Chicken and Prepared Foods. So I'm just trying to reconcile those kind of components of the outlook in some of the areas where the investment spending might be higher for the balance of the year.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. Q2 is always a tough quarter for us to understand exactly how it's going to play out given the seasonality of our business. But I would say it's not just on the Fresh Meat side that there's tremendous seasonality as it relates to the poultry and Prepared Foods side as well.","So we feel like Q2 will be challenged and we think Q3 and Q4 will be strong. Now, we're guiding to what we believe, based on what we know today, those are the numbers we feel confident about and we'll see how it plays out, but it's a lot depends on how Q2 rolls.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And if I could just ask one clarifying question on the high-single digit EPS guidance medium-term, is that before or after the impact of capital allocation? You guys have comfortably north of $1 billion post dividend of free cash flow every year plus the balance sheet, I just want to clarify that high single digit is just an organic number.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","After.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","After? Okay. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thank you for the question. Two things, just a follow-on on Adam's. Your value-added business in Chicken, you said it was up 5% and commodities were down. I guess, I would have thought that your Chicken margins would have held up better year-over-year given that type of expansion. Are you seeing a lot of competitive pricing in value-added Chicken that's causing pressure on those prices?","And then the second thing on Prepared Foods, I think three months ago I think you said that Prepared Foods would have a cost benefit on input costs of $125 million, and now the forecast is flat. So does that mean that you had a big input cost benefit in first quarter, and if so, what happened to the \u2013 did that help your margin in first quarter or was it just not a factor? Thanks.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah, I'm going to \u2013 I'll tackle the first one, and Dennis could probably provide some color on the second part of that, Rob. You know, the difference between last year and this year is just the pricing for us that we're into the marketplace with. I mean, it's what we're focused on as we talked repeatedly is about making sure that we're continuing to put ourselves in a position where we're growing volume. So, think about that value-added growth of 5% that comes making sure that we're entirely competitive, so that is the reason why, year over-year, you're not seeing the same margin structure, but you're seeing the maintained growth. Dennis, do you want to comment on that?","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Sure. As far as the raw material question on Prepared goes, Rob, we benefited by about $100 million in Q1, but we expect the remainder of the year to be flat, to answer your question.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And the $100 million, though, I mean your margins are flat in Prepared Foods, did you have to lower prices in sync with that $100 million?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Absolutely. Yeah, pricing pressure, think about Prepared Foods, our portfolio, it is predominantly protein and it plays in the same space, same dynamics, so absolutely we have been more aggressive for sure.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","And the next question will be from Akshay Jagdale from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. So, I wanted to ask about the compensation topic. So can you just tell us exactly what changed there? Obviously, it's good to see you're investing in people, but I just want to know what changed exactly and how that may be, better aligns with the shareholder interests or growth going forward?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Sure, Akshay. The way to think about it is we have to come to one system across Tyson Foods which is not a unusual thing for companies to make sure that they're doing that in a thoughtful way. As we did it, we said that the right thing to do was to get to a point where we have compelling packages for our team across the organization. For the year, we expect it's going to be about $100 million in total charges. The $58 million that hit Q1, I spoke about, about 80% of that is one-time in nature, and the costs for the rest of the year, they flow through. But I would say that the recurring cost structure increase is less than the accounting true-up for the first quarter and it does make a lot of sense for us to focus on making sure that we have a one-Tyson system as it relates to compensation.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","But are the incentive drivers different or higher or what's causing the step-up?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","No, it was getting to one system on holidays and vacations and because we were so different across both, that was the key issue.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just, you know, looking at the long-term opportunities in Prepared Foods, obviously, you've been investing in growth, and the numbers are showing in the Nielsen data. There's this issue with the legacy private label business which seems to come up every couple of years. I mean, at one point I think that business had a 5.5% margin, but for the last several years, it's been in the low-single digits. What's the opportunity there? Because I thought that as part of the combination of these two assets, Hillshire and legacy Tyson, you know, that's also a major source of synergies, right? So I thought a decent chunk of the synergies were coming from the legacy assets, and to hear that you need to make more investments, I'm just trying to understand what might have changed there, or if it's something new that's come up.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah, and I think it's fair to say that the business has always been on the, as you call it, on the legacy Tyson side, it's been a challenging business from a margin perspective. If we look at the 2014 results, it was a loss maker. 2013, it was about 3%. I think the 5.5 % was one-time that was, I believe, 2012. But if you look at the business year-over-year for the legacy Tyson team, it was a business that was challenged from a margin perspective. So when you're flowing through with the addition of Hillshire, there are some \u2013 the blend-out is going to be somewhat less.","As it relates to your question about the investing in the business, yes, we have continued to invest and part of that or I would say the majority of that, as it relates to synergies, have been closing some plants that were non-strategic as we consolidated volume into existing plants that we're heavily investing in.","That sometimes goes really well. Sometimes it wasn't executed exactly as we had drawn up on the white board. However, what I would say is, the investments that we're making now are pointed towards growing the business and improving the margins. And so, that's as clear as I could put it, Akshay.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","And just one last one on Chicken. The Focus 5, what percent of your business is that today? And I mean long-term, what's the opportunity for higher-margin value-added products as a percentage of that business, and sort of where are we today? Maybe you can just give us, like, a general sense.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah. So the \u2013 we're just getting the number, the percentage of the top of my head, I don't know what that is. You can maybe follow-up with that, Jon, to the extent that we're going to share it.","What I would say is, we are making tremendous impact on our business in food service on poultry. So our Prepared or further processed business in poultry is going extremely well in food service, and we are making sure that those categories we want to play long-term are going to be healthy.","Now, where that growth is going to be sourced from, there's a lot of channel shifting as I talked about. But if you think about the periphery of the grocery store, our customers are looking for solutions that are not necessarily retail packaged brands, but they are ready to consume. You might have heard this term gross around. There's a lot of \u2013 our customers that are looking to capture food service volume, we are in the sweet spot of that space, because our solutions are exactly what they're looking for and our expertise is what they want to leverage.","So, I'll say, and thinking growth for the future, food service will come from the traditional channels that it does, that you know of, but I also would ask you to think about that periphery of the store being a real sweet spot for us.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Okay. I'll pass it on.","Operator","The next question will be from Farha Aslam of Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Good morning.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Good morning.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc.","Could you go through the pizza topping business, just wanted to make sure that that recovery is still on track for the second half of this year?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yes, yes, it is. That is going to be a part of what's going to continue to hang with us here, but we wanted to make an improvement in our network. We went down that path. We made a good decision to close a plant that was not fit for the business, but the production was transferred to the newer facilities. It was absolutely the right decision to position us for growth, and we just have more work to do. The transition wasn't seamless, like I said, but we feel like that we're on path to make that a long-term healthy strong business for us, both in terms of Prepared Foods growth and also the margin structure.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc.","That's helpful. And then, if we could just talk about marketing investment, what do you anticipate the total company marketing investment step-up will be this year compared to last year? Have we hit a sustainable run rate? How should we think about incremental marketing for Tyson going forward in that high-single digit growth rate?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah, so Farha, I won't give you the forward-looking marketing investments, but what I will tell you is we are doing two things that you should hold us accountable to. One is making sure that that investment continues to improve its return. So we are doing some fabulous work on our team to make sure ROI continues to go up on marketing investments. And so if the ROI is increasing and we're making the right moves in supporting our branded businesses, we would expect the overall to continue to go up.","So, if we're getting a good return on that, we want to support the brands, and you know, it depends on which brand you're talking about, what the ultimate level is, the mix-out is going to be different depending upon what kind of traction we've got.","Clearly, we're going to spending and have spent a lot more on the Tyson brands and we're going to continue to spend on the other brands that we have the number one position. So it's what's required, certainly our customers expect that. And like I said, we're going to get nice returns on those investments.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc.","And in terms of kind of an ROI or payback period, how do you assess marketing? Because we've heard for two or three years that over the last two, three years, you're increasing marketing spend. We just want to understand how we should judge that marketing expenditure?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Okay. Let me take that as a follow-up. We'll talk to Jon to see if we can get you some more detail around that that we're willing to share. And I mean part of it we feel like we have a competitive advantage in that area and want to make sure we thread that needle correctly. But I would ask Jon to follow up with you, Farah.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the Beef segment. Obviously, very strong quarter and your guidance for the year, while it implies a step-down from this quarter, would still be a nice step-up from last year. This seems like a long cycle segment with cattle supplies perhaps implying another strong year in 2018. I'm just wondering how we should maybe shape our models into 2018, with a segment like this that shouldn't turn on a dime. That said, it just did turn on a dime. So any help in thinking about that in the Beef segment would be super helpful.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah, awesome. So, you know, I really thought we'd be going out of limb talking about 2018. What we see are, you know, certainly in the regions where we are \u2013 we'd like how it's shaping up. 2017 looks to have better numbers, let's say, cattle in our regions, which is great. Our cattle inventory, we feel like \u2013 if you look at it compared to 2011 and 2012, this year, it's similar \u2013 its improving to that level.","And, you know, we feel like for our position going into 2018, it's teeing up well, but it's just too far out there to know. You know, 2018 cattle are born in 2016, and we're kind of, you know, trying to model that ourselves. But we feel great about 2018. I can't give you a view, I'm sorry.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","It's just that, when we look at this segment and you have these new levels being reached, is there anything about this that makes you think that the Beef range is going to be moving higher? Is there anything going on structurally that is giving you an upside bias to where Beef margins can be over the medium term?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","I'll just go back and say, 2017 looks better than last year, and the Midwest, more cattle coming. We like that. We believed for the year we're at 5%, just the level that we're feeling like we'll wind up at. And it's hard to tell, but I would say, we're shaping up well. Dennis, anything?","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","I would say 2018 looks to be another solid year, potentially above the range again. As far as addressing the range, it's too early to do that right now.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. I just wanted to talk about the Chicken business a little bit more. And have you seen any change in the way you're contracting some of your Prepared Foods, and some of your tray-pack business since the Georgia Dock pricing (48:11) metric was eliminated?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","No. So, as I've said before, the Georgia Dock for Tyson Foods is a tempest in a teapot. It's really not something that drives a lot of our attention. Since the elimination of the mechanism last month, customers that are affected are being switched to other methods, so no impact on margin. We've told you that in the past we have various pricing mechanisms. It's really supply and demand that our customers are looking at, what's the overall protein availability, how do they feel like they have leverage. Certainly, as we're continuing to grow the branded business more of that is on a list price. We have certainly some businesses that are formula driven, but predominantly on grains, so that's what I'd ask you to think about.","And the diversity of those pricing mechanisms for us tells us it's important for us, because it helps us de-risk the total margin profile. But as it relates to the Georgia Dock, no impact.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then the other thing is, just related to Chicken again, I know you've given a flat feed cost outlook. Is that generally assuming a constant volume basis or does that incorporate any volume growth? And with the breast meat prices on the board trading for below $1, I guess the quarter prices are still little above $1, but with breast meat selling there, you are taking advantage and maybe opportunistically looking toward purchasing breast meat on the open market and flexing your buy versus grow strategy? Thanks.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome. Absolutely, we will continue to flex our buy versus grow strategy. We try to grow whole-bird increments to remind everybody and we buy pieces. So the parts that we need we're going to continue to buy on the market when the market is favorable, but that's our model. And that's what we feel really strong about to continue our growth is to make sure that we're making sure what we're producing internally is in whole-bird increments.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Ken Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Good morning.","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Hey, Ken.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I just wanted to get some clarification. How much cost in 2017 will not be repeated in 2018?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","About 80% of the $58 million, so let's just round it up to about $50 million.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","What about going forward? It sounds like there's more investment coming between the competition and also the network. I know you said 18 months, but there's \u2013 18 months is obviously a year and a half, right. So there's a part of 18 months that won't get it and then there's also that. So I'm just trying to figure out, 2018, what will not repeat as a total cost?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Ken, the 2017, whatever we have teed up to invest in 2017 is in our guidance, it's in the capital plan. This is, you know, we've been working on this for some time. As it relates to rolling forward beyond 2017, simultaneously, we're amping up our continuous improvement program. So investments that we're going to make in the business, we know that there needs to be a paid for (51:24).","So that is what we intend to do, so it's not going to be incremental. I would ask you to think about it as it's going to be offset by continued improvement in our continuous improvement efforts and discipline. So that's how I think about it. Dennis?","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Ken, maybe I misunderstood your question, but I thought you were asking what amount of our expenses will not be repeated next year?","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right, for the total \u2013 for what's in 2017, what are your total expenses that are one-time in nature that we will not see in 2018?","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","About $50 million, that's about 80% of that.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. There's no \u2013 so in the third and fourth quarter \u2013 second, third, and fourth quarter, we're not going to see more incremental spending that's included in your guidance that will not come in in 2018?","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","So, let's unpack that. We said $100 million for the full year, $58 million in the first quarter. Of the $58 million, about 80% of that is truing up some liabilities. And so that's going to stay at that level next year. So therefore it will not be repeated. Is that clear now?","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Of the $100 million, that is going to be spent in 2017...","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","80% will not \u2013 so $80 million not repeat in 2018?","Dennis Leatherby - Tyson Foods, Inc.","No, 80% of the $58 million that was incurred in the first quarter will not be repeated.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Are there any other incremental \u2013 I guess, I'm just trying to figure out what incremental spend and will not, but I will take this offline. I don't want to belabor there.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah. I will have Jon follow-up with you. We can do the math together and...","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","My follow-up question is, is 2017 a base number from which to grow or is it a number from which you've got to kind of adjust to figure out what the long-term growth target will be off that number?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","2017 is continuing to be a number where \u2013 we are going to grow in 2017 and we believe that, of course, it's going to be a base for us to grow into the future. But, you know, that's not \u2013 we want to make sure that we are continuing to grow while we're investing, that's a trick, and that's what we want to do for, you know, all of our stakeholders, make sure we're doing that really, really well. So I don't know...","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, you don't think 2017 is the aberrational for a EPS number, although you have strong Beef and Pork packer margins. So this number is a sustainable number, that's my question.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Absolutely.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will be a follow-up from Heather Jones of the Vertical Group.","Please go ahead.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking the follow-up. I was just wondering if you could help me to think about your input cost on Prepared Foods. So, some of your competitors, will be short bellies, long other items, but just so that we can track this and think about the impact going forward, if you could just give us a sense of any of the cuts that you may be more exposed to than others as far as from a cost perspective?","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Yeah, I'd say, Heather, it's not the cuts so much as it is the businesses that, I'd say, apply to. So if you think about the retail business, it operates in a typical CPG model, where we are looking at supply\/demand, the strength of the brands, elasticities to make the right calls on what's the best thing for us to do as it relates to pricing.","The food service, the raw material, generally flows through on a formula price. There's always \u2013 we're looking to make sure that we have the right balance, but it's slower. There's a almost \u2013 about 70% of the raw material gets passed on. But those funds will continue to \u2013 that we \u2013 when we capture \u2013 certainly, margin momentum are going to be continuing to be focused on innovation.","The particular cuts isn't so much how we think about it. Now, with the exception of bellies. Of course, bellies has been a particularly volatile raw material right now and that's something that we continue to make sure that we're doing the right thing for, the right brand, as well as our Jimmy Dean brand business. And that's probably the area that gets the most attention right now. The rest of the commodity inputs or cost inputs are something that is \u2013 we feel like we've got a pretty good handle on.","Bellies are domestic. Hams, I think, as it relates to another, probably volatile, component, are export predominantly. So the rest of the trim and those items that we buy for retail and food service, food service moves typically on a formula, retail does not. There's generally a lag effect up and down.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","So as it relates to your retail bacon business, we should care about bellies, but you would be working to pass those through.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Absolutely.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Thomas Hayes for his closing remarks.","Thomas P. Hayes - Tyson Foods, Inc.","Great. Thanks for all the wonderful questions.

For reconciliations to our GAAP results, please refer to this morning's press release.","I'll now turn the call over to Noel White.","Noel White","Thanks Jon and good morning everyone. Along with Stewart, joining us in the room today is Dean Banks who joined the company at the beginning of the month and is beginning to transition to his new role as President of our company. Welcome Dean.","We're pleased to report we delivered top and bottom-line growth in our first quarter and generated record Beef results. Before I speak to these results, I'd like to talk about our focus on sustainability to meet the growing global demand for protein that's why we recently announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos the creation of the Coalition for Global Protein. A combination of strategies and solutions including all forms of protein are needed to responsibly feed a world population expected to reach almost 10 billion in 2050 requiring an estimated doubling of the production of protein needed today.","Our goal is to unite stakeholders across the food and agricultural sector to develop new and creative solutions to sustainably feed the world with affordable nutritious food.","We believe this reflects positively on our strategy which is focused on sustaining our company and our world for future generations, while growing our business by delivering superior value to consumers and customers and fueling our growth and returns through commercial, operational, and financial excellence.","Turning to our results, our overall first quarter was in line with expectations with adjusted earnings of $1.66 per share. Beef and Pork results were strong. Prepared Foods drove growth in retail consumption. The Chicken improved operationally, although continued to face soft pricing which weighed on results.","Looking across the marketplace, consumption of our retail Prepared Food products has been outstanding. Both the Tyson core retail business lines which were up more than 5% and total Tyson retail up more than 3% outpaced volume and sales growth versus the top 10 retail food manufacturers in the 52 weeks ending December 28th. This growth contrasts with the total food and beverage category which was down 0.4% for the same period.","We've now experienced six consecutive quarters of growth. Our core business lines are outpacing the categories with volume share growth of 1% and all core business lines are holding or growing share.","In the Foodservice channel, our Foodservice Focus six product lines grew 3.5% and were twice the total broadline distribution channel growth of 1.6% over the last 13 weeks.","The power of our Foodservice brands, innovation, and capabilities across all channels has set the stage for growth. In the last three months, Jimmy Dean Breakfast Sausage volume grew 10%; Tyson Red Label grew 17%; and the Tyson brand grew 8%.","Now, let's take a look at our business segments. In Prepared Foods, growth and share performance has been outstanding, especially with our big brands. Retail innovation launched at the end of fiscal 2019 is performing well with velocities meeting or exceeding targets on the national launches of Jimmy Dean Biscuit Roll-Ups and Jimmy Dean Morning Combos with both demonstrating velocity performance in the top half of their respective categories. While still early, Biscuit Roll-Ups show potential for driving category growth.","Prepared Foods profit margin in the first quarter was impacted by an $80 million increase in raw material costs driven by beef trim and hams. Some of this increase was offset by pricing though Prepared Foods may continue to experience volatile input costs.","We continue to experience some operational effects from our recent ERP system implementation which impacted margins by roughly $40 million in the quarter. About half of this was discounted sales with the remainder related to inventory write-downs and donations. Although, the effects have persisted longer than anticipated, we continue to work aggressively to resolve them and we are seeing progress.","In the alternative protein category, the Raised & Rooted brand is only the beginning of our plan to build the world's leading portfolio of plant protein products. In the back half of the year, we're planning multiple new launches across protein forms, brands, meal occasions and channels. Over time, we see these options as another stable protein complementing our core offerings.","We're being practical and thoughtful in our approach to enable us to create better product experiences with healthier nutritious ingredients at affordable prices. Looking ahead for the Prepared Foods segment, we expect to maintain our momentum in the market. We will do this by continued investment behind our brands through marketing, promotions and innovation. And we will remain agile with pricing to offset input costs driven by the volatility of raw materials.","For the fiscal year, we believe the Prepared Foods segment's adjusted operating margin will be 10% to 12%. Our Beef segment produced a record adjusted operating margin of 11.2% in the first quarter. The quality of domestic-fed cattle has been excellent. This makes every link of the beef supply chain more valuable, whether it's a producer, the packer or the retailer and results in a better product for consumers.","Our premium programs continue to grow as a percentage of sales. Our customers and consumers are seeing the value in our quality and it's translating into increased revenue. Our Fresh Meats premium programs have nearly doubled over the last five years to approximately \u00a31 billion. I'm pleased to report that our Finney County, Kansas plant damaged by fire last August is now back to full operations. Beef exports are strong with the potential to be even stronger now that trade agreements have been formalized.","I'd like to remind you however that our second quarter is typically our most challenging for Beef. In addition to the challenges caused by winter weather in the Midwest, the drought in Australia has forced a herd liquidation putting more beef on the global market. Looking ahead, exports from Australia are expected to decline substantially as the ongoing drought and the tragic fires are likely to delay their herd rebuilding.","With Australian beef amounting to quarter of U.S. beef imports, this could be beneficial to our business. Our export sales continue to equal or exceed industry growth rates. For fiscal 2020, we're expecting our Beef segment's adjusted operating margin to meet the upper end of 6.5% to 7.5%.","Moving to our Pork segment. Strong pork demand and solid operational execution along with ample hog supplies led to a 14% adjusted operating margin in Q1. Export markets were the primary driver for increased demand. We believe that we are at the very early stages of the global demand shifts that we've expected from African swine fever. We're filling additional orders to China and we've seen year-over-year increases nearly 600% in the first quarter and we're already benefiting from indirect shipments as we backfill in other markets.","We've progressed towards a ractopamine-free hog supply. This will open up more markets to us as the need to move product globally increases. In fact, global demand for all proteins is increasing as ASF continues to reduce pork supplies in Asia. For fiscal 2020, we're expecting our Pork segment's adjusted operating margin to be 6% to 8%.","Now turning to the Chicken segment. We're pleased that our execution is better and operations are on track to deliver $200 million year-over-year run rate improvement. However, pricing which has been weaker than expected was the primary driver of our return on sales in Q1, but softer pricing has persisted into the second quarter. All leading indicators point to domestic poultry supply growth and the USDA is projecting a 4% increase in chicken production. I previously indicated global protein suppliers being impacted by ASF, while demand continues to grow at about 2% per year.","In light of ASF, we anticipate global demand will keep pace with U.S. supply growth as Chinese imports of U.S. chicken are expected to double. Domestically, we'll continue to innovate and drive demand in the frozen value-added space with products like Tyson Air Fried Chicken. This product launched last July with strong customer acceptance and is demonstrating dollar velocity performance in the top half of the category. Early data shows that the Tyson Air Fried Chicken is attracting new consumers and driving growth in this $2.6 billion category.","Looking ahead in the Chicken segment, we expect an annual adjusted operating margin of 4% to 6% driven primarily by softer pricing and overall chicken supply. In International and Other, both our legacy and newly acquired businesses are contributing to our improved international performance. We see the potential to expand in these growth markets, which are estimated to drive 98% of global protein demand increases over the next five years with 70% of that growth coming from Asia. We have a business of scale and there are still synergies to unlock.","We have high-quality assets and a strong team led by Chris Langholz who recently joined the company as President of International. Chris has an extensive background in global protein and we welcome him to the Tyson team. Our legacy International business are performing well increasing sales and earnings. The new acquisitions are providing great platforms for growth. We're committed to becoming the global leader in protein by serving emerging markets and strategic customers across channels and across segments.","Across our businesses, trade deals are contributing to our optimism. We believe with improved access to global markets from recent trade deals, we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities in the global marketplace.","In addition to U.S. trade deals with Japan and South Korea, we're very pleased the Phase one trade agreement with China and the USMCA have both been signed. An important benefit of the deal with China is the inclusion of more protein eligible for shipment. We're shipping product to China and have more orders on the books.","But keep in mind that tariffs that remain in place puts the U.S. at a pricing disadvantage in the Chinese market. If tariffs are lifted or reduced, we would likely see an acceleration of already increased global demand for U.S. pork, beef and chicken.","We're closely monitoring news of the coronavirus. We're actively assessing what this outbreak may mean for us for our global business and preparing for the possibility of any impact. In China, we've been working with the government and have successfully restarted some of our operations. The financial impact is unknown at this time.","With that I'll now ask Stewart to take us through the financials.","Stewart Glendinning","Thanks Noel and good morning everyone. Our first quarter results were inline with our expectations with earnings of $1.66 per share, up 5% from Q1, 2019. Operating income was $894 million, up 6% over last year. First quarter GAAP operating income was impacted $52 million or $0.11 per share for a restructuring charge and $16 million net of insurance proceeds or $0.03 per share for costs related to a fire at our beef plant in Finney County, Kansas.","Sales in Q1 were up 6% to just over $10.8 billion with an 8.3% return on sales. Sales volume was up 4.7% and average sales price was up 1.4%. Our operating cash flows were $894 million for the quarter and liquidity was $1.4 billion at quarter end. Including cash of $497 million net debt was $11.2 billion and net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.7 times for the 12-month ending December 28.","Net interest expense was $117 million in Q1. Capital expenditures were $312 million in the quarter and we continue to target an overall CapEx return of approximately twice our cost of capital.","Our capital allocation will continue to prioritize debt reduction while reinvesting in our business for organic growth buying back stock and increasing our dividend. In the first quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $132 million. Weighted average shares outstanding were approximately $367 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 22.7% in the first quarter. Depreciation and amortization was $288 million.","As Noel said, our newly acquired international businesses are contributing to the improvement in our International operations. Their contributions are inline with or better than our expectations, despite the high amortization and purchase price accounting loads placed on them. Noel has articulated our segment return on sales guidance which should give you an indication of how we expect our businesses to perform.","Now I'd like to provide some additional commentary on our outlook. Keep in mind that fiscal 2020 is a 53-week year. However we have adjusted our outlook to be comparable to 52 weeks.","Net interest expense should approximate $450 million. We continue to project approximately $1.3 billion in CapEx for the fiscal year, as we progress with building additional processing capacity for case-ready fresh chicken, beef and pork and we plan to scale back CapEx when those projects are completed.","We expect liquidity to remain above our $1 billion target. Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 23.5%. I would like to remind you that Q2 is normally a weaker quarter for us and we have seen a slower than expected start in January.","For Q2 fiscal year 2020, we are expecting lower earnings than Q1 driven by continued weak market conditions in chicken, higher raw material costs and some residual ERP impacts in Prepared Foods and normal seasonal cyclicality in beef and pork. When combined with the overall availability of protein a continuation of these factors will likely result in our earnings being lower than the same quarter last year. This is before any potential impacts to our business from coronavirus.","Improvements in the back half are dependent upon achieving expected savings and pricing improvements in Chicken, managing to offset raw material cost increases in Prepared Foods and continued strong demand for beef and pork later in the year. That concludes my remarks and now we'll go back to Noel for additional commentary. Noel?","Noel White","Thank you, Stewart. Supply-demand dynamics have become much more global and our diversified business model and global footprint put us where the growth is occurring and allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities.","In addition, we're encouraged by potential increased, export demand and the resulting reduced domestic availability of proteins. In closing, our strong brands, strong team, world-class assets, great customers and a global footprint to meet growing demand for protein leave us well positioned for future success.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator we're ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone.","Noel White","Good morning, Alexia.","Alexia Howard","Hi. I'm sure others will be focusing on the Chicken dynamics, but just to kick things off at a higher level, can you give us an update on where things stand with the trade agreements particularly with China? What's going on with the tariff situation? And what are you seeing in terms of international shipments? Because I know that it's -- there's things opening up around the world for you. How do you expect that to evolve over time?","Noel White","Yeah. Actually we are very pleased that our government has come to trade agreements just since our last conference call with Japan and Korea, Phase one agreement with China with USMCA. So we're very pleased with the progress that our government has made.","Shipments continue and interest has been strong. We are currently shipping and we have more orders on the books for China. And our business in the other countries that I mentioned continue to be strong as well not only those countries, but other countries around the world.","So from a trade perspective, it looks very promising. And as you might have seen overnight some of the tariffs that have been in place with China were lowered by approximately 5%. So that's great progress as well.","Alexia Howard","Great. And as a follow-up we have seen the pork cutout price start to increase over here as we would expect. We haven't seen much movement in terms of the grocery on-shelf pricing, which ultimately could start to drive the overall meat on the below part. Do you anticipate that those retail prices will start to increase on the Pork side and then start to bleed out into the other parts of the business as well?","Noel White","Alexia, first of all, I think pork continues to be a great value in the marketplace. And whether it's beef or chicken, chicken is also very attractively priced and whether there's room to raise prices on pork I think it really depends on what happens to cutout over the course of the next 60 days or so.","I don't think retailers are going to immediately going to change prices because of some short-term increases in wholesale prices. I think that if they believe that that will continue to be the case then they will. I think it's too soon to call.","Alexia Howard","Great. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Noel White","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ken Zaslow with the Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.","Ken Zaslow","Hey, good morning everyone.","Noel White","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zaslow","Just have two questions. One is can you talk about your chicken operations outlook? The industry is clearly going -- is kind of soft, but can you parse out the difference between what happened Tyson internally issues and underlying fundamentals for the chicken industry? And where is that going to go? Again, the quarter is done second quarter is largely kind of in the books as well. But can you talk about where the outlook will go and how you kind of think about that?","Noel White","Sure Ken. First of all, our chicken operations, if you remember last quarter I said that we expected a $200 million improvement year-over-year in 2020 versus 2019 purely from a performance standpoint. And I am pleased to say that we are on track for the run rate of capturing that $200 million.","So our plants continue to perform better than what they were. However, the pricing environment on poultry has been relatively weak and that's obvious in public available data, so the improvements that we've captured purely from a performance standpoint has been either offset or more than offset by the weakness in wholesale pricing.","Ken Zaslow","So you think it's mostly the industry not your operations that has created a downside to your guidance?","Noel White","Absolutely. Yes.","Ken Zaslow","Then my second question is just building on Alexia's question is, when you're thinking about the exports, can you tell me what you think the exports will increase for chicken beef and pork in 2020 and more importantly 2021? Are we looking at double-digit increases across the board? Are we looking at 20%? Like how do you think about this in terms of how the export picture will build over the next -- for each of the proteins?","Noel White","Ken, I can't give you an exact number as to what the expectation of the increase is going to be. I think it will certainly increase. And if we take back through 2019, there was a run-up in hog prices in the spring and exports didn't material quite as quickly as what was expected. There were heavy shipments coming out of both South America and Europe to China.","And then the Chinese stepped into the U.S. market and we saw the effect of that in the fall. And a lot of the product arrived and cleared in time for the Chinese New Year. There's product that continues to ship. There continues to be interest in pork and the same thing would be true with beef and with poultry.","So interest has been strong. Demand has been good. And the other thing I mentioned on the call last quarter is that we expected to backfill into other markets. And that in fact has happened. Our shipments to some of the other countries have in fact increased. So it's not just China, it's to other countries around the world as well.","Ken Zaslow","Thank you.","Noel White","Yeah, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Rob Moskow","Hi. Thank you. I had some questions about the chicken guidance. You lowered the margin estimate by about 200 basis points. But also in your prepared remarks, Noel, you said that you're now including the assumption that global demand will match the supply growth, which has also been increased to 4%. I think in your prior guidance you said, you were not going to include any ASF impact on the chicken business or on the business as a whole. Are we now assuming that there's an ASF, a positive ASF impact in the back half of your year? And then I had a follow-up.","Noel White","Yes. We do think that there will be a positive impact Rob on exports. We are expecting the four production -- 4% production increase. We are expecting to continue to see growth in demand from an export standpoint not only to China but to other places in the world as well.","Rob Moskow","Okay. But it's just not enough to drive your overall chicken pricing higher to offset the excess supply here in the U.S.?","Noel White","Yes. And Rob I think we need to keep in mind that when we talk about exports into the different markets that there's strength in certain products, there's weaknesses in certain products when we talk about chicken. So the USDA data would indicate that chicken breast pricing in particular has been weak.","On the other hand there has been strength in other products such as boneless skinless thighs and tenders and wings. So it's not as simple as just thinking chicken, but it's specific parts that there's strength and weaknesses.","Rob Moskow","Sure. And here's the follow-up. The -- I've talked to industry participants about what's causing the excess supply. It looks like some of it is transitory related to favorable weather and grow-outs. Can you give us a sense as to whether you think this 4% U.S. supply growth sustains for another year for another two years? I mean, I can make the case that there's a lot of capacity coming online, so maybe 4% is the new number. But I could also see the argument that maybe we're coming to the end of a multiyear expansion in the industry.","Noel White","Right. Rob, I -- first of all there was very favorable weather conditions as we came through fall for growing conditions. I think the weight of the chicken as an industry was up year-over-year. I know that ours was certainly heavier, heavier than what we originally projected and I just have to assume that that's probably the case with others in the industry as well.","Historically, the U.S. increase over the course of time has averaged at about a 2% growth rate and that's a pretty well-kept pace with what the increase in demand has been. So over the course of 12 months it's hard for me to say, but I think over the course of time that we think in terms of about 2% that that's kind of where my mindset would be.","Rob Moskow","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Noel White","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research. Please go ahead.","Heather Jones","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Noel White","Good morning.","Heather Jones","Good morning. So I want to stick with chicken and just dive a little deeper. You mentioned that you're on pace to generate the $200 million in operational improvements. And like you said, breast meat pricing has been weak. Now if we rewind a few years ago, Tyson was always well pretty consistently short breast meat but it seems like -- because the year-on-year deterioration in Tyson's chicken performance for this quarter was worse than the industry. So am I right in thinking that you guys are long more breast meat than you've been in the last couple of years? And if so is there any expectation that that should shift in coming quarters?","Noel White","Good question Heather. When Rob asked the question about production increases and I mentioned that the weights were heavier than expected that is in fact true with us and breast meat production as well. So we did use more internally. We did not buy as much on the outside market as what we had originally projected or planned to. Corrections have been made Heather that our buy versus grow strategy remains intact. However in Q1, it was not exactly as we planned.","Heather Jones","Okay. Thank you for that. And my follow-up is as far as -- how should we think about -- I mean pork exports to China have been pretty strong consistently and I would expect those to accelerate. But on the poultry side, just wondering if you could give us a sense of how you expect the cadence of those exports to be. The coronavirus seems to slow down the logistics some, but do you expect this to build as that February 14th agreement takes place? Or I mean, how should we -- how are you guys thinking about the cadence and exports to China of poultry specifically?","Noel White","Heather every day brings something new. The news overnight was welcome. If anything I'd say that we're going to have quite a bit of volatility. As I mentioned demand continues to be -- or interest at least continues to be strong. There is certainly the need and coronavirus has just clouded that a bit frankly Heather.","There has been disruptions. There's been disruptions in domestic production. There's been disruption at the ports. So that has skewed shipments receivables. I would expect that we get -- once we get past the coronavirus incident whenever that might be that, I do think that there's going to be a very strong demand coming out of that. But trying to estimate what that time period is going to be is not possible at this point.","Heather Jones","Okay. Thank you so much.","Noel White","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Ben Theurer","Yeah. Good morning, Noel, Stewart. Thanks for taking my questions. So I guess, we've talked a lot about Chicken so I want to switch a little bit into Pork and Beef. So, clearly on Pork to start-off, I mean you've had a very strong first quarter 14% operating income margin, but nonetheless you kept the guidance unchanged at 6% to 8%. So, I mean simple arithmetic it looks like you're looking for a relative weakness on a sequential basis for the remainder of the year. And it's also curious because you've said on an earlier question that you now do take a little bit of ASF benefit into the back half of the Chicken segment so you're not taking anything into consideration for Pork, or is it just trying to be conservative, if you could give a little more clarity on the guidance in Pork.","Noel White","Sure. Ben, our Q1 October, November, December is typically the strongest margin quarter for us and it's not unusual for us to drop off in Q2. So we're basically following the typical seasonal patterns that we would see. And normally we'll see things start to improve in Q2. And then through the summer it's not bad. And then in Q1, October, November, December it strengthens pretty substantially. So we're just projecting that the basic seasonal patterns that we've seen in the past.","Ben Theurer","And that is literally absent any ASF benefit though?","Noel White","In this case yes.","Ben Theurer","Okay. And then on Beef. I mean, clearly you've highlighted it within the release that you still had obviously the operational headwind but just not being able to get enough volume through because of the closing of the Kansas plant and the fire that affected it. Now you're back in. Could you elaborate a little bit? Like, if things would have been normal how would Beef turned out? So if you \u2013 I mean, you've adjusted for it to a certain degree but how would your volume at the other Beef plants during the quarter where you printed the minus 8% if we take out the one that was shut down because of the fire? Just to see the underlying fundamentals on Beef.","Noel White","Yeah. Ben, that's impossible to say what volumes would have been without the fire. I think the distinction was basically that the strength in our export demand and I think it's more of a demand story than restricted supply story. So don't know what supply would have been without the fire, but I do know that demand has been extraordinarily strong both domestically and from an export standpoint in Beef.","Ben Theurer","Okay. Perfect. I'll leave it here. Thank you very much.","Noel White","Thank you, Ben.","Operator","Our next question will come from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Noel White","Good morning.","Adam Samuelson","So I was hoping to just dig a little bit more on the Chicken business and really just make sure \u2013 just thinking about the different market segments there and the pricing and market pressure that you're facing. I mean, again, I think just going back to Heather's question on the buy versus grow and breast meat seems to be bearing a disproportionate amount of some of the market pressures of late. And just trying to think about how that's translating to \u2013 into your \u2013 whether it's the tray pack the small bird your further process business I wouldn't think that that impact is equal. I mean, especially where \u2013 I would think leg quarters you should have some benefit from better pricing. And as we think about 2020, just any comments on contracting for various foodservice institutional accounts how that \u2013 how those played out?","Noel White","Yeah. Adam, first of all I can't talk about pricing. It's a very sensitive subject. Most of the pricing is concluded not all of it, but most of it. And I would say that, as we came through our Q1 and as we enter Q2 breast meat pricing in particular is weaker than I would have expected it to be. However, as I mentioned earlier there has been strength in other products. Leg quarter pricing frankly has been a bit erratic as we came through Q1 January, February and don't know at this point what March, April, May is going to hold. A lot of those prices are not yet settled so that would be purely speculate on my behalf.","However, with breast meat USDA's data would say it's trading something below $1 right now so it's at or near historic lows. It presents a tremendous value both at retail and at foodservice. And typically when that happens you see some type of increase in either featuring or promotions at foodservice establishments. So I think that over the course of time and whether that's one month or six months, we're going to see increased promotion on those proteins that are of greatest value. And right now that would include chicken breast.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. And then just shifting gears a bit of a clarification question but maybe there's something in here. Just in the quarter in Prepared Foods your reported volume was down 3.1% yet you look at whether \u2013 the scan Nielsen data that we could track and what you reported on the slides in terms of the growth, both for retail and focus five foodservice items, there's growth. And I'm just trying to understand, kind of, the disparity between the reported segment growth on the volume side versus what you can see in the measured channels.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. I think, when you look at the -- this is Stewart. When you look at the reported volumes, those volumes reflect some channel shifts that we had between our segments. They don't account really for any profit on a total basis, so pretty immaterial. You see them in the quarter because of the kind of product. But the numbers we are giving you, in terms of the performance in the market, are more of the organic numbers that reflect the momentum of the business.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. I appreciate the color. I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Stewart Glendinning","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.","Ben Bienvenu","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.","Noel White","Good morning, Ben.","Ben Bienvenu","I wanted to ask about SAP. You had said that -- I appreciate the color on the call-out to the impact to Prepared Foods in the quarter. Obviously, you guys are making strides on improving the margins net raw material cost and net of SAP cost challenges. And the guidance for the balance of the year suggests that, that should continue margin expansion. So I'm just curious, if you could provide any color on how you expect the cadence of SAP impact to linger if at all. Should we see the magnitude diminish? And is it impacting any of the other segments beyond Prepared Foods?","Stewart Glendinning","Well, just to be clear, this was a system that was implemented for both Chicken and Prepared. We see the impact only in Prepared at the moment. We don't want to give any specific guidance on the timing for that. Know that we're working aggressively. We are managing the factors that influence the write-offs and the distressed inventory that we see. And we of course expect to see improvement as we move forward.","Ben Bienvenu","Okay. Great. And then, one question from me, on the Chicken segment. You talked about, Noel, making some corrections to being a bit longer on boneless skinless breast. Is that -- can you help us think about what those adjustments are, how quickly you can make them? And if this is a sensitive question, I understand. But, I think, on the facility front you guys have looking -- have been looking at opening the Humboldt facility later this year. Does the current supply environment impact that decision or the timing of that at all, to the extent you can comment?","Noel White","You're right, Ben, that is a sensitive question. Now, the production in our Q1, it was heavier than it was originally projected. And we, as always, respond to things that we don't expect, so you can fully expect that to take place. And as far as timing of the Humboldt start-up, nothing has changed with that. The project is on schedule and on budget.","Stewart Glendinning","And one other thing -- sorry, Noel, if I can just go back to the previous question. I just want to make sure that I'm very clear. Ben, your question on, when we expect to see improvement, we have so far this quarter have seen run rates that have been consistent with last quarter. And just for clarity, as we're working on this, of course, we expect this not to be a permanent part of our business. I want to be really clear that, that improvement lies in front of us.","Ben Bienvenu","Very, very helpful. Thanks and best of luck.","Stewart Glendinning","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Piken","Thank you. And just wanted to touch base a little bit on some of the chicken sandwich wars, and basically, it seems like there's been a lot of talk about the success of those sandwich wars. And just wondering, like, is the dynamic within the chicken markets healthier, maybe, for like some of the smaller birds and maybe the tray pack? Or is there a spillover effect from the weakness, maybe, in some of the bigger bird breast meat markets? And can these sandwich wars maybe help the chicken market? How much?","Noel White","Michael, with fast food, different customers use different-sized birds, so it's not possible to say that's advantaging one segment versus another. If we go back a couple of years ago, we saw hamburgers being heavily promoted. And, obviously, this last year that switched to chicken burgers and -- or chicken sandwiches and it looks like this year that we're going to see the same thing.","And that's purely because of the value that chicken has right now. And ground pork and beef prices are higher. The lean beef, particularly lean imported beef, is up substantially due to the reasons I talked about in the script, with drought conditions and the shortage of supply coming on, on the imported side.","Michael Piken","Okay, yes. And then, I guess, just as a follow-up here. I think one particularly large operator that you guys had serviced pretty heavily, is talking about potentially doing a pretty big promotion for chicken later this year. Like, is it possible, or what steps to take place, like, if there's not enough of like the smaller birds, like, can you guys chop up some of the bigger breast meat or the -- from the heavier birds to accommodate that product? Or how easy is it to do it? What steps does that entail? Thank you.","Noel White","Well, okay. Michael first of all I cannot talk about what specific customers may or may not be doing. But I think that there will be sufficient supply, regardless on whatever customer that you might be referring to. So I don't see an issue from a supply standpoint but can't talk specifically about any specific customer.","Michael Piken","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tom Palmer","Good morning. It's Tom Palmer on for Ken. Thanks for the question. I first wanted to clarify the Chicken guidance. Company is guiding to 4% to 6% EBIT margin, absent additional impacts from ASF. The prepared remarks and a lot of the answers today seem to focus on when pricing should get better this year from increased ASF-driven exports. So just given the first quarter results, which sounds like it's a slow start to the second quarter, what are the non-ASF drivers that would get the segment to 4% to 6%?","Noel White","Well, first typically, as we go into Q3, Q4 \u2013 our Q3, Q4, we do see a seasonal improvement that it takes place. So as I talked about Pork, same thing is true with Chicken that once we get into a little warmer weather that people fire up their grills demand does increase. So we're projecting typical seasonal strength in Chicken as well.","Tom Palmer","Okay. I mean the quick math is if you're running at 2.5% you'd be north of 5.5% in kind of the second half I guess?","Noel White","If that's what the math says, I guess that's what I would say.","Tom Palmer","Okay. And then just wanted to ask on the Beef side, I mean it's not a huge cup but you did lower supply expectations. Is this mainly related to end of the year, what you're seeing in terms of some of the cattle inventory? And do you think we would actually exit the fiscal year with year-over-year declines in supply, or flattish, just trying to get the picture there. Thanks.","Noel White","Yes Simon cattle supply is basically flat year-over-year. Cattle and feeder are actually up some. But pork month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, it does impact pricing and availability. But through the course of the year it all evens out. So as we look at the balance of 2020, basically flat if not a slight increase over 2019.","Same thing would be true in 2021 that we look at the calf crop and it would say that we will have equal if not slightly greater number in 2020 and then basically flat into 2021. And then as we move into 2022, 2023 it really depends on retention rate of peppers and other factors that we closely monitor. So answer to your question would be basically flat supplies, perhaps a slight increase in 2020.","Tom Palmer","Okay. Thanks.","Noel White","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Peter Galbo","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Noel I just want to get your thoughts kind of from a much higher level as it pertains to coronavirus and maybe some of the more medium to longer-term impacts. Have you guys done anything \u2013 any work or just around, if wet markets in China are curbed here over the next several months? Just what has that meant historically in terms of the Chinese consumer turning to more of a grocery store? And does that benefit the import market more than say it would if consumers were at the wet markets?","Noel White","Yes. Peter I think if anything it's just going to accelerate the efforts that the Chinese have had to decrease the number of wet markets. I think that we'll continue to see modern grocery continue to grow in China. So it's an acceleration. I think both ASF and coronavirus will contribute to that. Short term, obviously there's going to be some impact from coronavirus but that will pass. So we think on a much longer-term basis, it's how we will service modern retail in China. And over the course of relatively short period of time, we think that that will probably take place, particularly with the initiatives that the government has in place.","Peter Galbo","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And Stewart, maybe just a quick clarification on the Prepared Foods side. With \u2013 and I know this was asked earlier but just with the volumes down and I think you mentioned some of it was kind of intersegment changes. I mean, without any profit impact, is that something we should kind of continue to expect over the course of the year that that volume might just optically look negative because of the segment change?","Stewart Glendinning","No. In fact, you'll only see it in this quarter. Last year \u2013 really this took place a year ago. And because of the seasonality of this product you see a little bit more impact in the quarter. As I said in total, the volume is not material. And certainly the profit is completely immaterial.","Peter Galbo","So on a go-forward basis we would expect to kind of see that Nielsen and then the data that you guys kind of kind of converge a little bit more with reported results?","Stewart Glendinning","Yes that's correct. I mean you also need to bear in mind that the various Nielsen numbers and the foodservice numbers that some of those represent a portion of the volume. And certainly Jon can provide a little bit of a reconciliation during the follow-up call.","Noel White","Peter, I think the takeaway needs to be that -- I mentioned that our core lines grew something a little greater than 6%. We captured at least 1% additional share points. And the numbers are just clouded by this production that moved from one segment to the other. So overall, our retail business continues to be extraordinarily strong.","Peter Galbo","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Noel White","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research. Please go ahead.","Heather Jones","Thanks for taking follow-up. So Noel, just to clarify a comment you just made a few minutes ago. So the closure of the live markets that we've seen in some provinces in China, are you saying that you expect China's ongoing shift away from live markets wildlife trade to more like grocery channels, are you saying you expect that shift to happen -- you mentioned something over the short-term, are you expecting that shift to happen over the short-term you said?","Noel White","No, what I said is that I thought that the shift moving from wet markets to modern retail that the combination of ASF and coronavirus would expedite that transition.","Heather Jones","Okay. Okay. And my other follow-up is just going back to your comments earlier about the outlook for Beef as far as what's going on in Australia global demand. So it sounds like you have a bullish view on beef trim costs. So could you speak to what your expectations are for chicken feature at retail? Not asking about any specific customers, but just in general, is it your expectation that chicken feature will benefit from beef trim costs this year?","Noel White","The short answer would be, yes, Heather. I think that when we look at value between the proteins chicken is a -- particularly, chicken breast right now is in fact a tremendous value. And pork frankly as well with the quantity of pork that's being generated despite the fact that exports are up. And ground beef attributable to an increase of imported lean is relatively high priced compared to the alternatives. So I would expect to see more features of chicken as we move into spring and summer.","Heather Jones","Okay, awesome. Thank you so much.","Noel White","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Jake Nivasch","Hi. Thank you. This is Jake Nivasch on for Rob. Thanks for the follow-up. Just a quick one. Is there any reason why you guys didn't confirm the EPS guidance that -- set from last call?","Stewart Glendinning","Well, Jake, we didn't give any EPS guidance on the last call and we're not planning to give EPS guidance for this year.","Jake Nivasch","On the press release though didn't you guys say high single-digit growth?","Stewart Glendinning","No, we did not. We talked about what our long-term algorithm looked like, but we did not address specifically anything for 2020.","Jake Nivasch","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Ben Theurer","Yeah. Good morning again. I just wanted to follow-up on Prepared Foods. So you made very clear during the call you had obviously some costs associated because of the ERP implementation that's adjusted for, but you've also mentioned the $80 million headwind due to beef trim and ham. So I was looking up at least so far what the quarter runs compared to last year and it seems still there is a fairly significant headwind in terms of ham cost, which clearly would result -- would kind of drive towards relatively weakness because of that cost for Prepared Foods, but then a benefit in Pork. So what is your expectation, I mean within that broader concept for your internal COGS on beef and ham and how that should turn out through the year with or without ASF? Just to understand a little bit the dynamics on the margin recovery on Prepared Foods where this is coming from?","Noel White","Sure. Ben, yes, I can address that. And there was a spike in prices of both 90% lean beef as well as in hams. And we do not intend to take pricing action unless we believe that there is a shift that's taking place in pricing. As you look at ham pricing as we enter the fall, they presented a pretty good value and then they move counter-seasonally higher to about $0.90 on a volume basis. And subsequent to that they've come back down in fact fairly sharply most recently at least in the last couple of weeks. That is opposed to imported lean beef. And if we do believe that there is a longer-term shift in pricing that's when we would take pricing action. But we're -- we typically do not take pricing action on what we believe could be a short-term impact. And it doesn't matter if it's hams or if it's pork bellies for bacon or trim, only if we think that that shift has taken place and expect that to continue.","Ben Theurer","Okay. So in other words, if it were to persist a little longer or come back, you would start thinking of price increases, which would still take some time to offset so you modelize like -- potentially would not get to your margin on Prepared Foods somewhere between 10% to 12%, but then you should more than offset that with better margins within Beef and Pork or you're likely going to be above what the current guidance is. Is that fair to assume?","Noel White","I think that's a fair assessment, Ben.","Ben Theurer","Okay. Thank you very much.","Noel White","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Noel White for any closing remarks.","Noel White","Well thank you for your time today. And please join us online for our Annual Meeting of Shareholders which starts at 11:00 Eastern Time. Thank you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

This broadcast is the property of Tyson Foods and any redistribution, re-transmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Tyson Foods is strictly prohibited.","I'll now turn the call over to Donnie Smith.","Donnie Smith","Thanks, Jon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. Before we get into our earnings discussion, I would like to comment on this morning\u2019s other announcement. As you may have heard, Tom Hayes will be succeeding me as CEO effective the calendar year-end.","The Board and I agree that now is the excellent time to make this transition, the Company is performing exceptionally well and realizing significant growth and shareholder returns through our hybrid strategy of branded prepared foods and fresh meats. Simply put, I believe the Company has a bright future and that Tom is right leader for this next phase of our development.","We have worked hard to create a strong platform that will take Tyson into the future and we have an impressive pipeline of talented management to help us to do that. We are leveraging scale, developing our brands and building value for shareholders.","Since his promotion to President earlier this year, Tom has reminded me, the Board, and the rest of the management team on a daily basis exactly why we hold him in such high regard. He is a capable leader, a strategic thinker and a team player who is ready to build on what we have accomplished to-date and drive this Company forward. He has the skills to deliver on our strategic goals and complete the transition toward our hybrid model.","I have committed to him I will remain available as a consultant for the next three years. As you can imagine, it\u2019s a time of mixed emotions for me. I joined Tyson Foods 36 years ago and have spent my entire professional life here. In return, I have been given opportunities I could never have imagined.","At Tyson, I have worked alongside some of the best most impressive people you could ever hope to meet and together we worked tirelessly to build a great Company. I would like to thank both the Board and the Tyson\u2019s family for their encouragement and support without which I could have not succeeded.","More than just delivering good financial results, we have been able to make a positive difference in peoples\u2019 lives. I\u2019m thankful for the seven years I had the opportunity to serve Tyson as its CEO, and I\u2019m excited about its future and confident that Tom is the right leader for the next chapter. And with that, let\u2019s now turn to the quarter. ","Fiscal 2016 was our fourth consecutive year of record results with record operating income, operating margin, adjusted EPS, cash flow, Pork segment margins and Prepared Foods segment margins. Adjusted EPS grew 39% versus the prior year. Using the midpoint of our fiscal 2017 guidance of $4.70 to $4.85, the projected EPS five year CAGR would be 19%, which is outstanding.","Fourth quarter results were slightly below our internal expectations impacted largely by a $35 million or $0.06 a share and mark-to-market and lower cost of market accounting treatments primarily in beef and pork, our production this year in Prepared Foods and one-time factors in Chicken that Tom will go into a more details shortly.","Synergies for the fourth quarter were $165 million, with $67 million incremental over Q4 of last year. Synergies for the year were $580 million, with $258 million incremental to last year and well exceeding our $500 million target.","We currently expect synergies of approximately $675 million in fiscal 2017, below our previous estimate of $700 million. While we still expect to achieve at least $700 million in total, due to the timing of some projects we now expect some of the synergies to fall into fiscal 2018.","We bought back 8.3 million shares of stock for $600 million in Q4, excluding repurchases to offset dilution from equity compensation. For the fiscal year, share repurchases totaled $28.2 million for $1.7 billion. We were able to repurchase this level due to our record operating cash flows of more than $2.7 billion.","2016 was a great year, beyond setting records, we made tremendous progress leveraging the combined strength of the Tyson team and we are well positioned for even more success in fiscal 2017.","Now let\u2019s go to Tom for a report on our operating segments.","Tom Hayes","Thanks a lot, Donnie. Let\u2019s begin with Prepared Foods segment. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $133 million, with 7.2% operating margin. Average price was down 3.9% primarily reflecting the pass through of overall lower raw material costs.","Adjusting for the additional week in 2015, volume compared to Q4 last year was up 2.6%. Margin in the Prepared Foods segment were lower year-over-year primarily due to a sharp increase in pork trim raw material costs in Q4 that were not passed through to customers within the quarter and increased marketing spending.","In the foods service portion of Prepared Foods in Q4, we had strong results in our Bakery business, but softer than expected results in Prepared Meats. As part of our efforts to improve our production network, we closed a plant and transferred production to newer facilities. Unfortunately, this transition wasn\u2019t seamless, causing us to incur over time in our operations and higher distribution costs in an attempt to satisfy our customers\u2019 needs.","We have since taken steps to improve production efficiency and are building additional network capacity for long-term growth. Despite these challenges, Prepared Foods had a record year and delivered plant synergies. Synergies for the segment were $119 million for the quarter and $38 million incremental to Q4 last year.","For the full-year Prepared Foods synergies were $441 million with $156 million incremental to fiscal 2015. For the fiscal year, Prepared Foods operating income was $734 million with a record 10% margin. Pricing was down 3.4% on lower raw materials, adjusted volume was down 1% for the year, primarily due to the rationalization of some unprofitable ingredient meat SKUs.","We are growing volume where we want to grow by focusing on strategic brands and categories to increase operating income over time. We supported our brand equities across Prepared Foods through marketing, advertising and promotional spending to grow volume and secure our position on the shelves of retailers and restaurants.","For example, we increased our support behind Jimmy Dean Frozen breakfast franchise and Hillshire Farm lunchmeat. And in our fourth quarter, volume was up 9% and 28% respectively. We also grew our share by 1.5 points in the frozen protein breakfast category and by 2.3 points in lunchmeat.","We expect beef and pork raw materials to be deflationary to input costs in addition to pricing 2017. We will continue to invest in innovation, new product launches and MAP to grow our brands. We are expecting margins in 2017 to be similar to those in 2016 with solid volume growth that outperforms the categories where we compete.","In the Chicken segment for the fourth quarter, operating income was $220 million with a 7.8% operating margin. Adjusted volume was down 3.2% due to a planned temporary decrease in production and average price was up 3.5% as we focused on selling higher margin products.","There were three factors leading to lower than expected results in the fourth quarter in chicken. First, our production forecasts are based on consumer demand and through our sales and operations planning process we received indications of lower demand in July and August. As our business model dictates, we reduced production in response to softening consumer demand.","Secondly, we absorbed a sharp spike in soybean meal input cost within the quarter that affected margins in the short-term. And third, having completed the restaging of the Tyson brand, we turned MAP back on to grow point of distribution heading into the new fiscal year.","As a result, our Tyson brand frozen value added chicken volume was up 6% in Q4 of 2016, and is gaining momentum or attending very strong chicken segment volume in our first quarter of 2017.","Chicken segment results for the year were outstanding with an 11.9% operating margin we are just shy of last year\u2019s record return. Operating income was $1.3 billion, adjusted volume was down 0.7% due to the reduce demand in the fourth quarter that I just spoke to. Average pricing was down for the year by 1.5% as some input cost deflation was passed on to the customers.","The USDA is now projecting chicken supply to be in the U.S. increased by 2% in 2017. And our input cost should be flat. We will continue growing where we want to grow by selling more Tyson branded value added chicken. We expect the returns for the chicken segment to be at\/or above the upper end of our normalized range of 9% to 11% again in fiscal 2017.","Moving on to the beef segment, operating income was a $139 million in Q4 with a 4% operating margin. Adjusted volume was down slightly by 0.3% while average sales price declined 14.9% reflecting reduced cattle costs. For the fiscal year, operating income was $347 million with a 2.4% operating margin. Adjusted volume was up slightly by 0.8% while pricing declined 14.9% again on lower cattle cost.","Following a rocky start to the year, the beef segment finished strong with favorable pricing environment continuing into our Q1. We are expecting our beef margins to be at the upper end of its normalized range of 1.5% to 3% in fiscal 2017, reflecting the favorable environment that we expect to continue for some time.","I\u2019ll wrap up the segment performance by recapping the Pork segment results. Operating income was $108 million with an 8.7% operating margin. Adjusted volume was up slightly at 0.4% where average pricing was up 1% in the quarter. For the year, operating income was $528 million with a record 10.8% margin.","Excluding the additional week in fiscal 2015 and the divestiture of our Heinold business in Q1 of last year, pork volume was up 1.2% and average price was down 4.4% reflecting lower hog cost. In fiscal 2017, we expect the favorable operating environment to continue and are estimating operating margin of at least 10% for the year.","Currently the USDA is projecting supplies of our protein categories to be up 2% to 3% next year with moderate export growth. Domestic demand for protein has been strong and we expect it will continue in a deflationary environment and we are very well positioned across all proteins and customer channels to respond to the changing demands of consumers.","We are making significant investments in consumer insights, innovation, our brands, our customer relationships, our facilities and our people. In addition to $1 billion in CapEx in 2017, we are investing an improving safety, animal well being, warehousing and distribution and attracting and retaining talents throughout the organization. These investments should improve cost and turnover as well as continue to drive long-term sustainable growth.","While protein demand overall is strong and growing, we are seeing a shift in how consumers spend specifically in retail. When beef prices decline, more consumers buy beef as relative price premium versus other forms of protein narrows. This interaction is especially pronouncing the dynamic between ground beef and hot dogs.","While the hot dogs category overall was down in the 13 weeks ended October 2nd, we grew Ball Park volume by 11%, and increased volume share by 2.5 points. This is the great example of the power of strong leading brands like Ball Park and the consumer loyalty and strong customer support it garners.","Overall, Tyson Foods is performing very well on retail. In the 13-week period roughly corresponding with our fourth quarter, our Core 9 product lines grew dollar share in all nine categories and grew volume share in eight of nine categories. In total, we grew volume 9.6%, eight points ahead of total food and beverage.","If you take a look at the slides that we posted online, you will see that both the Core 9 and total Tyson at retail are outpacing growth among the top 10 branded food only companies in both sales and volume dollars. In sales volume, Tyson is only one of the three companies that posted positive volume growth.","In sales dollars, we are the only Company to show a positive growth with a 4.7% in the Core 9 and 2.1% overall and that's in a deflationary protein pricing environment. I want to extend my congratulations to Andy Callahan and the entire retail package brands team for their outstanding performance.","Turning to the food service channel, traffic remains roughly flat and growth is driven by average check sizes, which is up about 2%. That was a case in calendar year 2015 and thus far in 2016 and is expected to continue through 2017 and despite a lackluster environment, Tyson Foods is doing well on food service.","Our insights team using data provided by NPD has developed analytic tools that give us a better look into broad line distribution sector within food service. Broad line distribution has long been an important channel to us, but now we are getting a better perspective of the role we play, the importance of value added chicken and the strength of the Tyson brand.","For the 52 weeks ended in July, the most recent data available, our volume grew 3.9% more than double the category growth rate. By far, Tyson is the largest brand with 33% share in growing, the next closest competitor is private label with the 20% share and it\u2019s worth noting, we are a substantial producer of private label value added chicken for our distributor customers.","We look forward to be able to give you more and more insight into our food service business as our insights team continues to build out more analytic tools, which is a great example of the strength of our combined capabilities across our Company.","We continue to be encouraged by the phase of the new product innovation, as we extend our brands in adjacencies. Sales from new products launched in the previous three years has resulted in a vitality index of 14% in retail and 21% in food service. When we think about innovation, it\u2019s not only about new products, we really search to understand how people shop and how shopper behavior opens up new platforms renovation.","Partnering with our customers to leverage the opportunities of the e-commerce space is a great example of this. We began selling Tyson Tastemakers Meal Kits through e-commerce in September. While it\u2019s still early, we are very encouraged by the initial consumer acceptance and feedback.","This platform combines our innovation capabilities, supply chain at scale and leading brands in a way no other food Company can. Expect to hear more in 2017 as we extend this platform into multiple formats in e-commerce and traditional retail. 2016 was a great year, but more importantly, we laid the foundation for 2017 and beyond, we are capitalizing on a momentum and taking a systematic approach to success.","Now, I'm going to turn it over to Dennis, who will report on the fourth quarter and the year as well as our expectations for fiscal 2017.","Dennis Leatherby","Thanks Tom and good morning everyone. Fiscal 2016 was our fourth consecutive year of record earnings, as we continue to demonstrate the power of our diversified business model producing strong stable margins. We are investing our cash flows back into our business as we focus on long-term sustainable growth.","Total Company return on sales was a record 7.7%, for fiscal 2016. Operating income was also a recorded at $2.8 billion, representing a 26% increase over adjusted operating income a year ago. On an adjusted basis, this represents our fourth consecutive year of growth in operating income and return on sales.","Our record adjusted EPS of $4.39 represents a 39% increase over $3.15 per share last year. Our operating cash flow was a record $2.7 billion, and we have invested $695 million on capital expenditures. This outpaced our depreciation by $78 million as we continue to invest in projects with a focus on delivering high ROIC.","We also used our record cash flow in fiscal 2016 to return cash to shareholders and to retire debt. We increased the dividend for fiscal 2016 by 50% from the prior year. We also have repurchased 28.2 million shares for $1.7 billion during the year. Combined, we have returned over $1.9 billion to share holders and share-repurchases and divided, and that\u2019s after we retired some high coupon debt during the year, which further strengthened our balance sheet.","In fiscal 2016, our effective tax rate was 31.8% and on an adjusted basis was 33.8%. Net debt-to-EBITDA for the past 12 months was 1.7 times. Including cash of $349 million, net debt was $5.9 billion, and total liquidity was $1.3 billion. Net interest expense was $57 million during fourth quarter and $243 million during fiscal 2016.","For the quarter, average diluted shares outstanding were $381 million. ROIC was 18.1% and is approaching the pre-Hillshire acquisition level of 20.5%, which illustrates the strength and stability of our earnings, as well as our commitment to creating incremental shareholder value.","Now looking forward, here are some thoughts on fiscal 2017. We expect similar revenues as we grow volume across each segment offset by the impact of lower beef prices. Net interest expense should approximate $225 million.","We currently estimate our effective tax rate to be around 35%. CapEx is expected to approximate $1 billion as we focus on capacity expansion and operational improvements that create long-term shareholder value.","Prior to adjusting for any additional share repurchases subsequent to this call and based on our average share price so far in Q1, we expect our average diluted shares to be around 376 million.","This morning we reported our board of directors again increased our regular quarterly dividend by another 50% from $0.15 to $0.22.5 per share on our Class A common stock payable on December 15. This increase brings our dividend to $0.90 shares annually for Class A shares from $0.60.","As we stated last year, we expect to increase future dividends for Class A shares by at least $0.10 per share annually. This increase and our commitment to steady future dividend increases demonstrates our confidence in the enduring strength and stability of our cash generation capabilities.","We have a tremendous amount of momentum going into fiscal 2017 as we come off a year of 39% EPS growth. Our fiscal first quarter in 2017 is off to a phenomenal start, which gives us confidence in achieving annual adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 10% to a range of $4.70 to $4.85 per share. This new guidance range represents a five year adjusted compounded annual growth rate of at least 19%.","While we are pleased with the growth we have achieved, we are excited about the significant increase in investments in fiscal 2017 that will drive growth for the future. In addition to a $1 billion in CapEx, we are planning heavy investments as Tom mentioned previously, while we continue to grow organically.","Additionally, in fiscal 2017, we expect to return even more cash to shareholders by our announced increased dividend and additional share repurchases. We see compelling value on our shares and so far in the first quarter of fiscal year, we have repurchased another 3.4 million shares for $240 million.","While some of our investments will not immediately fall to the bottom line, we are creating a sustainable blueprint for success that will allow us to grow in responsible way for the future. In closing, we take a long-term view toward investing in our people, our brands and our facilities, which will drive value and generate attractive shareholder returns.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Denise we are ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Leatherby. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Ken Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Zaslow","Hi. Good morning everyone.","Tom Hayes","Hi.","Dennis Leatherby","Good morning.","Donnie Smith","Good morning Ken.","Kenneth Zaslow","Donnie congratulations, it\u2019s been a pleasure, I wish you well. And Tom congratulation on your promotion. I think with that Donnie, I would just say your timing of your retirement may not be perceived as optimal, Tyson is in the middle of a class action suit, earnings fell short of expectation on the perception that you have kind of reached peak earnings. And you are in a debate over your Georgia Dock pricing. It seems like.","But let me just tackle one issue at a time. Why not hand the reins over once the dust settles a little bit. Second, how much of the earnings shortfall in the quarter will be recaptured in the first quarter. Third, if Georgia Dock prices go away, how much would Tyson\u2019s outlook actually change? And then, Dennis just to kind of go back on the share repurchases, given that your stock seems to be probably pricing down at least 10% to 15% today, what is the expectation for share repurchases going into this first quarter?","Donnie Smith","Okay. So I\u2019m going to take the first one of that and then Tom and Dennis will start from there. Ken, I think this is an excellent time for us to be making this transition. Company is off to a phenomenal start for quarter, we are on a very solid foundation. As we have said before, we dispute the claims, we are looking forward to our opportunity to defending ourselves in court on the litigation. So that has nothing to do with the transition. So, yes, there is not a better time, we have got a great team, Tom is a very capable leader. So in terms of all of that there couldn\u2019t be a better time to be making this transition. Now Tom, I\u2019ll let you start on the second, third and fourth.","Tom Hayes","Yes. So, thanks Ken. And what I\u2019ll say is the timing, I think from everybody\u2019s perspective actually couldn\u2019t be better given the great shape that Donnie has brought the Company to, and we are all just thrilled about the opportunities ahead of us.","As it relates to the Q4 to Q1, yes there is a shortfall in Q1, and I think largely you will see it show up in the strong - Q4 show up in Q1. So the lower than normal results in Prepared Foods and chicken sort of relates to MAP spending that I spoke to. But I think we are in a great shape particularly in beef and pork, which I think shouldn\u2019t surprise you.","As it relates to the Georgia Dock, this is what we talked about before several times is that we really don\u2019t use it that much, it\u2019s about four or maybe a little lesser total chicken volume sales that are priced off the Georgia Dock.","We have talked several times that we used a lot of different pricing mechanisms, and we are diversified, we don\u2019t feel like it has significant impact to us. But the Georgia Dock has had very little influence on our price and strategy. Dennis I don\u2019t know if you want to add.","Dennis Leatherby","As far as share repurchases go Ken on that question. Last quarter we bought $600 million worth of stock. We bought 240 million so far and we have a phenomenal quarter going which means heavy cash flow. So you can expect we will have another big quarter. I won\u2019t get into the exact number, but we will buy quite a bit stock back.","Kenneth Zaslow","Just to be clear. So just making sure I get the answers. How much of your earnings shortfall will come back in the first quarter and then if Georgia Dock prices go completely away, will that have any impact on Tyson\u2019s outlook?","Dennis Leatherby","As far as the earnings going into this quarter, all of it will come back into the quarter from the shortfall standpoint. As far as the Georgia Dock goes, how much it will impact? It will have no impact if Georgia Dock went away.","Kenneth Zaslow","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Jeremy Scott of CLSA. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Scott","I appreciate some of the clarity there and congratulations Donnie and Tom, I echo that, but I also echo some of surprise, maybe at the timing. Just a follow-up on the Georgia Dock. Can you repeat what percentage of your sales are tied to the Georgia Dock and then secondly, can all of your clients that are pricing on Georgia Dock without restriction or penalty opt to price on index other than Georgia Dock, theoretically right now?","Tom Hayes","So to repeat it's about maybe 3.5% to 4% of our total chicken sales off the Georgia Dock and customers can negotiate to price it off of whatever index they would like. But we have found that that's not a good proxy for cost and we have some very sophisticated buyers that tend to look more at grain inputs than they do the Georgia Dock. Certainly it's got a lot of history and it's something that's been around for a while, but we find increasingly our customers are looking to have discussions about where do they think grain is.","And then, in addition to that, I would say there is a lot of discussions which we have also spoken about this, less about price than it is about everything else we offer as a Company and we are getting more and more into those discussions frankly and less and less about the absolute price of input cost. So again, I don\u2019t know if that answers your question, but that is the way we think about, it's a very, very small part of what we do.","Jeremy Scott","Okay. I just wanted to ask about chicken again, obviously a big surprise miss in the quarter, didn\u2019t really add up to any of our models; I appreciate the three factors that you have flagged. Can you quantify them in terms of what was the impact on margins of each factor and how they will roll over into the first quarter?","Dennis Leatherby","Yes, I won't go through the specific impact of each one. What I will say is when the soybean meal market went up, we are probably less hedged, as we go towards the end of the year we are looking for the new crop. That is something that certainly if there are spikes, it's going to play through our numbers.","As we go through our negotiations with customers, we look to capture everything that we can. I think in the last call we talked about severe run-ups, the slope of the curve is high, we have a harder time passing through those costs to our customers. So that was certainly a big impact.","Dennis Leatherby","And just to reiterate Jeremy, we are saying that for the year that earnings in chicken would be at or above the normalized range.","Dennis Leatherby","Right.","Jeremy Scott","Okay, and then just lastly on the CapEx. What exactly is driving the incremental investment there? I realize you talked about some of the initiatives that you are taking, but can you break that down into pieces?","Tom Hayes","Yes. So the biggest one is we are spending quite a bit of money to expand production at our plants, we have got a lot of growth opportunities as I mentioned briefly in the prepared meat sector and food service we have some capital spending there. We have increased our spending against or increased our production capacity on cooked chicken, fully cooked chicken and we are pretty close to being well through that capacity and we need to build more.","So think about the largest percentage of that would be focused on growth and in addition to that we are spending to make sure all of our process is working well, animal well being, a lot of sustainability efforts, but to answer your question on CapEx it\u2019s predominantly focused on growth.","Jeremy Scott","Okay. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will come from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson","Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone and ill echo Ken and Jeremy\u2019s comments, Donnie congratulations and Tom congratulations as well. May be my first question in Prepared Foods and just to be clear on the margin guidance for fiscal 2017 of 10% basically flat margins year-over-year. Can you quantify both the fourth quarters, you looked over some production issues, that don\u2019t seem to be expecting to lap. There is still about a $100 million of year-over-year synergies, you are growing your volumes strongly in your highest margin value added categories in the Core 9 and you have got some nice commodity deflation at your back. Can you talk about kind of the level of reinvestment spend in Prepared Foods that you wouldn\u2019t expect a sharper for some better margin leverage and\/or kind of earnings improvement. Thanks.","Donnie Smith","Sure. We think about the ROS is flat for a while, what we want to make sure is that we continue to do is focus on volume. Hopefully, you will see in those charts, we are able to see those online the investments are paying off, and we have significant investment going into not the least, which is MAP in Q4 that it was a big impact in the rate.","And as you look at what we are doing for preparing ourselves for the 2017, it\u2019s all about making sure that we have a shelf space, we are driving innovation and we continue to invest and frankly lift the investment in some other categories that weren\u2019t ready for and some of the brands weren\u2019t ready for the MAP spending as much as they are today.","So we think in terms of fourth quarter played out pretty much as we thought it would, and as we talked in the last call, we are executing that strategy that we want to be continually at 10% and we did it in 2016. With more protein on the market, next year, we wanted to make sure we are in good position that I spoke to, and we want to continue to drive category growth with our customer. So we are continuing to invest significantly and growing where we want to grow, which is in the Core 9 as we have demonstrated.","Adam Samuelson","Okay that\u2019s helpful. And may be switching gears to chicken and understanding that there were some issues in the fourth quarter that it doesn\u2019t sound you think repeat, may be other than the MAP spending. And you have guided margins at or above the high end of the 11% normalized range.","Can you talk about kind of the bigger string factors in chicken as you lookout through 2017, I mean the feed costs would, given the harvest that we just had would seem to be fairly benign. It seems like you have got good mixed tailwinds in terms of your value added business, export markets are okay. Can you talk about some of the bigger kind of drivers or variants that you think about in up or down side risks in chicken for the next 12 months?","Donnie Smith","Sure, I mean you called it as it relates to grain, we feel like that is pretty much flat, will be in the same position in 2017 as we are in 2016 as far as we known today. What we continue to do is drive the core of that business. So retail and food service, value added products can be drive to the non-core the commodity linked quarters and byproducts down.","So roughly the value added products are up above 4%, the commodity products down 7%. So the net is, if you could look at the total, the chicken platform you see it\u2019s roughly flat, but the mix in between is continuing to improve towards value added.","Adam Samuelson","All right. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it along.","Operator","And the next question will come from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Hi, thank you. I thought also one of the comments about Chicken was that you has expected Chicken demand to be down in July, August, so you reduced production and you said it was related to consumer demand and I guess that\u2019s related to lower beef prices. Was consumer demand as weak as you thought it was for Chicken, I mean it seems to me that demand for Chicken had been a huge part of the story overall.","Are you seeing any kind of weakening in that regard and then it had a follow-up on trim prices, which we track other than a little bit of a spike in July, I really didn\u2019t see anything else for the quarter, in fact, it came down quite a bit in August and September. So I wanted to maybe get a sense of just how sharp of an increase that was for your Prepared Foods margins?","Donnie Smith","Sure. Yes, so as it relates to poultry first, the volume was off to for sure up in Q4. But we saw it come in, we have a good [Indiscernible] process, I think it probably goes with our experience and [Indiscernible] signals allows us to modify in advance of seeing that now. As Dennis has said and we talk about we have seen that come back in first quarter here.","So the volume was off and it now has come back and the other thing that we want to make sure we do is we have lower inventories. We want to make sure that we don\u2019t run into a season of high inventories and that certainly helped us towards selling through the inventory a large degree in Q1. So it was the right thing to certainly pull back in production.","As it relates to trim pricing. So if you look at 72s and 42s the Prepared Foods business and particularly as it relates to hot dogs and grinding materials for sausage and so forth, the sharp spike dropped off dramatically as the trim is dropping off. It\u2019s good for us, because costs were going down or price is up, I may shoot up.","Again the slope of the change is going to cause us particularly on the food service business for reforming of price to have our raw material costs higher and our formula prices is lagging by about it is. So that was the short-term impacts, we are through that and that\u2019s the situation there.","Robert Moskow","And why do you think Chicken demand is coming back, I mean beef prices continue to fall. So you might see more consumer demand shifting to beef, I mean what how do you know it\u2019s not just a head take and it might get weak again?","Donnie Smith","We see that the value that we provide through for all of our customers is predominantly focused on how they grow their categories overall and when we look at Chicken, we have significant MAP spending that they want, they want us to invest in the business and continue to drive growth.","We have seen certainly some share gains and that\u2019s something that we are tremendously excited about, as we look at how chicken that the retail value added poultry or the Tyson brand at retail it\u2019s been doing very well, we have got a lot of innovation behind it.","So those are sort of the key drivers and some of the food service business that we have picked up over this summer is starting to kick-in. So there is a lot of things that - I can\u2019t give you all the detail on it Rob, but there is lot of things that are sort of working together that give us tremendous confidence about chicken volume not just Q1 but for 2017.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Congrats again Donnie and good luck, Tom.","Donnie Smith","Okay.","Tom Hayes","Thanks.","Operator","The next question will be from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead","Kenneth Goldman","Hi. And thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to make sure I understood when you are talking about all the shortfall in the fourth quarter chicken business shifting into 1Q. Can you just elaborate on what that mean? I wasn\u2019t quite certain if you are talking profit or volume?","Donnie Smith","It\u2019s more profit Ken.","Kenneth Goldman","Okay. With that in mean and thank you for that. Can you help us and I know you are getting same question in 10 different ways, so forgive me. But you help us walk us through the mechanics of that, because I\u2019m not quite sure like the soy issues that doesn\u2019t reverse right, MAP spending I assume it\u2019s not coming down in the first quarter. So I guess it\u2019s mostly fixed cost deleverage issue that gets reversed. Does that imply that volumes have to be significantly better than they usually are in 1Q. Again, you have talked about this. So I just want to make sure, I\u2019m thinking about this in the right way.","Donnie Smith","Yes. Sure. So, Ken soybean meal, yes you have seen the chart, everybody seen it, it spiked up and then it\u2019s [Indiscernible] that was up and down enough and now it\u2019s flatten back out, right. So, yes it has come back down and it\u2019s being down so that is helping our cost base. And I would say it\u2019s a relates to feed cost in Q4 is always a lag and our cost.","So now that in speaking to the profit, we are going to be in a much better shape based on doing a couple of things. One is reducing the amount that we produce or inventories we are drawing down and also continuing to do what I said, which is focused on driving growth at retail through the Tyson brands and driving growth with the new food service customer places.","Kenneth Goldman","Okay. And then I may have missed this, but I wanted to ask about retail beef and pork prices. It really hasn\u2019t fallen as much as wholesale and farm prices have for cattle and hogs. I know that retail prices are always much less volatile. It just seems a little more so at this time, as they are really kind of being sticky. I\u2019m just curious what your updated thoughts are and if that changes when that might change, are you having any conversations with your grocery customers about the proper prices that they should have on the shelf at this point?","Dennis Leatherby","Yes. We kind of run that, we don\u2019t influence necessarily the prices are going to be charging on the shelf, but you got to nail the dynamic is that the livestock prices have not come down faster than the retail prices has, which is allowed us to make the margins that we have right now in both beef and pork. So how that sticks to the season, I think it remains to be seen, but that is the dynamic that\u2019s allowing us to have a very, very strong first quarter.","Kenneth Goldman","Okay. Thanks so much.","Dennis Leatherby","Okay.","Operator","And the next question will come from Farha Aslam of Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.","Farha Aslam","Thanks. Good morning.","Donnie Smith","Good morning.","Dennis Leatherby","Good morning.","Farha Aslam","Again. On chicken, could you just share with us your commentary about demand declines and recovery. Is that for Tyson specific or is that the industry. And why would Tyson\u2019s demand be different than the industry.","Tom Hayes","So Farha this is Tom, we are talking about Tyson as that\u2019s all we can really speak to right. I mean that\u2019s what we focus on, and it is the Tyson brand retail, significant innovation, advertising, we have been on-air with television, we are seeing the definite results of at that activity, like I mentioned up 6% heading into much stronger Q1.","And speaking again need to be a broken record, but we have taken on some significant business throughout whether it's food service or retail predominantly on the Tyson brands. Certainly there are some retail private label that we plan, but it\u2019s predominantly the Tyson brand that we are seeing increased spend.","Farha Aslam","Okay. And then, when you look at your Prepared Foods business and the operational issues that you faced during the quarter could you roughly quantify how much they were and if they are completely fixed any carryover to the first quarter?","Tom Hayes","Yes, we won\u2019t quantify in specific terms, we will say that it was some of the down draft on Q4, there was as we closed one of our factories that produce pizza toppings, we had challenges moving to the factories that were actually increasing capacity at.","So that was not our finest hour in terms of how we execute and we are in a much better position now, because the good news is we have strong customer demands and we are building capacity to meet that customer demand.","And it was a onetime issue that's going to be certainly as we ramp up to serve the volume, we are going to see some continued at capacity numbers, but I would say that this predominantly due to that plant closures the affect it and so I can\u2019t quantify for you but that's the story.","Farha Aslam","You are done with it now?","Tom Hayes","We are still going to be going through the first half of this year getting some stability against that in terms of impacting our numbers is more of an opportunity. But in order to drive the results it's getting all of the volume that we have subscribed out the door in terms of customer orders that's the biggest challenge.","I would say that all of the supply chain issues would be solved for the second half of the year that's when the significant stability will come as well as our ability to serve all the order that we have on the improved demand.","Farha Aslam","That's helpful. Thank you.","Tom Hayes","You are welcome.","Operator","And the next question will come from Akshay Jagdale of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Akshay Jagdale","Thank you, and first congrats Donnie again on everything going out of the stock today that's been pushed aside, but congratulations on your retirement I guess. But my question is again on chicken, I just wondered is it fair to say that if you didn\u2019t have these three one-time issues that your numbers for chicken would have been above the normalized range. I mean I know you are hesitating for some reason to quantify it, but just wanted to first understand the magnitude of the impact?","Donnie Smith","The answer to that Akshay is yes, they would have been within the normalized range that you have typically become used to and it is unfortunately a one-time occurrence that we are going good about in terms of Q1 and rest of the year.","Akshay Jagdale","Okay. And then just related to the guidance, obviously again on chicken you are guiding similar results like this year, which is above the normal range. But I guess the markets is not really believing that so the demand issue - so what is built into your projection, if retailers do reduce the price of beef and pork will that - I mean are you able to navigate through that and still deliver the results you are promising for next year. And then can you just elaborate a little bit more on look the demand issue was in terms of weakness and why it caught you by surprise since you gave last year guidance.","Donnie Smith","So what I can tell you is we are seven weeks into our fiscal year, and we have lot more to come, we feel great about it. But everything thing that we know in terms of beef and pork pricing and chicken business in Prepared Food it\u2019s in our projection. So as we move through the year, we feel like we are going to be in a great shape. We are seven weeks and everything that we know is in our projections. That\u2019s all I can say about that.","In terms of demand signal, that\u2019s what drives our [Indiscernible] the demand is sometimes when you cross the end of the year it\u2019s certainly difficult. But at the end of the quarter I think of it as while we go to put those couple of months together or couple of quarters together to really take a good luck at what the demand is. And that is insignificant thing certainly as we are coming into the fiscal year for us here.","So getting into Q1, you will see that those two things are offsetting, but certainly beef pricing - not necessarily help the other proteins, but beef pricing has been down significantly, so you see the volume up rather sharply on beef.","Akshay Jagdale","So again, what happened with the demand being weaker, was related to beef pricing being lower. I'm just trying to understand what on demand for chicken really changed, because we just want to make our own judgments on whether that factor will continue in 2017? Thank you.","Donnie Smith","Okay, I would say beef was probably the largest sharpest up of all the proteins. We can\u2019t say there is anyone in particular issue, there is lot of thing we got to work to drive the volume and customers are loading it at different times or the season, they are trailing up inventories. There is not a specific thing that you can fit into other than we did see certainly beef as probably the largest factor.","Akshay Jagdale","Thank you.","Donnie Smith","You are welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Piken","Yes hi. Just a question on the pork segment, I mean it looks like margins for the packers are at an all time high, and just wondering if we should expect to see - I know you guided the 10% plus but it looks like potentially fiscal 2017 could even be better than 2016. Is that a fair assessment of kind of the market?","Tom Hayes","Yes, so you know it\u2019s definitely going to be a good year for pork that we have guided to. Well above the normalized range of six to eight, we said we think it\u2019s going to be 10 plus. So we continue to see strong demand for pork, it\u2019s seasonal for sure, but we have very strong demand for pork. And supplies are roughly, I think in unison with demand, so it\u2019s a good thing for us and so that\u2019s why for us we feel like it\u2019s going to be a good year on pork.","Michael Piken","As you look further ahead, to the vertically integrated hog producers are adding some packing capacity, which is suppose to come online next summer. Are you guys already sort of looking at alternative suppliers or how do you see your pork utilization rates trending as these other facilities come online and how are you looking to source your hogs in the future? Thanks.","Donnie Smith","So it looks like there is going to be sufficient harvest capacity to stay ahead of the increased hog supply. Our math is showing that the supply growth and demand growth like I said are relatively balance over the next few years and so that looks good for us. We feel like as it relates to season, the carcass weights are still not high as you might think they would be, indicating the supply as relatively current. So it remaining to be seen, it will that affects us, but we are feeling we are in a great position, we feel like we are well balanced between supply and demand.","Michael Piken","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will be from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Palmer","Thanks. Good morning and congrats, Tom and Donnie. First question, you noted that the Georgia Dock price is not the primary driver of chicken pricing. Perhaps you could just talk about how Tyson is getting its chicken pricing, which I believe is up 3.5% this quarter. And what your near-term outlook is for pricing in that segment?","Tom Hayes","Yes. So thank you, the Georgia Dock is one of many elements that we use, I would say that as we have talked about in the past probably the best for us is if we have something that\u2019s tied to any industry it really the underlying grain. So if we have a customer that\u2019s willing to block for a period of time then it\u2019s marked for us - grain underneath to make sure we have a margin that\u2019s blocked up.","Beyond I would say we continue to see our portfolio move more and more to what I\u2019ll call list pricing. List pricing with a promotional element on top of it, so regardless of whether its food service or retail that\u2019s the model that we have within Prepared Foods, a lot of the chicken value add acts like Prepared Foods. So I would say that\u2019s the predominant model beyond locking in against grain underlying input cost.","David Palmer","As a follow-up to that you discussed the soy spike over the summer and the impact on margins. Does this some in some way reframing the cyclical nature of margins according to feed costs, in other words, if we were to see a significant reversal in feed costs going in soy will the chicken segment margins perhaps dip below the long-term range of 9% to 11% at least on a temporary basis if that were to occur?","Donnie Smith","Yes, I think that\u2019s fair. It depends on when they happen in the year and how steep the service and so that\u2019s what is going to drive whether or not they are going to have a short-term impact on how [Indiscernible] going to be. So I think that\u2019s fair.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Donnie Smith","Welcome.","Operator","And the next question will be from Jeremy Scott of CLSA. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Scott","Hey thanks guys for the follow-up but sure this won\u2019t surprise you, but I have a follow-up on chicken. Just the way I calculated, based on your commentary. The shortfall in the quarter was upwards of $80 million to $120 million in chicken. And first of all, is that number somewhere in the ballpark? But secondly, when you say you will recapture that shortfall in the first quarter, you mean you will recapture the margin not necessarily a piece of that $80 million to $120 million. Are there mark-to-market losses that needs to be factoring in that will unlock in the first quarter or how should we think about that?","Donnie Smith","Yes, the mark-to-market I\u2019ll ask Dennis to chime in here, but no its margin structure we are talking about going back to where we expect it should be and again I\u2019ll just repeat that we have not small amount of marketing and advertising promotional investment.","Dennis Leatherby","As far as mark-to-market that\u2019s not much of a factor.","Jeremy Scott","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Tom Hayes for his closing remarks.","Tom Hayes","Okay. Well, thank you very much. What I would like to say is A, thank you for your interest and your continued interest during this Thanks Giving Holiday season, very happy with our investors, sell side, buy side analyst continue to be interested in our stock.","And certainly thanks to Donnie Smith, he has been a great partner bringing me up to speed on everything I need to know about Tyson Foods family. And as he said in his remarks, he is not going anywhere for three years, he is going to be on speed-dial for me, so I\u2019m very happy about that.","So I would just say thank you very for your attention and I appreciate it and we will be talking to you soon.","Operator","Thank you sir. Ladies and gentlemen the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect."]}}
