During the second quarter, we delivered double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, solid core operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow performance. Pall and Cepheid are two most recent largest acquisitions, also continued to perform very well. Looking ahead, we expect our core growth rate in the second half of 2017 to accelerate compared to first half levels, driven by improving order trends and as recent acquisition by Cepheid and Phenomenex become part of our core revenue. And with our continued strong free cash flow generation and strengthening balance sheet, we feel well positioned to actively pursue larger acquisition opportunities going forward. With that as a backdrop, let's move to the details of the second quarter.","Adjusted diluted net EPS was $0.99, which represents an increase of 10% over the last year. Sales increased 6.5% to $4.5 billion, and core revenue grew 2%. The impact of currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 6%. Geographically, revenue in the developed markets was up low single digits, with solid results in the U.S. and Japan slightly offset by performance in Western Europe. High-growth markets increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by China, which delivered high single-digit growth or better in each of our four segments. Reported operating profit margins declined 150 basis points to 15.2%, primarily due to the impact of charges related to the discontinuation of a product line in our Diagnostics segment and the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions. Our core operating margin increased 70 basis points with the strong performance led by our Life Sciences, Environmental and Applied Solutions, and Dental segments.","Strong free cash flow enables us to pursue high-impact growth opportunities across our portfolio, and it continues to be one of our most important metrics at Danahar. We generated $892 million of free cash flow from continuing operations during the quarter, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 160%. We now anticipate full year 2017 free cash flow to grow double digit over 2016. ","On the M&A front, we closed three bolt-on acquisitions during the quarter, totaling approximately $100 million of spend in our product ID, product quality and life sciences platforms.","Now let\u2019s take a more detailed look at our performance across the portfolio. ","In Life Sciences, reported revenues increased 4% and core revenue grew 3.5%. Reported operating profit margin increased by 150 basis points to 16%, and core operating margin was up 120 basis points. This continued margin expansion was driven by the team\u2019s consistent execution across the life science platform.","Beckman Life Sciences delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth with positive performance across all major product lines, most notably, transportation and automation. Beckman\u2019s recently launched Biomek i-Series Automated Workstations are gaining traction in the market, and several key automation projects contributed to strong results in North America. We saw a broad-based growth geographically, and we\u2019re well positioned in China to benefit from the region\u2019s continued investment in biopharma and life science research. ","One of Danahar\u2019s core values is, \u201cinnovation defines our future\u201d, and since we acquired Beckman Life Sciences in 2011, this has been a key area of focus for the team. They have increased new product launches meaningfully with more than 10 new product introductions in each of the last two years, and this cadence of innovation has been a key driver of Beckman Life Sciences\u2019 enhanced growth trajectory. What was a flat core growth business at the time of acquisition is now a mid-single-digit performer that has continued to gain share in its markets. ","Leica Microsystems core revenue was up low single digits with good performance across high-growth markets, partially offset by weakness in developed markets. At SCIEX, core revenue increased in a mid-single-digit rate, led by strength in the pharmaceutical and food testing end markets, while academic demand was stable across most major geographies. ","At the ASMS Annual Conference in June, SCIEX highlighted the market\u2019s first FDA-cleared vitamin D assay for in vitro diagnostic use exclusively on our clinical mass spec platform the Topaz System. Topaz and its accompanying clear core software are easy to learn and validate and have been specifically designed for the clinical lab. This new solution with the SCIEX vitamin D assay will enable clinical labs to expand their in-house testing services and run more tests more efficiently while delivering more confident results to support physicians with their critical treatment decisions. ","Pall reported low single-digit core revenue growth with positive performance in both our life sciences and industrial businesses, partly impacted by a tough prior year comparison. At Pall Life Sciences, growth was driven by biopharma, particularly double-digit growth in single-use technologies.","At Pall Industrial, modest growth was driven by microelectronics and aerospace. Declines in process and industrial was due to a large Middle East project in the first half of last year that did not repeat. But we are encouraged by healthy order growth across this business and expect improved performance in the second half of the year.","Moving now to Diagnostics. Reported revenue increased 14.5%, and core revenue grew 2.5%. Reported operating margin declined 760 basis points to 10.9%, and core operating margin was down 25 basis points. These margin declines are largely due to the restructuring charges associated with our decision to discontinue to Beckman VERIS molecular diagnostics product line and the acquisition impact of the Cepheid transaction. Absent the impact of the restructuring charges, Diagnostics\u2019 reported operating margin was up more than 400 basis points from the first quarter.","Last month, we announced to our customers the decision to redirect our team\u2019s molecular diagnostic efforts from the Beckman VERIS platform over to Cepheid. We are committed to providing the best solutions for our customers, and we believe that Cepheid molecular systems provide a better longer-term foundation for these efforts. Cepheid\u2019s platform offers industry-leading throughput and the most comprehensive molecular test menu on a single system. We believe that focusing investment on this technology, combined with Beckman\u2019s strong global market presence, will accelerate our ability to provide more comprehensive molecular solutions to benefit our customers. As a result, we incurred total charges of approximately $76 million, of which $49 million were non-cash related to the impairment of certain intangible and other related assets and $27 million in cash charges. We expect these cash charges to result in a benefit of approximately $40 million in annual savings in 2018.","Turning to Cepheid second quarter results. Double-digit core revenue growth was driven by broad-based strength across most major geographies and product lines. The team is consistently incorporating DBS tools into the day-to-day processes, and their efforts have sustained the double-digit operating profit margins achieved in the first quarter.","Core revenue at Beckman Coulter increased at a low single-digit rate with growth in China and North America partially offset by declines in Western Europe and Japan. Byproduct line, our chemistry and immunoassay businesses continued to lead the way.","Radiometer\u2019s core revenue grew low single digits, led by another quarter of growth across our blood gas and AQT product lines. In May, Radiometer launched the crea and urea parameters on the ABL90. These are two new blood tests that identify potentially life-threatening problems with kidney function. Radiometer now offers 19 critical care parameters, the broadest range available on a compact platform that delivers crucial results in just 35 seconds. As the most comprehensive blood gas testing provider in the world, Radiometer\u2019s innovations are helping caregivers make critical diagnostic decisions that save lives every day.","At Leica Biosystems, core revenue was up mid-single digits with growth across both developed and high-growth markets. Leica\u2019s performance was led by another strong quarter in our advanced staining business, and we saw solid results across our core histology product line as well. ","Turning to our Dental segment. Reported revenue was down 1.5% and core revenue was down 1%. Supported operating profit margin increased 30 basis points and core operating margin was up 50 basis points, due primarily to the benefits from ongoing productivity initiatives.","During the quarter, we saw positive growth in our equipment and specialty consumable product lines, including implants and orthodontics. This was more than offset by a decline in our traditional consumables businesses, which was due primarily to continued inventory destocking by several of our distribution partner, primarily in North America and Western Europe. We believe these channel dynamics will continue and expect our Dental core growth rates in the second half of the year to be consistent with the results we\u2019ve seen so far in the first half. Recognizing the near-term challenges, we remain focused on building greater long-term value across our dental platform. The team\u2019s recent operational improvements have supported reinvestment in growth initiatives to increase the cadence of product innovation, improve quality and enhance commercial execution. ","Over the last two years, we have improved our operating profit margin by more than a 100 basis points and seeing consistent growth rates in several of our key product categories. We continue to focus on positioning our dental business for sustainable long-term growth and value creation. ","Moving to our Environmental and Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 4.5% and core revenue was up 3%. Reported operating profit margins increased 70 basis points, while core operating margin was up 120 basis points. ","In product identification, core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate. We saw continued healthy demand for our marking and coding equipment and consumables in most major geographies, led by North America. Demand for our packaging and color solutions was driven by strength in high-growth market.","Videojet\u2019s core revenue growth was up mid-single digits, and the team continued to build upon their track record of outperformance. We saw balanced growth across North America, Western Europe and Asia. ","Videojet grew across all major product lines and launched three new products in May, including the Videojet 1860 printer, our new industrial inkjet platform. The 1860\u2019s key differentiator is the combination of onboard-predictive analytics and remote connectivity. The advanced maintenance analytics can alert operators well before common downtime issues arise, and the remote service capability enables operators to recover quickly from production line interruptions without an onsite service visit.","The 1860 printer has been specifically designed to help our customers improve their uptime and productivity and driver lower operating costs. Customers rely on Videojet solutions to print on more than 10 billion products daily, and we now have the largest installed base of remotely connected printers worldwide.","Core revenue at Esko was up mid-single digits, the growth driven by an acceleration in Europe and the high-growth markets.","Finally, turning to water quality. Core revenue growth increased at a low single-digit rate with particular strength in our water treatment businesses. At Hach, core revenue increased at a low single-digit rate. We saw a solid growth in our core municipal and industrial end markets and another good quarter of performance in China. This was partially offset by weakness in Latin America and project timing in our environmental businesses. Looking ahead, we expect that Hach will show improved core growth in the second half of the year.","Trojan delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth, a result that the team has now achieved in eight of the last 10 quarters. We saw healthy demand across the municipal end markets in North America and China, with robust project activity in those regions. An important factor in Trojan\u2019s project win rate has been the ability to provide our customers with outstanding technology solutions. Trojan recently expanded the capabilities of one of its core wastewater product lines, TrojanUV Signa, to broaden its applications, and it can now be used at nearly any size wastewater facility and for water reuse. This advancement enhances Trojan\u2019s competitive advantage and has been a key driver of recent demand.","ChemTreat continued to outperform with high single-digit core revenue growth, driven by positive momentum in North and Latin America. We saw particular strength across the food, fuel, and oil and gas end markets, and the team\u2019s consistent execution contributed to additional share gains across the businesses.","So to wrap up, the team executed well during the second quarter driving double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth, 70 basis points of core operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow performance. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect our core growth rate to accelerate versus the first half levels of improving order trends and as recent acquisitions like Cepheid and Phenomenex become part of our core revenue. We belief that the power of the Danaher Business System, significant opportunity across our portfolio and strengthening balance sheet position, all come together to position us well for the remainder of 2017 and beyond. We are initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $0.92 and $0.96 and expect core revenue growth of approximately 3%. We are raising our full year 2017 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance, which we now expect to be in the range of $3.90 to $3.97.","Matt Gugino","Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Lauren, we\u2019re now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken","Hi, good morning, guys. So maybe just first touching on sort of the sequential growth acceleration you\u2019re looking for, a lot of moving parts in the business. It feels like maybe in environmental and water, there was also maybe a bit of order push-out. Can you just give us some color and help us bridge back to a growth rate for Danahar that would be more consistent with what we would think about for these businesses. Again, you had a lot of comp noise and some order movements. You\u2019ve obviously got the acquisitions as you\u2019ve said. So help us sort of walk through the parts and then your confidence level in turning some of the pieces like dental, where the growth rates are obviously not where you wanted to be. Obviously, that doesn\u2019t happen overnight, but that you\u2019ve got the right sort of plan and that you understand why it\u2019s underperformed and in turn can get back to that more normalized rate.","Thomas Patrick Joyce","Good morning, Ross. Thanks. Thanks for the question. Let\u2019s start with the jumping-off point, Ross, of sort of the second quarter end and the first half. If we look at the 2% in the quarter and really look through that to the order rate, and we\u2019re actually rather encouraged by the core orders, which were 100 basis points better than our core growth. When we look at the second quarter number that we put up, that was mostly obviously due to dental. Our expectations were in line with dental being closer to a flat number came in lower than that, down slightly, and the results of that really represented the difference between the 2% we put up and the 2.5% that we expected. So it was really largely around the dental. I\u2019ll come back to water in just a second and your point about timing.","We are seeing the continued destocking that I mentioned, and that\u2019s primarily around the traditional consumables side, and we look at the rest of the dental portfolio, and as I mentioned, we continue to see good performance across our specialty consumables businesses as well as equipment. And so, I think we need to get through these adjustments relative to the channel before we can see some better performance from the dental platform, and as a result of that, we thought it was a relatively prudent approach to think of that as being consistent in the second half of the year with the first half of the year until we can get through those. ","I\u2019ll come back to the forward look here in a second, but I thought there were a number of encouraging things around the jumping-off, or starting point, here in the second quarter and the first half. Life Science in particular at 3.5%, a little bit better than expectations; really good performance at Beck Life Science; and at SCIEX as well, both mid-single digit, very good quarters. And despite the lower number that we put up at Pall, and you mentioned this briefly in your question, a very challenging comp at Pall both in terms of the life science side as well as the industrial side relative to the first half of last year and specifically the second quarter. So I think there is a number of things to point to you that would suggest that there are some things that underlies the first half, which, once we get passed, would suggest better performance in the second half. So the first half, you\u2019re really looking at a 2.5% sort of start, again, encouraged by the core orders that were about 100 basis points better than that. We get passed the comp issues at Pall. We see Cepheid and Phenomenex coming into the core and some modest improvement in water quality, particularly as it relates to this timing in Hach environmental, which were some larger orders, I think that 3% number that we\u2019re looking for in the third quarter and some better numbers than that in the fourth quarter, all feel quite reasonable to us.","If I step back even further back for a second, Ross, we\u2019ve done a portfolio here that\u2019s demonstrated over the last couple of years, the ability to drive 3%, 3.5% core growth as a starting point. And so, I think, with some of these further factors, again, we\u2019re relatively encouraged about the potential here.","At a macro level, we think the exposures that we have to high-growth end markets, like biologics, like food and environmental, our growing position in molecular, even the opportunities that we have in the dental platform around the digitization of dentistry, all are strong macro drivers that underpin this platform. Recent acquisitions are clearly faster-growing businesses than in the underlying portfolio that they came in to, and again, improvement at more recently acquired businesses that we\u2019ve talked about for a period of time here, the newness of this portfolio and our ability to drive core growth that we\u2019ve demonstrated in the past with newer businesses. I think, you put all those things together, and I think there\u2019s a lot of reasons to be optimistic for the acceleration that we\u2019re looking for in the second half. So I know it\u2019s a bit of a long-winded answer. Apologize for that, but hopefully that gives you a sense of things.","Ross Muken","No, that\u2019s helpful. And just maybe as you\u2019re thinking about \u2013 again, you made comments around the balance sheet and, obviously, the ability at this point given where you with Cepheid and other assets to potentially contemplate other M&A, can you kind of remind us, given the current environment and sort of where the business mix and how the different pieces are performing, kind of what your bias is right now in terms of the style of assets you\u2019re looking for and maybe in all sort of size limits, et cetera?","Thomas Patrick Joyce","Ross, just in terms of the balance sheet, I mean, we feel very good about it, particularly given the exceptional free cash flow that we delivered here in the quarter, nearly $900 million of free cash flow in great conversion continues to position the balance sheet exceptionally well for further acquisition efforts. We\u2019ve talked to $500 billion worth of opportunities here in the second half, but by the time we round the corner, with this bubble of free cash flow generation, round the corner into 2018, we\u2019d be back to spending certainly at a free cash flow level or beyond. So I think our bias from a size standpoint continues to increase as the balance sheet returns to fighting shape. Relative to our business model and our preferences, obviously, our past track record here in the last couple of years would suggest we look for businesses with strong underlying growth capabilities and growth trajectory in strong market positions, leading positions in those markets. You\u2019ve seen us build our position relative to the consumables and aftermarket in our businesses. Today, we are at roughly 55% consumables, and we think that underpins the level of market and volumes visibility and stability and also underpins good gross margins and strong operating margins. We look for global businesses and exposure and opportunities to high-growth markets. I think Cepheid is a great example of a business that has tremendous opportunities in high-growth markets but largely under-penetrated in those markets. And so, I think a continued bias towards strong growth rate, good consumables businesses, balanced with exceptional installed bases that are anchored by strong brand, global positions and high-growth market opportunities, I think all represent the kind of model that we\u2019d be looking for in future acquisitions. So hopefully that helps.","Ross Muken","All the color was super helpful. Thanks, Tom. ","Thomas Patrick Joyce","You bet, Ross. Thanks for the questions. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. Tom, I mean, I think you called out a softness in the US clinical market both from spec and Beckman. Is that all ACA\/PAMA noise? And, I guess, with Beckman still stuck in the kind of low single-digit growth, what gives you a comfort in an acceleration in the back half of the year for that?","Thomas Patrick Joyce","Thanks, Tycho. Tycho, we actually in mass spec, we had a very good quarter in mass spec with good performance, particularly in pharma and in the applied markets. The only softness that we saw around mass spec, which is not really new news, we\u2019ve seen it earlier this year and it really is a comp versus prior year, is really around the clinical anchored store clinical position in mass spec around pain panels. And as some of the reimbursement chains in pain panels, we saw a headwind there, and we\u2019ll get through that headwind in the balance of this year; but otherwise, good performance, a very good performance SCIEX generally across the number of the end markets. ","At Beckman, in diagnostics, we were very encouraged by the continued improvement particularly in North America with improving retention rates that we track very consistently as well as competitive win rates. That being said, we do believe that there is some uncertainty in the end markets today around ACA and what ultimately happens there. We\u2019ve seen some hesitation on the part of some customers to make some decisions, and we\u2019re going to need to get through that. I don\u2019t think the happenings of the past week have done much to eliminate that uncertainty; but in the meantime, I think we\u2019re driving what we can control well, which is ensuring that we serve our current customers well and drive increasing levels of customer retention and enhancing our win rates, and that\u2019s coming partly on the back of the work that we\u2019ve done in terms of new products, both in terms of our hematology platform as well as assays that we\u2019ve launched around AMH and vitamin D. So we are encouraged by the performance there. We think that the rationalization of the product portfolio between the VERIS, the VERIS platform and the Cepheid platform is going to enhance our position in what is arguably the fastest growing segment of the diagnostic market, which is molecular.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then \u2013 and geographically, the PMI indicators have actually been better out of Europe, you called out softness there. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in some of the leading indicators?","Thomas Patrick Joyce","Sure. Well, both in terms of leading and the lagging, Western Europe actually is \u2013 our softness there is largely around our dental platform. We had a number of businesses that performed quite well in Europe, but we would put the bulk of that softness in Western Europe around dental.","Tycho Peterson","Okay, and then just lastly on the dental. You\u2019ve called up pricing in the 10-Q. That seems to be a bit of a new dynamic is \u2013 just maybe quantify how much of impact that had versus destocking?","Daniel L. Comas","Tycho, it\u2019s very, very modest. We\u2019re talking 20 basis points. And we were flat in pricing in dental. In the first quarter, we were just down ever so slightly. A little bit of that is mix. Given consumables, where we tend to get more pricing, was so weak in the second quarter, I don\u2019t think there is any meaningful change in pricing in dental.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thanks. ","Thomas Patrick Joyce","Thanks, Tycho. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Thomas Patrick Joyce","Good morning, Derik.","Derik De Bruin","Hi, good morning.","Thomas Patrick Joyce","Good morning.","Derik De Bruin","Hey, a couple of questions that I\u2019m going to focus on diagnostics. It looks like the core operating profit margin on diagnostics, it was down 25 bps when you exclude everything, and I think this was second quarter in a row. Is there just some talks \u2013 some comments on the margin trend there and what impacting it? And then the other question is, it looks like Cepheid is growing 18-ish percent on an \u2013 if I look at the numbers. That\u2019s definitely -- last quarter and this quarter, definitely your Cepheid numbers are above what we have modeled as a standalone for the company when we \u2013 the company was still public. Could you talk a little bit about is it ensured placements, is it higher utilization on Cepheid? Just color on the revenue trends, if it\u2019s bulk high market growth \u2013 high developing market, high-burden market? Just a little bit more color on what the Cepheid numbers are?","Daniel L. Comas","Sure. You bet, Derik. So let\u2019s start with the Dx operating margins. The \u2013 what we put up is negative 25 basis points. If you look at the FX impact on that, which in the case of a diagnostics is probably one of the more notable impacts of FX in the quarter, net of FX diagnostics actually put a positive 50 basis points.","Derik De Bruin","Got it.","Daniel L. Comas","Operating margin. So, underlying operating margin -- and that is, if you look at the improvement from the first quarter, that\u2019s where my comments earlier represent a 400 basis point improvement over our operating margin performance in the first quarter, so good trajectory and good underlying performance. So, we feel pretty good about what\u2019s going on there.","Turning to Cepheid. You\u2019re right. We put up some pretty significant double-digit growth rates there at Cepheid so far through the first half of this year, and those are higher growth rates than what we\u2019ve seen historically. Derik, that\u2019s largely a function of some fairly large orders that we had both in the first and the second quarter, largely associated, but not exclusively, but largely associated with the high-growth markets. We continue to believe that Cepheid on a go-forward basis is a solid 10% kind of growth business. So we love the fact that we are putting up the numbers we are, and we continue to go aggressively towards large tender wins. But obviously those are a little less predictable and -- but we feel very comfortable with a sustained 10% flat double-digit growth rate going forward.","Utilization remains quite good. We track utilization sort of account by account. So I think the underlying performance of the business both in terms of placements in the developed markets as well as utilization across the breath of the menu remains consistent and in some cases actually improving through some growth initiatives that the team is putting forward.","Derik De Bruin","Great. Thank you very much.","Daniel L. Comas","Thanks, Derik.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen.","Doug Schenkel","Hey, good morning, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. Starting on guidance. For the year, what is your core revenue growth target? And what are you targeting by business? And then related to that, could you just speak to how ongoing dental weakness is impacting your growth outlook for the year as we sit here today relative to where we were, say, 90 days ago?","Daniel L. Comas","Dough, so what we are talking about is an acceleration to 3% ballpark, a 3% core growth in the third quarter and better than that here in the fourth quarter. Tom talked about the underpinnings about better order growth. We did have the unusual dynamic in the second quarter that core order growth was better than shipment growth in every one of our four reporting segments, and that\u2019s part of the encouragement we have kind of going into Q3 and the second half year. A high-level perspective, if we look at the second half, we expect three of the four platforms, excluding Dental, to accelerate here from where we are in the second quarter. Dental we expect versus relatively flat in the first quarter, we have a pretty conservative assumption here around dental here for the balance of the year, given the comments that Tom already made.","Doug Schenkel","Okay, understood, and that\u2019s helpful. But to be clear, you don\u2019t want to give specific by segment or full year core growth targets and you don\u2019t want to comment on how dental has changed relative to what you\u2019re embedding into guidance if it has changed relative to where we were a quarter or two ago, correct?","Daniel L. Comas","I think I kind of give you numbers in the total company Q3, Q4. We tend to give directional numbers around the segment. And clearly dental, dental is a lower number here than we were thinking in April. Again, I said that some of the other businesses are performing a little -- expectations were a little better than we thought here in April on the heels of what we\u2019ve seen in terms of order growth and -- better performance around margins is evidenced in the second quarter. ","Doug Schenkel","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. On dental, a real basic question, and I know it\u2019s a one that comes up probably in every meeting. So I am just looking to get educated again. How was it possible that distributors can still be destocking? It seems like this has been going on for better part of a year, and it seems like you\u2019d expect this is to continue for the balance of the year. I guess, just practically speaking, how much longer do you think this can take? Again, I\u2019m just trying to get educated on this dynamic and also trying to, I guess, at least get a better understanding of how confident you can be that there is not more going on than just destocking.","Thomas Patrick Joyce","I think what\u2019s a little bit different about the scenario today versus probably nine months ago is that nine months ago, we were really talking about a phenomenon that the channel first began taking about, which is that the disconnect between what was being sold in and what was being sold out started to create an inventory issue. So as the consumables market began to slow down, distributors began to adjust their order patterns later last year. I think what\u2019s different today that\u2019s enhanced it, Doug, is that there are some channel dynamics going on right now with some shifts in terms of manufacturing distributor alignment, all that\u2019s been made public, and I think that has further exacerbated some of the shifts we\u2019re seeing right now. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s simply a continuation of something that began last year. I think it\u2019s probably a little bit of what went on last year as well as the increased turbulence that\u2019s been associated with some of the shifts in the channel alliances. ","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Thank you. And one last clean-up question pivoting to capital deployment. What do you define as a larger deal? And I know you talked about your capacity in the context of free cash flow. Is the right way to do the math here just look at our free cash flow projections and assume a reasonable leverage ratio and that\u2019s how big you could go in the aggregate over the next year or so? Thank you. ","Daniel L. Comas","Sure. I mean, we would be -- when we talk larger deal, it\u2019s a -- we view Cepheid, a $4 billion deal, is a larger-type deal.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. And then is that math logic pretty safe?","Daniel L. Comas","Yeah, I mean that\u2019s about a year or a little bit more a year of free cash flow, plus the earnings you bring on from the acquisitions.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. All right. Thanks, guys. Really appreciate it.","Thomas Patrick Joyce","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. A lot of tough questions out this morning so far on the call, so I\u2019m going to go easy.","Daniel L. Comas","Steve, please don\u2019t let us down now.","Steve Beuchaw","No, no, no. I am -- I consider myself a part of the team here. One team, one dream. The first one is that one that normally come up early, which is, could we just spend just a minute on a couple of areas in terms of the end-market metrics that tend to be high-focused and some are controversial? One is pharma. I saw the commentary in your prepared remarks on the pharma was very, very positive, and it\u2019s fair to say that pharma is holding up and were sort of pass any concerns about the slowdown tied to drug pricing or any other boogieman. And then, I think with the NIH, I think, in the commentary you call that was stable, but I suppose that might be raised and hope for 3Q, because we have an NIH budget, or whether its federal budget. I mean, should we be thinking about 3Q possible being a little better? And then for Dan, shifting gears, I wonder if you can comment on just a couple of things. One, Easter timing, do you think that was at all material in terms of, not necessarily selling days, but activity in the quarter? And then, Dan, how should be think about the tax rate for the second half? Thanks for humoring my many, many questions.","Thomas Patrick Joyce","Steve, thanks. So let\u2019s start with pharma. We continue to remain very positive on the pharma market and specifically the biologics portion of the pharma market. As you may have heard us mentioned in the past, we have about $1.5 billion worth of revenue that\u2019s attached to the pharma market, and specifically in the biologics area, and these are largely around the bulk of assets at Pall and at SCIEX as well as a couple of other life science businesses. There is a lot of strong macro drivers, I think, underlying our continued optimism around pharma, specifically around the growth of biologic drugs, the shift from small molecule, investments in small molecule development. It\u2019s a large molecule development. I think you\u2019ve heard us mentioning a number of the statistics that are supportive of that in the past. You mentioned drug pricing, Steve. That does get some air time these days. I think drug pricing, in combination with just broader uncertainty around ACA, I think certainly has to have some impact on pharma companies today. We\u2019ve certainly seen some of our customers manage inventories a little bit more tightly, I think, make sure that they\u2019re managing their cost structures. We feel very \u2013 pretty well insulated from a lot of that because we produced a very high-value consumable at relatively low cost of the overall manufacturing process of a biologic. But nevertheless, these are factors that have to influence these customers in the macro. So while we feel extremely positive about the biologics market continuing, clearly you\u2019ll hear a little bit of noise in the market about uncertainty associated with some of those factors. You did hear me mention accurately about our business in the academic market relatively stable. I think that was specifically probably around SCIEX. That being said, you mentioned NIH. NIH, direct NIH spending is a relatively small portion of our overall life science business. And so while it\u2019s always encouraging to see NIH spending increased, the absolute impact on that, given our small direct NIH spending presence, means it\u2019s a good thing but ultimately doesn\u2019t really move the needle that dramatic. I think it\u2019s a good macro indicator, but I probably wouldn\u2019t go much further than that.","Daniel L. Comas","And, Steve, just on the other questions, we expect our tax rate to remain about 20.5% for the balance of the year. We do expect our cash tax payments to be down materially versus prior year. We had exceptionally high cash taxes last year somewhat related to separation. Because of that and because of our strong year-to-date free cash flow, I know we have talked in April about a sort of an expectation of high single-digit growth for free cash flow, we now expect double-digit growth of free cash flow for the full year. Regarding Easter timings, we did hear a little bit of noise, more European businesses, that are having some modest impact to them in the second quarter, but I\u2019m not sure we want to go more than that.","Steve Beuchaw","Thank you so much for all the color, guys. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. ","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. ","Thomas Patrick Joyce","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","I was hoping to visit the decision on the VERIS product line shutting that down, what was the tipping point? And just to be clear, this was shut down and not sold and might should we considering other similar actions elsewhere?","Thomas Patrick Joyce","Deane, this was a product line discontinuation. It was not a sale or any form of a transaction like that. In terms of a tipping point, I don\u2019t know that there would be necessarily a single point. This was something that we knew or thought about, I should say, as a possibility when we were going through diligence. Obviously, it was well understood that we were going to have an additional product line in molecular diagnostics. What we couldn\u2019t necessarily fully understand until we got beyond diligence close the transaction and really got underneath the product roadmap was the ability for us to continue to scale the gene expert platform and infinity over time both in terms of menu as well as in terms of daily volume or throughput, if you will. And so, as we came to understand the potential that was represented by the Cepheid platform and that unique architecture that they developed, we then were able to really map that against the capabilities of the VERIS platform, the runway in terms of menu expansion of VERIS and the associated process for FDA clearance and other regulatory approvals, and we found that not only did we have a tremendous opportunity in terms of scalability, throughput and assay development, but really it accelerated our position beyond what we anticipated in due diligence. And so it really was through what I think was a pretty thoughtful analysis that really was a team effort between the Cepheid team and the Beckman diagnostic team. They came to a unified conclusion that this was in the best interest of our diagnostic portfolio.","Deane Dray","That\u2019s a good color. And then just as a follow-up, and I hope I don\u2019t get the flag for piling on on dental here but, we\u2019ve been dancing around this destocking question, and interestingly, one of your biggest competitors has been talking recently about taking share in this space, and I just was hoping you could comment on that. So beyond the channel alignment noise, have you lost share in the consumable side?","Thomas Patrick Joyce","I see no flags throw. Happy to take questions on dental in any dimension. There is no question because -- about the impact of destocking here, because we have a relatively high level of transparency with our major distribution partners around sell out byproduct category for us and against the house. So it\u2019s a mathematical equation. We also have outstanding dialogue and transparency with our channel partners around what their current inventory levels are in terms of weeks and months and what their internal targets are managing their own balance sheet situation. So, I think we are on firm ground factually. I think, from a product line standpoint, I mention that we\u2019ve actually seen good growth in a number of our dental product lines. I think, in those areas where -- on the traditional consumables side, where clearly there has been the weakness that we\u2019ve noticed, while the destocking is pretty mathematical, could there be shifts between individual competitors inside the house that we don\u2019t get full transparency to, certainly it\u2019s possible. But I would say, today, if we lost any share in the consumables side, it would be very marginal.","Deane Dray","Got it. Thank you.","Thomas Patrick Joyce","Thanks, Deane.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.","Erin Wright","Great. Thanks. Can you give us an update on the Cepheid integration? Are you tracking ahead of plan? And do you think you\u2019ve seen some more low-hanging fruit in terms of synergies than maybe you initially anticipated?","Thomas Patrick Joyce","Thanks for the question. Cepheid integration has gone extremely well. We have a wonderful team of long-time Cepheid associates, many of whom are in the top leadership positions around the business, and we\u2019ve supplemented that team with a small number of key leaders from the Danaher side: one in operations, one in finance, just to name a couple. And I think the combination of that long-term Cepheid leadership team as well as some of the Danaher associates have continued to make exceptional progress. That progress has really come on the back of a consistent use of the tools of the Danaher business system. Some of that has come in the form of manufacturing productivity improvements, higher levels of volume being moved through given manufacturing cells at lower headcount levels in some cases, but in other cases, simply a function of being able to keep up with the growing demand at the same level of headcount, and therefore, driving higher levels of productivity. So, we\u2019re thrilled with the progress that the team is making operationally. In terms of some of the low-hanging fruits that you asked about, I think it\u2019s been pretty consistent with the expectations that we had. Low-hanging fruit in an acquisition integration typically starts with public company cost, and those company cost have come out of the business. We seen \u2013 we\u2019ve seen very good improvement in areas that we focus on, like indirect costs, which were not managed as tightly over time there as we would typically do at Danaher. We focused on purchase price variance and looking for supplier either rationalization or a combinations with existing Danaher suppliers, where we have outstanding quality and delivery, and some of that integration of suppliers has led to improvement in gross margins from a material cost perspective, and we continued to drive those improvements over time. ","In addition to that, I think commercially the teams are working very well together. While we maintain an independent commercial team at Cepheid, we have a tremendous lead-sharing process going on between the businesses across the balance of our diagnostic platform, more enhancing our feet on the street in high-growth markets, specifically in China. I\u2019ve talked about that in a couple of our past conversations. And so we think the opportunities for using the tools of DBS commercially terming driving higher market visibility, leveraging the commercial reach and capabilities of the balance of the diagnostic platform, all set us up very well for continuing good performance at Cepheid. So we couldn\u2019t be happier about the performance both in terms of core growth, operating margin and free cash flow at Cepheid thus far.","Erin Wright","Excellent. Thanks. And a follow-up acquisition pipeline and the regulatory environment, specifically on timing, and do any other regulatory uncertainties de-rail our alternatively expedite your decision making process when it comes to acquisitions? How aggressive can you be on the M&A front near term?","Thomas Patrick Joyce","I wouldn\u2019t say we see anything in the regulatory environment that would create any undue uncertainty or create any hesitations. We talked earlier today about the capabilities we have with the tremendous free cash flow and the strength of our balance sheet. I think we\u2019re extremely well positioned to put that balance sheet to work during the balance of this year and certainly into next year.","Erin Wright","Thank you.","Thomas Patrick Joyce","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup. ","Dan Arias","Hi, thanks very much for the question. Maybe just quickly on Pall, unless I missed it. Hoping you can maybe put some numbers around the revenue impact that the Middle East project comp had on the quarter and then how that compares to the headwind that you saw there in 1Q?","Daniel L. Comas","It was about a $10-plus million project both in Q1 and in Q2, and that\u2019s we will not have that comparison here in the third and fourth quarter.","Dan Arias","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on Cepheid and the pipeline there. I think we\u2019re coming up on the period where the prior team was targeting the point-of-care launch with the omni. Obviously, you guys have your own plan, has your own timeline there, but just wondering if you might be willing to comment on how you\u2019re thinking about that product and that market, what our expectations there should be, now especially as ACC comes around the corner here. ","Thomas Patrick Joyce","Thanks. You are asking about the omni product line, which we, the prior management team, put in play from our R&D perspective before we acquired the business. We got a chance to get inside the omni product launch opportunity in a great depth. We think that\u2019s an exceptional product with tremendous opportunities. We challenged the team to really make sure that they had done the type of diligence on the technology as well as the commercial side of launching that product. We did that partly through due diligence and then certainly through the strategic plans and the product roadmap reviews that we\u2019ve had. That product is, we\u2019re confident we can launch that product in the first half of next year. I think that product has any exceptional opportunity to drive point-of-care position and an exceptional level of assay capability that will truly revolutionize the point-of-care market. So we feel very good about omni, and we feel good about the launch schedule that we\u2019ve established.","Dan Arias","Okay. Thanks very much for that.","Thomas Patrick Joyce","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to Mr. Gugino for any additional or closing remarks.","Matt Gugino","Thanks, everyone, for joining this morning.

Lawrence Culp","Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Another very good quarter for Danaher. Our team continues to execute well, taking advantage of the strength of our portfolio and the Danaher Business System to deliver solid core growth, margin and cash flow performance.","Revenues grew 5.5% to $4.7 billion with core revenues up 3%. Acquisitions increased revenues by 3% while currency translation decreased revenues by 0.5 point. The investments we've been making in new product development and sales and marketing initiatives, particularly the rapidly expanding digital world, are driving growth and share gains across many of our businesses. Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, ChemTreat, Gilbarco, Leica Microsystems and Videojet are among the businesses that we believe increased their relative market share this quarter.","From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets grew mid-single-digits. China delivered low single-digit growth led by our Dental, Water Quality and Life Sciences & Diagnostics platforms. Most of our industrial businesses continue to see sales declines in China. Developed markets improved sequentially from the first half of the year, while year-over-year, Japan grew mid-single-digits, the U.S. was up low single-digits and Western Europe was slightly positive.","Our gross margin was 51.9% and gross profit improved $145 million. This increase, along with our holding G&A essentially flat, allowed us to grow our combined R&D and sales and marketing investments faster than our sales growth rate. We delivered outstanding margin expansion this quarter with our core operating margin increasing 110 basis points and reported operating margin improving 30 basis points to 17.4%. Our free cash flow to net income conversion was 139% in the quarter and we're still driving towards $3 billion of free cash flow for the full year.","We remain active and optimistic on the M&A front. During the first 9 months of the year, we closed more than $850 million of acquisitions, primarily in our Environmental, Industrial Technologies and Life Sciences & Diagnostics segments. We've had a number of constructive conversations with companies across all of our growth platforms and remain confident in our ability to deploy the $8 billion of potential M&A capacity available through 2014 in a strategic yet disciplined way.","Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement core revenues were flat as growth in our mobile tool distribution business was offset by modest declines in both our instruments and communications platforms. Both core growth -- both core and reported operating margin decreased 90 basis points, primarily due to the impact of targeted growth spending, including the expansion of our network monitoring systems for next-generation LTE networks and our DdoS security offerings for our enterprise and service provider customers. Instruments core revenues declined slightly.","At Fluke, core revenues were flat as increased demand for our industrial products in the U.S. and Western Europe was offset by pockets of weakness in certain high-growth markets. Fluke has generated more than $100 million of revenue from new products introduced since the beginning of last year, including additions to our power quality thermography and calibration lines. These new products, along with productivity and cost-reduction initiatives, helped drive more than 100 basis points of gross margin expansion in the quarter. At Tektronix, core sales declined slightly as low single-digit growth in developed markets was more than offset by weakness in our China export business where we primarily serve the technology sector.","Communications core revenues declined at a low single-digit rate as strong demand for security applications in North America and Western Europe was more than offset by a decline at our network management solutions business in the same regions. Encouragingly though, bookings were up double-digit in the quarter and we expect core growth rates to accelerate in the fourth quarter. New products introduced within the last 18 months, including Arbor's Pravail enterprise security software and Fluke Networks' TruView network performance monitoring solution, accounted for more than 25% of the total third quarter platform revenue and are steadily building momentum. During the quarter, Arbor closed the acquisition of Packetloop, a developer of big data security and forensic analytics used to provide enterprises with enhanced advanced threat detection during cyber attacks. Packetloop's capabilities complement Arbor's Pravail and Peakflow products, further extending our DdoS-centric solutions toward a broader suite of advanced threat analytics.","Turning to our Environmental segment. Revenues increased 10% with core revenues up 4.5%. The segment core operating margin improved 60 basis points with reported operating margin down 80 basis points due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Our Water Quality platform's core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate, in part due to an improvement in North American municipal project activity at both Hach and Trojan. Hach has now seen 3 sequential quarters of U.S. municipal spending increases. Sales in China continued to grow at a double-digit rate.","Trojan's orders were up high single-digits due to several large wastewater project wins, including the city of Chicago, one of several large U.S. cities now deploying UV technology in their treatment facilities. At ChemTreat, we continue to grow faster than the market and achieved another milestone as quarterly revenue surpassed $100 million for the first time. Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew at a mid-single-digit rate, led by demand for our payment solutions, which grew more than 25% in the quarter due to significant customer wins in Asia and Australia.","During the quarter, we expanded our highly popular Encore product line with a new compressed natural gas dispenser, which allows us to help retailers capitalize on the growing trend toward alternative fuels while also delivering superior safety features and seamless monitoring. In the quarter, we acquired Teletrac, further building out our smart transport business. Teletrac complements the previous acquisition of Navman Wireless by providing increased access to the U.S. market and key verticals, including long-haul trucking.","Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenues increased 10.5% with core revenues up 6%. Core operating margin was up 285 basis points, while our reported operating margin decreased 200 -- while our reported operating margin increased 250 basis points to 14.7%. Core revenues in Diagnostics grew mid-single-digits. At Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, core revenues were up low single-digits with growth in all major product lines, particularly clinical automation and immunoassay. We've seen low single-digit core growth or better for the last 6 quarters and the business is becoming more competitive each day.","As many of you know, during the quarter, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for the Access troponin assay for use on the DxI series of immunoassay systems. This clearance marks an important milestone for our customers and the Beckman Coulter team. For the first time since 2010, Beckman can offer the troponin assay to existing and new customers in the U.S. for use on all of our immunoassay and integrated chemistry and immunoassay systems.","With both troponin approvals received and many other regulatory and quality improvements made, we're better positioned to focus on retaining existing and winning new customers and to more effectively and actively increase growth investments in the business. We've launched several significant new products in the last year, including the AU 5800 and the DxH 600, and are investing in new product development and menu expansion to boost product vitality and ultimately, drive higher organic growth rates.","Radiometer's core sales increased at a low single -- at a low double-digit rate. Sales in high-growth markets were up more than 20%, led by China, which grew in excess of 35%. AQT, our cardiac care breakthrough, also had another terrific quarter, growing more than 30%.","At Leica Biosystems, core sales increased approximately 10% as advanced staining and core histology sales both grew low double-digits. Increasingly, we are finding opportunities to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. In this quarter, we had several meaningful wins as a result of the integration of our core histology capabilities with our advanced staining solutions to simplify overall pathology laboratory workflows.","Core revenues in our Life Sciences platform grew high single-digits with solid sales in most geographies, particularly Japan, China and Western Europe. AB SCIEX core revenues grew high single-digits, led by particular strength in pharma and in applied markets. The 6500 Triple Quad continues to build momentum and has generated more than $100 million in revenue since its launch last year.","AB SCIEX continues to expand its digital capabilities with multiple new and enhanced launches this year, including its new MasterView Software, which allows the mass spectrometer to be used for routine analysis in food safety, environmental and forensic toxicology laboratories with minimal training needed for lab personnel. This is just one of the many new applications introduced this year that simplify workflows and enable greater efficiency and cost savings for our customers. Of note, today, approximately half of AB SCIEX R&D associates are dedicated to software development, with nearly 1\/3 of the total R&D spend focused on these digital efforts.","Leica Microsystems core sales increased mid-teens, with sales of our confocal microscopes up more than 30%. Our SP8 modular confocal laser scanning microscope has generated over $150 million of revenue since its launch last year and continues to be very well-received. We're very proud of the fact that all 3 winners of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine cited Leica microscopes in their publications during the period in which they carried out the work that contributed to their awards. This is the third year in a row that Leica microscopes have been cited in Nobel Prize-winning work in the field of physiology or medicine. We're pleased to support such important and pioneering work.","Turning to Dental. Segment revenues increased 4.5%, while core revenues were up 3.5%. Core operating margin increased 70 basis points and reported operating margin increased 60 basis points to 16.1%. This marks the first quarter Dental segment margins have exceeded 16%, evidence of our team's ability to drive and sustain improvements.","Dental consumables core revenues grew mid-single-digits with solid demand in most geographies and product lines. In particular, we saw outstanding traction in our implant business, growing over 20%. Revenues from products introduced during the last 18 months have doubled since the first quarter, as adoption ramps for our new products, including the Lythos Digital Orthodontic Impression System and our TF Adaptive endodontic file.","KaVo core revenues increased low single-digits as double-digit growth in the U.S. was partially offset by weakness in project business in Western Europe. During the quarter, KaVo launched the DIAGNOcam, a handheld, X-ray-free digital imaging system that uses light technology instead of radiation to provide doctors with unsurpassed imaging quality.","In Industrial Technologies, total revenues increased 1%, while core revenues decreased 1%. Due to a weak top line, core operating -- or despite a weak top line, core operating margin expanded 100 basis points and reported operating margin increased 80 basis points to 22.6%. Motion core revenues declined at a high single-digit rate. However, we have seen improvements in the North American industrial automation and distribution markets.","We've also had commercial success with several new design wins, including a contract from a major material handling company for critical motion control capability worth over $15 million annually at full volume production. The team's execution on the margin front has been excellent, as operating margin increased more than 100 basis points from the first 9 months of the year. Motion continues to transition out of some of their lower-margin business, negatively impacting sales performance in the short term but positioning us for better and more profitable growth longer term.","Core revenues in our Product Identification platform were flat as mid-single-digit growth at Videojet and X-Rite was largely offset by a significant nonrepeating consumer electronics laser order last year, which created a difficult prior year comparison. We believe the investments we've made in digital marketing lead generation and in innovation at Videojet, combined with our expanding commercial DBS capabilities, continue to drive relative outperformance. We're now deploying the same lead gen growth tools to many of our other businesses.","During the quarter, Esko announced their first acquisition as part of Danaher, acquiring CAPE Systems, a software developer that specializes in packaging design, pallet optimization and truck and container loading solutions. This acquisition expands Esko's capabilities to provide an end-to-end offering to its packaging customers from packaging design all the way through to point of sale.","So to wrap up, our team continues to execute well with the Danaher Business System, delivering solid core growth, operating margin expansion and cash flow performance. We believe our new product and go-to-market investments, our continued focus on productivity and efficiency initiatives and our optimism on the acquisition front position us well for the balance of 2013 and beyond.","We are initiating fourth quarter diluted net EPS guidance of $0.91 to $0.96 and confirming our full year adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $3.37 to $3.42. We are assuming fourth quarter 2013 core revenue growth to be in the range of 2% to 3%.","Matt R. McGrew","Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. Debbie, we're ready to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first today to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a question on the acquisition pipeline. Obviously, a big topic of debate in the last couple of months, there's been a lot of noise around you guys perhaps switching up your capital allocation philosophy, given the lack of deals that's coming. And maybe you could talk about the discussions with the board around a potential for a buyback. If no deals get done, what's kind of the tipping point for that? And then also just kind of the standard discussion around what the pipeline looks like. And it has been a little bit of a long period of time since you guys did a big deal. So I mean, it is a fair question, I guess, so if you could just comment on that.","H. Lawrence Culp","Steve, all your questions are fair, but we're very pleased with the health care performance. You're exactly right. To see Life Sciences up mid-single, certainty on the Dental consumables as well, the Diagnostic businesses to boot, very pleased with that. But remember, we had water up mid-single-digits. GVR was in that zone as well and Videojet, particularly. So we had a number of businesses in mid-single-digits or better in the quarter. So a lot of folks contributed. But to your question, capital allocation is something that the Danaher board takes quite seriously, as you imagine. I think they understand that, that's a critical responsibility they have relative to the company. And clearly, we had a bias, a distinct bias over time toward M&A. What we've been able to do organically has thrown up a lot of cash. And what we've done is redeploy that back in a way that has complemented what we're doing organically, inorganically, to build what we think is a unique and outstanding portfolio. I think that bias, Steve, is very much intact today simply because while we have tremendous capacity, we talked about $8 billion over the next couple of years potentially, we see a wealth of opportunity. And again, the quality and the quantity of the conversations that we're having with potential partners, with potential sellers, is something that we find encouraging. There's no question that given where public equity valuations are in many spaces, M&A is more challenging at this point in time. But those valuations again can be a catalyst, a trigger, if you will, for the types of conversations that we're having. I think that when we meet again in December as we did when we met in December, the board will talk through all of the options that we have to build value, including buybacks, including the dividend. But that said, I think the bias that we have is, one, we have a tremendous amount of conviction in despite the fact, as you say, that while we've deployed $850 million this year, we haven't had a big, big deal since Beckman.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is this a dynamic around people's EBITDA expectations? Or is it more about what you talked about with the valuations? I mean, what's the sticking point here? Because it seems like you guys have been pretty optimistic on the pipeline several times in the last several quarters, it just seems like there's -- for whatever reason, stuff is just not getting to the finish line. Is that a fair characterization? Or is this just kind of normal course of business?","H. Lawrence Culp","Steve, I think it's more normal course. Clearly, for a host of macro reasons, valuations in a number of places are probably a bit ahead of the fundamentals, right? And we're going to be more rooted on the fundamentals and we're clearly in a slow-growth global scene with, despite last night's news or this morning's news, a great deal of uncertainty out there. So that doesn't make it easy necessarily. But again, it's hard for me to characterize or generalize the 1 reason or the 2 reasons that some of the things that we have been working on haven't come to a head yet. But again, I think that each situation is unique. We don't need to have a broad array of sellers out there. We simply need to have a handful of folks that we'd love to have part of Danaher get to a point where we can both be happy around the terms of the transaction.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","When you look at Test & Measurement, it's the one area that has remained pretty sluggish all year and shorter-cycle businesses that clearly are showing that global economies aren't improving at all. I mean, what are your guys telling you from the different geographies, particularly when you think about China still negative on relatively easy comps? I mean, is there any hope that we see a pickup towards the end of the year? Or is this the new reality, I guess, in global?","H. Lawrence Culp","I think if I can take the last part of your question, elevate it up and out of T&M and just look at the world more broadly, we clearly have seen a bit of the edge come off the high-growth markets. That said, they're still leading the way for us, as you know. I think we were pleased to see the U.S. be -- well, U.S. and Western Europe to be better incrementally. But for the high-growth market basket to be up, say, mid-single-digits plus as opposed to low double-digits is something that we wish were otherwise. But the macro is what it is. Scott, specifically at T&M, I think what we saw in the quarter is important to understand if you look business-by-business. The comms business had a really good quarter from an orders perspective. They were up double-digit. But as you know, in that space, deliveries can be a bit lumpy. And I think that's really where we were a little soft, vis-\u00e0-vis our expectations. But the order strength that they had sets us up well going into the fourth quarter. And we think the comms business is probably going to be up somewhere in the high single-digit range in the fourth quarter. So I'm not really worried about that. On the instrument side, I think we were actually pretty encouraged by what we saw. I mean, Tek was down slightly as was Fluke. But for Tek to be down slightly, that frankly is the best quarter we've seen since the fourth quarter of 2011 and very much in line with where we thought they would be as they work through some of the macro issues that you're alluding to. Fluke was in a similar position and really because outside of China, we saw the high-growth markets tail a little bit. India, Turkey, Russia were softer than we had anticipated. China, fortunately, was positive, at a low single-digit rate unfortunately, but still an acceleration, slight acceleration from where we were in the second quarter. So all in all, I think we were pleased with the way the quarter played out because, as you know, instruments has really been where we've been challenged. And it was really that comms dynamic that was a little softer than expectation. But again, it sets us up well for the fourth quarter.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful. So when you think about 4Q guidance, 2% to 3%, kind of sequentially flat against a slightly easier comp, I mean, is there an impact in there? You didn't mention government shutdown in any of your comments. I've got to imagine there's some NIH or CDC impact for the first couple of weeks of October. Is that in your guidance?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, it's a little hard to pin down. We didn't use the backup script we had if things didn't happen as everyone hoped they would last night here in Washington. But we've seen a little bit of sequestration impact in certain pockets, a little bit in LS&D, a little bit in T&M. And I think we've dialed that in. But to the extent that there's any residue from the circus over the last couple of weeks, we know what we know today, right? And I don't think it gets materially worse, given they found a way to a deal last night.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So I'm not sure you answered the question. Was there any real -- you couldn't measure any impact in NIH or CDC shutdown? Or is it....","Daniel L. Comas","Scott, I would say, generally, we did see some pockets of weakness in government in the third quarter, probably saw a little bit more in the industrial businesses. Even though it's not a big piece of Fluke and T&M, we definitely saw the impact. We are expecting a more difficult fourth quarter in Life Sciences compared to the third quarter. I think that's the combination of a couple of things. One was we had a terrific quarter Q4. We had a very tough comp here in Life Science. And I think there's a little concern about the residue of what's happened here the last couple of weeks. So part of the reflection, we did overall as a company have a better core growth last year in Q4 than we did Q3. And that was probably most notable in Life Science, and we'll feel some of that headwinds here in Life Science in the fourth quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just maybe, first, a cash flow question. Free cash flow net income was a very strong 139% but still down from last year. And I guess, some of that was trade working capital headwind, by my numbers, something like $40 million to $50 million. But maybe just talk to any dynamics there we should be aware of.","Daniel L. Comas","Steve, there are a couple of factors driving the cash flow being a little bit behind last year. One is the timing of tax payments. We've had higher year-to-date tax payments than a year ago. That should flip a little bit here in the fourth quarter. But as you point out, there's also some working capital dynamics. Last year, in our comms business, we had some sizable upfront payments on some projects. Not surprisingly, those are harder to get these days. It's a little bit of a one-off there in terms of deferred revenue. And then on the inventory side, we have had a -- I would talk to this, a sizable increase in kind of new products this year. That has impacted our inventory levels, which are a little bit higher than they were at this time last year. We expect some of that to correct here in the fourth quarter.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. All right. And then I noticed also the debt paydown, you've got -- I think it was down by about $650 million. Was that -- just any part of that a function of your discussion about capital deployment and sort of optimism but just not there right now? Or how should we think about that?","Daniel L. Comas","I wouldn't read anything into it. We had a Eurobond come due in the third quarter and we had cash on hand and we redeemed it at that point. And obviously, the capital market is still wide open here, so not concerned that if we were to run down some larger deals, we'd have any issues with financing.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then finally, the M&A that you talked about, I guess it was $869 million year-to-date for $294 million of revenues and a little more in this past quarter from a price, so kind of running 3x revenue for the year and, I guess, 4x for this last quarter. Just thinking about, these are small deals, lot of strategic deals. But that normal kind of pricing run rate on historical last 12 months' revenue -- or sorry, last year's revenue is not normally what we should be thinking about or expecting, right?","Daniel L. Comas","Yes. I mean, I wouldn't read much in from the bolt-ons in terms of what they would mean for larger situations. Some of these are very profitable niche add-ons or businesses that we expect to be very profitable companies becoming product lines within the operating structure.","Operator","We'll go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. So can you just maybe talk about -- elaborate a bit on the trading environment? Some of your peers have talked about a September slowdown. Did you see that? And then secondly, on emerging markets, we've seen some of the consumer staple companies caution on EM. And you've seen the slowdown but still at decent growth levels. But is there anything happening in emerging markets that maybe causes some concern down the road?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think the way September played out, Nigel, was more or less as we had anticipated, frankly. I think as we went through the summer, we knew we'd have a lot riding on September. Certainly, pleased to see Europe go positive again, albeit ever so slightly. I think in terms of the high-growth markets, we saw China up again low single-digits in the quarter, but we saw a little bit less froth in other high-growth markets but still positive, right? So if you look overall, I would've thought that given some of the macro issues that we might have seen a little bit of greater spottiness in Brazil and India. They're both up 15% for us despite the ForEx issues there. And Russia was up mid-singles for us. So I think we're probably more incrementally cautious about how much growth we will get from the high-growth markets but continue to believe that they'll lead the way here going into the fourth quarter and as we gear up for 2014.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. That's great. And then switching to troponin, obviously great news that you finally got approval on the high-speed machine. But can you maybe just talk about what benefit you expect to accrue from having that assay on the high-speed machine and maybe back away from that and talk about what negative impact you saw from the absence of that assay for the last 3 years?","H. Lawrence Culp","Sure. Well, I think in terms of the impact, clearly that was a test that had a run rate in the $40 million to $50 million range at peak before we acquired the company and before they got into the issues from a regulatory perspective. I think what it really means for us going forward commercially is that we can go back and sell that assay on any machine to any customer. And that's going to help us not only claw back what we can in terms of that lost revenue, but going forward, when existing customer contracts are up for renewal, there's no troponin issue to work through, that's solved. And when we're competing for new business as well, Nigel, that is not something that will be held against us. I think just as importantly from a product development perspective, the organization understandably spent considerable time and talent, let alone dollars, in paying off that inheritance tax, if you will. We get to pivot now with that behind us, putting those people and that money on more traditional growth investments, particularly in terms of menu expansion and complementary software and service capability. So it's a big deal for us commercially. It's probably even a bigger deal long term from an innovation perspective. And finally, as you can appreciate, having that successfully concluded is a tremendous morale booster for the team.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","No question about that. That's great color. And just one final question. Larry, you mentioned in the past, the midpoint mentality. And I guess, the question is, is there a bias towards any good news in 4Q being used for top-up restructuring? Is there a bias towards restructuring in 4Q?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, what we're going to do with the efficiency and productivity efforts in the fourth quarter is we will spend, I think, at this point, close to $100 million in the quarter and would expect that, that gives us a nice payback going into '14, probably in the $70 million to $80 million range. So we're going to top that up a little bit and probably use a little bit of the beat here to do that in part because we can and in part frankly because we should, given the uncertainties that still lurk out there. So I think it's a good setup for us going into the fourth quarter and getting ready for next year.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just putting a finer point on restructuring first, did any restructuring happen in Q3? Or is the $100 million plan all about Q4?","Daniel L. Comas","Jeff, the lion's share of it will occur in Q4. There were some early spending in Q3, but it was a modest amount.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. Great. And just wondering on back to instruments and Test & Measurement, Larry, other than kind of lapping what should be some easy comps after kind of 18 rough months or so, do you actually see some clear business drivers to kind of drive some acceleration into next year, whether it's new product or customer or front log or any other thing that feels tangible to get some visibility on the outlook?","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. Well, I think the visibility really comes from the sales funnels, right? And those sales funnels and the issues and the opportunities we have, I think, are our best window there, Jeff. But I think if you look at the trend lines in terms of retention rates for existing customers, win rates for new customers, let alone that you have a punch list of some of the things that we needed to work through, be they regulatory approvals that we just talked through, product enhancements and the like, improvements in delivery and service, I think we just again are a more competitive company every day. And that, coupled with the lessons we glean from our higher-growth Diagnostics businesses, Radiometer and Leica Biosystems, give us the confidence that we'll continue to see the sequential improvement in the underlying core growth at Beckman with the lineup we've got. Obviously, there's some longer-term growth drivers that kick in, in time, like our molecular diagnostics effort. But that's really not something that we're going to talk a lot about today. But we've got a long-term plan here that, I think, gives us again the confidence that Beckman is going to be a good grower for us.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Right. And can you elaborate a little bit more on the trends in U.S. muni? And it sounds like Hach is gaining some share. Is that how you'd handicap it? Or is the market actually gaining some momentum? Obviously, you've got some episodic projects that's going on that's helped.","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. I think that we have seen a welcome stabilization and, dare I'd say, a modest improvement in the muni scene. And we see it both at Hach Lange and at Trojan. Is Hach taking a little bit of share? We think so. But as you know, Jeff, it's such a fragmented market. It's hard to pin down inside a 90-day period. But we clearly have the winning franchise in a number of product categories that are important, not only on the lab bench, but in the plant at Hach.","Operator","We'll go next to Jon Groberg with Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Larry, I was just sitting here looking at the overall business and looking at 2012. You grew about 2% core, 2013, about 2% core if you take your 2% to 3% in the fourth quarter. And I'm just -- from your perspective, where you sit, what are the key issues you see for Danaher moving into 2014? It looks like consensus expects revenues to bounce back to, call it, 5% mid-single-digit growth. I'm just kind of curious what you see as the key issues for Danaher moving into next year?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, clearly, I think the macro context is important, Jon, not only for Danaher, but for all of us, right? But we can't control that. So we've just concluded our strategic plan reviews, which is really the front end for us to our budget cycle that we will begin here in a couple of weeks. And I think what we try to do is really make sure that with all of our businesses in the context of their respective markets, that we're very clear as to what winning looks like in '14. It's going to be a share gain play in a lot of places. We need to make sure we are grabbing as much high-growth market opportunity as we can come, even if those markets are a little less robust. We want to make sure we're continuing to drive everything we can from a digital perspective from the way we generate leads and sell to some of the new product and business model changes that are likely to occur, and all the while, I think, make sure that we're staying focused on the qualities of the delivery, the cost side of the business that has always been a DBS hallmark. So we take none of that for granted. That's our game plan really across the portfolio going into '14. And '14 will be what it is in terms of the context. We need to control our destiny as best we can.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Sure. And to your point, I mean, if you look across all your markets, clearly the markets themselves are just slower. But assuming a similar macro as we've had, I mean, let's just say that's what happens this year and next year, are those initiatives enough, you think, to drive you to mid-single? Or if we were in the same kind of macro, would you expect a similar kind of environment as the last couple of years?","H. Lawrence Culp","I think when we get to the other side of our budget cycle and we get to New York in mid-December, we'll detail out all of the assumptions for next year.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then if I could just follow-up then on the Test & Measurement side of things, it looks like at least for this year, kind of every quarter sequentially, margins are down a little bit. Were there any -- is that just a volume issue? Are there any plans specific to that business unit to restructure? I'm just curious kind of how you're seeing -- what your take on the margins are.","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. Jon, I think from a margin perspective, 2 key points. One, it is our highest gross margin business. So when a little bit of revenue goes missing in T&M, we feel it. I'd say the other, as we alluded to in our prepared remarks, we're continuing to invest in innovation, particularly on the comms side as we look at some of the LTE opportunities, as well as the expansion of the Arbor business beyond their DdoS core. We can't let the near-term dynamics get in the way of making sure we continue to invest in what has been, this quarter notwithstanding, really one of our best growth contributors in the last couple of years and a business that we think will be similarly positioned going forward.","Operator","We'll go next to Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Larry, so this sort of encouragement you talked about a little bit in Tek instruments, can you give a little more color on your thoughts there? I mean, is this just finally the mass of the comps? Or are you actually seeing better spending out there?","H. Lawrence Culp","I don't want to pound the table too much, Shannon. Again, we were down, albeit slightly. But the comps helped a little bit. But you'd have thought that, that would have been the case 5 quarters into the slowdown, right? And again, we haven't been in this zone since the fourth quarter of 2011. China continues to be challenging. And I say China, I think it's really more the tech sectors that we serve with the export base there in China as opposed to China more broadly. But we saw, I thought, nice improvement in the U.S., good improvement in Western Europe and some of the other high-growth markets were contributing. But just given the vertical mix, when Tek is going through what it is going through, the Tek end markets, it is challenging for Tek in the short term. But I think, all-in, we were encouraged with the print and hope to build on that as we move forward here in the next couple of quarters. I don't think the context for them gets any easier, so we're going to have to work hard to get north of line and put a positive print on Tek.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then just you also talked about some of these better trends you're seeing on the Motion side, but it's being, I guess, more than offset by your transition out of the low-margin business. I mean, x this transition, would that business actually be growing right now? And when do you see that kind of working its way through in terms of this bleed-off of other stuff?","Daniel L. Comas","Shannon, instead of being down high single-digits, I think we would've been down just a little bit. We've had 3 quarters in a row where our book-to-bill has increased and we were north of 1 in the third quarter. Again, we've got 2 more quarters of this -- of the noise, getting out of this low-margin business. But I think the underlying trends are favorable right now.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And what are you hearing in terms of sort of what's driving that better trend?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think frankly the stability in the U.S. and in Western Europe has helped us a good bit there. I think we're executing better. We've reset the mix a bit across the group away from some of these more volatile end markets. That's been a multiyear effort. Some of the exits that Dan alluded to are around discrete customer situations. So I think there's a little bit of market help there, Shannon. But I think that the great work that team has done on margins that has been evident in virtually every print here in the last 8 or 9 quarters is also showing up in the quality of their revenue set. And that, in turn, is why we're getting a better top line once you kind of filter away the one-offs out of the group. A little bit more health care, a little less semi helps a lot in this environment.","Operator","We'll go next to Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A question on Product ID within industrial tech. That piece, I think, it had sort of decent growth organically for about 3 years. It's gone flat in Q3, and the main reason seems to be consumer electronics. Could you talk about maybe what you've seen by region in the consumer electronics piece there and if you think that Product ID should return to growth in Q4 or that's more something that happens next year?","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. No, I think at PID, the issue in the quarter, Julian, is really the comp. We had a very large global consumer electronics opportunity a year ago. It was primarily a laser marking application. It was great to get. It's a little hard to offset in the quarter a year later. And I'd say that, coupled with the drupa show a year ago, really set Esko up for a very strong back half as the orders taken at drupa were shipped in the back half of the year. If you look at the core marking and coding business at Videojet, again, we were up mid-single-digits there. I think that business continues to perform very well, clearly the market leader. And the newest acquisition, X-Rite, was up mid-single-digits as well. So they're continuing to, I think, get their arms around the opportunity they have with DBS. So I realize the headline print isn't stellar, but it's frankly what we had anticipated happening and really have no concerns here around the core growth engines in PID as we move forward.","Daniel L. Comas","And Julian, we'll have a little bit of that laser overhang in Q4 and not near as pronounced as Q3 and we expect a better print here in Q4.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then on the cost base, you showed kind of very good operational leverage around R&D and SG&A in Q3. I mean, are the trends on the selling and R&D costs, are those more -- is Q3 more kind of representative of where you should be going forward relative to the performance in the first half, when maybe the cost growth seemed to be a lot bigger?","Daniel L. Comas","Julian, we -- R&D and sales and marketing continue to grow faster than organic revenue, but not -- it was not the same -- as you point out, not the same differentials we saw in the first half. As long as we're expanding gross margins, doing what we did on the G&A side, which was keeping it flat year-on-year, we're comfortable with that makeup because we think that's helping us drive some of this relative outperformance in some of our businesses.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just lastly, you touched on this early, but sort of net income is up about $250 million year-to-date, free cash flow is down about $200 million. Was your point that in Q4 that gap is pretty much wiped out because of the tax and the comms issue? Or is it maybe something that spills into next year?","Daniel L. Comas","Well, part of the year-to-date income increases are onetime or so. The overall point is accurate, but it's not that significant. And we expect better free cash flow here than we had a year ago in Q4 because of the dynamics I covered.","Operator","We'll go next to Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Larry, on the Dental side of the business, just curious if you could speak to how Dental consumables have fared kind of over the past 6 weeks or so, given what's been happening in D.C. And then on the margin front there, could you speak to how much more runway you feel like is left on the profitability front in the Dental business?","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. I think in terms of what we've seen on consumables in the U.S., as you well know, Brandon, it varies a little bit category-by-category. But we've been pretty pleased with the resiliency of what we have seen. Now what matters most obviously is POS in a number of the categories. And we don't really have up-to-the-minute visibility in that regard, given we go to market through distribution. But where we have that line of sight, it hasn't been, I think, as troublesome as the headlines out of Washington might suggest. In terms of the margin expansion with the business, again as we said, pretty darn proud of the progress the team has made on the margin front. We love the 16.1% print here. I think Dental can be a 20% platform or segment for us, really no reason for that not to be the case. We have work to do to expand the gross margins there. And that's work we're after, not only in terms of existing cost, but frankly new product design. And I think over time, there's leverage to be had out of the OpEx base. So I don't think in any way should you take this third quarter number as a high-water mark. It's a sign of progress, but there's more to come.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then back on T&M, could you just give us the overall book-to-bill for the segment? And then particularly would be interested in how Tek instrument orders performed in the period.","Daniel L. Comas","Brandon, for the instrument side, our book-to-bill remained about 1.0. So orders were basically in line with -- shipments were down ever so slightly. I think orders were about flat but not a big change. As Larry alluded to, orders were very good at comms and we were well north of 1 for comms.","Operator","We'll go next to Deane Dray with Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just some cleanup questions here. And for Dan, maybe if he can comment on the price\/cost dynamic in the quarter and what you're looking for in the fourth quarter.","Daniel L. Comas","I mean, we continue to see good progress on the gross margin side. That's obviously a function of what we did last year in Q4, the benefit of some of these new products coming in at higher gross margin. Price, still pretty steady. We're getting the same price on the consumable side. Equipment remains challenging. It's definitely worse than it was, say, 2 years ago, but it's been pretty consistent with what we're seeing. On the input side, we've done a good job on -- we've done a very good job on the procurement side this year. And you see that in what has been a low-growth environment, our gross margin up 60 basis points. And we've had as good a year as any on doing a better job on sourcing and procurement.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And we touched on this earlier in the call regarding plans for additional restructuring in the fourth quarter. Could you quantify any additional discretionary spending beyond restructuring? We touched on some incremental sales, R&D, maybe some other growth investments. Is there anything embedded in 4Q guidance in that area?","Daniel L. Comas","Well, as I mentioned to Julian, we continue to spend faster on those growth levers in our overall top line against driving margin expansion because of the gross margin and the G&A. And that continues to be our plan in the near term, and won't get any more specific than that.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Good. And then just last question for me, the news on the Chicago win for Trojan. I saw the announcement last week by the city of New York that they have completed the Trojan UV installation, that's the largest in the world. Is the Chicago win, is this an inflection point you've been waiting for, for drinking water, disinfection on UV? And are there other cities that we're looking at Chicago and New York to lead the way?","H. Lawrence Culp","Deane, it's a timely question, not only because we finished up in New York and Marv was down for the grand opening, so to speak. But with the Chicago win, we really get on the treatment side, a top 10 U.S. city deploying UV for the first time. So the application is a little bit different than New York. I think a lot of eyes are on Chicago. So we're keen to go from order to shipment and installation and get that gear installed. And I do think that will help us drive greater print penetration at the higher-volume sites or localities going forward. So it's a big order, which is great. But again, strategically, as you point out, probably more important to us going forward.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we'll take our final question today from Ross Muken with ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to talk a little big picture on Diagnostics. It's been an interesting sort of market dynamic. We've seen varied prints from some of your competitors, and it feels like your business is really sort of hitting an inflection point. So I'm just curious, from like a market perspective, there's a lot of pushes and pulls. Reimbursement is tougher, utilization is still a bit weak, but we're seeing platform consolidation, the emerging markets are good. You guys have had some good R&D success. I'm curious, as you sort of put it together, how the business is doing versus the market in terms of where it is on the plan versus what your expects were when you originally bought Beckman and how you kind of expect the R&D to kind of further accelerate. Do you feel like that business really is kind of now getting to where you want it to be? Is it doing better? I'm just trying to get a big-picture sense with all the pushes and pulls, how you feel like you're doing versus the market and where the big deltas are from an inflection perspective as we kind of go forward.","H. Lawrence Culp","Sure. Ross, I think, overall, we're very pleased with the Diagnostics platform, not only because of where we are with Beckman, but the real performance driver, as you know, for us the last several years have been Radiometer and Leica Biosystems. Radiometer has just done a phenomenal job globally in critical care, both on the core blood gases and now in cardiac care. And that franchise is just a wonderful business. Leica Biosystems, similarly, we positioned in a bit of a niche in the path lab, has only plugged into the highest product growth category, advanced staining, but has done that in a differentiated way, given we really can go end-to-end in that workflow from our core histo products all the way to advanced staining, and now increasingly with Aperio, into some of the informatic applications. I think at Beckman, in terms of the top line and our competitiveness, we are where we hoped to be in the second half of 2013. We thought this would be a low single-digit growth year as we paid off some of that inheritance tax, not only from a regulatory view but frankly a lot of the internal issues that we needed to work through, quality, service and the like. But we really like where Beckman is today. And I think as we move forward, we're going to play a lot more offense commercially. We're going to be better-positioned from an innovation and R&D perspective, both with the instruments as well as the menu. And that may not ever put Beckman in short of a big impact from the molecular effort into the Radiometer, Leica high single-digit, low double-digit growth range, but Beckman can be a very solid mid-single-digit plus grower for us over time and certainly has still runway in front of us from a margin expansion view.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, just on that last point, it feels like again, like to your point, you're really sort of going on offense now, which is obviously encouraging. The natural next progression for the business over time, R&D-wise, I mean, there's still plenty of menu left within your own world, but it's sort of that push into molecular, which I know they had been working on and you've put money towards. I mean, I think, in general, that organic strategy has made sense. How do you feel about sort of transforming Beckman over time into kind of a broader player in Dx and using some of your existing assets around you to kind of round out the business as you sort of see where some of the valuations have gone in that space? Obviously, externally, it gets a little bit more challenging. But how do you feel like that sort of playbook looks today versus maybe what you had thought 6 or 12 months ago?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think we have been focused frankly, Ross, first and foremost, on making sure that Beckman itself is strong. But as we made the progress that I alluded to earlier, we have been doing more with Radiometer, with Leica Biosystems, to collaborate and do some things that we might not be able to do independently. Valuations run in cycles, right? And there'll be times when there are attractive opportunities for us to add to Beckman and to the Dx platform, and we'll take advantage of those. And as you saw with the IRIS investment, where we extended Beckman into urinalysis, we're at the point where we think the business is strong enough and capable to think about those sorts of investments in addition to what we're doing organically. So I think it's full speed ahead at Beckman.","Operator","That concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. McGrew, I'll turn it back to you for closing remarks.","Matt R. McGrew","Thanks, Debbie. We're around here today for follow-up calls. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt Gugino, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Gugino, please go ahead.","Matt Gugino","Thanks, Christel. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Tom Joyce, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'd like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call, and the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings.","The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under heading Events & Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until February 13, 2020. ","During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance.","Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics refer to results from continuing operations and relate to the fourth quarter of 2019 and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. All references to individual operating company operating margins exclude the impact of intangible amortization.","We will also refer you to our Form 8-K filing dated December 18, 2019 for pro forma information reflecting Danaher's historical performance on a basis that excludes Envista's results of operation. We may also describe certain products and devices, which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals that are only available in certain markets.","During the call, we'll make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including those set forth in our SEC filings and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today.","These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.","With that I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Joyce","Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter results wrapped up a tremendous 2019 for Danaher. For the full year, we delivered 6% core revenue growth as we continued to capture market share in many of our businesses through new product innovation and enhanced commercial execution.","We also delivered 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion and $3 billion of free cash flow. But the numbers only tell part of Danaher's transformative story in 2019. We continued to evolve into a higher growth company as we announced the GE Biopharma acquisition and completed the IPO and subsequent split-off of our dental segment into an independent publicly traded company called Envista.","GE Biopharma, which will be called Cytiva after we close had a very good 2019 as core revenue growth of approximately 10% accelerated relative to the businesses performance over the past couple of years. We continue to be very impressed with this talented team an extraordinary group of passionate and highly engaged associates who provide customers with innovative solutions used in the development and production of biopharmaceutical drugs.","During the fourth quarter, we achieved several important milestones related to the acquisition which we continue to expect to close in the first quarter of this year. First, as part of the regulatory approval process we announced that we signed an agreement to sell certain of our businesses to Sartorius. The annual revenue to be divested is approximately $170 million and consists of businesses that are currently part of our Life Science platform.","Secondly, we received conditional clearance for the acquisition from the European Commission in December. While the timing around meeting certain closing conditions can be uncertain, we continue to work constructively with the regulators and remain encouraged by the progress we're making. And lastly, we raised approximately $4 billion of U.S. denominated debt in October, which essentially completes the financing needed to fund the acquisition.","Overall, financing costs have come in materially better than expected, as we were able to take advantage of favorable credit market conditions, particularly in Europe. When we announced the transaction last year, we anticipated financing $18 billion of debt and cash at a blended interest rate of approximately 2.75%, resulting in a total annual interest cost of $500 million. The actual blended interest rate on this $18 billion will be less than 1% for a total annual interest cost of $150 million.","As a result, we now believe GE Biopharma will be approximately $0.60 accretive to non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share in 2020. This assumes an end of first quarter close and includes the impact of the lower financing cost and the business is better than 2019 core revenue growth, partially offset by the lost earnings related to the pending divestitures. While not included in our formal 2020 guidance, we wanted to provide you with an update given these recent developments.","Now, turning to our fourth quarter results. Sales grew 5.5% to $4.9 billion, as the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by approximately 1%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 50 basis points. Core revenue increased 6%. Geographically, high-growth markets increased at a high single-digit rate, led by China and India. In the developed markets, the U.S. remains strong, delivering high single-digit growth, while Western Europe was up mid-single digits.","Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 55.5% and operating profit margin was 19.8%. Core operating margin increased 175 basis points in the quarter, bringing full year core operating margin expansion to 100 basis points, a testament to the team's terrific execution across the portfolio.","The Danaher Business System continues to be the primary driver of our strong core operating margin performance and 2019 marked the fifth consecutive year that we expanded core operating margins by 70 basis points or more. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1.28 were up double digits year-on-year, bringing full year adjusted diluted net earnings per share to $4.42. All in all, a strong finish to a very important year.","So, now let's take a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue increased 7% and core revenue increased 6.5% for the quarter. Operating profit margin of 21.2% was up 150 basis points with 190 basis points of core margin expansion. For the full year, life sciences achieved 7% core revenue growth and delivered operating margin expansion of 145 basis points.","Core growth at Beckman Life Sciences was up mid-single digits with strength across most major geographies and product lines. This finished off another great year for Beckman as the business grew high single digits and surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time.","New product introductions have been a key driver in Beckman's success and contributed more than 250 basis points to core growth each of the last two years. SCIEX core revenue was up low single digits versus the high single-digit prior year comparison. Performance improved sequentially, with particular strength in the pharmaceutical, food and environmental end markets.","Geographically, core growth in the quarter was led by North America and Asia, which was particularly offset -- which was partially offset by softness in China.","At Pall, the team achieved its second straight year of high single-digit core revenue growth, with nearly 10% core growth in the fourth quarter. Strong momentum in our biotech and aerospace businesses was partially offset by expected weakness in microelectronics.","IDT achieved double-digit core revenue growth, led by synthetic biology and next-generation sequencing product line, where newly launched products are gaining market share. Since joining Danaher in 2018, the IDT team has embraced the Danaher Business System and made excellent progress, both operationally and commercially.","Using DBS growth tools, they've enabled cross-functional teams to collaborate more effectively during the product development process, to improve quality and reduce time to market. With this more focused approach to innovation, IDT has increased their cadence of new product launches and expanded their best-in-class offering to further customers' research across a number of genomic application.","Moving now to Diagnostics. Reported revenue increased 7% in the quarter, with core revenue growth of 8%. Reported operating profit margin was 19.5%, with reported and core operating margins up 70 basis points. Over the last few years, we've made significant strategic investments, both organically and inorganically, to better position our Diagnostics platform and oriented towards higher growth opportunities. We're seeing the impact of these initiatives, as the Diagnostics team delivered 7% core revenue growth in 2019, a continuation of the market share gains we've achieved over the last few years.","Turning to Beckman Diagnostics. While core revenue was up only low single digits in the quarter on a difficult prior year comparison, 2019 was a great year for Beckman, as the team achieved mid single-digit core revenue growth, their best annual core growth rate since we acquired the business in 2011.","China continued to perform well and positive results across all major product lines were led by double-digit growth in automation. We've improved Beckman's growth trajectory over the last few years by focusing on impactful new product development and improved commercial execution.","Our launch of the DxH series of new hematology analyzers has been a key contributor to improvement in core revenue growth. And on the commercial side, our North American sales team's effective implementation of DBS growth rooms has helped drive double-digit gains in our customer retention rate.","Radiometer achieved double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter to close out their 15th consecutive year of mid-single-digit or better core growth, a remarkable achievement. Results were strong across both the developed and high-growth markets, as we believe Radiometer continued to gain share relative to the market.","At Leica Biosystems, double-digit core revenue growth was driven by positive results across all major geographies and product lines. In addition to continued strength in core histology and advanced staining, pathology imaging also had a strong quarter, driven by demand for new products, like the Aperio GT 450. The GT 450 is a new automated high-capacity digital pathology slide scanner that enables extensive biopsy databases to be digitized, making them more accessible for researchers around the world.","Core revenue at Cepheid was up more than 20% for the quarter, with broad-based strength across all major geographies, led by North America and Western Europe. The business surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue in December and we couldn't be happier for the team to hit this major growth milestone. Since the 2016 acquisition, core revenue has compounded annually at a rate of approximately 20%.","The team has done a terrific job incorporating DBS commercial tools and processes, to enhance their go-to-market strategy as well. With an installed base of more than 20,000 instruments and the largest molecular test menu available on the market today, Cepheid is poised to continue taking share in this highly attractive fast-growing space.","Moving now to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 2% with 2.5% core revenue growth. Reported operating margin increased to 25.3% with 265 basis points of core margin expansion.","In product identification, core revenue grew at a low-single-digit rate. At Videojet, core revenue was up low-single-digits but performance accelerated sequentially. Strength in North America and Western Europe was partially offset by softness in the high-growth markets. By end market, consumer products and food and beverage led the way.","Our packaging businesses, which includes Esko and X-Rite was up mid-single digits. We had a particularly good quarter at Esko where growth rate was led by demand for our brand owner software, including BLUE, a business we acquired 18 months ago.","BLUE provides label and artwork management software that enhances Esko's offering in the packaging development and production workflow. As a result, the Esko team is helping customers reduce the time it takes to bring new products to market while improving cost and quality across their packaging value chain.","Finally turning to water quality, core revenue for the quarter increased at a low-single-digit rate. Core revenue at Hach increased low-single-digits. However, the fourth quarter represented the last period of tough prior year comparisons driven by China's surface water monitoring regulation Policy 61.","Excluding the Policy 61 impact, Hach's core revenue increased mid-single-digits for the quarter and full year. Hach has been a consistent mid-single-digit growth business throughout its 20-year tenure as a Danaher operating company. And this success has been largely driven by the team's commitment to solving challenging customer problems through innovative applications and workflow solutions.","One example is the recently launched CL17 FC, Hach's new online chlorine analyzer, which is easy to use and is equipped with Claros, Hach's water intelligence software. This combination of innovative hardware and software solutions helps customers more effectively manage their connected instruments, their processes and data ultimately lowering their operating costs, increasing compliance and reducing risk.","At Trojan core revenue declined in the quarter due to the timing of certain large projects, but the team delivered impressive double-digit core growth for the full year. Trojan's growth acceleration in 2019 was driven by a combination of recent new product launches and commercial initiatives focused on expanding field service capabilities.","And lastly, core revenue at ChemTreat was up mid-single digits with particular strength in the chemical and food and beverage end markets.","So to wrap up, 2019 was an outstanding year for Danaher and marked our 35th anniversary as a company. Over the course of that time, through a combination of organic and inorganic initiatives, we've transformed into a higher-growth higher-margin and higher recurring revenue company.","With a resilient portfolio that's built for the future and the Danaher Business System as our consistent driving force, we feel well positioned to continue to deliver long-term shareholder value. We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1.06 to $1.09. This assumes core revenue growth of 6% to 6.5%, and reflects the impact of three additional selling days versus the first quarter last year.","We're also initiating full year 2020 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.80 to $4.90, which implies double-digit growth year-over-year at the midpoint and as mentioned earlier does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of GE Biopharma.","Matt Gugino","Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Christel, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Matt Gugino","Good morning, Tycho.","Tycho Peterson","Good morning. I'll start with Pall. For life sciences, you had previously baked in a slowdown for the fourth quarter. Obviously that didn't happen. So just curious, if you could talk a little bit about why you thought things might slow why they did not and I guess what's embedded in the guide for Pall Life Sciences going forward? And as we think about kind of capacity supply-demand dynamics and adding GE Biopharma into the portfolio, how are you feeling about the sustainability of the platform of business?","Tom Joyce","Thanks, Tycho. We're really, really very pleased with how Pall performed in the quarter double-digit core growth in the quarter that, I've mentioned was led by biotech and aerospace. And if you sort of break that down and go in specifically into the life science side of Pall, you have double-digit core growth in life sciences. We've talked in the past about single use technologies that certainly was a portion of that growth. Single-use continues to grow at better than 20%. And so I think the combination of just looking at life sciences overall breaking it down into biotech and then looking specifically at that high-growth area of SUT all combined to give us a tremendous amount of confidence both in terms of Pall's positioning in that market, but also the end market strength. And so I think we feel very good about that.","Now, we try to be prudent here early in the year in terms of how we embed different segments of the business into our overall guide. And so I think we sort of look into 2020 and think about the overall biopharma market and our position there is perhaps a little bit more normalized at high single digits in 2020. But overall that's not to suggest that we think this is about a market slowdown or there's any overcapacity issues. It's really about just saying that, hey, this 2019 was a great year. We're probably a little prudent going into the \u2013 into 2020, but this is absolutely a fantastic market to be a part of.","We don't really see any issues relative to what \u2013 as we've been asked about in terms of overcapacity in the market. We continue to track the volumes of individual drugs that are being produced, and that really is the indicator. And we continue to see just tremendous progress both in terms of the drug development pipeline and the volume ramps of individual biopharmaceuticals where essentially we are integrated into the process.","Relative to GE Biopharma that obviously improves our position in the overall market. It gives us broader exposure, specifically to the biopharmaceutical market, large molecules and those more advanced technologies given GE's exceptional position in chromatography. And so we're looking forward to closing that transaction here in the first quarter. And we think, it will be just a tremendous addition to the overall portfolio albeit as a separate standalone operating company distinct from Pall.","Matt McGrew","Hey, Tycho this is Matt. Just to kind of clarify. From a planning assumption perspective for biopharma for this year we're kind of thinking low double digits versus the mid-teens that we saw sort of last year. So just kind of clarify, where we think that will be here.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. That's helpful. And then one follow-up on China up high single digits, can you maybe just talk about what's embedded in guidance for China? And then obviously with coronavirus just curious how you're thinking about that as it relates to particularly for your diagnostics business over there.","Tom Joyce","Sure. It was overall a very good quarter in China Tycho up high single digits in the fourth quarter and that was across all four of the platforms. And we saw high single digits in Dx and that was broad based in terms of the strength that we saw. Within life science, you know, as well as we do there's some policy and regulatory noise around the food and to some extent, the pharma market around four by seven that had some impact on SCIEX. But generally, we expect continued good performance from both of those platforms and both of those markets. Even PID was up high single digits and that was largely Esko and Videojet. And in water quality, I think I commented on ex Policy 61 terrific.","So I think as we look forward in China, we see continued good growth opportunities there. Specific to the coronavirus situation. Obviously, it's a very challenging situation to get a clear handle on in terms of what its overall impact is. We have not seen any specific impact to this point on our business. That was before everyone left for the New Year. And as you know, certain provinces are extending, the Chinese New Year at this point. And that's obviously a little bit of a wildcard here in the first quarter.","So, losing potentially an extra week could have an impact on both sales and the supply chain. But given that it's early in the quarter, we'll be working to offset that certainly, here in the first quarter. And could see some impact moving to second, but we continue to work to offset.","So, we haven't incorporated any of that into any guidance. But it's just too early to tell. We're hoping for the best. We have businesses by the way Tycho that are actively involved in taking on this challenge.","Both Cepheid and IDT are engaged in -- with outside parties on a global basis both public and private, including the CDC to support their efforts -- particularly at CDC supporting the CDC efforts around releasing just in the last couple of days, a panel of two PCR probes and primers that are designed specifically to detect the virus.","So, we are in the fight here, but the impact of this both in terms of the overall Chinese market, our business. And any of our specific businesses it's just far too early to tell.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Joyce","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin, Bank of America.","Tom Joyce","Hi Derik.","Derik De Bruin","Hi.","Tom Joyce","Hey. Good morning.","Derik De Bruin","Hey, Could you sort of talk about the embedded margin assumptions for the business ex-GE right now as sort of what's embedded in the guide? Just sort of want to walk through now that dental is out what you're sort of thinking about the margin expansion and gross margin expansion would be in 2020.","Matt McGrew","Yeah. So kind of embedded \u2013 Derik, its Matt, kind of embedded in our guide here is sort of a 5% core growth which we talked about. And kind of -- the typical 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion on that is sort of how we get to the range $4.80 to $4.90.","Derik De Bruin","Great and the -- when GE comes into that, I mean it's going to -- obviously the margins are higher than that. Would you expect incremental boost to that immediately? I'm just sort of thinking about, sort of how it rolls through.","Matt McGrew","Well, I mean, it's going to roll through. And we talked about the initial accretion and kind of what we updated here today. So, that would have obviously included the fact that that is a higher-margin business than what we have.","So, I think the way to think about that rolling through is it is in that $0.60. And then, as we go forward, we sort of talked about that as this being -- even though it's high-margin business.","I don't think it's going to have much of an impact on our 50 to 75 basis points of core margin expansion every year. Higher-margin businesses tend to, kind of not necessarily have the best margin expansion, at the highest highs then given the VCM and the fall-through they already have.","So, I still think going forward using 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion, even post-GE is the right way to think about it. And you'll capture the uplift in the margin, in that $0.60 if you will in 2020.","Derik De Bruin","Great, and just a quick follow-up to Tycho's question on, the China situation, have you embedded anything into your organic core growth guide for any sort of slowdown in the market at all?","Matt McGrew","At this point, we have not. We kind of -- as Tom said, it's -- we know as much as you guys know and we've sort of kind of -- if everything gets back to normal very quickly here it's still early enough that. We think we'd probably be able to offset that largely. So too early to tell and we have not put anything into either Q1, or the full year at this point.","Derik De Bruin","Great, thanks, I will get back in a queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Hey guys. Congrats on a nice print here. Thanks for taking the question, Tom, maybe one big picture question on the Biopharma, I think, the commentary on the assumptions around 2020 growth low-double digits that was helpful.","In GE, that business has been running double digits in 2019. So I'm just curious your thoughts around the growth of the GE Biopharma assets. And not -- why 6% to 7% is still the right way to think about the outlook for that business?","Tom Joyce","Hey, thanks Vijay. I appreciate the question. You're right. We had an initial planning assumption of 6% to 7% for that business. As I mentioned, in my remarks, they performed better than that, here in 2019.","We just need to get the business closed and we need to get in underneath the covers and really understand at a deeper level kind of the order rate trajectory ,the backlog and those kind of things to make sure that we're comfortable as we go through 2020 at rates higher than our original projection.","So we're excited about getting inside and getting with the team and trying to understand those opportunities. Obviously, if we were closed in the business a year ago and had this visibility that we would normally get to 2019, we would have had a higher view, but we'll need a little time to get inside and see what 2020 ultimately might look like.","Vijay Kumar","That's helpful, Tom. And, Matt, one quick on the guidance. Margin execution shown in Q4 really strong. Was this because core revenues came in better with this volume-related leverage, or -- I'm just curious on what drove margin execution. And when you think about the context of three extra days in Q1, any assumptions on what the contribution is to the top line in Q1 from extra days? Thank you.","Matt McGrew","Sure. Maybe start with the second question first. So from -- I think, the three extra days in Q1 is probably worth -- it's sort of hard to tell. Its inexact science, but I think it's probably 50 to 100 basis points in Q1, would be probably what its worth. And then, kind of, talking to the Q4 fall through, I mean, gross margins were up 50 bps year-over-year, which was helpful.","Price was okay here in the quarter. And the rest was good. It was kind of running the Danaher playbook. SG&A was down. Gross margins are up. And the volume coming through at 6% was a little bit better than we thought and that led to a pretty good finish here to the year with 100 basis points of margin expansion. And I think that's probably the way to think about it.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks, guys.","Tom Joyce","Thanks, Vijay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen.","Tom Joyce","Hi, Doug.","Doug Schenkel","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Tom Joyce","Good morning.","Doug Schenkel","How does the favorable financing outcome -- we knew about, but you described very well in your prepared remarks, how does that impact your flexibility on capital deployment? Specifically, I'm really thinking about M&A, maybe more near-term than we might have thought a quarter or two ago. And related to that, based on your forecasts for free cash flow this year, it appears you can delever to about 3.5 times EBITDA by the end of 2020. Am I doing math the right way there?","Matt McGrew","I mean, it's going to be close to that, I suppose, have -- I mean, yes, I think that's probably a pretty good spot. As far -- I'm sorry, that's on the second question, the free cash flow. As far as any impact, I think, on your first question, does that change in a material way, the interest -- would change in a material way in the near term, I don't think it's going to have a big difference on what we -- how we think about M&A here in the near term.","I think we've talked about, we're still going to be active and in the market for sure. We will probably be focusing more on some of the bolt-on activity in smaller deals. But also, like we've said, if something was of interest and strategically out there for us. We also have talked in the past that, if we had to issue equity, we would. So, I don't think the financing necessarily changes anything in the near-term here.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Thank you for that. In your prepared remarks as well as in the press release, you called out market share gains as a driver of revenue growth. I'm wondering if you'd be willing to elaborate a little bit more on that and maybe be a bit more specific on where this most -- this is most evident, based on what you're seeing recently. And how we should think about the sustainability of these share gains moving forward?","Tom Joyce","Sure. Absolutely. I'd be happy to, Doug. I'll pick a couple of examples, looking across the portfolio. I mentioned in my prepared remarks about some terrific performance at Beckman Life Science. So to give you an example of what's driving the share gains there, if you look at our -- the cadence of new products, we've introduced over 20 new products in the last three years at Beck LS. In the three years pre-acquisition, that business launched three new products. So we've 7x the cadence of new product introductions.","And specifically those are going into higher growth applications like biologics and genomics, obviously, our CytoFLEX product line in flow cytometry and the reagents associated with that, the new automation products and the Biomek series that I've talked about, the Vi-CELL products in particle counting, all those things are really contributing from a new product innovation standpoint to share gains at Beck LS and that's why we're seeing that meaningful step-up in growth at Beck LS, which by the way was virtually a flat growth business when we acquired it.","You know, if I look over at -- in the diagnostics -- a couple of businesses that again are clearly gaining share. You got to look at Cepheid as one really good example and menu expansion continues to be a part of that certainly the menu expansion in flu and strep, but really good commercial execution. Expansion into IDNs our integrated delivery networks has made a big difference. I think if you look at that installed base that we've now grown from 13,000 systems at acquisition to 23,000 in the installed base over 40 major health systems that have been converted, 11 new assays and three point-of-care systems.","I mean these are the things that I think underpin our confidence and our belief in the share gains at a place like Cepheid. If I look at a business that has been with us certainly a lot longer, but where the performance continues to be terrific I talked about the 15th consecutive year of good performance at Radiometer and their share gains. We've seen a 50% increase in blood gas competitive takeaways in 2019 alone. So we track every competitive situation and we can be clear about where we have in fact displaced a competitive instrument. So I think good examples there.","One last one maybe I'll turn over to water quality where Hach has really improved their new product cadence. A lot of terrific products beyond the CL17 that I talked about in my prepared remarks, but a part of what's driven their cadence is they have cut their new product development time by 50% in the last two years. And at the same time, they've driven ideation and improved the nature of what's in the funnel I think substantially. And so again, we track our installed base as we track competitive win rates. And I think those trackers clearly give us confidence in the areas where we're gaining share.","Doug Schenkel","That\u2019s great. Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research.","Matt McGrew","Hi, Steve.","Steve Beuchaw","Good morning, and thanks for the time. Just a couple of easy ones here from me. One is as we go into 2020 and you've laid out the 5% core objective for the broader company pre-GE can you just speak to expectations for growth within the different businesses around that 5%?","Matt McGrew","Sure, Steve. I think maybe the simple kind of at a high level the way to think about it is that we're expecting life sciences and diagnostics both to be kind of in the 5% to 6% range, sort of, versus the high single digits that they were last year. And that EAS is kind of continues in call it the 3% to 4% range.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay. Great. Much appreciated. And then over the course of the year, I wonder if you could speak to a couple of points just within the non-op so we've got our models with many moving parts subsequent to the changes in the last several months and those still coming as tight as we can. I wonder if you could speak to how you would imagine corporate expense plays out over the course of the year relative to that 1Q starting point and maybe relative to 2019.","Matt McGrew","Yes.","Steve Beuchaw","And then I wonder if over the course of the year how you would imagine share count playing out. Of course there have been a lot of moving parts but is where we are for 1Q just a good benchmark for the full year? Thanks so much.","Matt McGrew","Yes. Yes. Sure. No. Lot of moving parts. We appreciate that. So corporate expense Steve I would probably think about $60 million to $65 million per quarter is a good place to start from a modeling perspective. And from a share count perspective in Q1 it's going to be call it 718 million, 719 million shares. I would model in, sort of, kind of our typical share creep of maybe 1 million to 2 million shares a year. And maybe for a full year that 718 million -- call it 720 million 721 million at the end, I think I'd ramp it that way.","Steve Beuchaw","Got it. Just all I needed. Thank you so much.","Matt McGrew","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS.","Dan Brennan","Great. Thanks, everyone.","Matt McGrew","Good morning. ","Dan Brennan","Good morning. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. I was hoping to dig into a little bit on the diagnostic front. Beckman obviously a nice year in 2019. What do you see for 2020 there? Can you comment on some of the competitive launches? And in particular you mentioned a lot of the new product introductions there in hematology for Beckman. Kind of what's on the horizon for Beckman Diagnostics?","Tom Joyce","Sure, Dan. Thanks. As I mentioned in my remarks, we're really pleased with how Beckman performed \u2013 Beck Dx performed in 2019 at a mid-single-digit core growth. And as I think you know, well, that's 100 basis points higher than where we were two years ago. And a number of things have combined here. The new product launches that we've talked about in the last year or so. Automation being one the DxA 5000. We've always had a competitive advantage we believe in the \u2013 in higher volume environments and the DxA 5000 and our automation capability take us, I think to an even more important level.","You mentioned hematology. Hematology the DxH 900 with the early sepsis indicator as well as the 500 series both big upgrades to that product line and those are making a difference without a doubt. And they will continue to be, because it's still early days in terms of the penetration of those new products into the market. So we're expecting as we go forward, we'll continue to see solid mid-single-digit growth from that business. And I think that will come from some of the things I just mentioned, but also I think some important product launches that are in the funnel, closing the menu gaps around infectious disease and blood virus and ensuring that we are architecting the hardware side of the house in a way that positions us well at lower volumes.","Relative to competitive launches, obviously, this is a business where every competitor cycles through new product launches over a five, seven, 10 year period. There have been \u2013 there certainly is \u2013 are one or two out there right now. At this point, we haven't really seen any material impact to us on our retention or our win rates, but it's always a competitive market and we'll be keeping pace in terms of the competitiveness of our product line. And I think some of the things, I've talked about already are what underpin that.","Dan Brennan","Great. And then maybe switching gears over to Pall bio process. Obviously, terrific growth there and you've commented earlier on some of the outlook earlier Tycho's question. I'm just wondering with regards to gene therapy obviously you have nice exposure there as well. But are there any opportunities to maybe expand the portfolio whether internally or externally to kind of capture the expected growth rate in gene therapy? Thank you.","Tom Joyce","Sure. Well, it's certainly early days as you know in gene and cell therapy, and there's a lot going on. And Pall is working very closely with a number of customers in that area. But given the nascent nature of those the development of those therapies right now, it will be a while. It will be measured in years before the impact of that may very well become sort of material to Pall in the aggregate. So, a very exciting space for us one that we think we're really well positioned to support, but one that will take a while to evolve.","Dan Brennan","Excellent. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question was \u2013 your last question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi.","Tom Joyce","Hey, Patrick.","Patrick Donnelly","Hey, Tom. Great. Maybe just one on Cepheid. That's been as you kind of noted a 20% grower since the deal margins obviously moved significantly higher as well. How should we think about that asset going forward? I mean, it seems like there's still significant opportunities. You talked about the menu expansion areas like China, obviously still underpenetrated. I think you guys are still talking about kind of that low double-digit growth. Now that we've been three years here at 20%-plus, what's the right way to think about that one?","Tom Joyce","Thanks, Patrick. It \u2013 when we first acquired Cepheid we were very confident in it sustaining a double-digit core growth rate. And obviously, since that acquisition at 20% better that's been higher than we've expected and it's \u2013 there's a number of factors there a lot of which I think \u2013 a couple of which you might say are somewhat a function of the nature of that business being impacted by flu. We've just come through, I think at least two years in a row here with a particularly strong flu season. We don't bank on that obviously. That's something that we can have a strong season, which is unfortunately for patients and \u2013 but obviously good for that business.","And you can have businesses where \u2013 or a season where that's not the case. And so we tend to be somewhat prudent in terms of how we anticipate those seasonal factors to play out. That said, the growth of that business has been certainly sustained by more than just flu.","The work they've done in expanding the menu. And driving that installed base. The numbers that I quoted earlier have been a big part of that. So, I think you put all that together.","And you say hey! Plan prudently relative to an uplift from something like a flu season, but have confidence that we can sustain that at least a low double-digit growth rate for sure, if not better. And based on the fact that they continue to innovate effectively and have really stepped up their commercial execution.","Patrick Donnelly","That's helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up on Europe, pretty solid mid-single-digit growth there, obviously continue to get some mixed data points around that region. You guys always have a pretty good handle given your diverse exposure.","Can you just talk through the trends you've seen there, expectations into 2020 visibility, would be really helpful.","Tom Joyce","Yeah. I mean, Patrick, we're not a great sort of macro proxy. But relative to our end markets, Europe in some respects has been a pleasant surprise in terms of its being relatively solid in the last couple of quarters.","So, I'm not sure that gives me a lot of optimism, in terms of anything that might improve substantially in Europe right now. But I think it's certainly been a solid market for us.","If you look across how each of our four platforms are performing there, each of them are doing quite well, but it's obviously a little bit weaker than the other parts of the world.","Matt McGrew","Yeah, Patrick maybe just to put some numbers to that, that has been a pretty solid 3% to 4% grower for us for probably six, eight quarters now. And looking forward, I think that's about where we still think it will be.","As Tom said, it's probably not as good as some of our other markets like, China and the U.S. which are more mid-to-high single. But I think that 3% to 4% is a pretty good place to -- sort of been, I think it's sort of where we'll be.","Patrick Donnelly","Got it, great, thanks, Matt, I appreciate it.","Operator","And presenters, that does conclude the allotted time for questions. Do you have any closing remarks?","Tom Joyce","Thanks everyone, for joining us. We're around all day for questions.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Agasta, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Danaher Corporation First Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Matt McGrew, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. McGrew, you may begin your conference.","Matt R. McGrew","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call today are Larry Culp, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Comas, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ","I'd like to point out that our earnings release, a slide presentation supplementing today's call, our first quarter Form 10-Q and the reconciling and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available in the Investors section on our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Financial Information and subheading Quarterly Earnings and will remain available following the call.","The audio portion of the call will be archived in the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Investor Events, and will remain archived until our next quarterly call.

Please refer to the accompanying slide presentation, our earnings release, our first quarter Form 10-Q and other related presentation materials supplementing today's call for additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. All references in these remarks in the accompanying presentation to earnings, revenues and other company-specific financial metrics relate only to the continuing operation of Danaher's businesses, unless otherwise noted.","I'd also like to note that we'll be making some statements during the call that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Larry.","H. Lawrence Culp","Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone. The first quarter progressed largely as anticipated against the highest core growth quarter of last year. Sales from the developed markets grew slightly, with the U.S. again noticeably better than Europe, which declined this quarter. China revenues were essentially flat while the rest of the emerging markets grew at a high single-digits rate. ","Overall, we were encouraged by a number of factors. Both shipment and orders improved sequentially through the quarter. Organic order growth was about 2 points higher than revenue growth as we built backlog across many of our businesses. This was most noticeable in China, where our book to bill exceeded 1.1. ","Also, in a number of markets, sellout by our distribution partners was stronger than our sell-in. We were pleased with the team's execution in the quarter, which led to 85 basis points of year-over-year core operating margin expansion, a 37.5% year-over-year increase in free cash flow and a 19.5% increase in EPS. ","We continue to aggressively invest in new product introductions and go-to-market initiatives. During the quarter, we launched a number of exciting products, a few of which we will highlight through the call today. ","We remain active and optimistic on the M&A front. As you saw last week, we announced the pending acquisition of X-Rite, a global leader in color measurement. Even after closing X-Rite and 3 other deals in the quarter, we expect to have approximately $5 billion of M&A capacity over the next 2 years. ","So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter. Today we reported record first quarter diluted net earnings per share of $0.73, a 19.5% increase as compared to our diluted net EPS last year. Revenues for the quarter increased 31% to $4.3 billion, with core revenues up 1.5%. The impact of acquisitions, primarily the addition of Beckman Coulter, increased revenues by 30.5%, while the negative impact of currency translation reduced sales by about 1 point. ","Our gross margin for the first quarter was 51.8%, a 250-basis point sequential improvement from the fourth quarter. Our operating margin in the first quarter decreased 80 basis points year-over-year to 17%.","DBS continues to be a primary driver of our outstanding cash flow performance. First quarter operating cash flow was $651 million, a 50% increase year-over-year. Free cash flow was $534 million, an increase of 37.5% versus the prior year. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was greater than 100%, inclusive of more than $50 million of incremental year-on-year cash spending related to our fourth quarter 2011 restructuring program.","And finally, our tax rate in the first quarter was 25.3%, which was modestly higher than we had forecast. We expect the rates to be closer to 24% for the balance of the year. ","So now let me turn to the 5 operating segments. To start with Test & Measurement, revenues there -- core revenues increased 2% for the quarter. Core operating margin for the first quarter increased 195 basis points while reported operating margin increased 190 basis points to 22.6%. Overall, our instruments businesses' core revenue declined mid-single digits in the quarter. ","Fluke core revenues were down slightly in the quarter, as growth in the U.S. of our service and installation tools was more than offset by weak demand in Europe and China. During the quarter, we launched the new Ti100 thermal imager platform, designed for industrial and building inspection applications. These imagers feature easy-to-use innovative on-camera tools and plug-and-play connectivity with Fluke's smart new software to collect, edit and analyze thermal images. Initial orders have been quite strong.","Tektronix core sales declined mid-single digits in the quarter with continued softness in Europe and China. In the U.S., we continue to see solid POS, though our sell-in to distribution partners declined year-over-year. We were also encouraged by the sequential improvement we saw in order activity across the business, with book to bill finishing at 1.0 for the quarter, an acceleration from the mid-90s rate last quarter. ","The recent launch of TEK's 70000D Series 33-gigahertz oscilloscope is off to a great start, and our MDO4000 mixed domain oscilloscope continues to gain broad industry recognition as a game-changing technology. In the quarter, the MDO4000 received the prestigious ACE Award and the ultimate product in Test & Measurement systems category, the ninth major award recognizing the innovation at the foundation of the MDO4000.","Core revenues from our communications businesses grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter, led by healthy demand for Tektronix Communications' network management solutions for wireless carriers in North America, as well as our enterprise tools and network security solutions globally. Customers' response to Fluke Networks recently launched OptiView XG and Arbor Networks' Pravail network security system continues to be strong. ","Moving to Environmental. Revenues increased 4% in the quarter with core revenues up 2.5%. The segment core operating margin declined modestly in the first quarter, with reported operating margin decreasing 70 basis points to 18.6%. ","Water Quality core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate while orders were up mid single digits, due in part to solid demand across most industrial verticals. Municipal spending was stronger than anticipated in the U.S. but remains constrained in China, but project funnels are encouraging there. ","Trojan is continuing validation work on its ballast water treatment solution and remains on track to begin shipping systems in earnest later this year. During the quarter, the U.S. Coast Guard issued their highly anticipated Ballast Water Discharge Standard, an important signal to the global community that the U.S. supports international regulation.","ChemTreat continues to outperform based on the strength of their sales footprint and technical capabilities. During the quarter, they had several significant wins including a major U.S.-based manufacturer with over 20 sites. The first quarter marked ChemTreat's seventh straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth, an outstanding achievement. ","Gilbarco's -- Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew low single digits, led by demand for our dispensers, vapor recovery solutions and automatic tank gauges. Our 2010 acquisition of the L&T dispenser business in India has allowed us to significantly expand our localization initiatives in that region. Recently, Gilbarco launched a new dispenser platform designed and manufactured in India. Customer reception has been extremely favorable, helping drive greater than 20% growth in our dispenser business in the quarter.","Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenues for the quarter increased 146.5%, largely due to the addition of Beckman Coulter. Core revenues were up 2% in the quarter. Core operating margin for the segment was up 25 basis points in the first quarter while our reported operating margin decreased 110 basis points from the prior year to 13.3%, largely as result of the Beckman Coulter acquisition. The Diagnostics businesses got off to a solid start to the year with mid single-digit core growth which, as a reminder, does not include Beckman Coulter. ","Radiometer's core sales increased at a high single-digit rate, with broad-based strength across most product categories and geographies. Demand for our ABL80 blood gas analyzer in China was particularly robust, growing more than 20% in the quarter. ","Following last years' regulatory approval, customer adoption of AQT in China has been strong, driven in part by the outstanding value proposition presented for our customers. A large Class 3 hospital in China recently purchased an AQT and informed us that they experienced a 66% improvement in turnaround time for cardiac marker results, which allows the hospitals to perform 2.5x the number of cardiac tests versus their central lab. We're obviously thrilled when we hear that sort of customer feedback from core customers.","Leica Biosystems sales increased at a low single-digit rate, with mid-teens in shipments and order growth for advanced staining. The core histology business was flat in the quarter, largely driven by weakness in Europe. ","Our Life Sciences businesses experienced flat core growth in the quarter. AB SCIEX core sales grew modestly in the quarter. However, orders were up mid-teens, positioning the business well for strong core growth in the upcoming quarters. Mid single-digit revenue growth in the U.S. and emerging markets was largely offset by weakness in Europe. The team continues to do an excellent job on the margin front as core margins were up over 100 basis points in the quarter.","At the Pittcon conference in February, SCIEX debuted several new products, including the 4500 Series of mass spectrometer, the Eksigent 100 series of analytical flow rate liquid chromatography products and a new micro flow rate instrument. The 4500 delivers 10x better sensitivity compared to competitive systems in the same midrange class and is well suited for applications in high-growth applied markets. The 4500 replaces the 4000 series, which is the best-selling mass spectrometer in company history. The 4500 was just named top new product at Pittcon by Instrument Business Outlook.","Leica Microsystems sales were down slightly in the quarter as solid demand in the life science research and industrial markets in North America and the emerging markets was offset by weakness across Europe. ","Beckman Coulter continues to exceed our expectations, as DBS continues to make an impact in many facets of the business. In addition to the progress we've made in terms of quality with the resolution of sodium and glucose, we're also making progress in other customer-facing parts of the business. ","As we implement DBS across Beckman, we've been able to increase our on-time new instruments installations in the U.S. by more than 20% and reduced unscheduled service calls by close to 15% since the closing last June. We've also seen a dramatic decrease in past-due schedule maintenance calls, which will be closed in June, numbered over 2,000 and today are below 200 with the line of sight to an even lower number.","As customers see the progress, the improvements are starting to show up in the numbers. Previously, we talked about improvements in the retention and new win rates in November and December of last year. And the first quarter saw a continuation of those trends, resulting in the second consecutive quarter of positive, though modest, revenue growth. ","Operating margins in the quarter improved over 400 basis points year-over-year and represented the best Q1 performance since 2006. While there's a lot of work ahead, we are happy with what the team has accomplished in the past 9 months. ","Turning to Dental. Segment revenues and core revenues increased 1\/2 of 1% in the first quarter. Reported operating margin increased 200 basis points to 12.7%, reflecting the actions we have taken to accelerate their profitability. ","Dental consumables' core revenues grew slightly in the quarter, led by sales for our orthodontic solutions and infection prevention products across most major geographies. This was largely offset by softness in our general dentistry consumables where we believe our sell-in to distribution partners was less than our sellout. During the quarter, we introduced several new orthodontic products, including the Damon Clear passive self-ligating bracket solution for the lower arch. Customer reaction here has been extremely positive. ","Kerr reached a significant milestone during the quarter with the millionth SonicFill shipment. SonicFill is a first-of-its-kind product that enables clinicians to perform posterior restorations with a fast, easy-to-use and reliable bulk fill technology using a sonic activated handpiece. The technology, developed in conjunction with KaVo team, has been a tremendous success for Kerr and KaVo, exceeding our expectations each step of the way. ","KaVo core revenues increased slightly in the quarter, with growth in imaging and equipment in North America and Europe offset by weakness in instruments globally. During the quarter, KaVo received recognition for its LUX 550 (sic) [ 540 ] LED light, which won the most innovative product in the devices and equipment category as voted on by the recent IDS trade show attendees. ","Moving to our Industrial Technologies segments -- segment, revenues increased 8.5% for the quarter, with core revenues flat. Our core-operating margin declined 20 basis points in the first quarter with our reported operating margin down 150 basis points to 20.6%. Product Identification core revenues grew slightly in the quarter, led by solid global demand for consumables and Videojet's continuous inkjet printers, primarily in Europe and Latin America. ","As I mentioned earlier, last week we announced a merger agreement with X-Rite, headquarters in Grand Rapids, Michigan, X-Rite manufacturers, markets and supports innovative color solutions through measurement systems, software, color standards and services. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the second quarter of this year. ","The acquisition is expected to be dilutive to EPS by approximately $0.03 in 2012 and $0.04 accretive in 2013. We're excited about the strategic opportunities that lie ahead for Esko and X-Rite, and I look forward to sharing more about this opportunity with you in the coming months.","Our Motion businesses' core revenues declined at a high single-digit rate in the quarter, with softness in the industrial automation technology and renewable energy markets across most major geographies. We are encouraged by recent order trends, as this was the second quarter in a row where our book to bill has exceeded 1.0. As a result, we expect to resume growth in the second half of the year.","So to wrap up, the year started largely as we expected. We were particularly please with the team's execution, which led to excellent core operating margin expansion, cash flow and earnings performance and are encouraged by the momentum with which we exited the first quarter. The sequential improvement within the quarter, solid bookings growth and an attractive acquisition environment, we believe, positions us well for the balance of 2012 and beyond. ","We are initiating second quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations guidance of $0.76 to $0.81 for the quarter, which includes approximately $0.01 of anticipated dilution from the pending X-Rite acquisition. The second quarter earnings per share guidance assumes 3% to 5% core revenue growth. We are nearing -- narrowing our full year diluted EPS guidance from $3.20 to $3.35 to $3.25 to $3.35, which includes $0.03 of anticipated dilution from X-Rite.","Matt R. McGrew","Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. Agasta, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Larry, can you fill out the thoughts a little bit on China? You guys have talked about some of the signs you had seen of easing there last -- on the last call. Have you seen things sort of play out through the quarter, and how has that contributed to this overall kind of pickup in orders you've seen through the quarter?","H. Lawrence Culp","Right. Well, I think, Shannon, China was certainly central to a good bit of what we saw improved during the course of the quarter. Our book to bill in China in the first quarter was greater than 1.1. I think that's obviously helpful in terms of our internal metrics. I'd add to that in a number of businesses, Water particularly, we saw strengthening through the quarter in our project funnel, and I think that's part of what gives us the optimism that some of the external data that we see strengthening, like PMI suggested, as we go through the year here, China should get better. So we obviously were pleased with what we saw in China. I wouldn't say by the same token that it was particularly surprising in that regard. And as we look here, I think we'll see strong acceleration in China, and we should see China, I think, in the mid to high single-digit range here straightaway the second quarter.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And you said it was flat in 1Q, right?","H. Lawrence Culp","Correct.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then can you maybe just talk a little bit about the trajectories on TEK instruments versus Motion? So I think TEK was down like mid single digits in the quarter; Motion, high singles. You said TEK is going to improve through the year. I mean, does that go positive already in 2Q? I know Motion doesn't. It stays negative. So can you just talk about, I guess, the different trajectories and improvement in those 2 businesses?","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. I think they will -- both businesses will improve, in part because obviously the comps will get easier in both businesses. And again, I think we're seeing encouraging trends, both with respect to our internal metrics, i.e., bookings, in addition to some of the external data points, be it PMI, NASDAQ, what have you. That said, I think that it's going to take TEK longer to go positive. I think they'll both be challenged here in the second quarter. I suspect we'll see Motion go positive in the second half. It may well be though, Shannon, I think until the fourth quarter that TEK instruments is positive on the core front.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Larry, could you just maybe just give a little bit more color on -- in terms of the full year outlook? Can we -- you gave us, obviously, a lot of detail back in December, but the earnings number have come up by $0.05 at the low end. But in terms of your businesses or geographies, can you just maybe just give a bit more context in terms of what you're seeing right now compared to December?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think that what we said in December, again, I think played out, by and large, as anticipated here in the first quarter. I think that as we look forward here, Nigel, again, I think we are encouraged by a number of the bookings trends that we saw, particularly in the U.S. and the emerging markets. We again saw that spread between the U.S. and Europe. This time about 700 basis points. Obviously, we saw Europe soften a bit. One key point with respect to Europe as we look forward is the second quarter is really the last quarter of last year that we'll be working. Hence, what we saw, a mid single-digit growth. So the European comparisons get a little easier, but we're not anticipating any rebound in the underlying market conditions in Europe. That said, I think the U.S. book-to-bill numbers, the sellout -- the sell-in\/sellout dynamics, our funnels and the like give us optimism that barring some change in the macro scene, the U.S. will continue to be good and strong for us. If we look at emerging markets x China, we're very pleased with what we saw in the first quarter. We were up high single digits. And again, if that holds as we would suspect it will, that, in combination with improving China, gives us more tailwind out of the emerging markets than we've seen here in the last couple of quarters. So I think all-in, we certainly have a number of dynamics that we're working through. We talked to TEK. We talked to Motion a moment ago. But on balance, with what we've seen in Life Sciences & Diagnostics, very encouraged there. I think when you look at Product Identification, there as well encouraging outlook. Environmental, both within Water and at GVR, I think it's going to be getting better as we go through the year. So barring some sort of cataclysmic macro change, we think we're going to continue to see the acceleration we talked about with you in New York in December.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then the sell-in versus sellout dynamics, have we seen that channel destocking? Would you characterize that as now largely complete, or are you still seeing some pressure there?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think that where we saw it, Nigel, probably most pronounced in T&M and in Dental. I would say that it probably, by and large, has run its course, but I wouldn't want to speak for the network distribution partners that we have around the world. I think a number of them, despite good, healthy sell-through in the first quarter, continue to take a conservative posture. That's -- we're going to play the long game here and work with them to make sure they are stocked with products that they need and that we're both generating demand in the marketplace. But in terms of that continuing at the rate that it has here of late, I would find it -- I find that unlikely to be the case.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one more, if I may. Environmental margins were down year-over-year. Could you just maybe just talk about that? Was that mainly mix?","Daniel L. Comas","Nigel, it's a little bit of mix. But it was really more investment. They had a nice step-up. I mean, overall, across the segment, good step-up in year-on-year gross margin percentage. We have stepped up some investment there. Obviously, the ballast water is part of that as well. The margins were obviously relatively flat year-on-year, but a lot of that was driven by increased investment.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Does that continue through the year?","Daniel L. Comas","You'll see some improvement, in part because we expect growth -- better core growth through the balance of the year, but that step-up investment will continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray of Citi.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On X-Rite, I was hoping you could walk through the value proposition of this business, both from the color brand management but also a bit more on the technologies. If I'm not mistaken, there's some overlaps with, of all businesses, Hach, in the photo spectrometer side.","H. Lawrence Culp","Deane, you're absolutely right. We actually -- we're once in the color business back in the old days with Dr. Lange. Both Lange and Hach used similar spectrophotometric technology to glean the end [ph] results that their instruments produced. So it's a space that we know for a long time. I think that with X-Rite -- or excuse me, with Esko, our perspective on X-Rite really evolved from it being an attractive opportunity won that just made a ton of sense. It was the #1 company atop the Esko funnel. I think from a value perspective for shareholders, I think we'd say that this is an attractive $600 million adjacency to what we do within Product Identification, good underlying growth. I think the company clearly is the market leader here. They have a strong 3 to 4x share lead on competition. Two great brands in both X-Rite and Pantone. I think you see all that play out both in the 60% gross margins and the 20% operating margins. And I think the deal economics are such that we should hit that double-digit return within 3 years, probably do better than that as we have at Esko. So in terms of the space, the company, the deal, we like that. What X-Rite enables us to do is basically help brand managers throughout their entire supply chain, from the time they conceive the packaging for a new soda or a new tube of toothpaste all the way until that packaging is manufactured and sent into the distribution network, to not only manage the packaging of thoughtfully only in a digital frame, but now add to that the key element of color management. So whether you talk to a Unilever, a Proctor, a Coke, they see this as a fundamental challenge and opportunity in their business, not only with respect to cost savings but often have literally scores of versions of a white, a red, a yellow, but also the complexity as their businesses have globalized in keeping those brands' standards up to the global standard. So we're off to a great start with Esko. As you well know, this has been a -- this is a strong grower for us from the get-go, and I think the opportunity to partner with X-Rite is going to be another good addition to Danaher, but also turbo charge what we're doing in Product ID going forward.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then over on the tool side, for Apex Tools, can you comment on operating results? And I know you have to be a bit guarded in how you comment on the -- both the timing, but are you thinking about the opportunities to monetize this asset, and what might the timing be?","Daniel L. Comas","Deane, this is Dan. Off to a good start there. The combined business posted the best-ever gross margins in their history, even on a kind of pro forma basis, very good operating margins as well and actually a little bit slow here in Europe, but continued good progress in the emerging markets. We're not going to comment on external rumors. I think we said from the start, we wanted to -- the teams really get after a lot of the cost savings and the go-to-market opportunities that, that continues, and we'll see what happens over time.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But -- is it fair to say that the whole thesis of putting these 2 businesses together is playing out at or above plan?","Daniel L. Comas","I think we and Cooper could not be happy with the team's execution and the benefit we thought we will achieve by putting the units together.","H. Lawrence Culp","And they've been a very constructive partner, Deane.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Wood of Jefferies.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So, Larry, can you just give a bit more color on Beckman? Obviously you had some modest growth there, better than the flat you talked about. Can you parse out kind of the core chemistry in immunoassay businesses from the life science's piece? And any expectation on a troponin refiling or change in expectation? We'd love to hear an update there.","H. Lawrence Culp","Jon, let me try to cover a number of those bases. I think we couldn't be happier, just as a headline, with where we are. As you point out from a performance perspective, the top line is improving, there's no doubt about it. That is in part a function of, I think, what we're doing on the quality and the service front. I'll come to that in a moment. But obviously, we're also seeing, I think, excellent progress on the cost side. The -- in terms of the core, we were at a low single-digit growth number. We were not flat. We'll take that as encouragement. That's 2 quarters in a row now. I think the underlying dynamic there really is in and around the retention and the win rates, which continue to improve. What we saw back last year continued through the course of the first quarter. We were up, I think, on a retention-rate basis of about 700 basis points, say, the last 5 months versus the preceding 5 months. So good traction there just for a whole host of different reasons. The win rates are improving as well. So if you think about that as a trajectory, I think we're -- we couldn't be more pleased with the recovery in the marketplace and in turn, so there is a lag effect to growth in the business. On the cost side, we were really pleased with the way the first quarter played out. If you go back in time, you really have to go back to '06 to see them at 16% at the operating level. That's more than 400 basis points from where we were a year ago. Lots of things coming in as we had anticipated. I think from an integration perspective, the reception to Danaher DBS continues to be thoughtful, strong, just -- as good as it could be. You talked about the Diagnostics and Life Science split. We have split the businesses, as you know, organizationally. We will be -- once we're in the core growth reporting mode, we will report those businesses separately. But to your question as to how the core growth splits, both Dx and Life Sciences were, in essence, both at that low single-digit rate. The organizational evolution is part of that; integration continues. We brought on a new Chief Medical Officer, an important and critical hire. There are a number of other things that we're doing lower down in the organizational chart now that I think bodes well for the future. And you asked about troponin, on the quality and service front, I think we continue to see DBS changing the way that we are doing the work there. Quality clearly is job one. Very pleased with some of the other assays that I mentioned in the prepared remarks that have been cleared, sodium and glucose. Troponin has been slightly slower, but the results have been steady. The progress good. And I would expect that while we're not going to try to provide a realtime update on these filings going forward, we should be in a good place on troponin very soon.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right, very comprehensive.","H. Lawrence Culp","Services also, Jon, just if I can just add one final point. What we're doing on the service side, you heard some of the data around: installation performance up 20% from a year ago; unscheduled service calls down 15%; a 90% reduction in past-due maintenance calls. These are all sorts of things that most Danaher businesses take for granted. Huge opportunity for us to possibly impact customers in Beckman by way of DBS. So all in all, a long way still to go here. But 9 months in, we're thrilled.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right, great. That was very comprehensive. My follow-up just quickly on SCIEX. Did -- up modestly but bookings up mid-teens. How impactful was the introduction of the 4500 intra-quarter? Meaning, did it impact the shipments of kind of that legacy system? And was that the primary driver to the booking strength kind of in the, say -- let's call it, the second half of March? Or did that not -- did you not start to book actual business from the 4500 in the quarter?","H. Lawrence Culp","Jon, the introduction of the 4500, while exciting, really isn't a material part of that dynamic. I would say that really what we saw was strengthening in the order books at SCIEX through the course of the quarter. Timing's part of the reason you see that book shift delta that we highlighted. And obviously, with a bookings quarter like that in the double digits, it gives us a lot of optimism on top of what we introduced at Pittcon. And hopefully, we've got a few things to show at ASMS that as we go through the year, we should continue to see AB SCIEX be an important growth driver for the segment and for the corporation.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You guys mentioned automation being weak. You kind of called it out. You don't usually do that in the 10-Q. Could you maybe just give us a little bit of color geographically, and how bad was it in the quarter for Motion?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think that automation -- remember, the machine builders that we service at Motion, both at Kollmorgen and Thomson, have seen build rates in some of the verticals that we serve as we highlighted, Steve, slow. I think the build rates are clearly what's impacting our growth in those segments currently -- or in that segment -- those businesses currently. I think we are heartened by the strengthening in the order book, in the book to bill. But as you well know, that's going to really be a second half positive sector on our core growth in those businesses. So I wouldn't say that it was horrible or disaster, anything like that. But I think coupled with some of the softness that we've seen in China, particularly in some of the clean tech verticals there, that combination had Motion down in the quarter as we described.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. But that automation stuff, that's separate from the technology you called out. They seem like 2 separate kind of discrete end markets you were talking about.","H. Lawrence Culp","That's correct.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then the -- just the China pickup. I mean, is this -- it seems kind of interesting that it's -- it kind of turns on a dime here. I mean, you see one good kind of month of lending come out of China. I mean, do you find it kind of strange that the translation from what you see in kind of the macro data converts that quickly to orders, or is there something different going on there? Is it really kind of a loosening, or is it just end of destocking? It just seems to kind of have turned on a dime for you at the end of the quarter, from flat to up 8.","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. I'm not sure I would characterize China turning on a dime here at quarter's end. We certainly saw slowing through the second half, anticipated a slow but improving start to the year, and I think that's, on balance, what we saw. I think that we would have anticipated in a few places, frankly, the business to have done a little bit better. If I look at Water, for example, encouraged by the funnel build here, but we were down in China in the year or in the quarter against what was not a particularly strong comp. We talked to Motion. That's an important dynamic for us in the quarter in China as well, as is Tektronix.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sure. But I guess but flat to up high single digits in the second quarter seems like a pretty significant turn.","Daniel L. Comas","It is, but part of that is just the calendar. A lot of what -- a lot of the improvement we're expecting in Q2, we booked in March. So I mean, our order growth rate was much better than our shipment growth rate in China in the first quarter. So we go in with a fair amount of backlog. So -- yet, from a shipment perspective, we're thinking flat to maybe mid to high single. But from an order perspective, it's gotten better but that trajectory not quite as steep, if that makes sense.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And then just one more quick question. If I do the math on a 3% to 5% organic in the second quarter, I'm getting to something like a 20% incremental margin to get to your EPS numbers. Am I missing something there? And that's x dilution. I've kind of pulled that out. So is there some reason why the incrementals are to going to be -- core incrementals are going to be weaker in the second quarter?","Daniel L. Comas","Steve, I'd have to look at -- I'd look at that. I'd be -- I don't think I'd be surprised if it's that low. And there could be some -- I don't know if there's any acquisition noise in there. There may be again -- some with X-Rite. But I would expect to be more in the 30s, but I'd be happy to look at that with you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Davis of Barclays Capital.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Guys, I want to get a sense, your long-term core growth rate has always been -- your target at least has been 5% plus. And I went back and looked at the average. I think since '99, it averages kind of 3.1%. Since the last 5 or 6 years, it's 3.5%. I mean, how much should we care about this? I mean, DBS obviously helps a lot of margins, but it doesn't seem to be doing much on core growth. I mean, it's -- you spent a fair amount on R&D. I mean, is this something that becomes an increasing focus as time goes on or just the nature of kind of your business model? You have to bring in assets like Beckman and kind of slow down growth to fix things, and that's just kind of what we should expect is this 3% to 4% rather than a 5% to 6% or something. How do you think about that?","H. Lawrence Culp","Scott, I would, for one, not accept and wouldn't allow anyone on the payroll to accept 3% to 4% core growth through the cycle on a core basis for this portfolio. I mean, we certainly have -- I think, as you look across the business stem to stern, a strong set of businesses. Clearly, new businesses are going to come in. They're not going to be performing at a peak level. But that said, I think we're a mid single-digit-plus grower through the cycle with the businesses that we have. And anything we bring in will be brought in to strengthen our ability to grow, let alone generate margin expansion returns for shareholders. So I would argue that DBS has positive impact on business top and bottom line, on the balance sheet as well. This is a quarter perhaps with the headline number, though it being, I think, what we had talked about for some time, working against the highest growth quarter from a year ago, it's not a headline we relish putting out there. But that said, I think as we look at the underlying trends of the businesses, whether we look at book to bill and backlogs, whether we look at how we're performing in our markets, some of these issues around the channel dynamics at the start of the year, I think we feel very good about the acceleration that we talked about. The comps do get easier. That's an element to be sure. But there's no reason you should lower your expectations. I'm not lowering my expectations with respect to what we can do through the cycle.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No, that's a very fair answer. Just getting back to your point on the sell-in versus the sellout. It seems like kind of a common theme in this call that your distributors were taking down some inventory. But what if -- why was that exactly? I mean, is it product cycle? Is it -- it was just kind of timing? I mean, how -- what's the common theme there?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think that they're -- I think it's hard to characterize what we saw, Scott, in 2 very different markets, T&M on one hand, Dental in another, with 2 or 3 truly common denominators. I think that said, we saw, I think, in a number of places at the end of last year, despite good sellout, a cautious position on inventory on the part of a number of our partners, all managed businesses, that carried into this year, again, despite some of the strength that we were seeing at that counter and elsewhere on a sell-through basis. I think that corrects itself. It has to. So I'm heartened by the sell-through. The inventory adjustments that we've taken in the short-term perhaps created a little pressure. But I think you take the long view here, we want to be working with partners who are growing at or above market. We want to be their core or their key supply partners, and I think we're in that position. Again, part of the rationale, part of the logic that gives us the confidence to say as we move forward here, we'll benefit from that pickup at that readjustment, if you will, on the top line.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So just as a quick follow-up, Larry. I mean, when you think about the evolution of Danaher over time, I mean, does it become more important that you compensate managers for core growth kind of going forward given the size of the asset base you have now or not? I mean, I -- not knowing exactly how you compensate everybody. But when you think about it, does that become a greater emphasis over time that, \"Hey, look. This is -- these are the assets we have, and we need to grow them. We need to gain share. We need to grow them, and 4% aren't going to get it done.\" So how do you compensate people to kind of do that, to accelerate that?","H. Lawrence Culp","Scott, big important topic. Let me simply say this. Yes, we have been increasing the weighting of core in our comps gains. And we'll continue to do that, not because we want to be a 5% to 7% versus the 4% to 5%. But the fact of the matter is, these businesses that are part of the Danaher portfolio, the bets that we have made are growth businesses and growth markets, right. So this is not a Danaher of a different time where some might reflect was simply a margin play. I don't think it was true then, but it's certainly not the case today. And we need to make sure that we are growing these businesses in order to perpetuate the leadership positions that they enjoy in their markets. If their market share as good as we think and the businesses are strong and get stronger, we should be delivering numbers more in line with what, I think, your expectations are pretty much in line with my own.","Operator","We'll go next to Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Larry, can you just maybe start with the math on the $5 billion, given about almost $3 billion of cash, free cash flow, that you're looking at? How are you -- just walk me through me the math on why it's not a bigger number at this point.","Daniel L. Comas","Well, I think we talked about at least capacity of at least $5 billion. That's on top of X-Rite, which is at over $600 million. So that's roughly 2 years of current cash flow, and the math is not any more complicated than that.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And in terms of your willingness to borrow or drive the balance sheet any harder, I mean, we obviously -- you see that in select situations. Have you -- has your thinking changed on that front at all?","Daniel L. Comas","Well, I mean, clearly, we've gotten bigger. Our cash flow has gotten larger. Our ability to borrow more under our current credit rating increases, and we would expect that to continue.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then back to the core growth question. Just a couple. One clarification. If I just comped on number of days versus a year ago, was that taking off about 1.5% or 1% or 1.5% in terms of how you think about the core growth numbers you just put up?","Daniel L. Comas","Steve, we had the same number of shipping days, both Q1.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So no impact on that front.","Daniel L. Comas","That's right.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then the NPVI number is still hovering 29%, right, or around high 20s?","H. Lawrence Culp","You're talking about vitality new products kind of sales?","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes. And I guess the question there is what -- if you think about this over time as indicative, we're going through quarter after quarter of constant drumbeat of new product introductions. That as year by year goes by, we're -- I'm expecting to see those start to gain a lot more traction. Is that -- are you -- what -- how do you think about that number? And I'm looking for other ways to think about core growth and traction on that from DBS, et cetera, to some of the earlier comments made, and wondering if that's not a decent way to think about it.","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think it's one important piece of the puzzle, Steve. But I think there are a whole host of factors, innovation, new products is one. Obviously the success of what we do from a sales marketing and service perspective, another. And what we're able to do out of the factory in terms of quality delivery is a third. That are parts of that mosaic that we are executing well on the right things could allow us to grow at or above market rates. So I wouldn't want to get too fixated on any one input in that regard. I really do think it takes a broad integrated effort to drive the share gains that we see at a place like Videojet or ChemTreat that we've seen over the last several years.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And you think 30% is roughly the right number? Or are you not sort of -- even though it's only one metric as you mentioned, you're not sort of thinking that, that thing should be 35% to 40%?","H. Lawrence Culp","I think I we would always like to take numbers like those that you believe in your gut are correlated with growth and share up. But that number -- the right number for certain businesses will be higher than it will be for others, right. You take a business like Leica Micro or Tektronix where product life cycles are a little shorter, maybe the competitive intensity is a bit more than we might see elsewhere, they need to be at a higher number. Likewise, if you look at some of, say, the Water businesses, be it Hach Lange with a high consumable stream or ChemTreat, the new product or the vitality ratio there is not likely to be that high, in part just because of the way you do the math, if you're being honest about it. Obviously, we would be. So I think we try to calibrate those sorts of metrics business by business. So the -- no one business goes off chasing a corporate mandate or trying to clear a corporate bar that isn't appropriate to the context of the market they compete in.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","A lot of ground covered. Let me just be quick, 1 or 2 items. U.S. muni, Larry, can you give a little more color on what you're seeing there? And is this kind of -- there's some random projects that have started to hit, or are you actually seeing -- ground swell's maybe too strong a word, but some true pickup on underlying activity?","H. Lawrence Culp","Jeff, I would say it's more underlying activity than big projects per se being let. So we will see that most positively at Hach, again because that's more of a razor blade's model as you know there. Conversely, that will pinch us a bit over time at Trojan as those big projects are slowing.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And your visibility on China muni, I think you said orders picking up. You have pretty good visibility on when those actually get let and move forward, or is it still just kind of order activity and pipeline building?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I would say that we have good visibility there, Jeff, with respect to projects. Again, given the selling cycle, given the way the municipalities plan these efforts and when initial planning commences compared to when we actually ship product, there's a good -- there's a bit of time there. The challenge is really applying historical practice and trends to that funnel and trying to anticipate when orders will be let. I think through the back half of last year and even here early in the year, we've just seen certain projects get pushed a bit more than we would have anticipated, more than we have seen historically. So I think that's why we're particularly heartened with the book to bill there. So we're seeing these funnels improve. That's good. Seeing a north of one of book to bill, even better. So that's the way I would describe it. It's certainly better visibility than we have in some other businesses, but it's been a little noisy, say, in the last 6 to 9 months.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And then just finally, maybe for Dan. Price play any role in the organic growth number this quarter?","Daniel L. Comas","There's a little bit over half a point. Q1 is often a little bit light for us in price. I think that will get a little bit better. Again, we're getting pretty good price on consumables, though it's relatively flat on equipment and instruments.","Operator","We'll go next to Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Just a couple of quick ones. First is just a clarification. Larry, you gave organic growth or kind of core growth expectations for 2Q. And I may have missed it, but for the full year, there's no change to your core growth outlook. Is that right?","Daniel L. Comas","That's right.","H. Lawrence Culp","That's right, Jon.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, Larry, if I think about Europe, all of the danger that Europe is not one country, right, but if I look at Europe, I'd say it's a little -- if I see the results coming out of your business, it's not exactly what I would expect, things like SCIEX and Leica Microsystems down, PID up. Can you maybe just talk about what's -- what you see happening in Europe and maybe how that's trended over the last few months, just given everything that we read in here over there and maybe your interpretation of what's happening?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I was in Europe this week. I'm not sure that having been there recently gives me any truly unique perspective, Jon. I think things are simply sluggish in a whole host of places. We can, I think, understand what happened at Leica and SCIEX again. While softening, we are heartened by some of the leading indicators. But that said, probably the best thing we have going for us right now in Europe is the simple fact that the comparisons get easier as we get into the second half. We say goodbye to these mid single-digit growth quarters that we saw last year, and that will help what we print. But while we're not, I think, unduly pessimistic about Europe, I don\u2019t think we harbor any illusions about the underlying economy, particularly in those places where it's soft, bouncing back dramatically as we go through 2012.","Daniel L. Comas","And, Jon, as you point out, it's not soft across the board. We were talking about the muni business and the Water business in the U.S. Actually, we had a good first quarter in our municipal business in Europe. You mentioned Videojet, still decent growth, Radiometer as well. So we still have some key businesses that are performing reasonably well in Europe. So it's not soft everywhere.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So outside of just broadly, you said being sluggish, it's not like you can look over the last 3 or 4 months trends in any particular businesses or orders that are going on that you can draw some conclusion about. You just kind of expect broadly sluggish just across all the businesses.","Daniel L. Comas","Q1 played out very much as we expected, which is consistent sequentially from Q4 kind of the normal seasonality. Some business is soft and some businesses still posting pretty good numbers.","H. Lawrence Culp","But, Jon, to Dan's point, I mean, rest assured, from an operating perspective, whether you cut it by company, whether you cut it by country, it doesn't mean those teams all get to take a pass on '12, right. There are countries where we see particular businesses, Dan highlighted a few good examples, where there are opportunities we should be able to grow. And at a minimum, you're always able to grab share. But when you roll it all up, obviously, Europe is going to be the challenge for us from a geographic perspective this year.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just, if I can, quickly on Dental. For first quarter, it looks like all-time high margins and pretty good improvement year-over-year. Is that just -- I know you've been focusing on that. Is that sustainable where we're at or there are some particular onetime items in the quarter? How do you think about the margins there?","Daniel L. Comas","They were not -- Jon, they were not onetime items. We got off to a very good start. We had a very good Q4 that was masked from a reporting perspective because of all the restructuring we did. I just saw that play out nicely in the first quarter and if you look at that segment and you would add back the amortization, we actually grew up from an operating -- through operating profit perspective, we're north of 15% in the quarter. So off to a good start and think we can sustain that.","Operator","We have time for one more question. That will come from Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And congrats on the X-Rite acquisition. I think that is going to look very good on Videojet and Esko. Just in terms of the Test & Measurement business, and I guess when I look at the distribution channel itself, are you very comfortable that there's no share gain or loss going on in the distribution channel on the instrument side of Test & Measurement, in particular at TEK, given this -- the sell-in is lower than the sell-through? And Dental, I would think you'd have a better perspective given the channel there is more concentrated, more consolidated. But are you comfortable that there's no share gains or losses in the channel on the instrument side in T&M?","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. I think if we look at T&M, and when we talk about this dynamic, we're talking about both Fluke and TEK, you're going to have puts and takes in any one month, any one quarter. But I think if we look at the last year or 2 in those businesses, I don't see it. I know some others may suggest otherwise. But I think if we look at those businesses, particularly with the new product momentum that we think we'll generate going through the year, what we're doing to generate brand preference, let alone broad end-user demand, we're doing good work there. And I think as we go through the year, again, barring change in the macro environment, that will present itself more than it has here in the first quarter in our top line numbers. And I think in Dental, the same dynamic applies. I didn't mean to leave them out.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","No, that's fine. And then also just within the T&M business and the instrument piece, is it fair to say -- is the tone of business and the book to bill, was it greater than one in China, and the tone of business strong -- or kind of maybe turning in China versus Europe? Have we seen the bottom in the T&M side?","H. Lawrence Culp","I'm sorry, Rick. You're talking about the T&M in China, have we seen bottom?","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Within the instrument businesses, within the T&M business, so really Tektronix and Fluke. Are we -- have we seen the bottom in Europe? And conversely, is the tone of business turned in China? I'm just trying to distinguish between geographies there?","Daniel L. Comas","Rick, overall, our book to bill was nicely north of one for instrument in the first quarter. I'm not sure I have that broken down geographically. It's obviously encouraging given we had a sub-one in the fourth quarter, to see that go north of one in the first quarter is a good sign.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just, Dan, real quickly. Just one question on CapEx. CapEx in the quarter looked significantly high. Does that back off this year or is that a good numbering?","Daniel L. Comas","That's really the dynamic of Beckman and the leasing model.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I see, okay. Okay. So as we see growth there, that number will spike up some?","Daniel L. Comas","Yes.","Operator","And Mr. McGrew, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Matt R. McGrew","Thanks for joining us, everybody.

Lawrence Culp","Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, better-than-anticipated core revenue growth and outstanding execution from our team led to strong earnings margin and cash flow performance. Core revenue growth of 2.5% was slightly higher than expected, led by Hach, Gilbarco, Beckman Coulter Diagnostics and our Life Sciences platform, all of which were up mid-single-digits.","Investments we've made in innovation and go-to-market initiatives in the high-growth markets continue to drive growth and help us capture market share. The impact of the Danaher Business System and the quality of this growth were evident in the excellent year-over-year margin improvement in the quarter. Our gross margin improved by $140 million or 100 basis points and our core operating margin expanded 95 basis points. As we look to the second half, we intend to make additional investments aimed at share gains and margin expansion for 2014 and beyond.","So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter. Today, we reported second quarter diluted net earnings per share of $0.87, a 3.5% increase compared to our diluted net earnings per share a year ago and representing another record quarter for Danaher. Excluding a $0.03 gain recognized in the prior year period, adjusted net earnings per share increased 7.5% year-over-year.","Revenues increased 4% to $4.7 billion with core revenues up 2.5%. The impact of acquisitions increased revenues by 2%, while the negative impact of currency translation reduced sales by 0.5%.","From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets grew high single-digits. In particular, we saw sequential improvements in Brazil and the Middle East, as each region was up more than 15% year-on-year. China saw low double-digit growth in the second quarter, led by our Life Sciences & Diagnostics and Dental segments, which grew in excess of 20%. In addition, our Water Quality platform in China grew at a double-digit rate for the second quarter in a row. Developed markets were up slightly with the U.S. and Japan up low single-digits and Western Europe down low single-digits.","Our gross margin increased 100 basis points year-over-year to 52.7%, driven by both volume increases and prior year-over-year productivity improvements. This significant improvement has allowed us to increase our growth investments while still delivering excellent bottom line results. Our reported operating margin in the second quarter was essentially flat at 17.8% while core operating margin improved 95 basis points.","The Danaher Business System continued to serve us well, helping to generate yet another quarter of solid cash flow performance. Second quarter operating cash flow was $899 million and free cash flow was $763 million. Our free cash to net income conversion ratio for the second quarter was 124%.","We continue to find attractive bolt-on opportunities and closed over $300 million of acquisitions in the quarter, focused in our Environmental and Life Sciences & Diagnostics segments. Given our healthy balance sheet, we have more than $8 billion of potential M&A capacity available through 2014 to expand and strengthen our strategic growth platforms.","Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement core revenues increased 0.5%. Core operating margin decreased 30 basis points while our reported operating margin declined 60 basis points to 20.9%. In our instruments platform, core revenues declined low single-digits. Fluke's core revenues were flat with 10% growth in high-growth markets, offset by weak demand in most developed markets. However, we are encouraged by the mid-single-digit growth we saw in North American industrial instruments during the quarter.","At Tektronix, core revenues declined low single-digits with growth rates in both developed and high-growth markets improving sequentially from the first quarter. Core revenues for our Communications platform grew low single-digits, led by strength in the high-growth markets, specifically the Middle East and Latin America. Across the platform, we've increased our R&D spending by approximately 15% year-to-date, focusing our new product development and innovation to address the expanding needs of our wireless and enterprise customers.","At Fluke Networks, we unveiled the new product Versiv product family designed for copper and fiber certification during network installation. The DSX-5000 CableAnalyzer gives field technicians unmatched speed and efficiency in certifying performance in copper cables while the CertiFiber Pro provides the same certification capability for fiber networks.","In Arbor Networks, demand for network security solutions remains very strong across all major geographies. During the quarter, we added over 50 new customers in both the enterprise and service provider markets, which include significant expansion orders at 2 large global financial institutions. As a testament to Arbor's innovation and leadership in network security, they were recently named the Best Overall Security Company during the Info Products Guide Awards at the RSA Conference.","Turning to our Environmental segment. Revenues increased 8% in the quarter with core revenues increasing 4%. The segment core operating margin increased 70 basis points with reported operating margin essentially flat due primarily to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Our Water Quality platform core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate. Hach grew mid-single-digits, driven by core lab and process instrumentation and mid-teens growth in service. We believe we are growing faster than the market. Geographically, the U.S. was up mid-single-digits in the quarter while China grew double-digits, driven by solid demand for drinking water projects.","During the quarter, we launched several new products, including a value line of electrochem products designed to specifically for China. We also unveiled the 5500sc Silica Analyzer, which features predictive diagnostic software, allowing customers to avoid unplanned downtime caused by silica buildup on boilers and turbines in power gen stations.","Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew mid-single-digits, led by healthy demand across all major product lines in most major geographies. Sales in Asia and the Middle East were particularly robust, driven by large customer site upgrades for dispensers and payment solutions. We believe we are gaining share with our point-of-sale and payment products, both of which grew at mid-teens rates in the quarter. GVR recently completed the previously announced acquisition of Automated Fuel Systems Group, a leading provider of fuel management solutions to government, fleet and mining customers in South Africa.","Moving over to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenues increased 5.5% with core revenues up 5%. We saw outstanding margin performance with our core operating margin improving 180 basis points and our reported operating margin increasing 130 basis points to 14.4%. This strong margin performance occurred even with a double-digit increase in R&D expenses at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, where we continue to ramp up our product development efforts. The diagnostics platform continued their solid performance with mid-single-digit core growth in the quarter.","At Beckman, core sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate with growth in all major product categories. This quarter marks the second anniversary of the Beckman Coulter acquisition, and we are exceptionally pleased with the progress that's been made by the team around the world. We've seen low single-digit core growth or better for the last 5 quarters and the business is becoming more competitive each day. Over the last 8 quarters, we've made significant improvements in our internal capabilities, specifically addressing on-time delivery, service and product quality through improved design to ensure that we're serving our customers well. We've also made tremendous progress to enhance efficiency with second quarter operating margin expanding 150 basis points year-over-year.","We've also made considerable progress on the regulatory front. For example, we recently received FDA 510(k) clearance for the troponin assay for use on our Access 2 system. This approval allows Beckman to offer troponin to new customers in the U.S. for the first time since 2010 and marks an important milestone for our customers, as well as the Beckman Coulter team. As Beckman enters its third year with Danaher, we are actively increasing growth investments in business, particularly in R&D, to boost new products vitality and ultimately, drive higher organic growth rates.","At Radiometer, core sales were up at a high single-digit rate with growth in all major product lines. High-growth markets were up more than 20% in the quarter, led by China, which grew about 45%. Instrument placements were particularly strong in the quarter with blood gas up 25% and AQT up over 50%. As previously announced, Radiometer closed the acquisition of HemoCue, a leader in hemoglobin and glucose point-of-care testing.","At Leica Biosystems, sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led advanced staining, which is up low-teens in the quarter. Most major geographies saw growth with particular strength in China, which grew at a high-teens rate. Further, our core histology business grew low single-digits year-over-year. And we are pleased to report that Leica Biosystems can be found in 100% of the top 50 cancer centers in America as recently ranked by U.S. News & World Report. Subsequent to quarter end, Leica Biosystems acquired Amsterdam-based Kreatech Diagnostics. Along with Leica's advanced staining instruments, Kreatech's probes and reagents enable customers to detect genetic aberrations that may lead to cancer and other diseases.","Our Life Sciences platform core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter. AB SCIEX core revenues were up mid-single-digits, led by robust growth in pharma and the applied markets, particularly food and environmental. The 6500, our high-end Triple Quad platform, continues to be very well received by customers globally in all major market segments and is expected to generate more than $100 million in revenue on an annualized basis. AB SCIEX recently launched its 3200MD CE-IVD series of mass spectrometers for clinical diagnostic use in Europe. This is an exciting achievement for AB SCIEX as the 3200MD expands their addressable market to include clinical care customers. And we look forward to leveraging channel synergies with our diagnostics platform to help drive growth of this largely previously focused product category from the research realm.","Leica Microsystems core revenues were up mid-single-digits, led by double-digit growth in China, the Middle East and Japan. We continue to see solid demand for our confocal microscopy systems, which grew over 10% in the quarter. Demand for our SP8 modular confocal laser scanning microscope remains robust, growing at a mid -- growing at a high-teens rate. To expand our go-to market efforts in Latin America, we acquired Aotec, Leica's distribution partner for microscopy and histopathology solutions based in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.","Turning to Dental. Segment revenues grew 3% in the second quarter with core revenues up 2.5%. Core operating margin increased 90 basis points while reported operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 15.3%. Dental consumables core revenues grew mid-single-digits, led by sales of professional dental consumables across most major geographies. In addition, our implant business grew at a high-teens rate as they continue to take market share. Kerr recently launched the Demi Ultra curing light system, the industry's first Ultracapacitor-powered light curing system, which provides dentists with more efficient curing and eliminates the need for battery power. Ormco's Insignia Advanced Smile Design received the 2013 American Technology Award in Health & Medical Technologies from the TechAmerica Foundation. This award is presented annually to the product that most improves the delivery of health services.","KaVo's core revenues were up low single-digits, driven by demand in China and other high-growth markets. Last quarter, we highlighted the new i-CAT Flex, which achieves a full 3D scan at lower radiation doses than traditional 2D Panoramic X-ray imagers. Reception in the market has been outstanding with the Flex receiving a best new product award at the Henry Schein National Sales Meeting and the 2013 Pride Institute award for best-in-class technology.","In Industrial Technologies, total revenues increased 2% while core revenues declined 2.5% for the quarter. Both our reported and core operating margin increased 110 basis points with our reported operating margin at 23.5%. Our Motion businesses core revenues declined at a mid-teens rate with weakness in most major verticals. We've begun seeing signs of stabilization in North American distribution, which grew modestly both year-over-year and sequentially. As evidenced by strong profit performance, Motion continues to transition out of some of their lower-margin business. This transition will continue to impact core revenues, which are expected to remain negative in the second half of this year.","Core revenues were up -- in Product Identification platform were up mid-single-digits with solid demand from our in-line variable printing technologies, as well as our packaging and color management solutions. Sales increased across most major geographies. Those of you who joined us last week in Chicago at our Investor Day saw firsthand the evolution of our Product ID platform from our core marking and coding businesses into a leading provider of integrated packaging solutions, spanning the entire consumer packaging value chain. I thought our team did a great job illustrating how we use strategy and DBS to establish and then build and grow a strategic platform. For those of you that weren't able to participate, I strongly encourage you to watch the replay available on our website.","At Videojet, new product introductions have been an important driver of our share gains. In the quarter, we introduced the 1620 and 1650 lines of ultra high-speed printers capable of speeds 40% faster than the previous industry benchmark with minimal planned downtime. Also in the quarter, Procter & Gamble announced their adoption of Pantone's new cloud-based color management solution, PantoneLIVE, which improves operational efficiency throughout the packaging supply chain. This is the second major consumer packaged goods company to adopt PantoneLIVE, building on early momentum in the market.","So to wrap up, we were very pleased with our second quarter results, better-than-anticipated core revenue growth and outstanding execution led to solid operational performance. We are initiating third quarter diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.78 to $0.83, which assumes 2% to 3% core revenue growth. We are narrowing our full year 2013 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance to $3.37 to $3.42 from a previous range of $3.32 to $3.47.","As we move into the second half of the year, we're maintaining a conservative macro outlook while staying confident in our ability to deliver solid operating margin expansion. We expect investments in innovation and the high-growth markets to continue to drive growth and share gains. Our earnings outperformance in the second quarter allows us to make additional high-impact growth investments and to fund productivity and efficiency initiatives that we believe will position us well for the balance of this year and beyond.","Matt R. McGrew","Thanks, Larry. Jennifer, that concludes the formal comments. We are now ready for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Scott Davis with Barclays Capital.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Let's talk a little bit about the investments you're making in the -- I mean, Larry, can you help us understand, what -- how much of this is driving growth versus restructuring and cutting costs? And I guess, the question, the obvious question here is that are you investing more money just because you're seeing or thinking there's going to be a reacceleration of growth? Or is it more focused on getting costs out ahead of continued weak -- relatively weak macro environment?","H. Lawrence Culp","Scott, I would say that operationally, this is really more of the same, consistent with the path we've been on in this slower-growth macro environment that we're operating in today. And frankly, I think we see ourselves working through going forward. So there's no macro call here to suggest we see an inflection point relative to things getting materially better. And hence, we want to be ready for that. I think that as we've seen through the first half of this year, we've been well served, having in the past positioned ourselves not only with the step-up in R&D to drive new product launches, but also our step-up particularly in the high-growth markets to go grab market share where we can. And in turn, to make sure we're being smart about our cost structure, we can make those investments and drive the margin expansion and the earnings growth that you've seen. So what we're really talking about here in terms of taking the beat and putting it back into the business, if you will, in the second half is really a combination of stepping up those growth investments, both in R&D and sales and marketing, as well as in those productivity efforts that you've typically seen us put through in the second half. And we flagged last year on that point or the end of last year that we probably had dialed in about $70 million this year in the back half to do that. We're going to step that up here, certainly as we look to the second half. But again, it's really a balanced approach to make sure we're making the investments for share gains and margin expansion as we work our way through the second half of this year.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And as a follow-up to that, Larry, when you think about the step-up you've had in R&D, I mean, you're already fairly -- you've always been a fairly large investor in R&D, so it's not as if you've underinvested in the past. But the step-up in 2013 versus '12, do you anticipate this being an ongoing trend and then you have another step-up in '14? Or is this reset the bar and you're kind of holding in this level versus sales longer-term? And I have just a quick follow-up to that, just in -- conceptually, every company we cover is raising R&D as a percent of sales, and I think even in the medical world that's happening. Has this become a little bit of a tax, if you will, that it just costs more to drive incremental growth and you don't really get that much net benefit because everybody's investing more? It's a bit of an arms race. Or is it really some differentiation that you think can occur with that added investment?","Daniel L. Comas","Scott, it's Dan. As we look back at Q2, we really saw the benefit across a number of the businesses in the step-up in R&D. So we talked about Hach, Gilbarco, PID, all businesses where we think we took share in the quarter. Their new product revenues improved sequentially 50% Q1 to Q2. And we think that was a big driver of the share gains. So I think we are seeing -- we're not seeing it everywhere, but some of this targeted step-up we've made in R&D, we are seeing the payback for that. And I think as long as we continue to see that and we're taking share, our bias would be to spend more.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sure. I mean that's [ph] the crux of my question, right. I mean, if you can gain share, it's definitely worth it. If it's just grow in line with the market, but you have to spend more, then it starts to -- industry structure starts come into the question, I guess.","H. Lawrence Culp","And Scott, to the structural question, I would just add, I think Dan's spot-on there, that if you were in the sessions with us as we talked to the businesses, the tone is really fundamentally an offensive one. We see opportunities to do things no one else does. We see opportunities to help a customer in a way that maybe we uniquely can. And that really drives the agenda, the budget in any step-up that you see. There's really not a lot of examples, where we're sitting there, saying, \"Gosh, there's catch-up to be made, a tax, as you say, to be paid.\" So I think that qualitatively, combined with the quantitative market share impact that we're seeing, suggests these are good investments for us. But we'll continue to be prudent to make sure we're getting those returns as we put this additional money in.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just on the second quarter, I understand that it's kind of a similar revenue seasonality, if I'm kind of doing the math correct, on the core as last year. Is that right, first of all? Just a sequential decline?","Daniel L. Comas","Yes. So we were down -- I mean, last year, we were down about $140 million Q2 to Q3. We probably have become a little bit more seasonal, a little weaker in Q3 given some of the acquisitions we've done over the last couple of years. I don't think we'll be down $140 million sequentially, but maybe we're down, call it, $100 million.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I mean, when I look at, like Beckman, for example, I think it was pretty -- if you go back historically with their business, it was kind of flat to up seasonally. And then last year, I think I thought you had kind of the initial dropoff in some of the more cyclical businesses, as well as that Life Sciences, call it, I don't know, an air pocket or whatever you want to call it on the product side. So I guess, that's the difference between the $100 million and $140 million is -- I'm just struggling to -- this is probably last year was probably your biggest sequential decline, and I'm just kind of struggling to figure out what's changed here relative to, I don't know, 10 years of history.","Daniel L. Comas","Well, I think part of the history is a number of years where we've done Q2 acquisitions. So the organic decline we've had historically over the last 5 years, Q2 to Q3 is larger than our printed numbers as an acquisition element. So the seasonality was more severe last year but not -- less out of line than the numbers would suggest because of M&A.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Is there any change in the level of restructuring this year as well? Like I think you talked about a couple of pennies of investment in the third quarter but I guess, just the fourth quarter.","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. That's what I was trying to suggest in response to Scott's question, Steve. So we're stepping up both the growth investments and the productivity moves.","Operator","We'll go next to Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Larry, interested on the somewhat better North American industrial. I mean, you talked about the distribution piece. Anymore color on that? I mean, was it a restock or pickup in end demand or anything you could make out of it?","H. Lawrence Culp","I mean, I think we flagged that both at Fluke and in Motion. I'm not sure we're ready to extrapolate too much from that at least at this point. I think we were encouraged to see Fluke improve sequentially in that regard. But I think we need to see this play out for another quarter or so to think we've got legs there. There was some inventory movement at Motion, which is part of what we saw there. But again, I think it's early signs, but we'll see how the third quarter plays out.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And how about on the tax side of things, I mean, any movement in either direction in terms of customers' sort of attitudes around equipment spending on that side?","H. Lawrence Culp","No. I think, clearly, sequentially things improved, but we are still negative from a core perspective. I think we've got the potential to be positive in the second half in large part because of the comps. But as you know, I mean, one geography in particular that we're watching closely, particularly in T&M, on the instrument side is China. China has been a real struggle, particularly as the export base has struggled there. The comps help us probably more than necessarily the underlying demand does. But I think that combination should help us get positive there in the second half but not wildly or overly so.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So you haven't seen any sort of significant change in behavior yet?","H. Lawrence Culp","Not yet. We're looking. Believe me, we're looking.","Operator","We'll go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just a quick follow-on to some previous questions. So Dan, I think you've referred to the step-up in R&D. Obviously, it makes sense if you're getting the payback. But the 40 bps in the quarter, is that indicative of the kind of step-up you expect in the back half of the year?","Daniel L. Comas","In that range, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then Larry, the restructuring expense, you mentioned a couple of cents in 2Q -- in 3Q. But the 4Q, I mean, so how do we think about that? Do you have a number in mind? Or is that number fungible depending on how the back half plays out?","Daniel L. Comas","Nigel, I think we're still a little fluid in that regard. As Larry highlighted, we talked about $70 million in our plan in the second half. That will be more fourth quarter than the third quarter, that's pretty typical. But we're going to spend more than that $70 million here. And we're still sort of figuring that out. We're trying to embed that in our guidance.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But more than $30 million in the fourth quarter rather than the second half?","Daniel L. Comas","Yes. Well, it tends to be more Q4-focused, yes. There'll be some in Q3, but it will be more biased to Q4.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then switching to the performance at Beckman. Obviously, very encouraging to see mid-single-digit growth so early. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more color in terms of what's driving that? Is it pull-up [ph] in attrition? Are we seeing more gross adds? Any help there would be interesting.","H. Lawrence Culp","Nigel, it's really not any one thing. But I think the program that we've been working to improve our retention and win rates in North America, I think, our step-up in terms of the investments in the high-growth markets, which really have been driving most of the growth at Beckman. And certainly, as we fix the quality issues, witness troponin and others, but also bring on some additional new products, every little bit helps, right? So to see a mid-single-digit quarter here isn't necessarily in any way a declaration of victory. But having been out there here in the last couple of weeks, I just think we've got a lot of progress and momentum building in the commercial execution and new product development, which bodes well for the business. But again, as you've heard me say, there's still a lot of work to do, but we're highly confident we're going to continue to improve Beckman and make that as good as any Danaher business that we have.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And how do you see [ph] the upside of Beckman for the second half of the year? Have you assumed that great quarter but let's not assume it continues? Or have you rolled forward some of that upside in the second half of the year?","Daniel L. Comas","Nigel, I think we're still working with a low single-digit focus in the second half here but clearly, a little bit more encouraged given what we've seen not only the numbers we printed, but just the general tone of the business.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just first question. The T&M core margin decline of 30 basis points, was all of that due to operating leverage? Or what other -- any other dynamics in that?","H. Lawrence Culp","Steve, it's really a combination of 2 things. One, as we noted, instruments is down, instruments is the higher-margin piece of that segment so that hurts. And communications is an area, where we are stepping up our growth investments. Clearly, not the best growth quarter they've ever registered. But as you know, probably one of our best growth businesses here in the last couple of years with a tremendous amount of runway, given their focus in mobility, their opportunities in security, and certainly, building up more of a position with the enterprise customer base. So it's really the instruments volume and the R&D step-up, really the OpEx step-up and comms which create that pinch.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then talked about Beckman a bunch. But if you step back now 2 years later, how are the financials compared to your original expectations both for ROIC and accretion at this point now?","Daniel L. Comas","Steve, we're right on track, probably the revenue is a little better. Margins are ahead of where we thought they would be. We thought we'd have $250 million of costs by the end of this year. We're north of $300 million. So a little ahead of the margins and a little bit ahead on the revenue line as well.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And maybe just a little bit of overarching commentary on any changes in the M&A environment is always helpful on these calls.","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. I don't think we've really seen a change, Steve, in the last 90 days. I think we're encouraged and fundamentally optimistic about our ability to deploy the capacity that we have, the $8 billion or so that you heard us talk about in terms of the next couple of years. And clearly, valuations are up. That means we can't buy every company we might want to buy, but that's never our MO, right? We're looking for great fits where we can add value, where we can generate a return for our shareholders. And the silver lining in an environment like this, particularly for a strategic, well-capitalized buyer like ourselves, is you can have high-quality conversations with high-quality companies. We're doing just that. So we continue to, I think, have that level of optimism of confidence that we will smartly deploy that capital to help build out the businesses as we move forward here. But again, not a dramatic sea change 90 days on.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Partners.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","I'm wondering if we could just try to put a little finer point on some of this incremental spending. Dan, I guess, you made it pretty clear the $70 million is in flux, you don't know where it goes. But I guess, first point, would we be talking about it if it's only $5 million or $10 million?","Daniel L. Comas","No, we would not be. So if it was $10 million, $15 million more, we wouldn't be talking about it. So maybe it's in that $90 million, $100 million range.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And then just trying to get a head around the incremental R&D and SG&A growth spending, you gave the basis points in R&D to Nigel. But relative to what you were thinking, how much is that changing? We heard the story of 170 new marketing people just at Videojet alone last week. It seems like there is a lot going on. But was that all kind of baked in the plan? Or is there a real increase there, too?","H. Lawrence Culp","In terms of what we're talking about for the second half, there are real increases both in R&D and some on the sales and marketing side. We've mentioned the high-growth markets. You flagged some of the marketing initiatives there as well, Jeff, fortunately saw in Wood Dale. It's really a step-up. Because as we go through the year, we obviously are reading and reacting. We're learning, we're developing skills. And we don't want to be too static in those growth investments. So we really -- when you hear us talk about dynamic resource allocation, we're really trying in real time to fund the opportunities as quickly as we can as opposed to being slaved to an annual budget.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. So even there, we're not talking about single-digit millions then, we're probably talking about 5s and 10s sort of thing?","Daniel L. Comas","That's probably correct.","H. Lawrence Culp","That's fair.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Yes. And then just back to kind of Q3, I guess, the whole sequential discussion. But on a year-over-year basis, the comp is really easy against obviously what was a pretty disappointing Q3 last year. Why wouldn't you accelerate a little bit against that, just a 0.8% organic last year?","H. Lawrence Culp","Right. Well, there's no question, Jeff, there's an easier comp in the third. I think what we're trying to share with you today is in essence what we're seeing customers and markets saying and doing today, right? So as we work through what's happening at point of sales, we talk to our distribution partners. As we go through our sales pipelines with our direct business, as we take a pulse of both the headwinds and the tailwinds out there externally, I think we come up with a top line figure that suggests that on a core basis, we're likely to be in that 2% to 3% range here in the third quarter. It's really as simple and as straightforward as that.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Great. And then just finally, can you size in basis points or dollars, whatever is easier, just how significant the Motion headwind is just from kind of unwinding the lower-margin project -- products?","H. Lawrence Culp","There's probably, call it, 400 or 500 basis points of core revenue headwind within Motion as a result of that, I think, appropriate and smart transitioning out of some of that lower-margin business. So we take the core revenue hit, but you clearly see the resilience of those Motion revenues as the positive offset, a trade we'll take any day.","Daniel L. Comas","The Motion margin.","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes, excuse me.","Operator","We'll go next to Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So you've talked a bunch about Beckman, Larry. On Leica, I just remembered, last quarter in Leica Bio, you had the control issue, Europe distribution change, worried of potentially new competitor coming to market. Can you just give a little bit of an update on each of those issues and kind of where you stand on Leica Bio in the quarter and for the rest of the year?","H. Lawrence Culp","Sure. I think in terms of the control issue for the broader audience, we have seen in the U.S. some policy guidance changes, which has negatively impacted some of our underlying volume in the business. I think that is modest and kind of working its way through the business. Our European distribution change there continues. But I think we certainly had a better quarter in that regard than we did in the first and continue to believe strategically that we're heading in the right direction and financially we should see less headwind as a result. And you mentioned competition. I have no idea who you're thinking of there, Jon, but we haven't really seen any material competitive pressure change here of late and continue to believe that, particularly in advanced staining, we saw very strong underlying growth vis-\u00e0-vis the market.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So would you expect kind of what you saw in the second quarter here to continue in the second half for Leica Bio?","H. Lawrence Culp","We would -- we certainly have that expectation with LBS as we drive into the second half.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just one more. I did the math on the core diagnostics of Beckman. It looks like you said in your Q, I think you said North America and Europe were actually down low single. So it's looking like high growth and probably China is still kind of plus 20%. Anything at all you're seeing there, given what's going on in China that makes you concerned that, that could slow some? Just maybe an update geographically on that business.","Daniel L. Comas","Yes, Jon. I think it's hard not to be a little bit cautious on that front, just the number of quarters we put back-to-back-to-back was 20%. And China is not [ph] part of the high-growth market. So we think they'll continue to be very good. Could there be some tempering? I think that's a possibility. And while Europe and the U.S. were down, they were down less than they were the last couple of quarters. So hopefully, we can get a little bit of improvement in the developed markets because I think there's some likelihood we'll have very good growth in the high-growth markets. But it's going to be probably hard to sustain at these levels.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So do you think North America and Europe could be getting to a point where they actually turn positive in the next few quarters here, given some of the successes that you've talked about at Beckman?","Daniel L. Comas","We are not yet prepared to forecast, but we like the trend line.","Operator","We'll go next to Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just on the operating cash flow, it was down 2% in Q1, it was down 14% in Q2. And you talked in the Q about the timing of customer deposits in T&M and so on in the network comm side. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how quickly you expect the operating cash flow to normalize? And what's driven that customer deposits issue?","Daniel L. Comas","Sure. Julian, there are probably 3 factors driving the first half cash flow being down slightly year-on-year. I'll come back to the customer deposits in the third point. One of which is just the timing of tax payments. We've had relatively higher tax payments here in the first half. That will normalize through the year. The second element is we have slightly higher inventory levels. Part of that is related to a number of new product launches. We talked about some of the benefits we're seeing at Hach, Gilbarco, Product ID. Again, we expect the inventory levels to normalize through the year. And then finally, customer deposits. Last year on some large projects, we were able to get some upfront payments. That will probably not normalize through the year so that will be a slight headwind, but these others 2 factors will help. And you should see an acceleration back to more normalized level of cash flow through the balance of the year.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then within Environmental, you talked a bit about municipal spending being down. Not a surprise, but I guess, any sense on the pace of the declines or how that's -- how you think that will trend as we go through the year?","Daniel L. Comas","Well, it was a little bit bifurcated. So the lower-ticket municipal spending actually got sequentially better Q1 to Q2. We're probably a little cautious of that because the governments have year ends of June 30. So we may have seen a little bit of benefit. But it's okay. It's not great, but again probably a little better than what we saw in Q1, continue to see the high ticket stuff to be challenging. And I don't think we're calling for a turn in that part of the business.","H. Lawrence Culp","And that comp is really focused, I think, in the U.S. and to a degree, in Europe. We're pleased with the China growth that we saw for now 2 quarters here coming in no small part from the muni side, which had been a bit more sluggish for us over the last couple of years.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly on Europe, there has been some hope around slightly higher PMIs and so on. It doesn't sound like you have seen anything at all around any kind of inflection point in any end market in Europe. Is that fair or...","Daniel L. Comas","Julian, we were down a point or 2 in Europe, which has been comparable to maybe slightly better than what we've been seeing. We've seen a few of our businesses -- PID had a better quarter in Europe. But I'd say generally speaking, we're not seeing much of any turn here.","Operator","We'll go next to Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Larry, Dan, could you give us a view around the book-to-bill in T&M in the quarter? And how would you expect that business to trend in the second half, particularly for Tek instruments? And to what degree are you beginning to see any change in demand trends out of China?","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. I mean, T&M book-to-bill was flat. I think as we look at Tek for the second half and really instruments more broadly, I think we have the opportunity to grow, call it, low singles, if all goes well. China is really important. China is important both at Tek and at Fluke. And as I mentioned earlier, we've seen softness, prolonged softness both with the export base, which we largely serve at Tek, and frankly in a host of other verticals that deal with domestic infrastructure, principally at Fluke. But as we have gone through those reviews recently with the teams, again in part due to the comps, in part because some of our own execution opportunities, we think we can go positive here in the second half and we're going to be working hard to do that. But China will be an important swing factor for that instruments platform, no doubt.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then Dan, in terms of the overall core revenue growth experienced in the quarter, can you give us a breakdown between equipment and consumables?","Daniel L. Comas","Sure. The consumables stayed right in that -- consumables and aftermarkets stayed right in that 3% to 4% range, all up. And equipment and instruments were a little better than Q1, so we were essentially flat in Q1 and we were up 1% to 2%. Again, we talked about some of that Gilbarco, some of the Life Sciences businesses benefiting to that number.","Operator","We'll go next to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just on Industrial Tech, wanted to put your comments on Motion in context to that core growth target, 0% to 3%, you put out last December. You guys trended a little bit lower than that in the first half. So I just want to make sure I understand what's embedded in your assumptions for the back half of the year.","Daniel L. Comas","In the back half, we're looking at Industrial Tech to be flat to slightly down in the third quarter. The biggest driver of that would be Motion, which we expect to be down high single-digits. Most of that [indiscernible] getting out of some of this very low-margin business. And then the fourth quarter, we'd expect a sequential improvement from that.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay, that makes sense. And then just in China maybe qualitatively, we touched on that issue a couple of different ways here. But I do want to spend a minute with regards to the nature of your customers in China, specifically with regards to capacity utilization. I mean, I think we all know a lot of the growth in China has been driven by success in investment. And I think one thing that's harder for us to read is sort of what your customers' capacity utilization looks like on your products over there just qualitatively. Can you maybe comment on that and just how think about what your customers' underlying demand looks like just given the current environment there?","H. Lawrence Culp","Isaac, I admittedly can't give you a figure as to our diagnostics customers, our Chinese diagnostics customers' utilization of our installed base over there. But I would say, as you might anticipate, it's higher, closer to the coast. Those new installs that have gone in are ramping. But there's probably very few places outside of the major coastal cities where our installed base is anywhere close to capacity. So we're proud to be part of this health care initiative in China. And certainly, as that installed base is utilized more actively in the delivery of enhanced care, that will be good for those patients and it will be good business for us.","Operator","We'll go next to John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Troponin, is that going to be significant to growth in the segment? Or is it -- like when does that kick in, do you guys think?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I -- those are 2 different questions, John. I think it's kicking in now that we have that 510(k) approval. And frankly, it's kicking in not only in terms of the resumption of being able to sell that product, but it's another box that's checked in terms of the commitments we made to not only our regulators, but our customers, which helps the overall business. I think we've tried to downplay the specific quantitative financial impact, John, of getting those assays back on the market just because largely I think that was overdone. I think this was more a reputational issue. And as we've gone through this hoop and others, I think people understand that we're getting Beckman back in the shape that it once was in and will be again. And that helps us with retention, that helps us with new customer wins, not only here in the U.S., where this issue was most acute, but more broadly as well.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. No, Larry, I'm just wondering, is there a sort of a short-term pop-up, if you will, that maybe is significant to Beckman's results that you could see sort of near-term associated with troponin?","H. Lawrence Culp","I would say if there's any near-term pop, it would be muted and immaterial.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So that makes sense. Can I ask you about just maybe, Dan, is where these pricing trends perhaps juxtaposed with some declining raws, how are you guys sort of seeing that across your portfolio or, say, across significant differences in geographies if anything is noteworthy?","Daniel L. Comas","John, I just probably have a top level point of view. Our prices remained about 70 basis points the last 2, 3 quarters. Again, getting it on the consumables and the aftermarket, relatively flat on the equipment, on the instruments. So part of that 100 basis points of margin improvement is the cost actions we took last year. But clearly, we're seeing some price-cost benefit right now. Not getting a lot of price, getting a little bit of price and seeing some benefit on the cost side.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Are there any discernible differences, Dan, in terms of pricing trend sequentially that would be...","Daniel L. Comas","No. I mean, we did say this started a couple of quarters ago that it got tougher to get price on equipment and instruments. And we went from maybe slightly positive to kind of flattish, slightly negative price but probably overall flattish instruments and equipments. And that has stayed relatively steady here at least through the second quarter.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. Okay, that's helpful. And just lastly, Larry, as you think about emerging markets, and you guys obviously are doing extremely well in China, part of the playbook, I think, had been to sort of broaden that success into the Indias and Latin Americas of the world. But clearly, the world looks perhaps different today as it did even a year ago in terms of the run rate for those markets. How are you, Danaher, strategically thinking about that? And why not maybe go for even more penetration in China if some of these markets around the world, maybe with the exception of the Middle East, look like they could be significantly more challenged in the coming few years in terms of realizing growth rates?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think strategically, John, as you rightly point out, and you know this as well as anyone, what we try to do is build on our China-first strategy the last couple of years and taking the successes we've had and learnings we've taken to all the other high-growth regions of the world. I think the evidence that we're having good traction in that regard for all the examples peppered through our prepared remarks in terms of the successes we're having in the Middle East, what we're seeing in Brazil, Eastern Europe, right on down the line. India has been a little softer for us this year, to be sure. Latin America, in part because of a couple of tough comps, was tough in the second quarter. But that basket, which is no longer a China-only basket, was up, what, high singles here. I think we're mindful of the headlines relative to that basket as we think about the second half. I think that's part of our conservative posture on the macro. But strategically, you hit the point. These markets may slow in their overall growth, but they're still going to be the best game in town and the penetration levels of most of our products in these parts of the world are still pretty modest. So you pick your market, take 200, take 500 basis points of growth off the top, yes, that will define how much investment monies we have to put into play. But that underlying growth, our penetration opportunities to grow in excess of those market rates still makes those spaces, those places incredibly important targets for us. And that's the way we're operating.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Deane Dray with Citi.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","We covered a lot of ground here already, and maybe just some closing comments regarding guidance. And Larry, last quarter, you had some specific commentary about having more of a midpoint bias to earnings guidance. Now you put up a solid second quarter. You're playing a little bit more offense and making some growth investments. So how would you characterize that bias today? And then same question for core revenue growth for the second half.","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. I think that what we've done here, Deane, with the update on guidance is really stay true to that midpoint mindset that you heard me express back on the first quarter call. So being at the halfway point here, have a little bit more clarity as to the puts and takes, it doesn't really change our outlook materially in that regard and we thought we can tighten up the guidance accordingly. I really think it's that simple. In terms of the core outlook, I think we're looking at a low single-digit environment here in the second half. We've quantified that as 2% to 3% as best we can figure here for the third quarter. But in essence, I think what we saw in the second quarter is on balance likely what we're dealing with here in the second half. We wish it were otherwise, but it is what it is and we're going to outperform accordingly.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Matt McGrew for any additional or closing remarks.","Matt R.

Lawrence Culp","Matt, thanks, and good morning, everyone. Given what was clearly a difficult operating environment during the third quarter, our team did an outstanding job on the execution front with a 100-basis point increase year-over-year in our core operating margin and a 50% year-over-year increase in our free cash flow during the quarter. For the first time in the company's history, our trailing 4 quarters of free cash flow exceeded $3 billion. We grew 1% organically in the quarter with sales in Western Europe declining at a mid-single digits rate and the U.S. modestly negative, both of which were slightly below our expectations.","Despite these macro pressures, we successfully protected our organic investments and stayed active on the M&A front, announcing $500 million of new acquisitions. In addition, during the quarter, we purchased approximately 5 million shares of company stock at an average price of approximately $52 per share. We saw the positive impact of DBS on growth in a number of our businesses, including Esko, Leica Biosystems and Hach. Especially in this environment, we are focusing our efforts on capturing market share. In the quarter, DBS helped to accelerate new product introductions across many of our businesses, and coupled with our go-to market initiatives, drove share gains at Videojet, ChemTreat, Tektronix Communications, Radiometer and Kerr to highlight a few specific operating businesses.","Geographically, the emerging markets grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter. China was also up low-double digits, though sequentially we did not see any improvement in industrial and user demand. Health care remains a bright spot in China with our Dental and Life Sciences & Diagnostics businesses growing in excess of 20% in the quarter.","Turning to the details of the quarter. Today we reported record third quarter diluted net earnings per share of $0.77, a 7% increase as compared to our adjusted diluted net EPS last year. We delivered this increase in earnings despite the fact that quarterly revenues declined slightly to $4.4 billion due to the negative impact of currency translation, which reduced sales by 3%. Core revenues grew 1%, and the impact of acquisitions increased revenues by 1.5%. Our gross margin for the third quarter was 51.6%, and our reported operating margin expanded 260 basis points year-over-year to 17.1%.","DBS remains the key driver of our outstanding cash flow performance. Third quarter operating cash flow was $975 million, a 42% increase year-over-year. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2012 was $2.3 billion, up 37%. And our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio for the first 9 months of the year was a robust 140%.","Across each of our growth platforms, we are active and optimistic on the M&A front. Through the first 9 months of the year, we've already deployed more than $1 billion of capital on 10 acquisitions and have reached agreement to acquire 2 additional businesses for another $500 million this quarter.","Subsequent to quarter end, we announced the pending sale of Apex Tool Group, our strategic joint venture with Cooper Industries, to Bain Capital for $1.6 billion. We expect the sale to generate after-tax proceeds to Danaher of approximately $650 million and to close in the first half of 2013. The transaction is expected to be dilutive to 2013 net earnings per share by approximately $0.08 until we redeploy that capital. The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.","Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement segment revenues declined 5% in the quarter with core revenues down 6.5%. Core operating margin for the third quarter decreased 320 basis points while reported operating margins declined 390 basis points to 20.1%, primarily a result of the lower sales volumes in our instruments businesses. Instruments core revenue declined at a low-double digit rate.","At Fluke, core revenues were down double digits. While demand there was healthy in Latin America and in the Middle East, it was more than offset by continued weakness in other geographies, primarily China. Despite the difficult environment, we continue to protect and nurture the growth investments in the business, and in the quarter expanded the range of Fluke's front-line industrial maintenance and troubleshooting tools with the launch of the 805 Vibration Meter.","At Tektronix, core sales declined at a midteens rate with further weakening globally across the business. Tektronix recently introduced the next phase in our award-winning MDO product portfolio, the MDO4000, a lower price point model of our all-in-1 oscilloscope and spectrum analyzer targeting design engineers across a broad range of applications. Core revenues from our Communications businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate in the quarter, driven by demand for Tektronix Communications' mobile network management solutions in North America and China. We expect core growth rates in our Communications businesses to decline in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the timing of a large carrier project from last year that is winding down. Demand for our network security systems is particularly strong in light of recent high-profile DdoS attacks. As a result, enterprise customers across many sectors are seeking to fortify their network security defenses.","Turning to Environmental. Revenues increased 2.5% in the quarter with core revenues up 3.5%. The segment core operating margin increased 70 basis points in the quarter with reported operating margins essentially flat, primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Water quality core revenues increased at a low-single digit rate in the quarter.","Hach core revenues grew mid-single digits with solid demand in all major geographies and across most verticals. Municipal spending for our core lab and process instrumentation was up low-single digits globally. Hach remains focused on expanding its service capabilities, doubling its service revenues as a percent of sales over the last several years. Today, consumables and service represent 55% of our water quality group's total revenues.","During the quarter, we acquired Dingli, a Chinese distributor of online water quality instrumentation. This is our first water quality acquisition in China and provides Hach with both engineering and integration capabilities, which will help drive growth in our process business.","The third quarter marked ChemTreat's ninth straight quarter of double-digit core revenue growth. Our best-in-class sales force initiatives continue to capture market share with several new account wins during the quarter.","Trojan core revenues declined in the quarter as municipal spending for capital equipment remained weak.","Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew low-single digits, led by robust demand for our dispensers in Latin America driven by anti-tampering security regulations in Mexico. In addition, the Encore 700, our highly flexible EMV-ready dispenser designed to support security upgrades for credit and debit cards in North America, which we launched at the end of last year, continues to see strong adoption and now represents over 30% of Gilbarco's U.S. sales.","CSP Magazine, the convenient store trade publication, recently awarded Gilbarco their 2012 Retailer Choice Best New Product in technology category for its Applause TV dispenser, which enhances customer loyalty and increases store traffic.","During the quarter, Gilbarco acquired ACIS Group, an Eastern European provider of products and services to the retail and commercial petroleum industry.","Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenues for the quarter decreased 3% due to the impact of currency exchange rates and a small divestiture. Core revenues were up 2.5%. Core operating margin for the segment was up 320 basis points while our reported operating margin increased 890 basis points from the prior year to 12.2%.","The Diagnostics businesses continued their strong performance with mid-single digit core growth in the third quarter. Radiometer's core sales increased at a high-single digit rate with growth in all major geographies and solid placements of both our core blood gas instruments and our new AQT immunoassay analyzers. AQT unit sales were up more than 25% from a year ago.","During the quarter, we received an order from a large German dialysis company to place 250 ABL90 blood gas analyzers in clinics throughout the country. This contract runs for 5 years and is expected to result in over 1 million tests per year.","Leica Biosystems sales increased at a mid-single digit rate with advanced staining in core histology sales up low teens and mid-single digits, respectively. Growth was balanced geographically with North America, Europe and the emerging markets all contributing.","At the National Society for Histology Convention in Vancouver this month, Leica Biosystems showcased 6 new products, the most of any presenting company to show, further emphasizing our commitment to innovation. One of the products we debuted was the BOND advanced software package, which allows multiple advanced staining instruments to run from one central control panel, thereby increasing efficiency for busy lab technicians.","As we discussed in our Leica Investor Day last year, digital pathology is an increasingly important element in the path lab as advanced staining is driving therapeutic treatment options and increasing the need for more advanced image analysis. So during the quarter, we were pleased to announce the pending acquisition of Aperio Technologies, a leader in this market with a full range of products covering scanning, managing, viewing and analyzing images. The combination of Aperio and Leica Biosystems strengthens our position in digital pathology with considerable innovation and go-to-market synergy potential to serve doctors and patients better and to fuel strong organic growth.","We are pleased with our progress at Beckman Coulter where DBS has made an impact on many facets of the business, including new product introductions, sales and marketing and quality, all the while improving the overall cost structure.","Diagnostics again grew at a low-single digit rate organically, the fourth consecutive quarter of low-single digit growth. While modest, the sustained growth we've seen over the last year has encouraged us that this business, once fully up on its feet, will be a strong contributor to Danaher's overall core growth.","Beckman's launch of the AU5800 series, a new high-volume clinical chemistry analyzer, while still early, is going well with encouraging initial customer feedback. As production and placements ramp over the remainder of the year, we expect the 5800 to be a key driver of growth in 2013 and beyond.","During the quarter, we announced the pending acquisition of IRIS International, a leading manufacturer of automated in-vitro urinalysis, diagnostic systems and consumables. IRIS' well-respected brand and market position provides an attractive entry point into this fast-growing IVD segment. This transaction is expected to close before year end.","Our Life Sciences businesses core revenues declined low-single digits in the quarter. AB SCIEX's core sales grew low-single digits in the quarter with particular strength in China. We began shipping the 6500, our most sensitive triple quad system, which we launched at ASMS in June. The 6500's ability to increase our customers' research and experimentation capabilities has resulted in very good feedback from initial users, and we expect shipments to increase through the balance of this year.","Leica Microsystems core sales declined mid-single digits in the quarter with soft demand in North America and Europe as the pace of activities slowed across a number of customers. Earlier this year, we debuted the SP8 modular confocal laser scanning microscope, a truly innovative new technology. We began shipments late in the second quarter and expect to see a ramp over the next several quarters.","In Dental, revenues for the quarter decreased 1% due to the adverse effect of currency exchange rates. Core revenues were up 3%. Core operating margin increased 90 basis points, and reported operating margin increased 100 basis points to 15.5%. We are pleased both with the team's execution and the relative stability of the overall dental market.","Dental consumables core revenues grew low-single digits in the quarter, led by sales of our general dentistry consumables and orthodontic solutions across all major geographies. Our Kerr brand continues to take share as a result of a robust new product portfolio and strong commercial execution around the world. Dental equipment core revenues increased low-single digits in the quarter with growth in instruments and equipment.","This month we launched the KaVo E30 treatment unit, an extension of our successful E70 and E80 lines, which allows doctors to flexibly match their treatment units with desired instrumentation. We are quite happy with our performance in China as our combined equipment and consumables go-to-market initiatives resulted in another quarter of double-digit growth. These joint efforts in China are a model for our Dental businesses globally as we accelerate their emerging market penetration.","In Industrial Technologies, total revenues increased 5.5% while core revenues were up 1.5% for the quarter. Our core operating margin increased 120 basis points while our reported operating margin declined modestly to 21.8%, primarily due to the impact of recently acquired acquisitions.","Product Identification core revenues were up low-double digits in the quarter with growth across most major geographies. Sales of Videojet's CIJ printers were particularly strong, up greater than 10% in the quarter. We launched the Videojet 3020 laser coder, an entry level laser for marking and coding applications in the consumer packaged goods in industrial products markets.","At Esko, core sales grew more than 10% in the quarter with strength across all major product categories. The consumer packaged goods industry continues to look for Esko to help fulfill their packaging design needs, which helped drive midteens growth in our software business in the quarter.","Despite the economic headwinds in Europe, Esko's sales there grew high-single digits, due to a healthy order book following the drupa trade show in the second quarter.","X-Rite, our largest acquisition year-to-date, is off to a solid start with several new products set to be introduced here in the fourth quarter. Collaboration between X-Rite and Esko has already begun with both teams excited to leverage opportunities to work together.","Our Motion businesses core revenues declined at a high-single digit rate in the quarter with weakness in most major geographies. We continue to see softness in Industrial automation, engineering solutions and technology markets across most major geographies. We expect core sales to improve in the fourth quarter in part due to easier year-over-year comparisons.","So to wrap up, our team continues to execute well. While the impact of DBS is evident in the share gains we saw across a number of businesses, clearly the macroeconomic headlines are having an impact on our growth. We're mindful that the operating environment is likely to remain challenging going forward, and as a result, we are increasing our previously announced 2012 anticipated restructuring efforts from approximately $100 million to approximately $120 million. We believe our strong recurring revenue base, now 40% of total revenues, and our efforts to reduce our structural costs along with the margin expansion opportunities present in our newer businesses and investments in growth initiatives, should position us well for the balance of 2012 and beyond.","We are initiating fourth quarter diluted net EPS from continuing operations guidance of $0.80 to $0.85, as well as adjusting our full year GAAP diluted net EPS guidance from $3.19 to $3.26 to a new range of $3.14 to $3.19. The midpoint of our revised GAAP EPS guidance would result in approximately 12% year-over-year growth compared to 2011 adjusted EPS of $2.83. We are assuming fourth quarter 2012 core revenue will be similar to what we have seen in the third quarter.","Matt R. McGrew","Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. Deana, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First, we'll hear from Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So Larry, so the U.S. going a little bit negative. I mean, I guess, how much of that surprised you and maybe talk about some of the key drivers and what you think's behind that?","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes, I think this -- we wouldn't isolate, Shannon, the U.S. I think it was really from a geographic perspective, both a U.S. and a Western European dynamic here. I think we've said for many years that the third quarter is often about September, certainly given the weak summer that we and others saw. That was all the more true here in the third quarter. We saw an uptick in September. We just didn't see a big enough uptick relative to expectations and again, in a real contrast, I think, to the high-growth markets where we saw that low-double digit growth. I think when you look at it from a product perspective, it's interesting because from a -- consumables were pretty much right where we thought they'd be. We thought they'd be around 4% core. They were, and again that's about 40% of our overall revenue. I think where we saw the swing was really in the bigger ticket capital purchases where, I think, we pegged the U.S. and Europe to be up slightly and it ended up in both places being down slightly. And again, as we indicated in our prepared remarks, Shannon, it was principally in Instruments, Fluke and Tek, certainly saw that in Motion where we're serving bigger ticket capital investments. At Trojan, we saw things soften and push out again kind of big ticket muni spending. And in Life Sciences, I think we saw some of the academic and government spending pressures to a degree. So we're really talking about a couple of hundred basis points of a swing there around, if you will, kind of Western market capital spend.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And as you're sort of launching new products with -- things like AB SCIEX and some of the things that have come out, I mean, are those kind of initial launches not what they used to be? And what are you hearing from customers in terms of any deferral? I mean, are -- is there interest, but they're saying check me again in 3 to 6 months or sort of what's the nature of the feedback?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I would say with the new products, and particularly in Life Sciences, we really couldn't be better positioned. And I think if you look at SCIEX, for example, we continued to ramp around the new products, particularly the 6500 on the high end, the 4500 in the mid-price point range. Talked about the new confocal at Leica, the SP8. So those conversations are -- they couldn't be going better, Shannon. And I think that's why we're alluding to these shipment start-ups and these ramps around products that we really put out in the market in the first half of the year. Those, by and large, have been good conversations. I think it's more, if you will, the bread-and-butter products and programs where we've seen some of the pressure that we're alluding to, again, primarily in the U.S. and in Europe.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, great.","H. Lawrence Culp","Innovation, particularly in life science research is the -- it's the name of the game. And fortunately, I think, we're in a good position in that regard. We just got to get a little bit more time behind us to get these products ramped.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Could you just talk about what's going on in Life Sciences? I guess, the little bit weaker performance there and the margin is also a bit of a disappointment. Is there anything specific that we should watch out for that's going to be part of this restructuring over the next few quarters that you would expect improvement on there?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, let me break it down in terms of the top line, margins and restructuring. If we start with Life Sciences again, Life Science as a group was down low-single digits, I think a real contrast to the mid-single digit growth we saw in Diagnostics, which continue to be, I think, very strong. Again, I think with AB SCIEX and with Leica, which are the 2 engines there of course, we saw academic and government spending be more muted here in the second half than we were anticipating. And we've seen that in the wake of some of the austerity, some of the sequestration concerns that are out there. As we ramp some of these new products, we'll get some benefit to offset that more modest spending environment. But I really think that's largely what we're talking about here, Steve, in terms of what we're seeing in Life Sciences. It's largely a Western dynamic. I think we help ourselves a good bit as we get these new products out the door. But again, as we flag a fourth quarter growth rate in line with what we've seen here in the third, it's in part due to a view that the spending environment in and around some of these bigger ticket items will be less robust in the short term than it would normally be.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Why does that get better? I mean, isn't there a risk that, that gets actually worse if these guys don't get together and get something done here near term? I mean, isn't that kind of a -- what's kind of the worst case for that related business for next year in case something happens here with the cliff that's coming up?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I -- my view, Steve, and this is maybe one of the few times we get the benefit of being here in Washington, talking to a lot of folks out, say, at the NIH up on the hill. I think regardless of how the election plays out, regardless of which party's in charge, I think there's a view that the U.S., much like China, much like Germany, needs to invest in life science research. It's the right thing to do. It's a source of national competitive advantage. So I don't think we worry so much about the long-term worst case. I think what we're seeing is a -- is more temporary given the strategic long-term interests that these customers, be they government or nongovernment, have in mind. And again, to the earlier question, as we continue to fuel innovation, like the 6500 and the 4500, it's SCIEX, the SP8 at Leica, Navios at Beckman and flow cytometry, I think we'll be well positioned to take share of the spending that is left out there around the world.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But I guess, as you contingency plan for next year, is this a business that could possibly be down double digits in a worst case scenario?","H. Lawrence Culp","I don't think that is in our planning scope at this point, Steve, in any way, shape or form.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then one last question just on you guys buying back stock. Just maybe what's the -- how did that decision -- how'd you come to that decision, and does that reflect on perhaps a lack of acquisition opportunities out there? I mean, historically, you guys have been pretty good buyers of your stock. It's performed well after you've bought it. I'm just curious as to with such a lack of visibility out there on the macro, why step up and do it now.","Daniel L. Comas","Steve, I think it's -- clearly, the bias is to the M&A side. And as Larry alluded to, we've spent about $1.5 billion year-to-date on M&A. The buyback represented about 1\/6 of that amount, but we do, as you pointed out, we do periodically go in and buy back some stock. You'll remember we issued about 20 million shares last year, so it's an opportunity to sort of bring some of that stock back in. And in terms of -- hard to read EPS within a couple of cents, but that's not really how we look at the buyback. We look at it on a cash basis. So we issued the stock last year at $52. At that point, our free cash flow was about $2.21 billion. And we were able to buy that stock back at an average price of $52. And right now our free cash flow is $3 billion, up 40%. So it just seemed like a good investment and a good opportunity to take some of that stock back. But clearly the bias is on the M&A side.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","For the expectations on the M&A side, I know we've talked about the interest in rebalancing the portfolio more towards the -- or lowering the Life Sciences, Dental, Med Tech to closer to 40%. IRIS came up. It looked like a nice tuck-in for Beckman, but how are you thinking about the mix versus what you look in the funnel of potential M&A opportunities?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, Deane, let me hit maybe on 3 points. First, I think the intent today is just as you described it. I think we would be very keen to put the next $1 billion, $2 billion, $3 billion to work predominantly outside of Life Sciences & Diagnostics and Dental. I think as we look forward, we want to maintain that balance. We think that serves the company and shareholders very well. I think as you look inside the funnels, to your specific question, we're active in a whole host of areas in that regard. So I think we continue to be optimistic. Per Dan's comments a moment ago, we'll be able to deploy capital in that direction in a serious, meaningful way. Third point I'd make is that, certainly, as you can appreciate, IRIS coming on board is a wonderful addition. Urinalysis is one test modality that Beckman is not in today. I think IRIS, through our global distribution channels, will be a significant contributor going forward. Clearly, digital pathology is a core trend of the future in and around one of our most successful businesses, that being Leica Biosystems. And if Leica can come anywhere close to doing in digital pathology with Aperio what they were able to do at Vision Systems in advanced staining, I think we'll be very happy. That said, let's keep in mind that if you step back on just the spend here in 2012, at least the commitment, we're talking about $1.5 billion and I think just over $1 billion is outside of Life Sciences and Dental. So we're very happy with what we've done with X-Rite and Product ID. We've made some important additions to the Communications business at Tek Comms and so forth. So I think the intent is as it was. I think the funnel's in good shape. And if you look at the body of work so far this year, a couple of nice life science additions to be sure, but I think you see that intention very much playing out with the capital decisions we made.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And just as a follow-up and since we're on the topic of the M&A funnel and you and I have spoken about this before, but just like to hear an updated thought process about Danaher's potential interest in specific Software-as-a-Service type of businesses. And clearly, so much of Danaher businesses today already have embedded software whether it's Esko or Tek Communications. But are there opportunities for Danaher to look into specific stand-alone Software-as-a-Service? And what would be the mindset and evaluation expectations for those types of businesses?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, Deane, I think the short answer is yes. Because as you rightly point out, whether it's what we've seen at Esko, what we're increasingly doing at Tek Comms, software is not only a critical component of the value we create for our customers, but the business models around how we deliver that value are evolving and whether it's Software-as-a-Service or some of those other Web-based or cloud-based models, I think you are going to see that being of increased importance, and thus, interest to us. I suspect you can see us approach this not only inorganically but organically as well. We're a week away from completing our strategic plan reviews for all the businesses. This was a common theme of opportunity as we look to extend our hardware- or equipment-based value props in just a whole host of places, some of which you actually might be quite surprised to see. In terms of valuations, obviously, the valuation parameters we've talked about in the past, I think, are going to hold here. I don't think in any way we would see different business models really requiring us to depart from, frankly, some old school math in terms of cash-on-cash returns. But as we've seen thus far, as we look forward, we think we'll be able to do that. So I don't think you'll see 10 of the next 10 deals be SaaS-based transactions, but clearly that's the way the world's moving and those sorts of additions to the portfolio will be strategically important and I think value enhancing along the way.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jon Wood from Jefferies.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So Larry, thanks for the update on the Beckman top line experience there. Could you offer us an update on how the margin trajectory looks for that business as well as cash flow? Just where you are from a synergy perspective and how you're tracking relative to the plan you laid out at the December Analyst Day.","Daniel L. Comas","Jon, this is Dan. Maybe I'll add just a few facts and let Larry add a little bit of color. I mean, we continue to track quite well, up 400 or 500 basis points year-on-year. We will do the $120 million of restructuring in the fourth quarter. It will be broad-based, but Beckman and others will clearly be part of that and we expect some additional opportunity from that as well in terms of higher margins going into '13. As you know, in the procurement side in a regulated industry, things can take longer. That was part of our plan. We're making progress there. Again, you'll see some of that benefit. So we clearly will achieve the $250 million of cost savings that we thought we would have in '12 and believe there's another $100 million of costs to come out and margin improvement between '13 and '14. So I think we're pretty well positioned. From a cash flow perspective, it's just -- it's been terrific. We've taken out about $175 million of capital out of the business through the first 9 months of the year. That's on top of a pretty large number in the second half of last year. So the cash flow at Beckman has just been extraordinary.","H. Lawrence Culp","Jon, I would just add to that, that clearly, as you well know, the foundation of that strong initial financial performance is what we're doing from a quality, from a service perspective first and foremost. We've had a number of the key facilities, Brea, Chaska reinspected without incident. Very encouraged by that. Obviously, we've got the troponin submissions into the FDA. We were out a fair bit over the last 6, 7 weeks for some strategic reviews. We had the board out, in fact. Just the core DBS implementation around service calls and past dues. Service calls, for example, unscheduled calls down 20% from a year ago. Just a lot of good improvements that we see in our metrics there that customers are beginning to see. In the prepared remarks, we flagged the progress we're making on the growth side. Again, we're not going to try to get too far ahead of ourselves but encouraged by what we're seeing, not only in retention, but increasingly the [indiscernible] opportunities we get for new business where we are not the incumbent on the back of some of these improvements. And as we get outside of the U.S. and we get outside of Western Europe, clearly the high-growth markets continue to really contribute to the overall performance that we're seeing. We had, for the first time, all the Diagnostics businesses together out in Brea, looking at some of the strategic synergies, both top and bottom line. That was a great week to have Radiometer and Leica Biosystems in addition to Beckman together. So we're excited about where we are, but I'd say all the more excited about the future in and around Beckman and the Diagnostics group.","Operator","We'll hear next from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just a couple kind of random things here. Just back on margins, Test & Measurement, the decremental seemed very severe there. Was there something particular going on with mix or restructuring or something in the quarter? Can you just elaborate a little bit more there?","Daniel L. Comas","Jeff, the reported -- if you just look at the base numbers, it was almost 100%. But if you strip out acquisitions and FX, it was 60%, still a high BCM on that. It is our highest gross margin business and our highest BCM business. Clearly, we're doing some restructuring. We'll do more restructuring here in the fourth quarter. That's an element of it. We are also sustaining investments across a number of our T&M businesses. So I think as we get through some of the restructuring here in the second half, that BCM degradation will decline and again we're -- I think we're of the view that this is not going to be as pronounced a downturn as we saw a couple of years ago.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","So you are expecting the business revenues declining into the fourth quarter again?","Daniel L. Comas","Yes, we are. Yes.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And just back to the questions on Beckman. So you're getting a lot of year-over-year margin improvement, but did the margins improve sequentially? Obviously, the segment overall did have organic growth, although you had some weak spots, but the margins were down sequentially in the segment aggregate.","Daniel L. Comas","Yes, we were down, I think, 80 or 90 basis points. There was a little bit of -- there was a write-down of an investment that Beckman had made prior to our acquisition that impacted margins a little bit in the quarter. And the biggest impact on margins is the fact that Life Science was down not only at Beckman, but broad based we were down at LSD. So our Diagnostics margins were up year-on-year, but the sequential decline was really driven by Life Science where the core growth was negative.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And just on the restructuring, Dan, do you expect to get dollar-for-dollar payback next year or does it spread into '14? How do we think about that?","Daniel L. Comas","The $120 million, we should get about a $90 million payback. And maybe, maybe we don't get all of that in Q1, but by Q2 we think we'll be fully ramped on that. So we'll get the 95% of that here in '13 is our expectation at this point.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay. And then just finally, is there a desire to retire that entire 20 million shares that are related to the Beckman deal?","Daniel L. Comas","Well, you knew I'll give the same answer as M&A. I mean, we don't have a plan there. We will continue to look at it periodically and opportunistically.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Wanted to focus on a couple of the bright spots first. The free cash flow was exceptional and it sounds like from your comments, Dan, that a lot of that was due to Beckman Coulter. So I'm wondering how much of that 130% or so of conversion was driven by -- or has been driven by Beckman Coulter this year.","Daniel L. Comas","Sure. If you look at our year -- our 9-month performance where our free cash flow to continuing net income, it's about 140%. If I took away the $170 million of capital we've taken out of Beckman, it'd still be 130%. Now even if we own Beck, say, we're 3 years from now, we're not going to get $170 million, but we'd still expect, say, $50 million. But if I take that all, put it on the sidelines, we'd still be 130% conversion. We're seeing broad-based, very good cash flow across our businesses.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So the message is more to come from Beckman, but perhaps not $170 million?","Daniel L. Comas","That's right.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And Larry, how do we think about China here? Because China was up low-double digits versus fairly flat in 2Q. Do you feel that double digit is sustainable from here?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think, Nigel, we are more the beneficiaries of easier comps right now than we are any pronounced pickup in China. So we're thrilled to be back, printing double-digit deltas here. I suspect we'll be close to being able to do that in the fourth quarter again. But I think until we get into '13, until they're on the other side of at least their transition and perhaps are pulling a few more policy levers than they pulled this year, I think that's really going to be the dynamic. The comps will make us look better, but we'll be fighting for business virtually everywhere. The export base there, as you know, is soft, in part as a function of their exposure to Europe. We feel that probably most in Instruments, particularly at Tektronix and probably to a degree in Motion. We're very pleased again with both Life Sciences & Diagnostics as well as Dental. Don't really see any reason that, that would in a pronounced way slow and we would expect, given their 5-year targets, for that to be another highlight in '13. But otherwise, I think we're probably, certainly like many others, of a more cautious view in the short term relative to China, certainly in contrast to perhaps where we were in the springtime.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just finally, could you help us think about 4Q in terms of obviously September was a bit softer. How does that flow through into 4Q especially given that we got some tough comps coming up in 4Q? And then on top of that, we normally see a pickup in margins in Life Sciences and one or 2 other businesses. Should we expect to have some of that normal seasonality coming through?","Daniel L. Comas","Maybe I'll just, on the Life Science, you -- we're going to have -- they're going to get their fair share of restructuring in the fourth quarter in Life Science Diagnostics. But despite that, you'll see a nice sequential improvement here from Q3 and maybe broadly on...","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes, I mean from a top line perspective, Nigel, again, I think we're going to see or would expect the fourth quarter to come in pretty much in line with what we've seen here in the third quarter. But that's despite a 300-basis point easier compare. So I think there were a number of places where September showed a little bit of a push at the end, but not enough for us to get excited. At least, I think on balance, that might have been pent up from July, August, some of that perhaps is just typical quarter-end stuff. But I think we've remained concerned about the U.S. and Europe, particularly with respect to capital or bigger ticket discretionary sorts of things and we could see some of that get pushed again.","Operator","We'll hear next from Julian Mitchell from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question just really on pricing. So I guess, you called out that pricing was pretty good in Industrial, Tek and Environmental. I just wondered if the margins in Life Science and Test & Measurement, when you were talking about the sequential move down in Life Science and the heavy year-on-year decrementals in Test & Measurement, was there anything going on, on price? I mean, the volumes have obviously softened as you've gone through the year. Are you starting to see price get a little bit worse in any of the business segments?","Daniel L. Comas","I mean, Life Science price, Julian, was slightly negative in Q3. But I think that's pretty comparable to what we saw in the first half. Again, it really was more of the fact that you had your high BCM equipment business and Life Science being down organically really driving the margins. Probably a little bit of element to that in T&M, price probably a little bit more of an impact on margins. We were running probably about 0.5 point of price in the first half of the year and we didn't get any price in Test. It wasn't negative, but we didn't get any price in the third quarter. So that probably hurt us a little bit on the margin side in T&M.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the portfolio, I mean you've obviously announced the JV divestment will close early next year. When you look at the rest of the portfolio, I mean, are you sort of broadly happy with that? You feel that you've got out most of the areas now after the last 18 months and it's really just a question of how much M&A you do from here?","H. Lawrence Culp","I think that's broadly the case, Julian. I think as we look at the portfolio, while we would never say never, we would submit that over 90% of the revenues today are in our desirable growth platforms. So as we think about the next $1 billion, the next $5 billion of activity, it should be acquisitions more so than divestitures and again, hopefully, balanced across the 5 segments.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I know Beckman gets most of the limelight now from Tektronix, but could we maybe go back to Tek a little bit. I guess this is the fourth quarter of continuing worsening core growth. It was low -- down low single, down mid single, down high single and now down midteens. And maybe just dive into that a little bit and versus your expectations and the updates we've gotten over the year in terms of how you think that, well, past the integration now and how that business unit's kind of playing out from your perspective within the portfolio and whether this is just a cyclical issue.","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, yes. I think that when we look at Tek, we wouldn't -- I think any business within Danaher has a healthy list of improvement opportunities and Tek is no different, Steve. But if we look at the second half performance here and the outlook Dan just referenced, I think what we've seen is, frankly, that the technology end markets that we serve and some of the key geographies, particularly China, have been soft. We -- I think we're of the view that they would be firming up a bit, that we'd begin to anniversary some of those down comps and that would be helpful. But between what we're seeing in Tek and what we're seeing in China, particularly, that's not the near-term outlook unfortunately. So again, I don't want to suggest to you that we are executing flawlessly there. But I think it's largely a macro call and we want to get to work on the things we can control and ride out the macro as best we can.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Is it living up to your return on capital expectations in terms of how that's -- or is that getting pushed out even further at this point?","Daniel L. Comas","I mean, in light of the top line this year, it's getting pushed out. I mean, we're -- I mean, our communication side of the business is way ahead, but the top line on the instruments side has pushed that out.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right, okay. And -- but strategically, there are no sort of major changes to the direction of that business, right?","H. Lawrence Culp","No.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then maybe contrast that with some of the strongest performing accelerating growth from Product ID and -- we're seeing it in Product ID, we're seeing it in ChemTreat, we're seeing it in Radiometer where it's something like between 11 and 16 quarters of straight growth. That's been pretty significant. And in acquisitive areas also over time, how are -- what is driving some of that consistently? Is it the product introduction side that you're frequently referencing or how should we think about that?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think if you were to put those businesses on the table, Radiometer or even Leica Bio, you talked about ChemTreat, you talked about Product ID from BJ to Esko, you'd really break it down, Steve, I think, differently across the businesses with DBS being the common denominator. Better go-to-market execution in terms of what the marketers are setting up for the sales force and the way the sales force is executing in the field. New product innovation is very much an important part of what we're doing in those businesses, without question. But the third bit, which is still important, is what we do from a quality delivering cost perspective. Some folks think that, if you will, kind of shopfloor DBS is relevant, but whether we're going into the factory in Copenhagen at Radiometer or the service network at ChemTreat or even in the software routing labs at Esko, DBS has a lot of positive impact so that the rest of the business can really operate without a tremendous amount of friction. So we can kind of break down each one of those stories, but it's just, I think, day in, day out strong, balanced, continuous improvement in those 3 areas, which is driving the growth that you see. Certainly in Product ID, we get the secular benefit of broad exposure to supply chain, product security and more customized marketing trends, particularly in consumer goods. Clearly, at ChemTreat, we're benefiting from a fair bit of market disruption over time as well. In Diagnostics, particularly in critical care and in oncology, unfortunately, those are both growth sectors where Radiometer and Leica Biosystems, respectively, are exceptionally well positioned. So we get a -- we got to make a little bit of our own luck there, but we also think we face some broader secular trends there and elsewhere that are going to be good over the long haul.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. And just a final detail, the euro assumption that you have into the, I think, $0.01 in the fourth quarter from FX, could you just give us that your -- on your assumption?","Daniel L. Comas","Yes. I mean, it's just basically the $1.30 versus kind of the mid-$1.20s where it was over the summer.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Larry, did the second half of September, because I know that September is a very important month and often these quarters, there are swing factors in the final days of the quarter, did the second half of September or as the quarter played on or the month of September played on demonstrably weakened versus expectations in terms of the CapEx dynamic that you were talking about?","H. Lawrence Culp","I wouldn't say it was -- there was broad-based weakening that accelerated in the last week or 2, John, but we certainly saw some places where we saw some things push that we thought wouldn't in the last week or 2. But didn't try to tally it up to determine what that meant when the dust settled.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Were there any pockets of the portfolio that actually got a little bit better than expected?","H. Lawrence Culp","I think the consumables businesses or the consumable parts of a number of the businesses, again whether it's Product ID, even Diagnostics, were solid. I wouldn't say that we saw an uptick. There were some places where we saw POS pick up a bit. But I really wouldn't want to try to get into a lot of detail there, John, because I think it would be potentially misleading. I think we saw, by and large, that September uptick just wasn't enough and the tone out there, again in the U.S. and Europe, particularly, is x housing, x autos where we don't have a lot of exposure, it's just not that buoyant right now.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, that's fair. Can I ask you, you guys did a tremendous job of preserving profits in the last recession. This time around you're sort of in advance of a lot of companies in terms of restructuring and doing some more restructuring than previously called out. If the U.S. were to tip into, let's say, a mild recession, do you feel as confident that Danaher would be able to have as many cost levers to go after, if you will, to be able to preserve profitability the way you sort of did last time?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I certainly would say that we would have that intent, John. I think that when you think about the downturns as I think Dan was alluding to earlier, we're not in any way anticipating a post-Lehman, a post dot-com sort of downturn. If there's anything out there of that nature, we would expect it to be more muted. The operating challenge, of course, is to make sure that we're balancing what we do on the cost side with the protection of our organic investments, be they short term in terms of go-to-market or longer term around new product development. But that's always the case. I think what we've tried to do not only back in the summertime with the $100 million call out, now the 20% increase to that restructuring effort here this year is just to give ourselves more latitude in that regard as we think about earnings growth and long-term growth investments going into '13.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just lastly, Larry, given the deal you did in China and the downturn in China, is that shaking out more M&A opportunities for you there for whatever reason, maybe more willing sellers or just evolution of markets? How are you thinking about that?","H. Lawrence Culp","John, I think that's -- it's an interesting question. I think we're more optimistic today about our China M&A outlook than we've ever been. It's hard for me to pinpoint the root cause because the macro dynamics that you highlight, I think, are very much in play. I also think that our team's doing a better job. So it's really the combination, which I think fuel our optimism.","Operator","We have time for one final question, and we'll hear from Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So I guess just one big picture question, Larry. You said you expected 4Q to be similar to 3Q in terms of core growth, but obviously, as you mentioned, your comps get much easier. So if you think about sequentially, maybe thinking about those big buckets that you talked about, consumables versus instruments, is it the instruments that you expect to maybe be a little bit worse sequentially in the fourth quarter, or just kind of how you're thinking big picture about the sequential dynamics of the business.","H. Lawrence Culp","Good morning, Jon. You nailed it. If we break down consumables versus equipment, we would look broadly and say we think consumables, again, despite the comps will be in that 4% range. But we would -- we'd expect equipment and primarily, again, around some of the businesses that we flagged to be down slightly.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then if I can, just 2 quick clarifications. One, it was kind of hit on, on the Tektronix business and I guess you don't really have much more insight in the next 3 months or so as to what will happen there, but on the Life Sciences side, I was just a little -- it looks like AB SCIEX in 2Q and 3Q was kind of low-single digits. So I just want to clarify kind of what happened there. Was it more the Leica business because I think they're similar sizes, was it more the Leica business that was down worse than expected or did you expect that AB to be -- to grow even better than it did in the quarter?","H. Lawrence Culp","You're right again, Jon. It's principally the softness at Leica that is bringing down the overall number there. Sciex, as you can appreciate, probably has a little bit of pent-up business here with the timing of the launches come out of ASMS purely with the 6500. But on balance, it is a -- it's a Leica story.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then last one just quickly, how are you thinking about the medical device tax in '13 and maybe just either size it, I know it's under manufactured costs, so it's maybe not the full 2%, but I'm just -- and are you going to be able to offset that in any way? Just curious how you're thinking about it today.","H. Lawrence Culp","I was hoping to avoid any political questions here a few weeks before the election. But I think we're in the process of working through our options and the impact here, Jon, as we, I think, gear up from an operating perspective in the fourth quarter not only from -- with our '13 budgets, but frankly some of the more tactical considerations. Clearly, we need to be mindful as to what others do here but to the extent that we can pass some of this along, we will attempt to do that.","Daniel L. Comas","And Jon, I mean, we'll go through all the detail in our budgets here in November. But our kind of top-level look is if the full tax goes in and we're not able to recover any of it and that's not going to be our assumption, but just lay out the math, it'd probably be about a $0.01 a quarter hit. So $10-plus million a quarter hit.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. I know you'd talk about it more when you give guidance, but just people are already going to have '13 estimates, so just wanted to make sure we were clear.","Operator","That will conclude our questions-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Matt McGrew for closing remarks.","Matt R. McGrew","Thanks, Deana. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today.

Earnings came in above our expectations, thanks to the Danaher teams\u2019 very strong execution. ","Danaher Business System continues to drive superior margin expansion, increase cash flow and healthy top line performance in a modest growth environment. The investments we\u2019ve made in innovation and expansion in high growth markets drove share gains in many of our operating companies. Fluke, Hach, Veeder-Root, Radiometer, AB Sciex, Implant Direct and Esko are among the businesses that we believe outperformed relative to their markets during the quarter.","These share gains and the teams\u2019 execution also helped drive more than 85 basis points of core operating margin improvement in four of our five segments. Our cash flow performance is also very good, resulting in free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of a 128%. ","We are encouraged by our increased M&A activity of late, as we\u2019ve announced $3.3 billion of deals across our portfolio in the first nine months of the year. These acquisition will strengthen our dental, life science and diagnostics, environmental and Test & Measurement segments. ","Cultivation funnels across our portfolio remained full, giving us confidence in our ability to deploy our substantial M&A capacity in a strategic and disciplined way. So with that as a backdrop, let\u2019s get in to the details of the quarter.","This morning we reported diluted net earnings per share of $0.95, up 13% and representing another record third quarter for Danaher. Revenues grew 4.5% to 4.9 billion, with core revenues up 3%. The positive impact of acquisitions increased revenues by 2%, while currency translation reduced revenues by 50 basis points. ","Geographically, high growth markets led the way increasing high single digits. Despite the headlines in China, our businesses grew double digit, led by our T&M Instruments, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics and Dental platforms. Developed markets remained relatively stable and the US and Western Europe both grew low single digits.","Our gross margin expanded 80 basis points or approximately a $140 million to 52.7%. This increase in gross profit enabled us to increase our sales and marketing and R&D by nearly 60 million in the quarter and deliver 70 basis points of core operating margin expansion. ","Turning to our five operating segments, Test and measurement revenues increased 1.5%, while core revenues decreased 1%, primarily due to a decline in our communications platform. Reported operating margin declined a 170 basis points, while core operating margins decreased a 115 basis points. ","On Monday, you saw that we announced an agreement to combine our communications business with NetScout Systems to create a premier global provider of network management solutions for both carrier and enterprise customers. ","We are excited about this transaction which is the culmination of a multi-year discussion with NetScout about working together. This is a powerful opportunity to combine highly complementary businesses in a transaction that we believe will benefit all Danaher and NetScout stakeholders, associates, shareholders and customers alike. ","Danaher\u2019s premier troubleshooting, cyber security, and engineering solutions combined with NetScout\u2019s high performance monitoring technologies will give customers access to the most expansive suites of best-in-class product in the industry.","The combined company will offer even greater breadth and depth across both carrier and enterprise networks, expanding opportunity through innovation and growth and improving our customers overall experience.","We anticipate that this transaction will close in 2015, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory NetScout shareholder and other approvals. Upon close, our Executive Vice President, Jim Lico will join NetScout\u2019s Board of Directors, while retaining his responsibility to Danaher.","Now back to the results from the quarter, our communications platform core revenues decreased at a double-digit rate. High teens growth in our security solutions business was more than offset by a decline in network management solutions due to spending delays from a wireless carrier customers, primarily in North America.","Despite the revenue decline, we were encouraged by the positive order growth in the platform that we believe will continue for the remainder of the year.","At Arbor demand for Pravail enterprise security products grew more than 50% as IT Security customers continue to rely on Arbor to prevent and mitigate attacks on their networks.","Around the world conducting business has become increasingly virtual, and Arbor is responding with flexible solutions to help customers of all sizes quickly and cost effectively launch or expand best-in-class security solutions.","Fluke Network saw robust demand for its enterprise TruView system and portable network tools which were each up 15%. F Net\u2019s TruView system continues to receive industry recognition and we are honored with the 2014 Communications Solutions Product of the Year Award from the global media company, TMC.","Our instruments platform core revenue increased at low single-digit rate with growth in most major geographies. Fluke core revenues were up mid-single digits representing its highest quarterly growth rate in over three years. Growth was solid across most major product lines, led by calibration and biomedical which each increased double-digits.","Distribution [sell-out] [ph] remained strong globally, particularly in North America and China, where growth was mid-single digit or better. Fluke plans to build on this momentum by launching Fluke Connect in China later this month.","At Tektronix core sales were up slightly, with modest growth in point of sales in North America and healthy demand for power supplies and oscilloscopes in China.","Turning to our environmental segment, revenues increased 10.5% with core revenues up 5%. Segment core operating margin improved 85 basis points with reported operating margin down 30 basis points due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Water quality core revenues increased at a mid-single digit rate with strength in analytical instrumentation and chemical treatment solutions.","Hach executed well in a temperate municipal spending environment driving above market growth in both North America and Europe. Sales also healthy in China growing double-digits. This month, Hach will launch the SL1000 Portable Parallel Analyzer or PPA, a breakthrough system that dramatically streamlines water quality testing.","The PPA system is the only testing solution in the market that uses a disposable cartridge to improve ease of use and reduce the manual steps by over 50% in an EPA compliant drinking water testing environment. Importantly, it provides technicians of all experience levels with a fail safe way to achieve highly accurate and consistent results.","In Trojan demand for large municipal projects remain weak globally. Encouragingly, we received two Ballast Water Treatment system orders that will be installed in a total of 15 ships. We anticipate the delivery of these systems will start in the second half of 2015.","On the regulatory front, we received Alternative Management System or AMS acceptance from the US Coast Guard for a full suite of UU ballast water treatment product in July, this is a temporary designation that allows customers to use Trojan solutions in US waters, while our application for US type approval is pending. ","Gilbarco Veeder-Root\u2019s core revenues grew mid-single digits with real robust demands for our dispensers, vapor recovery products and point-of-sales solutions. Vapor recover sales grew more than 50% in China as businesses continue to work towards compliance with environmental regulations. ","In point-of-sale, North American customers are choosing GVR\u2019s reliable and affordable payment security solutions as they operate their systems in advance of the new EMV regulations that begin to take affect in 2015.","In the quarter, Gilbarco Veeder Root acquired FuelQuest a leading provider of fuel management solutions for suppliers, distributors and buyers of petroleum products. This acquisition further expands the capabilities of our Insite360 cloud-based fuel management platform by allowing our customers to remotely monitor fuel acquisition, planning and distribution. ","Moving to life sciences and diagnostics; revenue increased 4% with core revenues up 3%. Core operating margin was up 120 basis points, while our reported operating margin increased 100 basis points. Core revenues in our diagnostics platform grew mid-single digits. ","At Beckman Coulter, core revenues increased a mid-single digit rate with double-digit growth in immunoassay, urinalysis, and automation. Growth was particularly strong in China where revenues grew over 20%. Beckman received FDA 510 clearance for its Power Express Sample Processing System in the quarter, further expanding its world-class suite of automation products. ","The Power Express is a scalable, high speed system designed to automate sample processing in labs of all sizes across all core disciplines including chemistry, immunoassay and hematology. The Power Express is just one of several new FDA cleared solutions that will help our US customers improve efficiency and reduce turnaround time for critical diagnostic tests. ","Radiometers core revenues increased at a mid-single digit rate, led by more than 35% growth in AQT sales. High growth market sales were up more than 20% as we continued to expand our market position in China. ","Leica Biosystems core sales were up low-single digits, as mid-teens growth in high growth markets was offset by weakness in core histology instruments in Europe. Advanced staining instrument placements were particularly strong as revenues increased over 20% in the quarter. We expect our advance staining growth rates to remain healthy, as our growing installed base continues to drive sales of reagents and other consumables.","Core revenues in our life science platform grew at a low-single digit rate, compared to high-single digit growth in the third quarter of last year. Sales in the US and Western Europe were positive, but we continue to experience uncertainty in tender timings and funding in China. ","AB SCIEX core revenues grew mid-single digits with strength in academic, clinical and applied markets. We continue to expand our in vitro diagnostic offerings by launching the Triple Quad 4500MD and QTRAP 4500 systems. 4500 series offers greater flexibility, exception sensitivity and faster data acquisition affording doctors and patients quicker access to reliable and accurate diagnostic test results. ","Leica Microsystems core sales increased low-single digits. Our SP8 microscope continues to be very well received and drove double-digit growth for our Confocal microscope systems. ","Last Wednesday, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to three scientists including Leica long time collaborator and key opinion leader Professor Stefan Hell. Professor Hell and others were recognized for their work in developing a way to use optical microscopy to study the molecular processes in the living cells. ","This work is especially meaningful to Leica, as we collaborated with Professor Hell to commercialize the first microscope that uses this technology back in 2004. Remarkably, this is the fourth year in a row that Leica Microscopes have been sighted in Nobel Prize wining work, and we are honored that our products continue to be used to support this and in other important scientific research.","Turning to Dental, segment revenues increased 3.5%, while core revenues were up 2%. Our core operating margin increased 100 basis points and reported operating margin increased 110 basis points to 17.2%.","The team has done a terrific job in using DBS to drive productivity and improve segment margins over the past several years. In early September, we announced the pending acquisition of Nobel Biocare, premier global brand and a pioneer in dental innovation. ","Nobel Biocare has expertise in implant dentistry; digital prosthetics and software combined with our extensive capabilities in 3-D imaging, intra-oral scanning and digital restorative solutions will benefit both patients and dentists by further optimizing clinical workflows.","We believe DBS will make a significant impact on Nobel Biocare\u2019s performance by helping to drive further innovation, growth and collaboration with our other dental companies. We are confident that Nobel Biocare is an outstanding bid for Danaher and we look forward to working with this capable team. ","The purchase price of $2.2 billion equates to approximately three times revenues and less than four times gross profit, which we believe positions us well from a return perspective. The acquisition remains subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2014 or the first quarter of 2015.","Dental consumables core revenues grew low-single digits as healthy demand in China and the Middle East was partially offset by a modest decline in the developed markets. In the US, the sluggishness we saw in the second quarter continues.","Encouragingly, demand for our implant products remain robust increasing globally at a double-digit rate. Dental technologies core revenues were up mid-single digits, driven by demand for our dental hand pieces and imaging equipment globally.","In mid-September, we introduced the newest member of our family of Cone Beam 3-D imaging products, the i-CAT FLX MV for a medium field of view. The FLX MV allows dentist to capture a high resolution, lower radiation 3D image of the upper and lower piece. ","Our Tx STUDIO 5.3 software is also integrated in to the FLX allowing dentist to both scan patients mouth and prepare a full digital treatment plan from one location on a touch screen. ","In our Industrial Technology segment, revenues increased 2% while the core revenues were up 4.5%, core operating margin expanded 145 basis points and reported operating margin increased a 170 basis points to 24.3%. Motion core revenues increased a low-single digit rate, marking the second consecutive quarter of growth to the platform. ","Demand in the high growth markets was particularly strong, led by industrial automation in China. During the quarter, we completed the divestiture of our electric vehicle systems and hybrid product lines which had annual revenue of approximately $100 million. ","Core revenues in our product identification platform grew mid-single digit as Europe and the Middle East both thus saw double-digit growth. At Videojet core revenues grew mid-single digits, as a growing installed base of equipment and solid execution in service help drive high single digit after market revenue growth. ","During the quarter, Videojet launched its 1000 series of continuous inkjet printers. These printers featuring extended life printing core that reduces down time and enables customers to print almost continuously for five years. ","Esko also experienced robust demand in the quarter, with double-digit growth in our workflow automation software and digital imaging products. In September, Esko released its new packaging design and workflow automation software Suite 14. ","This comprehensive set of software tools helps brand owners interact with their global supply chains in the cloud in proving efficiency and control at every stage of the packaging, design and pre-production process. The reception of Suite 14 has been exceptional and over 1,000 customers have already upgraded since launch. ","So to wrap up, the Danaher team executed well this quarter, using the Danaher business system to expand margins, generate strong cash flow performance, and deliver higher than expected earnings. Across the portfolio our outstanding presence in high growth market, investments in innovative new products and focus on improving sales and marketing have helped our businesses continue to take share in their markets. ","As we plan for 2015, we remain mindful of the challenging macroeconomic outlook, including the recently strong dollar. Thus, we are continuing to invest in high-impact areas while also increasing spending on productivity initiatives to approximately $125 million in the second half of 2014. ","We believe our focus on growth investments and margin expansion combined with our robust balance sheet and M&A capacity position us to finish 2014 well, and drive long term results. ","We are initiating fourth quarter diluted net EPS guidance of $1-$1.04, which assumes fourth quarter core revenue growth similar to the first three quarters of 2014. so before we go to Q&A, I wanted to take a moment to share a few thoughts after the first six weeks of my time as Danaher\u2019s CEO.","When this transition began, I knew that Danaher\u2019s future was bright. I believe it\u2019s now firmer than ever. The caliber of our team, the depth of incredible talent, that deep commitment to DBS and our culture is second to none. Financially, our balance sheet has never been stronger, much as we have done in the past, and more recently with the $3.3 billion, we have committed so far this year, I look forward to channeling this strength to build upon our leading portfolio of companies.","At Danaher, we compete for shareholders and that is on the top of my mind everyday. We continue to look for smart ways to create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders such as this week\u2019s announcement regarding the combination of our communications business with NetScout, the recent divestiture of our electric vehicle and hybrid motor product lines, and our pending acquisition of Nobel Biocare.","As you know, we\u2019re always in the process of evaluating portfolio and our focus will be on acquiring smartly, partnering smartly and managing smartly. Lastly, our teams culture of continuous improvement using Danaher Business System will remain our primary focus, because that is who we are and that is what truly defines our competitive advantage.","Matt Gugino","Thanks Tom. That concludes our formal remarks, and we\u2019re now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll take our first question today from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Speaking of that, the equity market are telling us that there is bad stuff out there, but you guys don\u2019t seem to sense any panic amongst your customers or anything. Can you tell us if anything has changed in October, any activity amongst your customers, particularly in your more cyclical businesses like Industrial Tech or Fluke that folks are starting to hunker down a bit.","Tom Joyce","Scott it\u2019s obviously still pretty early here in October, and I\u2019m sure they are all watching their screens or reading the paper day to day, but I think the simple answer to your question is, no. We\u2019ve seen a start to the October here is pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve seen through the last couple of quarters, but that is certainly not to suggest that this environment unfolds day to day here. ","Those screens and those headlines won\u2019t start to influence people\u2019s behavior. Obviously over time we\u2019ve seen that happen, and frankly not that the last week has necessarily been the overwriting influence on us, but concerns over the macroeconomic situation, obviously the changes in currency, the shift and the strengthening of the dollar have all influenced the way we want to position ourselves going in to 2015. ","But again going back to the short answer to your question, no, we are not seeing customer panic in the order book at the moment. ","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay, and then the natural follow-on to that is the sellers, you know a bid ad spreads have been a little frustrating I think for most guys in industrial the last couple of years and the sellers have gotten a little, I don\u2019t want to call it greedy, but its certainly opportunistic. Have you seen your phone light up in the last couple of weeks where sellers might be a little bit more amenable to compromise. ","Tom Joyce","Again, I don\u2019t know that there has necessarily been any particular inflexion in the last couple of weeks or phone lines lighting up. But I would say that as the general direction we have seen some increased activity. We have seen I think the sellers interested in taking advantage of what are still some pretty rich valuations. But those same sellers are interested in the transaction. ","So I think we would generalize by saying that we are pleased with how the funnels are sitting today, the cultivation conversations are good and we seem to be making progress in some those conversations. So, directionally we feel pretty good about where we are. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Just wanted to pick up on the comments about what might be changing, and you are obviously planning for a pretty similar growth environment to what we\u2019ve seen both in 3Q and year-to-date. But I am wondering if the mix of that 3% is somewhat different and obviously Europe, there is focus attention here and are you projecting a weaker Europe, maybe stronger US; any change in the mix of that 3%?","Tom Joyce","I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say we are thinking about any dramatic shifts in that mix, but I would say there are probably a few things to note. I would say we\u2019ve seen and perhaps we\u2019d expect to see some marginal improvement here in the US. I would say while the European environment has been stable quarter-to-quarter, obviously there is a bit of concern out there right now about Germany and some potential slowing there. So as Germany goes as we know, sometimes Europe goes and so I think there is a reason for some caution as it relates to Europe.","More recently we have seen softness in Latin America specifically in Brazil, and of course the situation in Russia has changed the trajectory of that market. So I think when you put all of that together, and then you add some continued very good growth in China maybe not quite as high as over a long period of time, but certainly some continued very big growth.","I think you see some shifts on the margin, but we\u2019d still consider the high growth market to be the leaders, the developed markets sort of hanging in there. But maybe within each of those two major \u2013 that split, you might see some shifts here and there. ","Dan Comas","Nigel maybe just to add one thing on Europe. As Tom and I went through the strategic reviews here, over the summer and the fall, we actually think on a relative basis Europe\u2019s one of the places we are doing pretty well, and some businesses where we felt we were taking share, a chunk of that was in Europe. Hard not to be worried about all the headlines here in Europe, news about Greece today and their sudden rise again in interest rates, borrowing rates over there. But actually at a relative basis I feel we like we performed pretty well there. ","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay, so [Inaudible] some mug shakings there, that\u2019s pretty clear. And then just digging a little bit deeper, one of the hospital providers called out some benefits from the Affordable Care Act on their patient volumes, and I am wondering if you\u2019ve seen some benefits from that on your consumables, and then on top of that life sciences remains a great challenge in China and I am wondering if you have a line of sight of when that might start improving. ","Tom Joyce","So on the Affordable Care Act and the impact on consumables, first of all we are very encouraged by the progress that we are making at that, and I would say largely the progress we are making there and frankly across the entire diagnostic portfolio is very good execution across those businesses and those businesses I think are particularly Radiometer taking share and Leica Biosystems doing very well particularly in advanced staining which is an important area of future growth in one of the better market segments. ","We think utilization is probably marginally improved as a function of the Affordable Care Act, and I think there are some out there who would certainly say that the states with Medicaid expansion are the ones where we are seeing that uptake.","We are also seeing improvements in the hospital\u2019s balance sheets, with a little bit of pressure taken off the bad debt side. So you kind of put those things together and yeah there\u2019s a marginally improving environment there, but relative to any improvement beyond that right now, I think its probably still a little early to tell, but improvements on the margin. ","In terms of life science and in China specifically that\u2019s probably one of the most challenging environment out there today. You\u2019ve heard us talk and perhaps others talk about some of the delays in funding in the life sciences market, some of the concerns around compliance in that market that may be underpinning some of those delays, as China enforces what we believe are ultimately good policies for how that market will operate. ","But nevertheless, that is a market that continues to be a slow market today, and we don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily a phenomenon that\u2019s going to ease up here in the next couple of weeks, let alone perhaps even in the next couple of months. So I think we are sort of thinking that that could be something that continues to be under some pressure, a slower growth market, maybe into 2015.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Bernstein Research.","Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research","Tom may be a little perspective on Tektronix specifically; you know this is the first quarter in 11 quarters almost three years I suppose that where it\u2019s turned positive even if you said it was up low-single digit but slightly. Is this the start of something a little more significant, and what drove that turn, you know is there something fundamental that that\u2019s starting to shift a little bit in that business that you\u2019re seeing. ","Tom Joyce","It\u2019s obviously been a challenging time over a number of quarters, but we are very encouraged by what we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters and the change there. I think that team has executed very well. I think they have done some very good things from a product and from a go-to-market standpoint. ","Seeing two data points together is always a good thing to do on the positive side, but I think that\u2019s still a business that will be probably a low-single digit grower here over the near term. ","So I would attribute it a little bit more on the execution side that necessarily a fundamental shift to an inflexion point in the market. I mean clearly there are some things going on that will drive market growth over time, but I put a little bit more on the teams execution here more recently.","Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research","And you mentioned Ballast Water for Trojan, that\u2019s another encouraging sign. Is this just a one-off you think or something more significant again?","Tom Joyce","No, we would not consider this to be just a one-off. We would consider it to be just the beginning and early and very positive indication of the market acceptance, and I think its just important to remember that these regulatory approvals are really kind of threshold events for starting to bring this market to an inflexion point of higher growth, and so we are excited by the approval that we got, the AMS approval that I mentioned. ","But that\u2019s not as big a deal quite frankly as getting formal US Type approval that I mentioned that we expect next year. So more to come on that, very encouraging early indication of acceptance and it\u2019s I think an indication of good things to come. ","Steven Winoker - Bernstein Research","And if I could just sneak one more in on the separation all through this week, the value of the business combination you\u2019ve made abundantly clear. Just may be a little more thinking on the shareholder value of doing this outside of Danaher rather than within Danaher. ","Dan Comas","Steve its Dan, I think it\u2019s a reflection of our long held view, NetScout\u2019s long held view that there was a lot of increment \u2013 and this is a one plus one equals three. It\u2019s a little bit like our tools joint venture, but we think with a greater growth profile, and we just ultimately concluded this was the best way to affect that. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","So you mentioned Ballast water and I guess are there any other businesses may be Beckman perhaps that just from some company specific dynamics should perhaps look better at this time next year versus what they are doing now, just outside of the macro.","Tom Joyce","Steve I saw several opportunities that businesses had as I came through the strategic reviews that would point towards growth potential in a number of businesses. I think for example, if you think about Gilbarco Veeder-Root, and what we are seeing around the early indications around the customer baser moving towards compliance with the EMV regulations that I mentioned. ","I think that\u2019s an indicator of some momentum that we could see later in 2015. I think and you mentioned Beckman Diagnostics specifically. I think that Beckman continues to drive their improvements in quality, in service, in delivery and the overall customer experience, and then you combine that with some of the new product clearances and then the introduction of our molecular diagnostics platform [Barrettes] next year. I think that too has exciting potential for Beckman. ","So I think because it would be too outside and there would be a number of others if we walked across the portfolio. ","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Right, and from a macro perspective it sounds like this is 3% type of economy. It doesn\u2019t sound like you think even though you highlight the macro challenge that\u2019s out there, it doesn\u2019t sound like you think this is kind of a 1% -2% economy, this is just kind of a stable and steady growth type of environment we are in right now. ","Tom Joyce","Yeah, I don\u2019t think we want to go Chicken Little on here, but I think we want to be ready for what comes. We\u2019ve done that obviously over a long period of time when the cycles moved through, we try to anticipate where challenges come and we think there\u2019s some indications out there that would be challenges, but we are not trying to call a crisis here. ","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Yeah, and then one last question just on portfolio mix, by buying Nobel and doing this deal for the comps business I would assume this kind of reinforces the view that you guys aren\u2019t particularly stuck in a frame of mind that was a certain percentage from a healthcare and a certain percentage from industrial businesses. You are going to go where the opportunities provide the best strategic and financial returns. ","Tom Joyce","Steve I probably couldn\u2019t say it any better than you just said it. We are not stuck on percentages and we absolutely moved to where we can add the greatest value for our shareholders by making those portfolio moves that come our way and that we can make happen over time. ","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Is it too late for sellers to get something done by the end of this year or is everybody just kind of looking more towards \u201915. How robust is the pipeline?","Dan Comas","Steve it\u2019s not a tax driver here that \u2013 but on the margin here the last two or three months and just what we\u2019ve seen in the last four-five months has been encouraging regarding conversations. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. ","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Just a quick one or two; just on the sell side of things Tom, the NetScout deal is interesting right in an environment where its tough to buy perhaps it makes sense to sell a few things. So I just wonder, we are all fairly acquainted with your portfolio, but what\u2019s the prospect for other moves perhaps structured in different ways but kind of pruning opportunities in the portfolio. ","Tom Joyce","First of all it\u2019s important to recognize that there was not motivation behind the partnership with NetScout that had to do with it being tough to buy. We thought that was just a great opportunity not matter what as you might have expected. But we will continue to evaluate the portfolio and make sure that that our businesses are well positioned for the future. ","I think we have a tremendous portfolio today. I think going across the strategic plans that I did and not that I saw every operating company during the season but I saw all the major operating companies and certainly all of them from a platform point of view. ","And I think there\u2019s just a lot of potential that we have across the entire portfolio today. But that being said, you\u2019ve heard Larry say it over a long period of time that no business has a permanent home at Danaher, and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate whether each of our businesses is well positioned in the portfolio and if we see opportunities for smart partnering or an opportunity where that business is better served to be in a better place, we\u2019ll certainly look to make that happen. ","But in general I am thrilled with the portfolio we have today.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Right, and then I was just wondering if we could get a little additional color on just what\u2019s going on restructuring, just kind of a couple of questions and points around that.","Tom I think you said a 125 million in second half implying some of it started in Q3. I am wondering Dan if you can just kind of give us a little color kind of Q3 versus Q4 and if there is any change in deal cost and other things that are going on in the fourth quarter and may be just a little thought if you could on where the activity is taking place and what the payback might be.","Dan Comas","Jeff on the about where it\u2019s taking place, obviously a lot of communication to do here, so we are going to avoid to get in to specifics. But the 125 million largely, and that over 90% of this will be in the fourth quarter. Broad based, we would expect about a little bit less than a one year pay back. ","So on an annualized basis, we expect about a 100 million of savings and roughly $0.10 a share. Probably don\u2019t get all of that until we get to the end of the first quarter, given there\u2019s often some kind of lag effect, but found a lot of good projects here and obviously we made decision to execute upon them. ","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Any change in deal cost in it. ","Tom Joyce","Jeff I just might add to that, I think if Dan and I went through each of the individual businesses both during the operating reviews earlier or during the strategic plan reviews, it was clear that the businesses were already thinking ahead as to where those opportunities might be and how to take advantage of it. ","So we were really pleased with how the businesses looked broadly across the portfolio and came up with really a terrific group of projects. ","Dan Comas","And then Jeff just in terms of deal costs we highlighted some of that in July. I don\u2019t think its changed much clearly loosing the motion business and the earnings in the fourth quarter that\u2019s obviously in the guide here, we continue to work on the integration of the Siemens business that\u2019s going well, but we are spending money on that. ","The only thing that could be of significance that we would call it out, if we were to Nobel here in the fourth quarter which was a possibility, we would have some one-time expense which given the magnitude we would call out separately. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Just a question on Dental firstly, sort of earlier in the quarter you talked about US sell-through of consumables being a little bit better, doesn\u2019t seem to have shown up yet in your number. Is that something you think reverses pretty soon, and also dental very, very strong core margin improvement performance in Q3 that after a pretty weak Q2. What do you think is a kind of steady-state run rate on that dental margin trajectory should be?","Tom Joyce","On the dental consumables Julian, it clearly is a business that is still closely tied to what we think is a fairly slow growth macro environment, and so I think we are doing a good job from an execution standpoint I think, but clearly we don\u2019t have any tailwind from a market standpoint. ","So, we\u2019ve got work to do there, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything impressive, any more noteworthy than the environment in which that business is performing today. Dan will comment on the second on kind of an outlook on margins, but you are right to note certainly that it\u2019s a good performance from dental on the margin side in Q3.","Dental technologies in particular did a very good job on driving margins, some of that a function of things we did last year around productivity, some of that just continuing good work this year from an execution standpoint, and then a little bit of help overall across the segment from a mix standpoint with consumables despite the slightly slower growth that you commented on, generally providing a pretty good mix for the segment overall.","Dan Comas","And Julian in terms of margin, for the full year, and there will be some noise in Q4 obviously because of restructuring but from a core basis, we would expect core margin expansion in that 75-100 basis points core margin improvement during the year. You obviously saw more than that here in the third quarter.","It\u2019s a little bit hard for me to kind of quote a number here given the expectation of Nobel coming in, because we will have a lot of noise for a couple of quarters. But ultimately with Nobel what we have we think this is a 20% segment in four to five year from now. ","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","And then just on the outlook, you obviously talked about restructuring measures you are enacting now, and you talked earlier about the decent increases in SG&A and R&D in Q3 funded by the gross margins. Have your own spending plans whether OPEX or CapEx changed in light of the macro conditions that you sight or for now you are kind of proceeding as you were and you will just watch to be able to put closely for changes. ","Tom Joyce","Julian probably important to note here that we are just now entering in to budget season here, so we\u2019ll have work to do with each of the individual operating companies to understand how they are positioning for 2015. ","And one of the things we try to make sure we do through that process is to recognize that there\u2019s not a one size fits all across the portfolio when it comes to investment, where those gross margin improvements either come from and\/or where they get reinvested. So as we walk across the businesses we will be thoughtful as we\u2019ve always been about making sure that we are investing smartly in to those businesses that have the best opportunities, that they are at the best positions in their market and that\u2019s where you see [less] for example in R&D and in sales and marketing and perhaps some other spots you might see us stay a little tighter. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. ","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","Just a couple of quick questions, on Siemens is that transaction that\u2019s tracking on the timeline is that a first quarter close and Dan could you just give the IT integration expenses in Q3 and Q4 are those still kind of summing to may be 10 million but between the quarters. ","Dan Comas","That\u2019s directionally correct; I don\u2019t have them to break down. We just debrief with the Beckman team the other day on the integration and its going well and all our expectations are for a Q1 close. ","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird","And then also Tom just in terms of China we continue to put up some very nice double digit growth there as mentioned, and I think we understand the issues in the life sciences market place there and being regulatory and hopefully they clear sooner rather than later. ","But it feels a little bit contradictory, your growth in China coming in some of these more cyclical markets, T&M, I think motion was mentioned. It seems contrary may be to the macro perspective that people have in China. ","So do you attribute your double-digit growth to your initiatives distribution, sales, marketing or how do you reconcile that. ","Tom Joyce","Sure Rich thanks for the question. Jim Lico and I were together in China, I think its now two or three weeks ago for a number of days, and we\u2019ve sat with each one of our individual businesses, in many case I was sitting with businesses that I was less familiar with. ","But clearly I think what we saw was, we saw a very good group of people , an outstanding set of teams that are continuing to build commercial reach in those markets. We are seeing teams now putting innovation related resources on the ground, product planning resources we are adding to our local R&D presence, developing product for that local market and commercializing those product in ways that I think are helping to drive our growth. ","And you are right to observe that, that growth is coming fairly broadly across not just for example places where we\u2019ve talked about it in the past like Beckman Diagnostics that continues to do an excellent job. Of course that\u2019s a very big business over there, so that\u2019s obviously part of that growth, but it is broad based. ","The dental team for example, an outstanding over there that\u2019s continuing to drive double digit growth and that\u2019s not only good market but the team executing very well. So I think if you put that altogether and it\u2019s a good portfolio, well positioned in a number of good markets with good teams that are continuing to invest aggressively. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. ","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Just one follow-up question on the life science business; if I look at your comments here you did say a combination of pressure in China both in terms of the overall demand environment as well as budget delays. So I was wondering which of the two was may be a bigger factor just to give us an insight on what your visibility is on our recovery there heading in to next year. ","Tom Joyce","Isaac tough to parse what you described as budget delays versus overall demand. But if I were to try and generalize, we know that there has been and continues to be scrutiny over, particularly the larger tenders, the instrumentation related tenders, and whether you call that budgetary or you call it a demand, I am not sure. ","Now that being said there is another dimension which is, we are on a macro basis, our investments going at the moment, and clearly we see investments going in to the diagnostics that\u2019s more in the healthcare side of the house, and we are seeing obviously the benefit of that and our business is doing very well there. And perhaps that means slightly less in to the true research side of the house, but I think it\u2019s a little tough to parse that much more precisely.","Dan Comas"," I think I would say compared to 90 days ago, initially goes to kind of Rich\u2019s previous question, there are some parts in China that we actually incrementally feel a little better about. But I think to be fair on life science we\u2019d have to say we are incrementally a little bit more negative than we were 90 days ago. ","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s helpful. And then on T&M you guys have been (inaudible) tell a little bit expectations for a continued negative growth there in the wireless business in to 2015 so. So just wondering how broad based that is across to customers and just confirming that you don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue of market share just more of the environment. ","Dan Comas","We think it\u2019s largely an environment and I think that the thing that\u2019s kind of most encouraging here is we saw orders turn positive in the third quarter for the platform, and that trend actually looks pretty good heading here in to Q4 as well. The issue there is, we often get - some of that orders we actually get upfront payment, you see that in some of the numbers in our cash flow statement, but we actually won\u2019t book revenues for six, nine and 12 months out. ","So we are seeing a nice turn in terms of orders. The next couple of quarters are going to be challenged here, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s changed, but I think the outlook\u2019s looking a little better here.

Before we discuss our second quarter performance, I would first like to provide more details about this morning's announcement that we intend to spin-off our dental business into an independent publicly traded company. We expect this transaction to be tax-free to Danaher shareholders and to close in the second half of 2019.","We'll refer to this new entity as DentalCo for the time being and it will be comprised of Danaher's current dental segment, operating companies, which consists of Nobel Biocare, Ormco and Kavo Kerr. These businesses together generated 2017 revenue of nearly $3 billion, had gross margins of approximately 55% and EBITDA margins in the high-teens. DentalCo will be a premier global partner for the dental community with industry leading brands providing world-class innovation, service and solutions for customers.","We believe this business is well positioned in attractive markets with compelling secular trends that include improving standards of dental care in emerging markets, digitalization of the dental practice and the increasing importance of dental aesthetics and implant solutions.","DentalCo will have a global team of approximately 12,000 associates and will be headquartered in Southern California. The company's strong leadership team will include a number of experienced Danaher executives. Amir Aghdaei, who as group executive has had responsibility for our dental segment for the last 3 years, will become president and CEO of DentalCo.","Two other Danaher leaders will also serve alongside Amir on DentalCo's Board of Directors, while retaining their roles at Danaher. Dan Daniel, Danaher's Executive Vice President, currently overseeing the diagnostics and dental segments; and Daniel Raskas, Danaher's Senior Vice President of Corporate Development. In addition, our Chief Financial Officer, Dan Comas, will serve as a Special Advisor to DentalCo Post-Spin.","Over the past couple years we\u2019ve highlighted the progress that Amir and the team have made on a number of key metrics. They\u2019ve done an outstanding job of helping to better position our Dental segment for long-term success and what is recently been a challenging and changing market environment. This is certainly evident in Dental' second quarter results which will run through shortly. Through a combination of recent growth investments and productivity initiatives along with the team's strong commitment to continuous improvement and the Danaher business system, the Dental segment is in a much better position today than it was just a few years ago.","Since 2015, Dental's gross margins have increased by more than 100 basis points, while general and administrative costs are down nearly 50 basis points. We consolidated a number of operating companies from 10 to 3 and reduced the business's manufacturing and back office footprint, but 30%. Dental\u2019s R&D spend as a percent of sales is up more than a 100 basis points as we continue to invest in new product development across the portfolio.","And at Nobel Biocare, are nearly $1 billion implant business, we\u2019ve increased R&D spend by approximately 20% launched more than 25 new products and increased the sales force by 15%. These actions have put our Dental business in a better position to accelerate its growth trajectory and drive continued margin expansion.","So today\u2019s announcement is an important step towards realizing even greater potential for both Danaher and our Dental platform. We believe that our Dental business can be more impactful as a standalone entity with greater focus around organic and inorganic investment opportunities, including M&A, and that this combination to support an attractive earnings growth profile for the business going forward. This opportunity reminds us of the Fortive spin off, we completed a couple of years ago, which is generated a tremendous amount of value not only for the businesses but for shareholders as well. Most importantly and much like Fortive, we expect the Danaher Business System to continue to have meaningful positive impact on DentalCo.","Across Danaher, we\u2019re continuously committed to maximizing the long-term value for all our shareholders, customers and associates. And the establishment of our Dental business as an independent company creates a tremendous opportunity for us to deliver on that commitment. We look forward to helping Amir and the entire Dental team for success as they become an independent public traded Company.","As per Danaher, over more than a decade, we\u2019ve built our Product Identification, Water Quality, Diagnostics and Life Sciences platforms both organically and inorganically. These platforms share a number of common characteristics that comprise about standing brands of industry leading positions. Each of high percentage of consumables revenue that is considered captive to pursue mostly direct go-to-market strategies and they share attractive growth profiles. Our strategy will continue to focus on building around these platforms to strengthen our portfolio and competitive position as a multi industry science and technology company.","Now let\u2019s turn to our second quarter results. We had an outstanding quarter with the team delivering results ahead of expectations. We achieved 6% core revenue growth, healthy margin expansion, mid-teens adjusted earnings per share growth and strong free cash flow. Our performance was broad-based and we were particularly pleased this quarter with the number of our businesses that delivered 5% or better core growth. This marks our third consecutive quarter of 5.5 or better core revenue growth. And we believe we're taking market share across many of our businesses. These share gains are part of the payback we're seeing from recent growth investments and the team's strong execution utilizing the Danaher business system.","We're using DBS growth tools to develop and deliver better products for our customers, and in turn, enhance our competitive position in the markets we serve. You'll hear a few examples today of how we're doing this and taking share across our portfolio.","Turning to our second quarter results. Sales increased 10.5% to $5 billion with the impact of currency translation increasing revenue by 2.5% and acquisitions adding 2%. Core revenue was up 6% with 4 of the 5 platforms delivering mid-single digit for better core growth.","Second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.15, representing 16% growth year-on-year. We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow year-to-date resulting in more than 20% growth year-on-year and a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of 120 -- excuse me, 127%. Our outstanding cash flow generation sets us up well for additional capital deployment in 2018.","Geographically high-growth markets revenue was up high-single digits with China leading the way. In developed markets, we saw mid-single digit growth in both North America and Western Europe as both regions have gained momentum since the beginning of the year.","Our gross margin for the second quarter was 56.6%, an all-time high and up 160 basis points year-on-year, while core operating margin expanded 105 basis points. Our terrific margin performance was driven by a combination of higher core growth and good execution particularly across our Life sciences and Diagnostics platforms.","Now let's take a more detailed look at our second quarter results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue increased 16% and core revenue was up 7.5%. Reported operating profit margin increased to 18.2% with core margin improvement of nearly 300 basis points. This is the 8th consecutive quarter of more than 100 basis points of core margin improvement, driven by the team's outstanding DBS execution.","Segment Life Sciences delivered high-single digit core revenue growth with broad-base strength across prior clients and regions led by developed markets and China. Segment continued to benefit from strong new product introductions like CytoFLEX LX and flow cytometry and the Biomek i-Series in automation. These differentiated offerings coupled with the strong go-to-market focus and execution in biologics and genomics help drive Beckman's above market growth during the quarter.","At Leica Microsystems, low double digit core revenue growth was driven by strength across North America, Western Europe and China, and solid demand across all major end markets. Leica had positive results across each major product line with good momentum from new product launches like the ARveo Digital Augmented Reality Microscope which provide leading imaging technology for the most complex surgical procedures in the medical end market. Leica's effective application of DBS growth tools have helped the team develop several important new products and improve their commercial execution, a powerful combination that's been a key competitive differentiator for Leica.","Core revenue at SCIEX increased at a high-single-digit rate with strength in North America and China, driven by the pharma and clinical testing markets. The SCIEX team is focused recent innovation initiatives on attractive end market opportunities in mass spectrometry like biologics and food testing, producing unique workflow solutions but enhance our competitive advantage and drive continued market share gains.","At Pall, the team delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth with similar results across both our Life sciences and industrial businesses. Growth was broad-based globally and the team continued to build a strong order book across the business. Biopharma and microelectronics led the way each delivering double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. And we saw a good momentum in our process and industrial business driving mid-single-digit core growth and strong order trends.","Our most recent acquisition, IDT, is off to a great start and increased revenue at double-digit rate during the quarter. The team's DBS integration is already facilitating key commercial enhancements and cost efficiencies and we\u2019re excited about this early progress at IDT.","In our Diagnostics platform, reported revenue was up 7.5% with core revenue growth of 5%. Reported operating margin increased to 17.7%, including 150 basis points of core margin expansion. Beckman Coulter grew at a low-single-digit rate led by strength across high growth markets. By product line, our immunoassay and chemistry businesses continued to perform well. And we had several exciting new product launches in our hematology business in the second quarter, including the DxH 520 analyzer for low volume settings and the DxH 900 analyzer for high volume with a first of a kind early sepsis indicator.","These new analyzers are faster and easy to use with a much smaller footprint. The early sepsis indicator alerts clinicians to an infection sooner of critical capability given the life threatening nature of sepsis. These new hematology solutions are important additions to enhance Beckman\u2019s competitive position in the diagnostics market.","Looking across the rest of our diagnostics businesses, Radiometer, Leica, Leica Biosystems and Cepheid each delivered high-single-digit core revenue growth during the quarter. We saw continued strength in North America, Western Europe and China and growth across most major product lines at each of these three operating companies.","Across our Diagnostics platform, recent growth initiatives have focused on improving R&D and sales and marketing processes using DBS growth tools like accelerated product development and sales funnel management to help us develop and deliver better solutions for our customers. At Leica Biosystems, we've gained good early traction in a number of recent launches like the BOND RX Advanced Stainer and the PELORIS III Tissue Processing System.","At Cepheid, the team's improved commercial execution and continued menu expansion with new tests like the Group A's Strep Xpress test were key drivers of the business's double digit growth in developed markets. This combination of innovation and commercial improvements using DBS helps us expand and differentiate our offerings and contributed to share gains across these businesses during the quarter.","Turning now to our Dental segment. Reported revenue grew 4.5% with core revenue growth of 2%. Our operating profit margin declined to 14.3% and core margins were down 125 basis points due to continued investment spend and productivity initiatives across the platform. Our traditional consumables and equipment business grew for the first time since 2016 and we saw early signs of end market stabilization through the quarter. Growth in China and Western Europe was partially offset by modest declines in North America where inventory adjustments in the distribution channel moderated versus recent quarters.","Nobel Biocare led the way in specialty consumables with mid-single digit core growth, driven by good execution in North America and China. Our orthodontics business, Ormco, grew low-single digits. Last month, Ormco launched a full-scale clear aligner system in Australia called Spark, which has received very positive feedback from doctors and patients. Spark aligners combined at Ormco's market leading expertise in creating digital treatment plan with the highly aesthetic orthodontic treatment options. Spark enables Danaher to treat a broad range of patients including those with complex cases. We're pleased with Spark's initial progress in Australia and expect to build upon this early traction to expand our offering going forward.","Moving now to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue was up 11% with 7% core revenue growth. Reported operating margin declined modestly to 23% and core operating margin declined 50 basis points as a result of accelerated growth investment and productivity initiatives across the platform. We believe these growth investments have helped to sustain and expand our share gains across the segment.","In product identification, core revenue increased at a mid-single digit rate as we saw continued share gains in our marking and coding business. Videojet's core revenue was up high-single digits and all major regions and product lines generated mid-single digit growth or better during the quarter.","At our Water Quality platform, core revenue was up high-single digits with the strength of performance broad-based across our water treatment and analytical instrumentation businesses. Hach's core revenue increased at a double digit rate of solid momentum in both the municipal and industrial end-markets. Robust results in the high growth markets was driven by continued demand in China as a result of their active project pipeline. Additionally, Hach's recent innovation investments have focused on our offerings in servility, medical and software solutions. Recent product launches in these areas are helping to drive Hach's continued above market growth rate.","Last year, we highlighted Hach's rel0065ased of the Claros Water Intelligent system, a software platform that brings together instruments, data and process management to provide customers a valuable operational insight to manage their water processes in real time. The Hach team uses DBS growth tool like agile software development and commercial launch excellence to enhance Claros capabilities and functionality and to make important go to market adjustments that improve targeting and messaging to drive better commercial performance. Claros is just one example of how Hach is harnessing the power of DBS to accelerate growth and enhance Hach's leadership position in the market.","The chemistry mid-single-digit core revenue growth was driven by similar results across the developed and hybrid markets, by end market growth and commercial facilities and primary metals was partially offset by software results in chemical and food and beverage.","Lastly, Trojan\u2019s core growth was up high-single-digits with bookings and revenue growth continuing to benefit from momentum in the North American municipal markets. Good commercial executions and recent new product introductions are enabling the team to sustain a strong customer win rate and we believe Trojan gain further market share.","So to wrap up, we\u2019re extremely pleased our second quarter results. Our performance is a testament to the team\u2019s execution and passion for continuous improvement helping us deliver 6% core revenue growth, mid-teens EPS growth, 105 basis points of core operating margin improvement and a 22% increase in year-to-date free cash flow. We\u2019re particularly pleased with our continued strong performance on the top-line as DBS growth tools and investments and innovations are helping us to take share in many of our businesses. We\u2019re also very excited about our announcement that will be spinning off our Dental business into a standalone publicly traded company. We think this is an important step to help both Danaher and the Dental business realize greater potential and maximize value for our shareholders, customers and associates.","As we look ahead, we believe the strength of our portfolio combined with the power of the Danaher business system provide us with the foundation to deliver long-term shareholder value creation. We\u2019re initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.05 and $1.08, which assumes core revenue growth of approximately 4% to 4.5%. We are raising our full year 2018 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to a range of $4.43 to $4.50 versus our previous range for $4.38 to $4.45. And now expect to achieve mid-single-digit core revenue growth for the full year.","Matt Gugino","Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Kina, we\u2019re now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll now take our first question from Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tycho Peterson","A nice quarter. Tom, I want to start with the decision has been Dental now, I guess, given the market pressures, it seems a little bit early, I think the most of our investor discussions people expected this would come in the next couple of years. So I know you've a year to prep. But is this increased confidence in the market picking up? And can you talk a little bit about what needs to happen to get the business ready? And also any comments you want to make on M&A strategy post in and thoughts in a distribution channel 50-50 -- direct distribution rate model long-term for that business?","Tom Joyce","Tycho, good morning, and thank you. I think as you heard us update you over the last, really couple of years or more, we've made terrific progress in the business. And as happens in some challenging businesses and market situations, it does take some time but we are now seeing the benefits of that work. We're seeing those results and early indicators around improved cost structure. The growth investments that we made there are now generating some improved growth in our position in the market, improved competitive position. And I think if you've seen on a relative basis where we can show some outperformance. And so I think in many respects, this is really about the progress that we've made and getting our business to a point where we think it really holds a great potential for that progress to manifest itself and to get them on a shareholder value creation overtime.","In addition, I think from a market perspective, the dental market has clearly begun to stabilize. And we think a year from now it will be in an even better place. And so with another year similar to what we did at Fortive, we have an opportunity to get the team ready and to ensure that we have all the appropriate steps completed to be a successful profitable company launch just as we did with Fortive. As a standalone company and clearly off a smaller base, acquisitions in organic investments will have a magnified impact on the business, and of course you've seen that at Fortive as well. Acquisitions in the $100 million to $250 million deal range can really move the needle. And some of the investments that we've made organically around things like the IO scanner, the work that we're doing on clear aligners now, those are all going to be more impactful overtime.","So we think this is a great opportunity to create long term value for shareholders. It's got a -- what we think is a very attractive earnings profile coming off of low-single digit core revenue growth, solid operating margin expansion with opportunity, plenty of opportunities to go.","And in terms of your question about capital and M&A, we're going to set this up as you -- I hope you would expect as an investment grade business with the capabilities to deploy capital through M&A. And certainly in a way that it doesn't hold us back, we continue to be focused on deploying capital at Danaher over the next year and beyond.","So this remind us a lot of afford both in terms of timing and in terms of the long term shareholders value creation opportunity whether it's the comparison between the industrial cycle timing in the dental market recovery or the performance of our business getting better and being able to run the Danaher playbook consistently in an independent business.","Lastly, your question about distribution, I mean this is the business obviously that has a little bit more of a skew towards going through distribution. Albeit 50-50, Danaher post Dental would be more skewed towards direct more like 75-25, and the distribution channels always going to play an important part I believe in the dental business. But at the same time those direct businesses are superb. And we love those because of the intimacy they have with customers. So I think all in, while the channel structures may evolve slightly overtime, I think both the business and the market are in a much better shape today than they've been in recent times.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then for a follow up, I just want to go back to the quarter for a minute. And if you could just help us bridge the 4% guide with the 6% result, I know you're firing all cylinders, but can maybe just talk if they were sources of supplies are upside relative to your own expectations. Obviously Life Sciences did well against the tougher SCIEX comp, both Environmental & Applied up 7% as well. So can you maybe just talk through some of the underlying momentum in the businesses?","Tom Joyce","Sure. Well, I tell you we have terrific momentum in the businesses. As I mentioned 4 out of 5 segments clearly at mid-single-digits and above all of the segments in addition to Dental outperforming our expectations. Good performance. That was a combination of both commercial execution and new product innovation pretty much across the board. As it relates to how we look at the quarter ahead, yes, there\u2019s a little bit of moderation in our Q3 growth rate relative to Q2. There\u2019s probably a 100 basis points of tougher comp in Q3 versus Q2. And yes, as you say, we fired on every cylinder in Q2. And we think it\u2019s probably a little bit prudent to be a bit cautious in our outlook given some of the trade related matters. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get into this here shortly and then some of the broader macro uncertainties if you will. We still remain optimistic about the future. But I think the combination of little bit tougher core growth and it had bit of caution in the macro outlook was prudent relative to the third quarter and balance year guide.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And just to clarify the $0.01 to $0.02, is that from the tariffs and out of the $0.06 to $0.07 headwind in the back half of the year. Is that the right math?","Matt Gugino","Yes. The right way to think about that Tycho is on currency versus April, the strengthening of the dollar, probably hit our revenue, second half revenue, about $250 million at a 20% fall so that\u2019s about $0.05, and there is about a penny a quarter of transactional impact from the tariffs. Now that\u2019s before any counter measures and we\u2019re working on a bunch of things, but it's probably going to take a little bit of time for us to get some of those counter measures in place.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Scott Davis","I applaud the decision to spin Dental. It seems to work in the past 4 years so good luck with that. I wanted to backup a little bit. I can\u2019t recall seeing the stronger numbers out of Leica and Hach, just those two businesses explicitly you called out as having new products. And how does -- to help us understand that product cycle a little bit better, I don\u2019t remember in the past team that kind of outgrowth. Was there -- are there timing issues where in fact maybe we should see this moderate a bit or is there\u2019s been some or these products so different or special that this is somewhat game changing for likely better orders?","Tom Joyce","Scott these -- both Leica Microsystems and Leica Biosystems as well as Hach, our businesses that have strong track records over a long period of time of creating the market leadership positions that they have created on the back of exceptional products and product differentiation and competitive advantage. We have made some significant progress across not just these businesses but a number of businesses over the last couple of years in improving the approaches that we take to bringing in innovative ideas from the end user and then to execute on those ideas in a more timely and cost effective way. And I think what you're seeing not just in the businesses that you asked about but really across the number of our businesses, the manifestation of a couple of years of work in improving the execution from that front end to bring ideas in all the way to the backend execution and launch and commercialization. Leica, in particular, Microsystems has broadened their new product innovation scope beyond what historically has been a confocal launch cycle. And I think that's making a real different. ","At Leica Biosystems, what I mentioned there whether its microtomes, tissue processors, advanced strainers, all of those things are product of a number of process related steps using the tools of DBS to do those simultaneously as appose to somewhat more sequentially. And at Hach, a business that now it's focused much more on ensuring that we deliver higher quality answers to customers through data and data analytics, information and the clearer software system. I think you saw anything to combination of hardware, consumables and data and analytics that is further differentiating that business. So it's a variety of different things but I think the general theme across Danaher has been improving new product execution all the way from the frontend to the backend.","Scott Davis","Okay, fair enough. And then I know you -- it's early days in this pair of trade non-sense. But when I think it\u2019s some of your businesses where you're buying a fair amount of components from Asia or even shipping in from Asia to developed markets. Can you start to prepare the markets for price increases to pass that stuff through? I mean how -- if your competitors have similar dynamics, I imagine they do, but I don't know entirely. How do you start to think about at least whether it's through distributors or otherwise getting playing the ground work at least for the fact that you're probably going to have to raise the prices at some point?","Tom Joyce","Scott, as you can imagine we're sort of in the early days of all of that. We don't feel that we're in the cross-hairs of where they're really going after but, and in fact there is no one business at Danaher that has a significant impact, but it's a bunch of middle impacts across all the businesses and that adds up to that roughly sort of penny a quarter impact.","We're really thinking about countermeasures in four different ways: one would be price; two would be thinking about supply changes; three would be thinking about modification manufacturing locations because we can hit tariffs both ways U.S. to the China and China to the U.S.; and then fourth, there are opportunities sort to seek exemptions around certain areas around the tariffs. They've actually just outlined the process to do that. So I think between those four categories including price, it'll take us a couple of quarters. I think we'll be able to bring that number down. I think the broader question is here does it have a larger impact to the macro environment? And that's more of a -- that's outside the realm of my specialty.","Scott Davis","Mine as well. Okay. Thank you, guys.","Tom Joyce","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ross Muken","Good morning, guys, and congrats on both the fantastic quarter and the spin. Maybe first you called out sort of pharmaceutical strength look like math spec as well had a fantastic quarter. It feels like at least last event using gain share in kind of that market and you had really strong product momentum. Maybe just give us a little color on kind a how you're thinking about pharma overall given some of the noise in that market seems like you're growing right through it and it seems like also on the product cycle or share basis. That's an area for outperformance.","Tom Joyce","Thanks, Ross. We feel very good about the life science end markets right now. Generally, coming across the board, they look very healthy to us and we are executing quite well in those life science and market. Specifically around your question on pharma or biopharma, it is normalized, yes, is one way to think about it. A year ago, you saw some softness in that market, you saw issues with a couple of big customers, not just ours, but customers that were broadly served through the market, you saw some inventory adjustments. I think a lot of that is past now. So I think we\u2019re in a market that is sort of returned to normal. But normal in the case of biopharma means a very good growth market and you saw that based on the broad-based strength at Pall. Certainly the exposure we have the biopharma at Beck LS, at SCIEX and Mol Dev, all would indicate that things are very much tracking as you would expect in the biopharma market with double-digit growth in Pall, in the biopharma market led by continued strength and single-use technology. So I mean we\u2019re in a very, very good place in a strong market. ","On the broader pharma side small molecule continued strength in China certainly due to generic drug regulations. And I would say generally steady growth in the developed markets. Outside of those specific areas around LS, if you think about the applied market, pretty solid there certainly food testing continues to be a good market. The academic market is pretty solid, China up nicely. We don\u2019t have, as you know, we talked about this in the past. A lot of direct funding that comes from NIH. But NIH funding obviously trickles down to the market and the increase in NIH funding should bode well. And then in the areas where we have a bit more of, you might say industrially oriented exposure in life science. For example, if you looked at our mid single-digit core growth at Pall Industrial, good performance there. Market, I think, is pretty steady. But our performance continues to improve. So I think on balance, we feel very good about the life science end markets and specifically the ones you asked about. Geographically, I think, China continues to be the strongest area with double-digit growth there. We\u2019ve added terrific performance in China across the number of our businesses but life science across clinical academic and pharma is strong, in the developed markets pretty stable. And interestingly, just a side note, demand -- we had probably one of the best quarters in Japan we\u2019ve had in certainly, in any kind of recent memory. So on the life science side double-digit core growth so the performance there.","Ross Muken","And then maybe second, you\u2019ve done a number of upcoming interesting transactions last few years that were highly growth accretive and it seems like you\u2019re doing quite well. So maybe just an update on IDT, which seems to be after a very strong start in Phenomenex, it seems like Cepheid also had another good quarter. And how you feel like sort of post spin, it feels like the RemainCo, the traditional Danaher that this year would have been growing north of 5. How do we think about the new growth profile of kind of the business now, the Dental, which it had obviously a number of years of some challenges is going to be its own entity to kind of create value on its own? How do you think about what Danaher looks like from here on now the top-line wise at least?","Tom Joyce","Sure. As I mentioned very briefly in my prepared remarks and believe me I couldn't given them very more verbal high-5s. The performance at IDT has been terrific thus far. We're thrilled with what the team is doing there. It was a double digit recorded and very much what we expected. And I think that continued very good trajectory for that business. And we have lots of opportunity to improve the commercial execution of that business and continue to work on how we expand that business particularly geographically.","So we're off to a very good start. Phenomenex continuing to perform very well. And then Cepheid as you'd mentioned absolutely had a good quarter. But also again it's actually a challenging comp at Cepheid and still had a good quarter. And we expect to see Cepheid's growth rates pick up in the third quarter off the second quarter numbers. So I think each of the new acquisitions, which as you appropriately mentioned, have all been accretive to sort of the fleet average core growth of the business prior to your acquisition, all those are tracking quite well.","As we think about Danaher going forward, I think there are a number of factors that I think will contribute to improving our growth profile and are contributing today. Clearly, acquisitions, we just talked about those, but it is about our day in and day out execution as well in businesses that we've owned for some time. And we see continued good performances for businesses that we've owned for 3 or 4 years and businesses that we've owned for 10 and 12 years and more. And so that day in and day execution and, particularly around new product innovation that I just mentioned to Scott, is a contributor. We think we positioned the portfolio in exceptional markets, Life Sciences, Diagnostics, Water Quality, proliferation of packaging and packaging configurations around the world, all of those are terrific positions to be in and with the strong position in the high growth markets. And each of those secular drivers I just mentioned contributing in a magnified way in the high growth markets we think we have a great position there.","And then finally, the balance sheet remains in terrific shape. We will virtually paid off a good deal if not all of IDT already this year. And so the balance sheet is ready willing enable to get after continued deployment. And obviously our bias would be to continue to look for opportunities where near term and, certainly long term growth prospects are at or accretive to the portfolio. So I think it's a combination of things as we think about the portfolio ahead.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Thank you and good morning.","Tom Joyce","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Schenkel","In your prepared remarks you noted that Europe and North America have gained momentum since the beginning of the year. Are there any key end markets or product areas that are worth noting in a little more detail? And how would you characterize the outlook for this building momentum to be sustained moving forward, especially given some of the mix macro data coming out of Europe?","Tom Joyce","Doug, looking at geographically in the developed markets, I mean, it was pretty broad-based across the portfolio. Just thinking about a couple of businesses that just to name a few that grew double digits in North America in the quarter, in Life Sciences like Microsystems grew double-digits. The other businesses in North America were mid-single-digit growth or slightly better in the case of Europe life science businesses across the board, we\u2019re pretty well solidly in the mid-single-digits. If we look in Diagnostics, clearly Leica Biosystems performed well in both of those markets, Cepheid in both of those markets. So it\u2019s hard to pick out businesses where there was some particular weakness in the developed markets. And that\u2019s not to say that they\u2019re all at the same rate. But generally, as I look across each of the businesses there was quite broad-based.","Matt Gugino","Maybe I would add, clock tend to be a reasonably good bellwether because they get both to the industrial and to sort of the government, the municipal side of it. And they were up, I think, high-single-digits both in the U.S. and Europe in the quarter. Some of that's clearly share. We don\u2019t think the markets growing that well. But it does suggest reasonable stability in those regions right now.","Doug Schenkel","Okay.","Tom Joyce","If I look at another say broad-based player just in a very macro, in context, Doug, if I look at Videojet, mid-single-digit growth solidly, so in North American and actually double-digit growth in Europe, and that\u2019s in the quarter, I mean that\u2019s not necessarily the long-term there, but the point in time good performance.","Doug Schenkel","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just for my follow-up and quickly flipping through the 10-Q this morning, it appears pricing was more of a tailwind this quarter than we seen recently in both Life Sciences and EAS, anything to talk about there really. What were the key drivers? Was there anything related to tariffs say price increases that were dropped into the quarter although I would think that would be pretty early? And then how are you factoring this into guidance for the balance of the year?","Tom Joyce","Doug, that's unrelated to tariffs. I mean, we clearly are seeing the benefit on the industrial side and you\u2019ve seen that tick up both across our water and PID business. In the healthcare businesses, it has been more challenging. It was a little bit better sequentially. Those businesses, I think will remain challenging to get a lot of price and we\u2019ll continue to be leaning more on the industrial business for price. So I think it\u2019ll take a little bit of time but hopefully we\u2019ll get a little bit more price as potential offset to the tariffs. But that\u2019s not going to kick in here in Q3.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steve Beuchaw","In the backdrop of the really strong operational performance and interesting transformational opportunity for Dental, I wonder if we could get an update on a question that has been in a more to forefront over the last several months, which is capital deployment for RemainCo. I wonder to what extent it any does the management bandwidth commitment associated with getting Amir and the team ready to Spin. Does that in anyway impact your thinking about capital deployment? And if you could give us any broad-stroke views on how your views on how capital deployment should be executed this year that would be really helpful.","Matt Gugino","Sure, Steve. We remain absolutely committed to continuing to deploy our free cash flow and beyond in the interest of the 4 platforms that we will have in RemainCo over the next year. Life Sciences, Diagnostics, PID and Water all stand at the front of the line for capital deployment. And so that has been and will continue to be our bias. As was the case for every during the period, the similar periods, the year that we work to stand at Fortive, we continue to have that bias and focused on deploying capital. So nothing really changes about either our commitment to or our ability to deploy capital in the interest of those 4 platforms going forward. So we feel good about where the balance sheet sits today and we see some interesting opportunities in the pipelines that we continue to review.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay, great. Good to hear. And then just two very similar points I wanted to follow up on the businesses. First is a SCIEX, you called out clinical as a growth driver. Once upon a time there were some reimbursement changes that were tougher to clinical business. Can I take your comments to mean that is that part of the business in applied clinical to that not really working now subsequent to those changes maybe. Does that include any benefit from the Topaz launch? And then on Dental, I wonder if you could give us just an update on what you're thinking about organic growth or core growth for the back half of this year and given some of the comments that you made about the improving trends, stabilizing trends that you see in this space? Thanks so much.","Tom Joyce","Sure, Steve. So on SCIEX, you're right, we did comment specifically about clinical. And the reference that you made just for others on the call, I know, you're knowledgeable to Steve. Around reimbursement really had to do with what the industry knows and we referred to pain panels or pain management, and changes in reimbursement that go back couple of years now had an impact on portion of the SCIEX business associated with testing for pain management. And as that reimbursement change we sought some slowdown, some declines actually in that clinical business. We have rounded the corn on that if you will. We lap over those comps now. So to some extent we have an easier comp as that reimbursement dynamic is now behind us. And we'll see some incremental growth in our clinical business overtime. And yes, we're very pleased with how Topaz has come out of the blocks. So somewhat early days post that launch, but that and other new product introductions at SCIEX are continuing to contribute to good growth.","And relative to Dental going forward and in the back half, I think our view continues to be that that will be a low-single-digit growth rate in the back half. Again, we saw some early indications that we'll see some incremental growth and we saw that in the second quarter. But it still going to be a low-single digit growth as that market continues to stabilize. But our continued improvement in our performance associated particularly with new product innovation and good commercial work. We think even in the face of what may still be a challenging end market should certainly have us on an improving track.","Steve Beuchaw","Really appreciate all that. Thank you. ","Tom Joyce","Thanks Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Derik De Bruin ","Dan, good morning.","Dan Comas","Good morning.","Derik De Bruin ","Couple of questions. So just noticed that Cepheid grew high-single digits this quarter, which certainly is lower than it has in the most recent quarters. Just -- can you guys talk about anything unusual there comps just moving from that? And I\u2019ve got a follow-up.","Dan Comas","Sure, absolutely. And sorry, I just made a big -- just a path in reference to that, just a couple of minutes ago. Yes, Cepheid grew high-single-digits, actually, a number of very positive factors in terms of new customer acquisition and penetration of new products behind that high-single-digit number. But you\u2019re right lower than the trend line we had. That\u2019s really just a function of challenging comp in the high growth markets or what was formerly referred to as the HBDC or hybrid and developing countries arena. We had some pretty big numbers a year ago on that in one market in particular. And so we fully expected that Cepheid will return and we will see an uptick in that growth in the third quarter back to the 10% range or better that we\u2019ve seen in the past.","Tom Joyce","Derik, if you look at the business ex-HBDC and that\u2019s out of 20%, we\u2019re up mid-teens in the core business.","Derik De Bruin","Okay. That\u2019s actually the number that's why I was looking for. Great. That makes sense, because you know and if I remember correctly, big NDA order last year or China order?","Tom Joyce","Yes.","Derik De Bruin","Okay. That puts it into the perspective. And as we\u2019re sort of at mid-year, have you seen any pushback from hospital labs on due to PAMA, just sort of thinking about what capital spending at the hospital labs and just thinking about. Are they working their budgets that they're pushing back to some sort of update now that we have some time to digest?","Tom Joyce","Sure. They are clearly watching their budgets. And there are certain situations where we\u2019ve seen some pricing pressure. But I think as I mentioned, right, when PAMA became a reality, Derik, in many respects, this is sort of standard operating procedure in the diagnostics market at least in the large central lab. There is always been a basis for some level of pricing pressure, particularly when you are seeking either new business or renewing your existing business. And so there\u2019s certainly some of those dynamics aren't put, but in the overall scope of our Diagnostics platform and relative to margins, the impact is very, very modest to marginal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steven Winoker","Dan, I just, first want to follow up on the tariffs comments you made. That tariffs that you\u2019ve contemplated, is that the only the $50 billion so far or includes the other $200 billion on top of that?","Dan Comas","That\u2019s the higher number.","Steven Winoker","The higher number, okay. And presumably, should that go to the full about beyond the $200 billion. Have you take, right, not the demand factor. We can\u2019t -- and so we do not, I mean, I don\u2019t know if we can double it, we don\u2019t -- have you quantify that yet?","Dan Comas","We\u2019re taking it like you guys as it comes hourly.","Steven Winoker","Okay.","Tom Joyce","Sitting here at six blocks in the White House doesn\u2019t mean we get the info any quicker than you guys do.","Steven Winoker","Yes, I figure one of you withstanding outside sitting with there. Anyway, okay. So now on the Dental split, Tom, I understand the rationale for that. But one of the comments you had made and we\u2019ve seen it play out as the larger impact on M&A on a smaller entity when you do this and given the importance of M&A to the whole model and how that plays out. But why can't I extent that logic even further to the rest of what system side of RemainCo? In other words, if it's true for Dental, why wouldn't that be true for ENAS?","Tom Joyce","Well, I think, first of all we love those businesses in terms of their consistencies that those businesses have with the model across the portfolio. They have very similar growth profiles across the 4 platforms. You have very similar margin profiles. You have, in the most cases, much more captive levels of consumables associated with those businesses. And you have a science and technology orientation to those businesses that I think unifies them into a common business model. And so while you certainly can make a case that depending on the size of business, M&A can make more magnified difference in one versus the other. The commonality of the business model I think is what unifies the four platforms going forward.","Steven Winoker","Okay, that's very clear. And then just if I could on the business units on Pall, I mean, can you talk a little bit more about the puts and takes on the growth rate there around the different components? And particularly focused on some of the things that maybe kind of holding it back a little bit?","Tom Joyce","Well, I think we've seen as I mentioned good performance across Life Sciences with Biopharma very strong, single used technology is very strong. If it was an area in what we broadly describe is Life Sciences that wouldn't be really growing at quite the rates that we see in Biopharma and SET. It probably would be the smaller portions of the Life Sciences segment which are life science businesses at Pall which will be the lab food and beverage business and the medical businesses. And again those are smaller but obviously are not posting the same growth rates.","And then as I mentioned on the industrial side, really good performance in Micro that's been consistent for a long time. And then the fluids oriented process business, we're starting to see some better performance there and that's largely more a function of our execution. If there was a softer part of the industrial side of Pall, probably would be on the aerospace side. But we have a very strong competitive position there nevertheless.","Dan Comas","And Steve, as we've alluded to, bookings have been very strong. And part of that play down Q2. Q2 was 200 basis points better than Q1. And we expect another kind of comparable sort of step up here in Q3. So we feel a lot of momentum there and our shipments actually sort of understate what we're really seeing in the business today. As you know that can be a little bit more of the lag business.","Steven Winoker","Right, that's helpful. And then finally that core operating margin contraction in the 2 businesses Dental and EAS, in terms of you explained that that was investments and productivity spending, but how much longer should we anticipate that continuing?","Tom Joyce","Well, I mean, it's a little bit dependent on what we're seeing in the quarter because we saw a lot of strength by mid-quarter and businesses like Dental and EAS that had both productivity opportunities and growth opportunities, we sort to say go after to where things are trending well, so little bit of that dynamic. But I think on the EAS, we'll begin to sort to see that get better. Dental, we're going to be doing some things to really, to make like we did in Florida to make sure we're set up welcome next July.","Operator","Our final question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Brandon Couillard","Just one question on Dental. I would be curious to hear if the channel dynamics were still a negative drag on the top-line in 2Q? And if you could elaborate kind of on traditional consumables sellout trends in both the U.S. and Europe?","Tom Joyce","Sure. Brandon as I mentioned, I think we\u2019re in a much more stable environment right now, relative to the channel dynamics that you asked about. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks that what we talked about in the past about channel related inventory adjustments had moderated significantly during the course of the first half of this year. So I think the vast majority of that is behind us. I always had to take to say that we\u2019ve never seen the inventory adjustments. Again, because I think that the distribution channels always going to be somewhat sensitive the distribution based on what sellout looks like. And so I think, in general, we\u2019re in a much better place and the vast majority of that is behind us.","The realignment of the sort of the preferential exclusives or the unwinding of those exclusives is better said, I think now is largely behind us. There\u2019s still obviously some ramp of new sales forces in with different distribution partners could have an impact on growth rates. But in general, I think, that\u2019s starting to normalize as well. So I think when you take those things together and then you look at what was our core growth rate and some improving sellout, I think we\u2019re just in a much better place today","Operator","That will conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Gugino. Please go ahead.","Matt Gugino","Thanks, Kina, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We\u2019re around all day for questions.","Operator","That will conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect."],"6968":["Danaher Corp.

Today, we reported another record third quarter for Danaher. We are pleased with our team's execution which drove solid core growth, earnings performance and free cash flow. In a weakening global macro environment, we saw the positive impact of the Danaher Business System across our portfolio. Our consistent pace of new product introductions and go-to-market initiatives led to mid single digit growth or better for several of our operating companies, including Hach, Trojan, ChemTreat, Gilbarco, Radiometer, SCIEX, Videojet and Matco. We're also making steady progress on the separation front. This quarter we announced many key leadership positions for both NewCo and Danaher and began to identify new growth opportunities for many of our associates. With strong teams in place at both companies we remain on track to complete the separation in 2016. So with that as a backdrop, let's move on to the details of the quarter.","Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were up 6% to $1.05. Reported revenue grew 6.5% to $5 billion, while core revenues increased 3%. Acquisitions increased our revenue by 10.5% while currency translation was a 7% headwind.","Geographically, growth rates were balanced between the developed and the high-growth markets. Within the developed markets, the U.S. remained steady, growing at a low single digit rate, while Western Europe increased mid single digits as a result of share gains in a number of our businesses. In the high-growth markets, demand was mixed with strength in India partially offset by weakness in Brazil, Russia, and the Middle East. In China, growth moderated slightly from first half levels but still grew mid single digits in the quarter.","Third quarter gross margin was 52.5%. It increased 40 basis points, or 80 basis points excluding acquisition-related adjustments from Pall. Core operating margin declined 10 basis points and reported operating margin was 15.9%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, core operating margin expanded 50 basis points. Free cash flow for the quarter was $691 million, resulting in a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of approximately 115%. We expect this solid performance to continue in the fourth quarter.","We're also having a record year on the M&A front. In addition to Pall, we closed or announced nine acquisitions for approximately $650 million in the first nine months of 2015, bringing our total spend to over $14 billion. Our funnels at both Danaher and NewCo are strong and we expect to focus our activity on small and mid-sized transactions throughout the separation process.","In August, we closed the acquisition of Pall ahead of schedule, thanks to diligent work from both our teams. We're excited to welcome this iconic brand to Danaher and we're already impressed by the enthusiasm and commitment we're seeing as Pall associates begin to embrace the DBS process. Ultimately, we expect the thoughtful application of DBS tools and principles to result not only in an improved growth trajectory but in a better experience for our customers. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the $300 million of cost synergies we previously outlined and have financed the acquisition in an interest rate environment that is very favorable for highly rated companies.","So now turning to our five operating segments. Test & Measurement revenue declined 2% while core revenue increased 2.5%. Both reported and core operating margin increased 80 basis points to 22.7%. Our Instrument platform core revenue increased low single digits. At Fluke, core revenue grew low single digits as strength in our Biomedical and Calibration product lines was offset by weakening industrial demand in China and North America.","Tektronix revenue declined low single digits as solid demand in North America and Western Europe, particularly for our high-performance oscilloscopes, was offset by weakness in Latin America and Russia. Tektronix innovations continued to lead the market as we introduced several new products this quarter. Notably, we began shipping our new high-performance oscilloscope, the DPO70000SX, this quarter. The DPO offers the most accurate real-time performance and highest analog bandwidth on the market. It combines patented signal-capturing technology, compact design and highly scalable architecture to help reduce signal noise and distortion so electrical engineers can better understand and solve their most complex problems.","Moving to Environmental, revenue increased 1% with core revenue up 6%. Core operating margin expanded 185 basis points while reported operating margin was up 160 basis points to 22%. Our Water Quality platforms core revenue increased mid single digits with Hach, ChemTreat and Trojan all growing mid single digits or better. Across the platform, the Danaher Business System is helping our R&D, sales and support teams bring new products to market faster, convert leads to new business, and drive customer loyalty.","At Hach, this drove broad-based growth across all major product lines and geographies, including China and Latin America. As water becomes an increasingly valuable resource, our customers are more focused than ever on analyzing their local water supplies with the greatest degree of accuracy and simplicity. Hach's new products, including the SL1000 PPA that we introduced last year, enable customers to perform critical tests and analyze data more easily than ever before.","ChemTreat also grew across all of its major geographies, in spite of the challenging environment, revenue in Latin America grew double digits, thanks to the team's outstanding execution and quick adoption of DBS in our recent acquisitions Aguasin and Lipesa. Trojan also had a solid quarter driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American municipal market.","Turning to Gilbarco Veeder-Root, GVR had a strong quarter, delivering high single digit revenue growth as robust demand in North America was partially offset by a decline in China. In the U.S., double digit sales in order growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers continued as retailers began to implement new and upgraded EMV-compliant systems. We expect EMV regulations to drive demand at GVR for the next several years.","Now turning to Life Sciences & Diagnostics, sales were up 14.5% while core revenue grew 3.5%. Operating margin decreased 490 basis points to 10.8%, primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Margins were also negatively impacted by continued weakness in emerging market currencies and cost actions taken during the quarter. In addition, we continue to invest in feet on the street and new product initiatives to accelerate future growth.","Our Diagnostic platform delivered low single digit core revenue growth. Specifically at Beckman Coulter, core revenue grew low single digits driven by our immunoassay and urinalysis products. During the quarter, we launched the DxH 500, a low volume hematology analyzer designed for use in physician office labs. The DxH 500 offers fast, powerful data processing software and longer up time, saving our customers time and money and helping keep their focus on patient care.","At Radiometer, healthy demand in both high-growth and developed markets contributed to high single digit revenue growth. This marks Radiometer's 15th consecutive quarter of high single digit growth or better. All major product lines grew mid single digits or better, led by AQT, which was up more than 20%.","Leica Biosystems increased at a low single digit rate as strength in Western Europe was partially offset by a double digit decline in the Middle East. Demand remained healthy for both advanced staining consumables and our recently acquired Devicor business. This August, we celebrated Leica's 10-year anniversary as part of the Danaher portfolio. Over the past decade, Leica Biosystems has built a leading pathology diagnostics platform through a series of strategic acquisitions and organic growth investments. Leica Biosystems now generates over $800 million in annual sales and has nearly eight times the operating profit it had in 2005.","Our Life Science platform core revenue increased at a mid single digit rate. High single digit growth in the U.S. and double digit growth in Europe were offset by weakness in the high growth markets. SCIEX core sales grew mid single digits, driven by continued strength in our pharma and clinical end markets. During the quarter, we enhanced our QTRAP and Triple Quad mass spectrometry systems with the addition of the 6500+ series, offering revolutionary sensitivity, wider sample coverage and faster switching speeds, the 6500+ helped researchers detect more compounds to better understand disease, protect our water and food supplies, and develop pharmaceutical therapies. Customer reception has been very positive and sales since launch have exceeded our expectations.","Leica Microsystems core revenue increased slightly, as growth in the U.S. and Eastern Europe was largely offset by weakness in Western Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Orders were stronger, up mid single digits, with robust demand for our medical and life science products. We recently launched the DMV6 (sic) [DVM6] digital microscope for use in quality assurance, research and development, and forensics applications. With a combination of outstanding optics, intuitive operation and smart software, the DMV6 (sic) [DVM6] enables users to change objectives with one hand and process results with the other, all while automatically keeping samples in focus. In addition, it's offered in three configurations which help our customers find a solution that best fits their applications, workflows and budget needs.","Moving on to Dental. Total revenues increased 23.5%, largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition, while core revenue decreased slightly. As a result of this decrease, we saw a 55 basis point lower core operating margin while reported operating margin also declined 240 basis points to 14.8%. Nobel Biocare is approaching its first anniversary at Danaher and delivered another quarter of solid results.","Since acquisition, Nobel has delivered mid single digit average daily sales growth and over 150 basis points of operating margin expansion. NobelClinician, our implant workflow management software, has helped drive this success, and during the quarter, we celebrated our 10,000th Clinician [NobelClinician] customer. Within the rest of the Dental segment, growth in consumables was offset by a decline in our North American and Middle Eastern equipment businesses.","During the quarter, Kerr launched the SonicFill 2 in Europe, building upon the success of the original SonicFill by providing dental practitioners with more options for color matching and filling strength. Since its launch in North America earlier this year, the SonicFill product family has grown double digits. It remains the only single-step, sonic-activated handpiece that allows clinicians to easily fill cavities in posterior teeth.","Turning to Industrial Technologies, sales decreased 6.5% while core revenue was flat. Core operating margin expanded 20 basis points, while reported operating margin increased 10 basis points to 24.4%. Our automation platform's core revenue declined low single digits with weakness in North America and China. In North America, we experienced weaker demand from our distribution partners and have seen a contraction in capital spending. Product identification core revenues increased low single digits. We saw particularly strong demand for our marking and coding products. which grew mid single digits in Europe, and we believe we continue to take share in that region.","Videojet grew mid single digits with growth across all major product lines. Driving innovation in the market is a key focus area for Videojet and year-to-date, the team has launched several new products that help increase efficiency, improve quality and ensure reliability for our customers. During the quarter, Videojet expanded its thermal inkjet offerings with the launch of the m600 oem. The m600 was designed specifically for packaging machine builders in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics and food end markets, and offers a 60% smaller footprint, reduced heat emissions, and expanded control options for critical coding applications.","So, in summary, we had another good quarter, delivering solid core growth, free cash flow and earnings performance. In a challenging global macro environment, we've continued to enhance our businesses through organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions. As we move forward, we believe the strength of our portfolio combined with our team's steadfast execution through the Danaher Business System will help us deliver strong operating results and shareholder value for the remainder of 2015 and beyond.","Wrapping up, for the fourth quarter, we anticipate approximately 2% core revenue growth, which will be impacted by four fewer selling days versus last year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.29, which implies year-on-year growth of 12% to 15%.","Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Eric, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take the first question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, good morning, guys.","Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President-Investor Relations","Nigel.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just wanted to pick up on some of the guidance, Tom. It seems that September was weaker than the rest of the quarter, just maybe comment on that. And the 2% core growth as we enter 4Q shouldn't be a surprise, given the selling days pressure, but given the weaker September, is there a risk it could be a bit weaker than 2%?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Nigel, good morning. Overall, we have seen some incremental slowing in the macro. That being said, it's in pockets. There's some pockets regionally where we've seen some of that slowing, clearly, and in some of the more industrially oriented markets. We saw that in September. But I would not say we've seen some form of a step change in demand across the portfolio. In fact, we think generally, the portfolio is very well positioned, it clearly differentiates us.","And generally we think, when you look at the strength of the portfolio, when you look at the fact that we got the Pall closing done and we're getting after the opportunities that we have there, and we see the year-over-year FX impacts potentially dissipating as we move forward, clearly some weakening, but my inclination is continue to play offense. We need to continue to be cognizant of both the headlines and our trend lines, but our bias is to build on our strengths and despite some slowing here, we think the fourth quarter could largely be consistent on a days adjusted basis, anyway, with what we've seen here in the late going in September.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's great. And then just as a follow-on, we're seeing some of your competitors have stepped up restructuring as we enter 2016. Are we still on plan with the original guidance for restructuring or do you see the potential for maybe an uptick in 4Q?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Back in December, we laid out sort of the view of the year, and I think what's a little bit different this year is that \u2013 and in line with that guidance, by the way, we've done some things along the way. We haven't simply sat back and taken stock of things here in the fourth quarter, but instead, I think we've been better at having each of our businesses look for opportunities along the way.","So we've seen some activity going on throughout each of the quarters of the year. And while as we go through the fourth quarter, we may do a little bit more than we initially anticipated. Those plans are sort of still in the works here. But we think overall, that plan will be pretty consistent, maybe a little bit higher. Obviously, there'll be some Pall contributions to that activity. But generally, we think that will set us up pretty well for 2016.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, Tom, that's great. Thanks a lot.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Nigel, appreciate the questions.","Operator","And the next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Could we get a little more color on Pall and, in particular, what you're seeing in the Industrial businesses there as well as the Life Sciences? And then just also what are the kind of financial moving parts as far as profit contribution in the fourth quarter and then to the extent that you're either investing that away with restructuring or letting that drop to the bottom line?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, thanks, Steve. First of all, we're really pleased that we got the Pall closing done as we did. Terrific teamwork, I think, on the part of the Pall team as well as the Danaher team to get that done sooner than anticipated. We're off to a very good start. We have Rainer Blair, who many of you know from our Life Science business, in the leadership position over the business right now. We've added Danaher teammates to the Pall squad and teams are working well, driving both growth initiatives as well as cost initiatives.","Specific to your question, Steve, on Industrial and Life Science. On Life Science, we've seen continued strength, anchored specifically in the biopharma side of the Life Science portfolio, consistent with what we've seen historically in the business and consistent with our expectations. We have seen an incremental level of weakness in the Industrial side of the house. Again, probably to be expected, given the nature of the exposure to certain end markets in Industrial business. So incremental weakening, but understandably so, given those vertical markets.","Specific to the financial contributions, we will see some contribution clearly here in the fourth quarter at Pall, but obviously that will, in fact, be offset to some extent by any of the cost actions that we'll take and the investments that we'll make.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So you're investing that away. And what was the core for Industrial in the quarter?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","They were all up. Pall with mid single digits, with Life Science high single to double, and Industrial slightly negative.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then one last question. How was September for you guys?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","September was up about 2%, Steve. We thought it would closer to 3% and that kind of cost us 0.5 point overall in the quarter.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. All right, thanks a lot.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","The next question is from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning, guys.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Scott.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Tom, can you give us a little bit more color on Dental? And when you think about like \u2013 I can't do the math because I don't have the data, but if Nobel Biocare was up so well then the core underlying business must have been down pretty meaningfully. And you said consumables were strong, so basically means that dentists have stopped buying equipment. So I don't know this business well enough to know whether you get some strange buying patterns there or not, but can you give us a little bit of color on what are your sales guys telling you? Why are dentists not buying right now?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Scott, one point of clarification, in our core number, we are not including Nobel yet.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Oh, okay.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So on an adjusted basis, we would have been up low single digits, but I'll still let Tom \u2013 the question on why we were down slightly.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, thanks, Dan. Your question still has merit, Scott.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That makes me feel better.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, but let's go a little deeper outside. First of all, on Nobel, just a quickie. We're really happy with what's going on there. The team has done an excellent job. Average daily sales rates continuing to trend very well. New product introductions coming out on schedule with a strong cadence, great acceptance in the marketplace. Good progress across various regions. So all in, we're super happy with the start there and team's doing well.","But onto the core of your question, probably important to think about it in terms of the consumables side of the house versus the equipment side of the house. We saw better performance on the consumables side of the house. We've made a lot of progress, which we had talked about throughout the course of this year, on rightsizing inventories in the channel, driving some sell-out, and our performance there is really pretty good from the standpoint of what we're seeing in the sell-out data.","I'd contrast that a little bit to what we've seen on the equipment side. Where on the equipment side it's the inventory rightsizing in the channel that's taken us a little bit longer than we had anticipated. So that is a bit of a headwind there. And secondly, we did see some slowdown in equipment purchases, particularly in the high growth markets, where it's a little bit more project-oriented.","Now, the key thing that we look at, though, when we look through those numbers is we look at the sell-out numbers. And the sell-out numbers are \u2013 on a year-to-date basis, were in line with the market, certainly, so we think we're holding our own from a share perspective. But it's taken us a little bit longer to get where we wanted to on the equipment channel side and, again, a little high-growth market headwind.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And then, I had an interesting meeting with a financial sponsor yesterday who just commented that they thought the IPO option was dissipating pretty fast and that they wanted to derisk their portfolio pretty quickly, and this was a fairly large sponsor. It seems to be an environment where Danaher could really provide some liquidity and pick up some decent assets at good prices, but you did comment that you were looking at more small and middish stuff. Is there a scenario where you would stretch the balance sheet and\/or even tap equity markets if you felt like it was the right transaction, just given the dynamics out there?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think your question's framed in the right way, Scott. For the right strategic transaction, for the transaction, for the asset, the business that really strengthens us strategically that adds a level of competitive advantage, that provides a greater level of growth rate on a long-term basis, we would do the right thing from the standpoint of whether that's going into the markets, as we did so effectively to finance the Pall transaction, or set up the balance sheet in a way that would allow us to do that. So my comments should not mean to suggest that there's a bright line that's snapped at a certain point beyond which we wouldn't go. So it's all about the strategic value that can be created.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Fair enough. Good answer. Okay. I'll pass it on. Thanks, guys.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","We'll go next to Steven Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks and good morning, guys.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Steve, good morning.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. Hey, just first on the separation timing, I know you've obviously been very busy, you got Pall done early, what are the key hurdles to having that separation happen earlier? Is there a desire to do that earlier anyway? How are you thinking about that at this point?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Steve, two of the bigger drivers are filing with the IRS and getting a favorable ruling on key points and then, two, filing the Form 10 with the SEC and getting through that process. We're working diligently. I think there is a good chance, prior to the investor meeting, we'll have a better sense on whether or not we'll be able to try to pull this thing forward from our end of the year kind of current timeline.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then secondly, just perhaps a minor point, but maybe help us understand to what extent in all the major currency headwinds that you've called out, how much of the margin impact is really transactional in terms of maybe mismatched price and cost base? Help us maybe just understand how you're thinking about that in the quarter.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. I mean try to think through kind of a high-level example. So if you take \u2013 we've got $5 billion of revenues and 25% of that's in the high-growth markets, not all of that's in local currency, but most of it \u2013 call it $1 billion of it in local currency, that's just kind of a rough number. Through the course of Q3, if you look at the JPMorgan Index, which is they track the top 10 emerging market currencies, those depreciated 10% during the quarter, from the beginning of July to the end of September. So call that a weighted average of a 5% decline.","So you have a 5% decline on $1 billion of revenues, that's $50 million of revenues that we lost that we didn't think we'd lose at the beginning of the quarter. The dynamic on the margin side is in those high-growth markets, it's primarily sales and service and marketing people. So the lower local currency maybe saved us $10 million, $15 million of SG&A expense, but very little cost of goods expense. So you lost $50 million of revenues and you probably lost $15 million, $20 million of lower operating expense from currency, so you get a transaction effect of losing $20 million, $30 million of operating profit.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, fantastic, very helpful. Thanks.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","The next question is from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, thank you. Just a question on some of the other companies in the group, they sort of break out price, raw materials price, raw materials impact on margins year-to-date, and obviously it's been a decent tailwind I think for pretty much every company. Is there any color you could provide in the nine-month period, let's say, not just the quarter on how much of a benefit price raw material has been?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Julian, it's clearly been a slight benefit. We continue to get about 60 basis points, 70 basis points of price largely in our consumables business. But commodities \u2013 given our gross margin profile, commodities do not play a big impact on our cost of goods sold. The one area where I would have thought we would have actually gotten more of a benefit than we have is actually on the logistics side. Clearly, fuel prices have come down, but the transport companies have been pretty sticky about reducing prices. Now, again, I think as demand gets a little weaker here, maybe that helps. So it's been a benefit to date. But just given our product make-up, it's not been \u2013 the commodity side doesn't help or hurt us as much as most industrial companies.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you, and then just a question on China. Obviously, the last month or two, people are trying to see if there's any evidence of a bottoming-out in short-term demand there. Maybe just talk about how you have seen demand in the different verticals in the last three months or four months.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Julian, we've actually seen China, while slowing incrementally, it's still one of the better markets where we play today. Our growth rates continue to be very good in a number of our businesses. Specifically in our Diagnostic business, we continue to grow extremely well in China. We've seen some of the \u2013 some of the slowing that we had talked about around tenders for Life Science over a period of time, that money has freed up. Not perhaps to the same rate that we would have hoped by this point, but certainly, we're seeing a better environment for life science spending.","Our Environmental businesses continue to see terrific opportunities. And so I think as we look at China, we really continue to look at a number of sectors in that market where our businesses are extremely well positioned and where the sectors themselves are really quite attractive. So, clearly, the more industrially oriented you are, the more challenging that may be, but our Environmental businesses, our Life Science Diagnostic businesses are well positioned and we still feel very good about those. I think that's probably a market, as an example, where we really plan to and my bias is to continue to play offense. We'll be selective about where those investments go and target them to the higher growth segments, but in general, we're still constructive in that market.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thank you.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Hi, good morning, guys. So maybe a little bit more color on the pharma vertical as a whole would be helpful. I know you talked to Pall in the quarter obviously. There's been a number of sort of volatile events in the space, on drug pricing, et cetera and we've obviously seen a bit of a collapse in some biotech prices. And so help us understand, I mean, it seems like SCIEX had a pretty good quarter and obviously the biotech side of Pall did as well. So help us think through the market volatility and whether or not that sort of worries you at all relative to the demand side of things.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Ross. We continue to be bullish on those markets. Yes, obviously there's been some volatility, certainly, in those markets, certainly in terms of the way they've been trading. And of course, our exposure, as you mentioned, is largely in the Pall business as well as across our Life Science platform, and more specifically around AB SCIEX. Specifically, our pharma exposure in Life Sciences is about probably 20% or 25% of that business specifically goes into that market. In the case of Pall, specifically it's about a third of their business is bio pharma-related.","The growth rates there continued to be very strong throughout the course of the quarter. These are critical applications that to some extent are a bit insulated from the core volume side of what's going on inside of those facilities. In other words, whether you're making a large volume or a small volume, you're still going to be running that equipment and consuming some of our products. On the research side, the research investments, while they're shifting around a bit, continue to be relatively good. So I think in general, we're staying the course there and we think there's still great opportunities ahead.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","And maybe just dovetailing off of Steve's question from earlier, it's been an environment that's been difficult for you from an M&A standpoint last few years, but we're finally getting to a period where there's a little more volatility, if valuation has come down in some subsectors, seems like the timing may be fortuitous given when you can complete the spin next year. Maybe remind us around your activity level on tuck-ins during the last kind of market dislocation in 2008-2009 and talk a little about the trade-off of kind of completing the spin in due course versus the desire to sort of continue to add on at least more of the tuck-ins versus maybe anything larger.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I hope we're not looking at 2008-2009.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","No, obviously.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","During \u2013 obviously, that was a good period for us in that 2008-2009 period, we acquired almost \u2013 brought in almost 20 companies and not surprisingly, those are among our best returns for the company. I don't think we're heading into that, but the environment's getting tougher. We talked earlier about the IPO market being tough here and I think that bodes well, I think that bodes quite well for NewCo, given the choppiness in the industrial sector, given a little less competition from private equity. We've talked about roughly 2 billion of capacity the rest of this year and into next year. But as we get towards the end of \u2013 middle, end of next year, that number's going to jump back up a lot. So we're not \u2013 Tom suggested we're not shutting down, we're still working hard looking at activities, looking at possibilities both for Danaher and at NewCo.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ross.","Operator","We'll go next to Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Had a couple quick comments or questions on the Water Quality side of the business and maybe you can give a frame for us how you're seeing municipal budgets today. Everything I'm reading, it looks as though muni budgets are actually one of the growth markets at least for North America. So how are muni budgets favoring projects for Trojan, for example?","And then a second question on Pall, it's interesting that Pall, as you expect, you see the logo in the Life Sciences side, but it could have easily also showed up today in the Environmental logos, and be interested in how you're positioning Pall in go-to-market in Water Quality.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Deane. So specific to municipal budgets and the overall municipal water market as a growth market, it's interesting, right, because we could talk about it as a growth market today, everything's relative. We haven't historically thought of the North American muni market as a growth market on a relative basis, but today, it really probably is. To your point, it's growing better than a lot of other markets that are much more challenged. And I think the way I would describe it, Deane, is that in contrast to probably the last three years or four years where those budgets were flat or down, largely recovering from a pretty challenging housing market in so many areas around the U.S, today, we'd say those budgets are probably growing modestly. A lot of muni budgets are probably growing maybe in the 2% or 3% range, and that's 2% or 3% better or more than what they were growing probably in the last three years or four years.","So there are good opportunities there. They continue to contribute well to \u2013 certainly to Hach Lange as well as to Trojan. Specific to your question about Trojan, we have seen the bidding activity up this year and we've seen overall revenue converting that business \u2013 that bidding activity into revenue up this year as well. So probably one of the better markets where we participate today and clearly with leading positions, we believe we're gaining share in Water Quality.","In the Pall business, Pall does have a position in municipal water. It is \u2013 it's not one of their larger businesses, but we believe there are opportunities there. And we have a team at Trojan as well as at Pall looking together at where there might be cooperative opportunities. It could be on certain projects or certain opportunities relative to technology where bringing filtration as well as ultraviolet treatment together may be a great opportunity for a customer. So it's early days there. We're really just getting into the 100-day strategic plans across those vertical markets, but it is a good position to start with and we'll see what we can do.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, and just a quick question. What was NewCo's core revenues in the quarter?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Deane, they were a little bit under the 3%. So they were 2%, 2.5% led by both Gilbarco and Matco.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, thank you.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Deane.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys, good morning.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question on free cash conversion. what are the buckets for improvement in the fourth quarter? And also if you could give us an initial sense given that we've closed Pall, how much working capital contribution can we get in 2016?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Andrew, I don't know if we're looking at a very different dynamic in Q4 of this year versus last year. We did see a spike in payables at the end of the third quarter. That sometimes happens when we have a quarter end that's in the following month. So we actually closed a quarter in October as opposed to September 29, September 30. That should normalize back in the quarter.","We tend to have pretty good working capital performance as we get towards the end of the year. That should be another contributor. So I don't think \u2013 I don't see a very different frame than what we had last year. We're still working through the Pall numbers. We think there's some meaningful cash flow opportunities there, not only in the working capital side but also on the CapEx \u2013 managing CapEx a little differently there, but we'll talk about both of those more in time.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just a follow-up on separation timing. Did you change your disclosure language on the timing? Because the QNO (45:28) says in 2016, or is it the same language as before? Just to confirm, sorry.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't remember. What I'm continuing to say is our expectation is 2016, we still believe it will be the end of the year but that could change, and if there is a change, it would be to the positive and we'll know more here in a couple months.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","And the next question's from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, guys, thank you. Just a question on Beckman to start. If I just take a quick look at peers here like Abbott and Roche, some of them do seem to have core growth rates closer to the high single digit range. And so I'm curious, sort of, if I look back at my notes, you guys had an analyst meeting earlier this year and gave a lot of disclosure on the things you've done to turn around the franchise, but curious kind of what you need to do from here to kind of pace ahead of your comps there.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Isaac, thanks. We're continuing to make progress at Beckman. We track our customer retention and we track our win rates very closely on a month-to-month basis. We're confident as we look at the combination of retention and win rates that we're adding to our growth position as we look out into 2016 and 2017. Obviously, some of what we see in retention and adding menu to retained accounts as well as new customer accounts don't necessarily manifest themselves in the quarter in which you've won them. In fact, oftentimes, it may take six months to 12 months for those to materialize.","So I think we're confident we're continuing to make progress, strengthening the portfolio through new products, continuing to see good growth in the high-growth markets. But it's a journey, we still have work to do. We're not yet at the growth rates that we would like to see relative to the peer group. You highlight them well. And \u2013 but we are making progress and we're confident in the opportunities.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then maybe just a question on NewCo. Where are you in the process of sort of leadership selection and when might we know a little bit more about kind of how you're going to staff up the NewCo? Thank you.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we've publicly named Jim, obviously as the leader, but his entire L1 team with one exception has been named. They're all internal folks. And a fair number of people at the L2 level, the level below that, have also been named. So we're off to a good start on that front.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it.

Lawrence Culp","Matt, thanks, and good morning, everyone. Before we start, I'd like to take a moment to let our associates, our friends and the people of Boston know that they are in our thoughts in the wake of this week's most tragic and unfortunate news.","We entered the quarter with modest expectations regarding global growth, and that played out largely as we anticipated with our core revenue growth coming in at 1%. From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets, which represent 24% of our business, grew to high single-digit rate in the quarter. China was up low double-digits, led again by our Dental and Life Sciences & Diagnostics businesses, which grew in excess of 20%. Also encouraging was the double-digit growth we saw in our Water Quality and Product Identification businesses in China. In contrast, sales in the U.S. were flat, which was slightly below our outlook, while Western Europe, as expected, was down low single-digits.","Despite this low-growth environment, the Danaher Business System continues to help us drive share gains, margin and cash flow. In the quarter, DBS growth tools helped accelerate new product introductions across many of our businesses, and coupled with our go-to-market initiatives, we believe drove share gains at Kerr, Videojet, ChemTreat, Tektronix Communications, Esko and Radiometer. We were encouraged by our strong gross margin performance, up 50 basis points or $90 million year-over-year to 52.3%, which allowed us to sustain our core growth investments in both new product development and sales and marketing.","We remain active and optimistic on the M&A front. We announced the signing of over $300 million of new acquisitions during the quarter. With our strong free cash flow, ample balance sheet capacity and the proceeds from the recent sale of the Apex Tools JV, we now expect to have about $8 billion available for capital deployment over the next 2 years. So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter.","Today, we reported first quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.75, up 2.5% relative to the comparable amount in the first quarter of last year and representing another record first quarter for Danaher. Excluding the impact on prior year earnings of the Apex JV, net earnings per share increased 6%. Revenues for the quarter increased 3% to $4.4 billion with core revenues up 1%. Acquisitions increased revenues by 3%, which was partially offset by negative currency translation of 1%. Our gross margin for the first quarter increased 50 basis points year-over-year to 52.3%. Our reported operating margin in the first quarter was 16.4% with core margins up 20 basis points.","First quarter operating cash flow was $637 million, with free cash flow from continuing operations of $520 million. We expect full year free cash flow to exceed $3 billion. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio, excluding the gain on the sale of the Apex JV and the impact from $40 million of cash payments related to our fourth quarter restructuring, was greater than 100%.","Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues increased 1% for the quarter while core revenues were flat. While core margins were down 25 basis points year-on-year, segment margin saw a significant sequential improvement over the prior 2 quarters. Fluke core revenues grew at low single-digit rate, their first quarter of positive core growth since the fourth quarter 2011. Mid-single-digit growth in North American industrial end markets and high single-digit growth in high-growth markets was partially offset by softness in Europe and in other North American markets.","Last quarter, we highlighted Fluke's launch of the VT02 visual thermometer, which may you have heard about as it was featured in March in a broad nationwide range of radio campaign. Using DBS growth tools, Fluke identified a white space opportunity in an adjacent product category and developed this innovative entry price point temperature measurement tool with an integrated visual heat map to meet customer needs. We've been encouraged by the sales ramp of the VT02 in both the U.S. and Europe.","At Tektronix, core revenues declined at a low double-digit rate with continued weakness across many end markets. Despite difficult market conditions, we continue to innovate and increase the breadth of our product portfolio at Tektronix. During the quarter, we launched a multiphase PA4000 Power Analyzer, which will be used by engineers on the management for the development of high-efficiency electrical products, such as motors for hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles and household appliances. This innovative new product is Tektronix's initial entry into this adjacent high-growth segment.","Core revenues from our Communications businesses grew at a low double-digit rate in the quarter, driven by demand for both our enterprise tools and network security solutions globally. Tektronix Communications' low-teens growth was driven by demand for its mobile carrier network management solutions in North America and China. Arbor Networks network security solutions remain in very high demand as DdoS attack have increased in both frequency and size. Both sales and orders increased greater than 25% in the quarter as we won several new service provider accounts in high-growth markets and saw strong growth in our U.S. enterprise business.","Environmental segment revenues increased 4.5% in the quarter, with core revenues up 1%. Core operating margins expanded 45 basis points with reported operating margin flat at 18.6%. Water Quality core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate in the quarter. Hach Lange core revenues grew low single-digits with double-digit growth in China and the Middle East, offsetting flat demand in the developed markets. Healthy North American industrial activity, particularly in beverage and power, was partially offset by weaker U.S. municipal demand.","ChemTreat marked their 11th straight quarter of double-digit core revenue growth. Latin American core revenues were up mid-teens in the quarter as expansion efforts into the Mexican market continued to gain traction, including several large wins in the quarter with industrial accounts. Over the last 4 years, the Mexican business has grown over 300% driven by the best-in-class, go-to market initiatives.","Gilbarco Veeder-Root's first quarter core revenues were essentially flat in both the developed and high-growth markets with strong growth in Russia and India, offset by difficult comparison from prior year regulatory changes. We saw solid growth in our payment business in the quarter, with shipments on several large-scale rollouts throughout Asia. New payment technologies and innovations at retail service stations and convenience stores is an attractive growth driver for GVR. Highlighting this during the quarter, GVR announced a partnership with PayPal to develop digital payment and other mobile solutions for customers worldwide. Using GVR's Passport POS, customers will be able to pay using their PayPal account with their mobile devices, eliminating the need to carry cash or credit cards.","Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenues for the quarter increased 1.5% with core revenues up 2.5%. Segment core operating margins increased slightly, while our reported operating margin decreased 60 basis points from the prior year period to 12.7%. Our Diagnostics businesses saw a good start to the year with mid-single-digit core growth.","At Beckman Coulter, core sales increased at a low single-digit rate despite the impact of 1 less day in the quarter with growth in all major product categories. This marks the fourth straight quarter of low single-digit or better core growth at Beckman, with high-growth markets continuing to drive this performance. Beckman's best-in-class automation capabilities, an increase in the cadence of new product development and the significant quality and service improvements we've seen over the last 18 months position them well for continued growth. We anticipate low single-digit growth for the rest of this year and expect to be on track for mid-single-digit growth in 2014.","During the quarter, we launched 2 new products, the DxH 600 hematology system and the Power Express total lab automation system. The DxH 600 extends the hematology portfolio to better address the needs of larger-volume clinical labs. Power Express continues to enhance Beckman's leadership in clinical automation by enabling labs to connect multiple analyzers easily to improve workflow, increase efficiency and reduce cost.","Radiometer's core sales increased at a high single-digit rate in the quarter with growth in most major geographies and particular strength in China and the Middle East, which were both up over 30% in the quarter. Our AQT line was up 40% in the quarter, and we hit a milestone with our 1,000th instrument placement since launch. Last week, we closed a previously announced acquisition of HemoCue, a leader on hemoglobin and glucose point-of-care testing.","Leica Biosystems sales increased at a low single-digit rate in the quarter, led by double-digit core histology growth. Advanced staining revenues decreased mid-single-digits as solid demand in North America and China was more than offset by a decline in Western Europe, where we are transitioning from a distribution to a direct-sales model in parts of that region.","Our Life Sciences businesses core revenues increased low single-digits in the quarter. AB SCIEX core sales grew mid-single-digits, led by the applied and pharma markets. We've been pleased with a very strong uptake of our new 6500 Triple Quad and QTRAP systems since their launch late last year. During the quarter, AB SCIEX announced a multiyear collaboration agreement with the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle for the development of new methods in technologies and proteomics research using mass spectrometry. This research, led by 2012 National Medal of Science award winner Dr.  Leroy Hood, will help develop a new approach to medical care by redefining biomarker research and complementary genomics through qualitative swap proteomics analysis using the AB SCIEX 5600 TripleTOF. We are pleased to support both the ISB and Dr. Hood in this groundbreaking research.","Leica Microsystems core sales declined low single-digits with strong sales in Life Sciences, offset by weakness in industrial and medical markets. The recently launched SP8 modular confocal laser scanning microscope continues to be well received globally and was a strong contributor to growth in the Life Science market during the quarter.","Turning now to Dental. Our segment revenues grew 3% in the quarter with core revenues up 2.5%. Core operating margin increased 20 basis points, while reported operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 13.1%. Dental consumables core revenues grew low single digits in the quarter, led by our sales for general dentistry consumables and infection prevention products across most major geographies. In addition, our implant business was up mid-teens.","During the quarter, Ormco launched the Lythos Digital Impression System. Lythos allows an orthodontist to have a complete digital orthodontic workflow, beginning with the scanning of the patient's mouth through the creation of a 3D treatment plan to the custom design and manufacture of the orthodontic appliance.","KaVo core revenues increased mid-single-digits with robust demand for instruments and imaging products. KaVo launched 6 new products in the quarter at 2 of the largest trade shows in the industry, the Chicago Midwinter Dental Meeting and the International Dental Show in Germany. New products included the i-CAT Flex [ph], which allows for a full 3D scan at a lower radiation dose than a panoramic X-ray. In addition, Instrumentarium launched a CR reader, an easy-use, cost-effective phosphor plate imaging reader. We also introduced an innovative Twisted File Adaptive endodontic product, which self-adjusts between a rotary and reciprocating motion, providing the clinician with exceptional control during root canals.","Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment. Revenues increased 7% for the quarter while core revenues declined 1.5%. Our core operating margins expanded 105 basis points in the first quarter, while our reported operating margin increased 30 basis points to 20.9%. Our Motion businesses core revenues declined at a high single-digit rate in the quarter with the same weakness in most major geographies. Our sales into U.S. distribution were particularly soft.","Product Identification core revenues were up mid-single-digits with growth across all major geographies. Videojet enjoyed high single-digit growth in service and mid-single-digit growth in both equipment and consumables in the first quarter. During the quarter, we began shipping both the both the 1550 and the 1650 next-generation CIJ printers, which are targeted primarily at customers in the food and beverage markets, where predictability of uptime and avoidance of errors is critical. Initial customer feedback has been extremely positive on these new products, and we expect the placements will continue to increase through the balance of the year.","At Esko, core revenue increased more than 10% in the quarter, led by exceptional performance in high-growth markets, including Latin America and China. DBS continues to have a significant impact in driving growth at Esko. Using dynamic resource allocation to fund internally go-to-market investments in high-growth markets, Esko has more than doubled the feet-on-the-street in Latin America and China since our acquisition in 2011. Over the same period, sales in those geographies have grown in excess of 35%.","Revenues at X-Rite grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the first quarter compared to a year ago when it was a standalone company. X-Rite becomes part of our reported core number later this quarter. While still early, we're excited about X-Rite's contribution to the PID platform and the new collaboration and go-to-market opportunities that they bring. An example of this collaboration is the PantoneLIVE, where we recently launched 2 Illustrator plug-ins that were codeveloped with Esko. These plug-ins provide brand owners with instant access to essential brand color standards, as well as the PantoneLIVE Color Libraries directly from within their development software. Reception of PantoneLIVE in the marketplace has exceeded our expectations, with orders tripling sequentially from the fourth quarter.","So to wrap up, the year started largely as we expected. DBS has helped drive share gains, margins and cash flow in this low-growth environment. We believe our solid recurring revenue base, the structural cost actions executed in 2012 and the significant amount of capital available to deploy position us well for the balance of this year and beyond. We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.80 to $0.85, which assumes 1% to 2% core growth. We are also reaffirming our full year 2013 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $3.32 to $3.47.","Matt R. McGrew","Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. Lisa, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just starting off with the Life Sciences & Diagnostics margin. It was about 100 bps lighter than, I guess, we were expecting. Can you just talk about, a, kind of what the margin looks like at Beckman, and then if there was anything else that drove that weakness?","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. I think with respect to the -- what you're seeing there, Steve, is we knew, given some of the investments in the segment that we were making, particularly on the sales and marketing and R&D side that margins were going to be tight in LS&D. That said -- and I say that both with respect to the Life Sciences & Diagnostics businesses as well as at Dental. We had a couple of big trade shows in Dental, for example, that we had to work through. But that said, clearly the revenue picture in LS&D, particularly in LS, was softer in the end than we anticipated. And that certainly put some of the pressure on the margins that you see. But also in addition to the revenue, I think it's important to point out that we had a couple of not necessarily one-time but I think special situations in the quarter on the expense side that we think mitigate as we go forward. One was this conversion at Leica Bio with respect to the distribution to direct sales model. We had an opportunity to move forward in that regard. I think that made sense strategically. That didn't help us from a cost perspective and practically from a volume perspective as we worked through that late in the quarter. In addition, as the regulatory front evolved over the quarter with a number of the Diagnostics businesses, we had an opportunity to accelerate some of our spending ahead of submissions. And we thought again positioning ourselves to get those new products approved made sense, so we went ahead and did that.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So can you -- I mean, I guess R&D for the company was up 40 basis points year-over-year. I mean, 6.7% is a really big number. Can you let us know, I know you disclose it in your Ks, but maybe in LS&D, what was -- I would assume it was up a little bit more in than the 40 basis points.","Daniel L. Comas","It was. And it also -- given some of this distribution transition we're going through, some of the sales and marketing was also higher. We think that all sort of begin to even out here in Q2, so you'll see, I think, more normalized margins in LSD in Q2.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And can you give any kind of magnitude, Dan, around what the R&D was up as a percentage of sales in LSD?","Daniel L. Comas","We were up combined over 100 basis points between R&D and sales and marketing as a percent of revenues year-on-year.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That makes -- and then when you talk about these regulatory filings, I mean, is this just greater-than-expected spending than you would have initially thought as you fix the business? Or is this like -- are these like -- is this more proactive with new products?","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. Steve, it's probably somewhere in between. I mean, it really is about what we do and when we do it. So some of it is strictly timing. And at the same time, as we work through the plans for those submissions with the regulatory bodies sometimes, we'll -- as time marches on, you get a better sense of the scope and the work required. So we thought accelerating some of that spend wasn't frankly an opportunity, despite the pressure that you allude to here. And again, I think the stronger those submissions are, the sooner they're in, the better off we are relative to getting those products out and launched in time.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just one last question. It's probably a pretty stupid question, but I'll ask it anyway. I guess, with the day sales, with a comp on the -- a tougher comp on the weather, a lot of noise going on out there and some pretty terrible reports coming out so far. On a scale of 1 to 10, if 1 is 2009 and kind of 10 is the ideal operating environment, what do you think -- how do you describe kind of the current environment you're operating in? It's just kind of hard to tell how bad the trend is here. I'm just curious as to your high-level take on that.","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. Steve, I would say that we came into the quarter knowing that we were going to be missing a day. I think we came into the quarter knowing that Good Friday would be the last day of the quarter. So all of that was knowable. What we saw through the quarter was frankly that our consumables business, which, as you know, represents about 40% of our overall sales, was very much in line with our expectations. And if you adjust for the day that we missed and put aside all the end of March noise, I think we were good. I think where we fell a little bit short here with respect to the quarter was really in equipment, right? I mean, at 60% we thought we'd be up a couple of hundred basis points, and that's where we got squeezed, particularly in the U.S. as we saw some business soften in March when we thought we would finish more strongly. I wouldn't say it's bad. I think we saw the normal uptick in March, just wasn't pronounced in equipment again, in the U.S. principally, around some of the higher-ticket products. We've mentioned TEK. I think we've mentioned Motion as well in the distribution. So in the grand scheme of things, I don't think we're -- we're not necessarily excited about the macro numbers that came out here the last 3 or 4 weeks. But that said, we missed the top end of the core range by about, what, $30 million. If we'd hit that, I don't think we would be talking about some of the OP and EPS shortfalls here. But that's the way it played out. I think at this point, our sense is that while it's early and we don't have everything that we'll have in time, the shortfalls, again, largely a macro dynamic. March didn't finish as strongly as we would have anticipated. But on a relative basis, business-by-businesses, we think we're doing pretty well. I think as we look at April, things would come back in a couple of pockets in the wake of some of that end of March softness. But again, probably too early to read too much into that. Certainly, too early to read much into first couple of weeks of April relative to the equipment side of the business because while things get pushed to the right at times, it may just be a couple of weeks. Sometimes those customer decisions may take longer.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays Capital.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A couple of things. I mean, first, the big pullback you saw in Motion was a little bit of a surprise when you have that big of a negative. I mean, were the timing issues there that customers just wanted to destock? I mean, I think you mentioned some weakness in distribution, U.S. technology. Is that something that's going to restart here in 2Q? Or do we have some greater underlying weakness here that's more sustainable?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think that's -- it's a bit of a mixed bag, Scott, as we read it today. I mean, you mentioned distribution and TEK. I mean, I think those are 2 different markets for us clearly where we go to market through distribution. We saw soft sell-out as well as our own sell-in. Certainly, the TEK OEMs that we deal with tend to be customers we deal with directly. And we certainly saw pockets in TEK that were soft. I think our view is that as we look at the second quarter, if you wanted to pick a segment that's likely to be down, it will be Industrial Technologies. It will be down largely on the back of Motion softness. Certainly, not softness in Product Identification, which we think will continue to be one of our better-performing businesses here in the near term.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I want to move to 2 other quick things. I mean, the medical businesses have been strong a couple of quarters in a row here in China. Are you seeing that broadening out at all to the other businesses, like Fluke, for example, and the more shorter-cycle businesses?","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. We certainly saw, I think, a broadening of the strength in China. Again, the first quarter is a little hard to read sequentially, given the timing of the new year there. But that said, I think we were pleased with the overall print in China, both at depth and its breadth. And as we have worked through our reviews of late with our teams there, I think by and large, there are a few exceptions where guys aren't feeling good about the year, it's really more a matter of this point of calibrating what sort of growth to expect there. But they'll definitely, I think, be one of our better high-growth markets here and the rest of the way.","Daniel L. Comas","I'd say, Scott, on the industrial side, it was instead of all being down or flat, it was mixed. So I guess that's a little bit encouraging. PID and water had good real good start to the year in China. But I'd contrast that and talk [ph] a little bit of a positive sign, but I would say that T&M and Motion didn't -- their numbers were down and sequentially did not feel any better. So uneven but a couple of pockets a little better.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sure. And then just last question on price. When we have this type of a slow macro environment and it's been largely, probably 7 of the last 10 years has been pretty good pricing environment, now we're seeing some weakness in commodities. I mean, what's the outlook for price from here?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think the price outlook in and around a point of price as we move forward ought to be something that we should achieve. I think on a price cost equation, Scott, in general, pretty pleased. And clearly, having the gross margin up 50 basis points here, $90 million in dollar terms year-on-year, I would suggest we're executing pretty well, not only on the price cost side but also in terms of productivity, our Danaher wide procurement activities, as well as frankly bringing new products to market with higher gross margins, which give us the benefit of the mix up. So if there's one thing I think we're particularly comfortable with, it's that effect. And clearly, we'll get, I think, additional impact from the 2012 restructuring in the gross margin mix as we move through the year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just you mentioned $8 billion of capital available for deployment over the next 2 years. I think that's up from $5-plus billion that you used to discuss. Can you maybe talk about, given the current environment, how your -- where you're thinking about deploying the additional capital? And you obviously mentioned a one positive comment in the release. But give us maybe more of a flavor for how this might transpire.","H. Lawrence Culp","Steve, the $8 billion figure, in contrast to the prior frame, is really a function, I think, of being on the other side of Apex. Certainly, a look here at our cash position, which is strong, and our view of our cash flow now being $3-plus billion on an annual basis. And it's really -- it's just that simple. I think strategically as we think about capital deployment, our strategy is in no way changed. I think our view certainly continues to have a bias toward inorganic growth to supplement what we do organically. And we'd like to do that across the entire Danaher portfolio. So as you look today at the way Dan and I and the teams are working together, we're working, I think, funnels that are active across all of our growth platforms. Clearly, we're keen to put that capital work in that fashion.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And the acquisition that you just did, the $300 million one you announced in, I guess, February was in Life Sciences. I mean, how is the industrial pipeline looking or the non-Life Sciences pipeline looking?","Daniel L. Comas","Steve, I would say we're, one, encouraged by the number of discussions we're having. And I would say it's noticeably better than it was in the second half of '12, probably a little bit of a challenge maybe up to the last couple of weeks. Given equity markets, I do think some of this more choppy economic data of late, maybe including our own on the margins, could be helpful here in getting maybe some things across the finish line.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then on the top line or the implications for the second half, I think EPS implied, given your guide, is somewhere north of 10%, 11%. And top line, given your 1% to 2% in the second quarter, and this quarter at 1%, implies a very significant acceleration in the second half. How much are you thinking -- and that's obviously despite deceleration on many, many fronts across the portfolio. How are you thinking about that being, as opposed to just comp-based versus meaningful material underlying acceleration, all of these major growth investments that you've been making for some time now? Give us maybe some flavor for how you're thinking and talking about it and what's giving you that perspective.","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I don't think, Steve, that as we look into the second quarter, let alone the second half, that we're here pounding the table that things are going to get better in a hurry. I think what we're trying to do here with the second quarter outlook is give you a sense of our view out the window as to our operating environment and the way that we're going to perform. If you look at the first quarter, clearly we came in in the midpoint of the range on the bottom, a little short of the range on the top. I think that midpoint mindset, if you will, probably is what's most relevant as you think about the second quarter, let alone the full year. I think to come in at the high end of this range would require the U.S. to get a little bit better than at least some of the most recent data points would suggest. And probably, the strength in China would have to pick up a bit more so than the encouraging news that we've seen. And we probably would need to have Europe at least stabilized rather than being down a couple of ticks as it has been of late. I'm not suggesting that is our scenario. But as we look forward in this lower-growth environment, I think that midpoint mindset is probably what is most useful right now.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And I guess on that, I'm just looking for, given the many investments that you've been making in the top -- to drive the top line, if you -- to what extent externally can you sort of look at the payoff you're getting on those top line investments? And I know it's very hard to separate it from a tough macro. But what evidence are you seeing?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think in terms -- we look at those investments one by one by one, right, at the operating company level. So when we see the Dental team in China rapidly accelerating their growth and profitably so, it's an easy calculation to see those feet-on-the-street investments. When you see an uptick in R&D at Videojet and in turn the flood of new products that have come out over the last couple of years and in turn the profitable growth of returns and the market share gains at VJ, you know you're getting a return there. So not that every investment that you make is going to pay off, but I think by and large, where we are investing, we see that return not only in terms of the top line and the intended share gains, but frankly also on the gross margins.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just on Life Sciences and in general, first, just as you think about what next, I mean, one of the things that strikes me and certainly not being an expert in the area is perhaps the moves of Thermo and others are kind of fortifying kind of a distribution footprint that maybe you can't replicate. Do you view that as kind of a strategic issue to contend with? And just what is your view on kind of how maybe the channels are evolving?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, Jeff, that's probably a longer conversation than we might be do justice to this morning. But I think in Life Sciences in particular, we have a number of distributor partnerships around the world, including Thermo. But that said, the vast majority of what we sell in Life Sciences, and I'm specifically talking to the research side and the applied side of that portfolio -- that segment, not the diagnostics, we sell on a direct basis. I mean, these are not gloves and beakers that sell for 2 or 3 digits at a pop. I mean, we're talking about high-end, highly engineered, customized equipment that researchers, scientists spec out and really pushes on with respect to innovation. So those tend not to be distribution-oriented. Hence, any moves of consolidation you see there, I don't think, have a direct bearing on our competitiveness going forward.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. Great. And I was just wondering what you just said to Steve on the outlook was helpful. But just thinking about the second quarter.  I mean, you are basically guiding second quarter flat year-over-year but a little bit better revenue growth in Q2 than Q1, maybe some of this LS&D spending normalizes, perhaps some restructuring savings come through. What is working kind of against maybe those positives that pulled us at a roughly flat EPS result in Q2?","Daniel L. Comas","Jeff, part of it was in the quarter last year. We reported $0.84 last year, but we did call out $0.03 that's kind of one-time item. In addition, we had the Apex earnings. So absent those one-time items and absent Apex, clearly we're probably more like $0.79. So again, not talking a lot of increase, but obviously $0.80, $0.85 on a normalized basis is up a little bit versus what we really, operationally, we had last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So Larry, you mentioned a midpoint mindset, I believe. And I just wanted to clarify, is that more a core growth mindset? Or should we apply that to EPS as well?","H. Lawrence Culp","I think with respect to the quarter, perhaps the year, both.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just taking a step back. You've given some good color on the trading conditions in 1Q. But taking a step back to 4Q, obviously we have that unusual strength. And I'm just wondering how much pull-forward do you think there was from 1Q into 4Q.","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. I'm not sure that our view would be materially different today than it was back in the fourth quarter. Again, some of what we saw might have been a push out from the third into the fourth. So I think what we're trying to do, Nigel, business-by-business, is really take stock of the trends through that, if you will, at that 3-quarter period. But undoubtedly, we did see some softness in the quarter, I think, because of at least in Life Sciences and in Dental, some of the pull-forward. Was that 50 basis points? Was it a full point? Frankly, we haven't spent a ton of time there, let alone trying to figure out how much a day plus the Good Friday spring break dynamics at quarter end cost us in consumables. It is what it is.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. I know it's tough to try and organize [ph]. And then just you had mentioned $8 billion of surplus capital to redeploy. And if I go over the last 6 years and you're obviously back one, which was an unusual size, I think you deployed about $9 billion sort of the last 6 years. And I'm just wondering to deploy that sort of quantity of capital, do we need to take a big swing on the acquisition front?","H. Lawrence Culp","I don't think we see that $8 billion opportunity to deploy capital as something that requires the same check to be written. Again, I think as we look at that capacity, we really think about that as a backstop for all of these growth platforms that we have. So we've got 7 or 8 businesses here, all with their acquisition maps and funnels, and then working that accordingly. So I think our preference would be, if you're looking at $8 billion, to divvy up $1 billion to $2 billion across those businesses. And I think they all have funnels that would represent or present those sorts of opportunities. Now certainly, if something of size came along that made sense for us, we would look at it. But as you well know, if you look back over that time period, the bigger deals tend to come infrequently.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Larry, on investment, you talked about that you've got 4 consecutive quarters at low single-digit growth, nice and steady, but there's an expectation now that it ramps to mid-single-digits in 2014. So just talk a bit about what the drivers there. Is that a new product cycle?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think the view all along was that we'd have to pay off some of this inheritance tax. But by '14, we should be able to move into that mid-single-digit growth range. I really think it's nothing more than the cumulative effect of both the fixes, the quality, the service, in addition to the implementation of DBS, not only to drive cost out, but really to lay in the daily management to help drive better execution, both in sales and marketing and in new product development. As we move forward, as you see in this quarter with the launch of the DxH 600, the Power Express, we're going to get a better lift from those products. Certainly as we get behind -- we put behind some of the regulatory issues that we've had, that's going to be helpful. So I just think we've got momentum building at Beckman, momentum on a global basis, and that bodes well for that business.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then I guess it shouldn't be surprising that you called out Arbor because lots of headline news about cyber attacks. Can you just refresh us how Arbor's go-to-market strategy, how much of their product and software is off the shelf, how much of it is a customized solution and maybe the mix between government customers versus enterprise?","H. Lawrence Culp","Deane, we're well-positioned certainly in cyber security with Arbor much as we are in mobile around the mobile explosion that the carriers are enjoying. And that's on the Tektronix Communications side. At Arbor, I don't have the exact mix in front of us. I think we're more weighted toward carriers than we are enterprise. But the enterprise initiative has been clearly an important part of what we've done here in the last 2 years, and that's where we're enjoying some of the outsized growth right now as financial institutions and others wrestle with these DdoS attacks. That said, from a -- in terms of government, I just don't have that number offhand. It's -- I think it's a relatively modest portion of the business, but it is represented in the customer set.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And would this be a business that would be one of those looking for M&A opportunities?","H. Lawrence Culp","Oh, I think all of the businesses out there have their aspirations. Clearly, in security, we need to be smart about both the strategic fit of anything that we might do there, let alone valuations, of course.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jon Groberg with Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So Larry, first on the Tektronix business instruments, sounded like it turned down again to down low double-digits, if I heard you right, from I think it seemed like maybe it was starting to improve a little bit last quarter. Can you maybe talk about what happened there and what the outlook is? And also maybe in the context of that business, I think that's a pretty high gross margin business. So kind of how -- what drove the gross margins sequentially, given the weakness there?","H. Lawrence Culp","Jon, you're right. We certainly saw continued softness at Tek. And as I think both Dan and I have alluded to here, that was pretty broad-based. Certainly in the first quarter here, I think we saw that particularly here in the U.S. I think what we saw at TEK was really just a continued push right in our funnels in a whole host of areas. Certainly, a number of the customers that we serve on the development side in the Tek end markets are reworking their capital budgets for this year, a little unclear as to how that plays out. As you know, this business tends to track PMI a good bit on a couple of quarter lag basis. So I think we're optimistic that we get Tek stabilized later this year. But that said, it's going to certainly be a headwind for us all in the first half. Fortunately, we've got some offsets working for us in comms and at Fluke on a segment basis.","Daniel L. Comas","And Jon, on the margin side, the gross margin side, across the company, as Larry alluded to, we've had really good performance. Given Tek Instruments, as you know, is a very high gross margin business.  Gross margins were down year-on-year in Test & Measurement because of that. But in the other 4 segments, they were each up 50 to 75 basis points. Again that's a combination of some of the price\/cost dynamics, the restructuring, bringing out new products. We were really pleased at Dental; we were up almost 100 basis points year-on-year in terms of gross margin. And it obviously means good execution on the cost side, but as importantly, some of these new products coming in at much better gross margins.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. That's very helpful. Yes, very impressive gross margin. And then if I can, just 1 follow-up kind of on the Life Science side. And some of these smaller businesses, I know you mentioned advanced staining was down, if I heard you correctly. Actually, Roche had a really tough quarter in advanced staining, too. So can you maybe -- I know there's some reimbursement and other things going on there. Can you maybe talk about your outlook for that business for the year? And then on some of these legacy Beckman Life Science businesses that actually are more distribution-related to one of the previous questions, does it make sense to maybe look to divest some of those businesses, I'm curious?","H. Lawrence Culp","Sure. Let me take those in order. I think we continue to have a very buoyant outlook for Leica Biosystems. Unfortunately, cancer is an issue around the world, and we're hopefully part of the solution there. You referenced the negative control guidance in the U.S. We think that probably had a little bit of impact for us in the quarter. But I think the major issue that we alluded to at Leica Biosystems was really this distribution change. In parts of Europe, we're going from a distribution model to a direct model. That creates near-term noise. As you work through that, I think it's the right strategic move to make. It will help us grow faster in Europe long-term. But clearly, we saw revenue and cost issues in the quarter as we work through that. But that will settle out, we'll be in a better place. With respect to Beckman Coulter Life Sciences portfolio, they had a nice quarter. We have a business there that I think is improving. I was with them during the quarter. We installed some new leadership, promoted Jennifer Hunnicutt [ph] into the President's role there, one of our outstanding general managers. I think we're optimistic, Jon, about that portfolio, it's clearly, if you will, the forgotten part of the Beckman Coulter. There are a number of synergies with the rest of our group. And while you're right, a number of those products go to market to distribution, they don't go to market exclusively through distribution. And I think to the extent that we innovate, we build that brand, we're going to be able to certainly compete anywhere in the world, either on a direct or a distributed basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So Larry, back in the third quarter, equipment disappointed and consumables hung in. It was kind of a similar dynamic and it was also, I think, mainly U.S.-based. And then that dynamic basically reversed in the fourth quarter, so you guys ended up missing it in the third quarter on that and beating it in the fourth on that. Is there a reason why you don't think we might have a similar just choppiness but shift quarter-to-quarter this time as a reason something keeps you more cautious about 2Q and not expecting that kind of a, I guess, catch-up that happened 3Q to 4Q?","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. I mean, if you're reading anything in our language or tone in that regard, it may be a function of the March macro data that came out, let alone the fact that no fun being short even of a tight 1.5% to [ph] top line range. I think that said, again as we look at the second quarter, there'll be some things that certainly help us, having the benefit of that extra day, if you will, being on the other side of the holidays, et cetera. But I think we're going to be, as we typically are, cautious, hopefully smartly so, relative to the outlook here. I think we -- again, we look at the quarter, acknowledge some of the noise but don't want to point to that. On a relative basis, we think we're doing well. And that's ultimately what's going to matter. As we move forward here, we continue to do that and make sure that we've got our investment envelope properly tuned to the environment. Clearly, little numbers matter a lot when you're talking about a couple of hundred basis points on the equipment side that can move around as it clearly has here the last couple of quarters. But that said, I think, again, we're going to move forward here with a strong competitive position, thinking that the range that we've offered up this morning, again, the midpoint perhaps being the most likely scenario for the second quarter and the second half.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Yes, I mean, it does seem like maybe it's a function of the lower growth environment that your equipment sales are choppier than they used to be, I guess, right?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, again I think a couple of hundred basis points in growth is really the swing factor here. And it's been a noisy operating environment, as we've dealt with some of these external issues. But that said, the environment is what it is, right? So we're going to move forward.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Yes. No, I hear you. And then just quickly on China, I mean, so Med Tech remained strong, the industrial stuff, I guess, is mixed instead of all down. I mean, is there anything that's kind of taken a leg down or gotten notably worse in the quarter in China?","H. Lawrence Culp","I don't think so. We've been wrestling with these issues that Dan alluded to at T&M, particularly Tek more so than Fluke, and at Motion for some time. So it's continued to be soft. But I don't think we would characterize it as legging down in any way.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken with ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So where, if anywhere in the business, did you see any impact from sort of the sequester? And how do you sort of think about that as it relates to kind of what trend you saw in March versus April? And is there any degree you can give any anecdotal conversations you've had with either customers or peers to sort of understand how that's kind of also as an overlay influencing maybe the CapEx environment?","H. Lawrence Culp","I think certainly part of the softness that we saw in the U.S. and was probably most pronounced at Leica Micro, Ross, could be attributed to just some of the noise in and around the sequester. And again it wasn't as if budgets were being slashed, projects canceled and the like. Things were just getting pushed right because of, I think, a degree of uncertainty that seemed to play out. I think we certainly saw at SCIEX some softness in the academic realm as well. And it's really with those businesses that we probably have most of our sequester exposure in Life Science. We have pockets here and there of other government exposure which could play out Tek and Motion, for example, being areas where we have that exposure. But it would be principally in LS. And again, I think it's a noise factor for us right now as opposed to any part of a clear stepdown as we look out for the rest of the year, at least at this point.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","On the capital deployment front, it's been, I think, I have to check the figures for Q1, but I think it's been a fairly quiet M&A period overall for the market, x maybe in my space, the deal this week. But I guess as you're thinking about that environment, it seems like from your characterization, it's pretty active behind the scenes. And so I guess, as you look at sort of what you've been involved in and what you've looked at that hasn't come to market, is it price? Is it timing? Is it uncertainty? And then have you seen the mix of buyers you're competing against change, e.g. is private equity a much bigger component of the process now versus where they were 12 or 24 months ago? And how are you sort of thinking about that as a changing dynamic?","Daniel L. Comas","I mean, clearly, given the better leverage markets, again what's happened in the last couple of weeks probably dampening that a little bit, we're seeing private equity more in different situations. Where we have a strong point of view about what we can do with the margin, which is I said 3 out of 4 times, let's say, private equity is probably not going to be able to displace someone like ourselves. In terms of the activity, I think the way you'd characterize it and I would think that's something we hear from not only what we're seeing but we hear from kind of bankers is the behind-the-scene discussion levels are definitely up versus where they were 6 months ago, and I think that's encouraging. Now why things don't happen, it's all over the place.  It's sometimes price, it's sometimes transition issues, it's uncertainty. But normally, when we tend to see an increase in the number of discussions we're having about mid to large situations, historically, that tends to roll out into some acquisitions.","H. Lawrence Culp","Ross, I would just add to Dan's comments that if you think about situations that we've looked at where we've ultimately decided to let things go.  The strategic fit, the strategic rationale is really important for us. It's got to make sense in terms of the broader strategy. And particularly in this low-rate environment, we're still, I think, primarily focused on those returns on capital as opposed to accretion. And that really has been, I think, the frame we've used over time to deploy capital. Sometimes it's led us to be quite busy and bunched up, and other times, maybe a little quieter than folks expect. But with our portfolio taking a long view through the cycle, we've tended to, I think, by and large, make good bets that have generated good returns for shareholders. I think we continue to hold that view as we look forward.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Absolutely. And maybe just one quick last one on that. I mean, to your point on return on capital versus accretion makes total sense. I mean, given your view on the year and stocks off another couple of percent today, how are you guys thinking about sort of share repurchases? And I know you bought a bit at the end of last year and then stopped. And so I'm just trying to get a sense for sort of your sensitivity and feeling on sort of the intrinsic value and your sort of openness if we go through another soft patch to maybe reconsider again sort of reentering the market.","Daniel L. Comas","Well, I think you characterized it well. We're always looking at it. We look at it opportunistically and from what sort of return sort of payback and buying back our own stock. Again, having said that, given what we potentially see on the M&A side, it's right now in secondary consideration but still something that's part of our accounting.","Operator","And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","H. Lawrence Culp","Thanks, Lisa. Dan and I would be around all day, everybody, for follow-ups. Thanks for joining.","Operator","And that concludes today's teleconference.

We're very pleased for our strong second quarter performance. We delivered 5.5% core revenue growth, we continued investments in innovation and commercial initiatives contributing to share gains across many of our businesses. This marks the seventh straight quarter of 5% or better core growth which combined with solid operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow is a testament to our team\u2019s focused execution and the power of the Danaher Business System.","We also continue to make progress on our anticipated acquisition of GE Biopharma and the planned IPO of our Dental business and both transactions remain on track relative to our previously communicated expectations. As we move into the second half of 2019 we\u2019re excited about these important portfolio moods and the opportunities that lie ahead for Danaher.","So now let\u2019s turn to our second quarter results. Sales grew 3.5% to $5.2 billion, with core revenue growth of 5.5%. Acquisitions increased revenues by 1%, while the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 3%. Geographically, high growth markets grew high single-digits led by double-digit growth in India and approximately 10% growth in China. We saw mid single-digit growth across the developed markets with both the U.S. and Western Europe growing in that range.","Gross margin for the first quarter was 55.8%, and operating profit margin was 17.1%, down 30 basis points year-over-year. However, core operating margin increased 15 basis points despite a meaningful foreign currency headwind from a stronger U.S. dollar year-on-year. We\u2019ve generated $1 billion of free cash flow in the second quarter resulting in double digit growth year-on-year and a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of 137%.","So now let's take a more detailed look at our second quarter results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue increased 6.5% with 7.5% core revenue growth. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of high single digit or better core revenue growth in the segment.","Reported operating profit margin was up 190 basis points to 20.1% with core operating margins increasing 170 basis points. This terrific margin performance was a result of the team's outstanding DBS driven execution across the segment. Beckman Life Sciences\u2019 core revenue growth with a high single digit as performance was led by double-digit growth in both flow cytometry and particle counting and characterization.","The strength in particle counting was led by Vi-CELL product line which is primarily used analyze to cell viability in biopharmaceutical applications.","In addition Beckman closed the both on acquisition of Cytobank a software solution that pairs with our flow cytometry platform to help biopharma and clinical research customers analyze complex datasets more quickly and efficiently.","Core revenue at SCIEX grew at a mid-single digit rate. Good results across the pharmaceutical and applied end markets were partially offset by the continued impact of a tough comparison in our North American clinical business. We've made significant investments to improve the cadence of innovation at SCIEX since we acquired the business nearly 10 years ago.","The team highlighted several new products last month at ASMS including Echo MS a non-contact liquid handling solution with very high analytical throughput. This first-of-its-kind technology enables mass spectrometry\u2019s rich data generation to be used in new applications within the drug development workflow helping customers in their pursuit a breakthrough disease treatments.","At Pall, high single-digit core revenue growth was driven by broad-based strength across most major geographies and end markets. Pall Industrial was up mid single digits with strong results in our aerospace and process and industrial businesses. This was partially offset by microelectronics which declined due to a tough prior year comparison and softer end markets.","Double-digit growth in Pall Life Sciences was led by our biotech business where we saw broad-based demand across product lines. An important highlight during the quarter with the U.S. FDA's approval of a pediatric gene therapy which is manufactured using Pall's iCELLis bioreactor. So Zolgensma is the first gene therapy to treat spinal muscular atrophy or SMA in children under the age of 2. SMA is the number one genetic cause of death for infants and Pall is proud to contribute to the breakthrough treatment for this devastating disease.","The second quarter marked the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of IDT and we couldn't be happier with the progress the team has made so far. IDT delivered another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth driven by broad-based strength across all major product lines and geographies.","Moving now to Diagnostics, reported revenue was up 4.5% with core revenue growth of 7.5%. Reported operating margin was 17.5% with reported and core margins down 20 basis points. This decline is predominantly attributable to the impact of foreign currency headwinds related to the stronger U.S. dollar and tariff related costs.","At Beckman Diagnostics, mid-single-digit core revenue growth was driven by high growth markets, particularly China. By product line, immunoassay and automation led the way. Momentum from recent product launches is benefiting Beckman in a number of key product areas, enhancing the business' competitive position and accelerating its growth trajectory.","We are particularly encouraged by ongoing improvements in our hematology business where we continue to see strong global demand for our new DxH 900 high-volume analyzer.","Radiometer achieved high single digit core revenue growth with strength across the developed markets and China. Our blood gas and AQT product lines both performed well with key competitive wins contributing to market share gains.","Leica Biosystems\u2019 core revenue was up mid-single digits. Good results across Advanced Staining and core histology were driven by demand for recently introduced products and we believe LBS continued to take share relative to the market.","Finally, at Cepheid core revenue is up more than 20% on continued momentum in North America and strong results across high growth markets. Cepheid embrace of DBS growth tools and processes like transformative marketing and funnel management has enabled the team to make meaningful progress penetrating new accounts were particular success at integrated delivery networks in North America.","Turning to our Dental segment, reported revenue declined 3%, and core revenue was down 50 basis points. Reported operating profit margin declined to 11.2% with core and reported margins down 310 basis points. This decline primarily reflects the impact of lower volume, foreign exchange rate movements and ongoing investment spend focused on new product development.","Low single digit declines in our traditional consumables and equipment business were partially offset by low single-digit core growth in our specialty businesses.","Geographically double-digit growth in China was more than offset by continued softness in Western Europe and Latin America. As part of our expansion into clear aligners our orthodontics business Ormco highlighted Spark at the American Association of orthodontists tradeshow in May.","Spark is made using TruGen a proprietary material with exceptional flexibility and clarity which provides a highly aesthetic and comfortable aligner capable of treating complex cases. Following a successful initial launch in Australia we are previewing Spark with a group of leading orthodontists in the U.S. as part of our targeted expansion and expect to build on this good early traction going forward.","We continue to make good progress towards the intended IPO of our Dental business. We\u2019ve recently announced the new company's name Envista and have identified its key senior leaders and future operating structure. We remain on track to establish Envista as a separate publicly trading company in the second half of this year.","Moving to our Environmental and Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 2% and core revenue was up 4%. Reported operating margin increased 40 basis points to 23.4% with 45 basis points of core margin expansion.","In Product Identification, core revenue increased at a low single-digit rate. Videojet core revenue was up low single digits versus a high single digit prior year comparison. Results were led by growth in Western Europe and high-growth markets with solid underlying end market demand worldwide.","In our packaging business which includes Esko and X-Rite we were encouraged by better sequential performance and ongoing improvements in order trends. A few weeks ago Esko hosted more than 200 customers at the Esko World User Group Meeting in Nashville. The event brings together brand owners and suppliers from across the packaging workflow to showcase Esko's solutions and provides the unique forum for Esko to gather industry insight to guide impactful product innovation.","Finally, turning to Water Quality. Core revenue growth for the platform was up mid-single digits. At Trojan double digit core revenue growth was driven by strength across the developed markets in China. We saw solid demand in the municipal and industrial end markets and the team sustained its strong customer win rate with good commercial execution and new product differentiation.","ChemTreat delivered high single digit core revenue growth. The North American and Latin American markets continue to lead the way with strong results in food and beverage, commercial facilities, and oil and gas.","Lastly at Hach, core revenue grew in a low single-digit rate versus a double-digit prior year comparison. Good performance in North America and Western Europe benefited from demand across the municipal and industrial end markets.","This was partially offset by declines in China which was meaningfully last year as a result of government initiatives around surface water monitoring which generated significant demand for Hach's unique offering.","2019 marks Hach's 20th year as part of Danaher making it one of the longest tenured operating companies in our portfolio today and a tremendous example of how we grow businesses and build platforms at Danaher. Through a combination of organic execution and strategic M&A with a commitment of DBS and a foundation of continuous improvement Hach has evolved from a $130 million business in 1999 to what is now the cornerstone of our $2.5 billion Water Quality platform. During that time the platform has increased growth and operating profit margins by over 1500 basis points and completed more than 25 acquisitions to augment growth and adjacencies in water treatment byTrojan and ChemTreat.","This combination of organic and inorganic initiatives has helped drive consistent share gains and build sustainable long-term value with the platforms\u2019 return on invested capital now in excess of 20%. You'll get to hear more about this success story at our upcoming water quality investor day in September and we hope that many of you will be able to join us for the event out at Hach's headquarters in Loveland, Colorado.","So to wrap up we feel good about the momentum we generated in the first half of 2019. The remainder of this year will be transformational for Danaher with the anticipated IPO of Envista and welcoming GE Biopharma to our Life Science platform. Both incredibly important portfolio moves that we expect to maximize value for our shareholders, customers and associates.","We believe the combination of our differentiated portfolio the Danaher team\u2019s DBS driven execution and our commitment to build long-term value uniquely positions us for strong performance through 2019 and beyond. We are initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.12 and $1.15 which assumes core growth of approximately 4.5%. We now expect full year 2019 adjusted diluted net EPS to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.80. ","Matt Gugino","Thanks Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Laurie we're now ready for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. Congrats on another solid quarter. Tom, on the more industrial focused market, it doesn't sound like you're flagging any sort of softness or issues there. I know you had the tougher videojet comp but you did mention I think better quarter-over-quarter in order to trends and packaging so can you just talk on the outlook for Pall Industrial Product ID packaging some of these more industrial focused markets given some of the macro data points? ","Tom Joyce","Sure Tycho. Happy to, as I think you probably know well, we don't have a lot of truly industrial exposure left in the portfolio today. Call it 10% or less of the overall portfolio so admittedly we're perhaps not a great read but I'm happy to share with you some of the details behind some of the specific businesses that you asked about.","In terms of the trends we're seeing broadly defined across these businesses, in general they're still pretty solid. Let's call it low single digit, mid-single digit growth rates across these businesses that I'll tell you about in a little bit more detail. So maybe let's start with say a portion of Hach. So Hach has some industrial exposure that the industrial side of Hach was up mid-single digits in the quarter.","The order trends remain pretty solid across both the U.S. and Europe. Overall Hach was with low single digits in the second quarter but again that was against that big double-digit comp last year that impacted us in China. So again just look at the industrial side, pretty solid.","You mentioned Pall industrial again another portion that maybe worth a little bit of a read. Pall industrial up mid single-digits in the quarter. So pretty good performance. Where we saw a little bit of softness was certainly in microelectronics that was expected. We clearly have some difficult comps there two years of double digit growth and that market has clearly softened up based on lot that\u2019s going on in terms of the trade dynamics and that's \u2013 that market is probably not likely to improve much in the second half of the year but so that's a little bit of a soft spot there, but at Pall industrial that was more than offset by our aerospace business and what we call FTAP which is fluid technologies and asset protection both aerospace and FTAP were up double digits in the quarter.","So again put that altogether mid single digit growth Pall Industrial, pretty solid VJ, you mentioned VJ again a little bit of exposure there at VJ. That was up again depending on the sub-segment low single digit to mid single digits, pretty small numbers at DJ but against your trends were pretty solid. And DJ's overall comp was although low single digit in the quarter, was again the high single digit prior year.","So net we keep a very close eye on what's going on in these sub-markets. We do think they can be indicative of maybe some broader trends but our order trends remain pretty steady and again we don't have a ton of exposure but happy to keep bringing those indicators forward for everybody so sort of broader sense of the macro.","Tycho Peterson","That's helpful and maybe similar line of questions on China. I mean you had 10% growth double digit in Dental, you are under indexed to maybe food and four plus seven generic headwinds but as we think about the back half of the year and the China picture any reason that that couldn't continue at double digit levels for you guys.","Tom Joyce","Yes. Thanks. We feel very good about where we are in China. Obviously, that starts with the nature of our platform's positions there. When you think about Life Sciences diagnostics, Water Quality, the concerns around the environment, certainly even our Dental business which continues to be really well-positioned there and growing strongly, starting in the broad sense of the platform position we love where those businesses and how that platform is positioned for the secular growth drivers in China.","And despite the headlines which clearly indicates that there are some slowing in China we continue to see pretty good underlying conditions and I think just to go through a few specifics, diagnostics was very strong. We're talking mid-teens kind of growth there especially at Cepheid which is again off the small base but continued to grow nicely. Beckman is doing well there.","Another strong quarter of life sciences of high single digits and of course dental demand continuing a double-digit growth. So good performance there.","Product ID again a smaller position in China, but pretty solid mid-single digit growth, but as I mentioned this again is probably a couple of more puts and takes there in China than we might normally have seen. Water quality being one of those against this federal mandate that existed last year around service monitoring. So that's a little bit of an impact and again what I mentioned about micro down and even that [FTAP] business probably a touch lighter.","So a few little pockets there but again if we step back broadly I think we're in good shape there. As we look forward I think we'll continue to see mid-single digits to high single digit growth in Q3, but again that's only because of really this tougher comp where we had high teens, growth in Q3 of \u201818 largely driven by the water quality business.","So we don't really see a meaningful slowdown in our businesses at this point, but clearly given the headlines and the data that's been put out more recently, the ongoing trade tensions, we're watching these businesses very, very closely and we will continue to update as we see things.","Tycho Peterson","Okay and then just one last clarification you got \u2013 guidance for Dental margins to be flat. I know they are down 300 basis points. How much of that was incremental investment and how should we think about Dental margins for 3Q and 4Q?","Tom Joyce","We're clearly continuing to invest around new products in that business but the lower volumes, I think are meaningful here, Tycho. It\u2019s certainly the investment is a function there and that we think it's important to set this business up effectively for the growth to come and you've seen us lift R&D spending by 100 basis points over the last couple of years and so that portion of what we think is really essential to the future growth trajectory of the business but the volume trend is really what we need to get those new product innovations to begin to turn along with some just tailwind in that market.","I think as we see that volume come back a bit that's going to be the incremental jump that we're going to need in terms of the OMX, so I think it's really a combination of those things that we'd be looking for certainly as we turn the corner into next year. I think as we look at the balance of this year we're going to continue to drive some of those investments. We're still going to have some challenges in terms of the overall growth in this market, but I think we remain very, very bullish about the prospects for this business to improve both the growth trajectory and the operating margins as we head into 2020 and beyond. ","Matt Gugino","Yes, Tycho. It\u2019s Matt. I mean some of the volume there too is on, if you think about specialty in the quarter was kind of low single digits that typically is some of our better margin business and so I think from a mixed perspective like Tom said that lower volume and kind of where it happened here in the quarter was a big piece it.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thank you. ","Tom Joyce","Thanks Tycho. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore ISI.","Tom Joyce","Good morning Ross.","Ross Muken","Good morning guys. Congrats. So maybe I just want to go back to Diagnostics. I mean I felt like Cepheid probably north of 20 in the quarter. I mean, obviously, Q1 you had some tough flu comps. So I guess that that's a pretty remarkable growth where it feels even above sort of trailing 12-months levels. So I guess help us understand whether it's sort of a new product or some of the GeneXpert or just placements or new menu like or geographic, where is that upside sort of coming from and we sort of that the sort of key stages of the DBS flywheel sort of getting this business kind of churning at the rate it maybe should get too?","Tom Joyce","Sure. Thanks Ross. You termed the flywheel is one where we love a lot, and obviously from that standpoint turning the flywheel, I would say it's still early days at Cepheid and yet we've begun to turn that flywheel at a pretty good rate but there's still opportunities to continue to enhance the RPMs, if you will. So let me take it through a few of the details.","As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we were up north of 20% in the second quarter and some of that continues to come from our, what we call our HBDC market or High Burden Developing Country growth, but if you even backed out of the High Burden Developing Countries where we continue to see good growth, Cepheid continued to be up mid-teens in many of the core areas and core assays.","So that growth continues to be really broad-based. Infectious disease led the way, flu, RSV, Strep all strong, sexual health also very good. The flu season and normally by the time we get into July here, we're not usually talking about flu, but just to go back a second, it did last \u2013 it lingered a little bit longer into April, which probably on the margin helped growth a bit as well. So I think the combination of things, with very good performance in the core assays and the developed markets and then continued good performance in HBDC.","From a DBS perspective, a number of key things going on from an innovation and commercial execution perspective that are helping us to continue to drive share gains. We've netted over 300 new customers since acquisition, which is really meaningful in terms of not only the installed base that is built, but obviously the annuity stream that's associated with those captive consumables.","So that market leading installed base is now north of 20,000 instruments. We closed, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I mentioned IDNs. We've closed a number of major health systems or IDNs and that is again continuing to drive the installed base with strong annuity streams. The anchor assays, like flu and Strep A are key to develop to driving those wins.","And I think over time we're going to, we're going to see some penetration in the physician office labs in an even deeper way with our CLIA-waived Xpress offerings and because I think those will be an important part of it. So overall, I think the team is in great shape. I was with the team at Cepheid in the early part of the year and they continue to perform exceptionally well. But I think it's still early days.","I think one way to think about the early days is in terms of geographic penetration. We're still coming off a relatively small base in China, but the molecular diagnostics opportunity in China is really strong. Today, China is still probably sub-5% of Cepheid and it's going to be significantly bigger than that as years go on.","We're working on getting beyond the initial test that we have approved in China, which are really around MTB and C. diff, HIV viral load, etc and we continue to build the sales force, it's up by 3X times where we started. And we got 4x or 5x the revenue. So again, small base, early days, but I think plenty of room to go.","Ross Muken","And maybe just on the pharma side, I know you called out biotech at least relative to Pall, but more broadly, I guess, how would you kind of characterize small versus large molecule demand across the portfolio? And specifically to Tycho's point before in China, any sort of anecdotal things and when we were there, it seemed quite like biologics and bio-manufacturing was on absolute fire, so just any color would be helpful. ","Tom Joyce","Sure. I think in terms of small versus large, I think we continue to see solid growth from the segment of market that's more oriented toward small molecule. Well, Ross that that's sort of our legacy, if we looked at the SCIEX business as an example of that, continued solid performance across the small molecule business, large molecule, biologics is where the faster growth is, and we see that in our Pall numbers.","The Pall Life Science business up double-digits. The biotech part of that was really led by our single-use technologies and that's, those are \u2013 those single-use technologies are significantly oriented, it's not exclusively oriented to the biologic side of the house.","iCELLis, I mentioned iCELLis and the iCELLis bioreactor continues to be a big source of growth for us. We look at the areas of cell and gene therapy as huge opportunities. And again, it's still early days in those markets. So I'd say coming through at all, small molecule, solid, pretty consistent large molecule, continued strong growth.","You asked specifically about China. Thanks, thanks for your recent visit. That market is going quite well. But again, I think that's still a market that is in development. A lot of the history there began in the small molecule area, some of what's going on there around biosimilars is clearly a source of growth. But that market will continue to evolve over time.","There is a tremendous amount of government investments that's going on, as you also probably found when you were there. And so we're very bullish about how our business in Life Science, is not just on, by the way that the process technologies you might say around filtration and ultimately around chromatography.","But I think our tools business as well, whether we're talking about SCIEX and the evolution of the use of mass spectrometry in large molecules or the use of our other Life Science tools around biologic drug development and discovery. Those businesses are all tracking well.","Ross Muken","Super, helpful. Thanks Tom.","Tom Joyce","You bet Ross.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.","Tom Joyce","Derik, good morning.","Derik De Bruin","Good morning. How you all doing?","Tom Joyce","Great. Thanks. Nice to hear from you.","Derik De Bruin","Thank you. Couple of questions so I guess the first one would be you mentioned in your comments about like a bio that you were seeing some shared gains there and given the joining of a couple of real competitors that market and just sort of curious about the additional color on what's driving the share gains and some dismay any information on that would be a good place to start?","Tom Joyce","Sure. Yeah, you bet, happy to. First of all, we have a terrific team on that business today. Melissa Aquino who I have worked with for a long time, actually came out of our Water Quality business, ran our DBS office prior to this role is leading that business today, and just doing a wonderful job, both in terms of driving new product execution as well as the commercial side of the house.","One of the things that I've been particularly impressed with is, I was with that business earlier this year, Derik, they've got the new product engines now working in that business.","We struggled a bit three, four, five years ago with getting products out of R&D on time. They were great products, they ultimately were targeted at the right market. We are now getting those out faster.","The rate of new product introduction is higher than it's ever been before and we're seeing the impact of that in the growth rates both in histology, the core microtome tissue processor, what you might think of is kind of the more [indiscernible] stuff is at the front end of anatomical pathology, as well as better growth rates and more product innovation around advanced staining.","We still have work to do around path imaging, you recall years ago, we did the acquisition of Aperio, we think there's tremendous opportunities around the evolution of digital pathology. We have \u2013 I think many of \u2013 much of the tool set, that it takes to move pathology imaging into the mainstream, if you will, of anatomical pathology, but we've got some product development that continues to need to be done.","And frankly, it's a market that's slow to adapt to those technologies, and we will need to be a little bit patient as those transitions take place within the community of pathologists. But a lot of good things going on there, but I would point primarily to product development engine, now running far more smoothly and efficiently.","Derik De Bruin","Great. And then just two related questions, one, can you just give us any update on sort of GE and timing on that whole process? And also just sort of a follow-up on Ross' question. When you think about small molecules and large molecules in cell and gene therapies, can you compare, sort of like the profitability for some of those markets.","The question I'm getting to is like as you move into providing products Zolgensma and just some of these other ones that are out there. I'm just curious is those are going to be a higher margin, higher products for you, more profitable products for you, going and then doing \u2013 genomic supplying columns or supplying resins and filters for the biologics business?","Tom Joyce","Sure. Let's take in there. But let me give it a shot. So let's have a key \u2013 first of all, we continue to be really impressed with the GE team, we mentioned that when we announced the deal, that we found that coming through due diligence. But as we normally do with large acquisitions, we put a transition team together, we acquired \u2013 the soon to be acquired business has a transition team.","And so, we continue to get some exposure to that team and we remain really impressed by them, it's a highly passionate and talented group with great industry experience. As you saw in Q1 from them the business is off to a great start in 2019. What we've heard a little bit is just sort of very anecdotally that things continue to track quite well. Their first quarter was \u2013 at core growth above where they've been in the last couple of years. So all indications are the business is in wonderful shape.","From a transaction standpoint, we issued the equity in Q1. Clearly, the debt financing ought to be helped by what we're seeing now in lower rates, assuming those kind of hold in both the U.S. and Europe and that's just in comparison to when we announced the deal. So overall, we feel very good about where we are. No change to our expectations.","We've had good and constructive dialog with the regulators and we're working with them like we would on any other deal. And so we're continuing to drive toward a fourth quarter close and feel good about that.","Relative to your second question, which was around small molecule versus large molecule cell and gene therapy, and profitability, and then you made specific reference to Zolgensma and the recent introduction of that breakthrough product by the division of Novartis, your question was really around profitability, I guess. First of all, going back to the core, we've always seen good profitability in our business around small molecule related applications and large molecule.","I would say no difference. Obviously as we continue to develop breakthrough new products associated with the evolution of biological drug discovery, development and processes, we continue to focus on enhancing gross margins, as we drive new product development and so obviously the value that we deliver to shareholders is directly associated back to the gross margin that we're able to achieve.","And so we continue to really keep the long horizon in mind, in terms of what the market needs are, and continue to drive products that will help to enhance gross margin, which they've done. And so we feel good about that.","Now, when it comes to cell and gene therapy, it's so early in the evolution of that market today, that it's hard to say anything that's particularly material or quantitative around overall profitability, even our iCELLis product line, which is doing exceptionally well. It's still early days and its market penetration as fast as that pickup has been and as unique of that product is in the market.","So more to come over time, but in general, our outlook is profitability looks very solid across this market. Zolgensma as you mentioned, you probably know from what's been publicized is a unique therapy, is a breakthrough, it's incredibly impactful to children under the age of two, and it's a very costly therapy. And that's a challenge in healthcare today is the cost of developing therapies and so on.","But that's a dynamic that where quite a number of steps removed from when it comes to drug pricing and the relationship with the payers. And so I think the continued evolution of the technologies associated with these breakthroughs is going to be imperative for our customers today and we're proud to be a part of it, but we certainly recognize the challenges that are associated with how costly these have become.","Just one last point, that many of you have probably heard me say that at Danaher, we have a, what we call our shared purpose and it's four simple words, helping realize life's potential, whether that's the potential for our associates or our customers, our shareholders.","Ultimately in many respect patients and there's probably no better example of how we help realize life's potential when it comes to healthcare than when a tool of ours can play a role in really impacting the quality of life for patients. So we're proud to be a part of that and there is more to come and it's still early days.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen.","Tom Joyce","Hey Dough.","Doug Schenkel","Hey, good morning guys. I wanted to touch base to start on a few loose ends on Pall. How would you characterize win rates for Pall biotech, especially in the gene therapy space? I guess the second part is, I believe it was last quarter, you mentioned some building backlog for iCELLis, what's the status of that?","And I guess the third part is, I'm curious if customer anticipation of the GE Bio acquisition is having any impact on Pall demand, clearly you're doing well there and you have been for a while, but just wondering if there is any attribution to anticipation of the GE Bio deal as customers think about the possibilities associated with you having a broader portfolio? And whether or not that is impacting demand at all?","Tom Joyce","Sure. Thanks, Doug. So first of all on Pall around win rates in gene therapy, and you mentioned specifically iCELLis and that's a good place to start when it comes to gene therapy. iCELLis is a unique product, not to suggest that there is only one way to affect what iCELLis affects in terms of bioreactor, but its capabilities are particularly unique in the market and as a result of that the leaders in that market segment associated with the projection steps in gene therapy have chosen iCELLis at a pretty consistent rate.","And so, while I won't begin to quote right now a specific win rate percentage. I would tell you, it's just, it's very high and that has to do with the unique capabilities that iCELLis delivers in this market that is, it's difficult to do with the quality and the efficiency and the cost effectiveness that iCELLis allows for.","So we feel very good about that, but again it's still because the gene and cell therapy market is still nascent today. We can feel great about that but the materiality of that is something that will only build over time. It will build at a reasonably rapid rate, but again a nascent market today.","Your question specifically about the customer reaction or anticipation I guess as you framed it for the GE deal and impacting of Pall demand. I don't know today that we would point to anything specific in that regard, Doug.","I would tell you quick sort of an anecdote,I was in China a couple of months ago and was it was with a significant Pall customer. They happen to be a GE customer as well as most large customers that I might meet with either in China or any high-growth market or even in the U.S. or Europe.","But in this particular case, it was, there was an appreciation for the fact that the combination of those two businesses in terms of the type of service and support that that customer would expect, the fact that we become more meaningful to one another in a positive and constructive way was something that they feel very good about.","And so those are just anecdotes. I don't know if there's anything we would point to today that is a demand impact today that we could see into relative to the top line.","Doug Schenkel","Thank you for that. Beckman diagnostic where you guys grew mid single digits for the third consecutive quarter. Do you think this is the new norm and specifically in North America there is clearly been some improvement there over the last couple of quarters. How did that flare in North America for this quarter for Beckman Dx?","Tom Joyce","Sure. Doug. And we obviously as that's an important battleground we paid a good deal of attention to that. As you said third straight quarter of mid single-digit growth. We feel very good about that.","Some of the things that led the way are we continue to see very good growth in our immunoassay business in the core Central Lab. You'll recall that we had, we've developed and launched a new automation system the DxH system which has taken our competitive advantage in particularly high volume accounts to a new level.","And so we feel very good about that, but probably one of the key things that is a difference today is our hematology business. And for those you Doug and others who follow us for a number of years, that even going back to the acquisition of Beckman to begin with hematology with the headwind.","And so we made a significant amount of investment in new product development. We have transformed that product line. Those new products specifically around of both high and mid volume specifically in the high volume the DxH 900 as well as the early sepsis indicator capabilities that we have now launched are contributing together to turn the tide.","We continually look at retention and win rates and we have seen those increment upward consistently over the last, particularly over the last two years and those new products around automation and hematology have clearly been a big part of it. China continues to be a strong driver for us at north of 10%.","And so that's a plus as well. So the combination, still work to do, there is still minute gaps that we're working on that we \u2013 couple of critical ones that we will look to close more likely in 2020. And so I think we're continuing to see good performance. I think if you step back, just for one second and think about the impact this has had on the diagnostic platform.","If you think about the improvement in Beck Dx now at mid-single digits with the addition of Cepheid now with its terrific performance . We now have a diagnostic platform with core growth at 7.5% that we think will as the comps come out will stack up reasonably well and now a platform that's been solidly mid-single digits for eight straight quarters.","So I think Beckman is important certainly with the combination of Beckman with solid performance at Radiometer like the biosystems, and the high growth rate at Cepheid is really what solidified that stronger overall platform position and it's really the platform together.","When we look at clinical chemistry immunoassay, hematology, urinalysis, microbiology and across the other modalities in anatomical pathology in acute care, that really is the right comp against some pretty good competitors.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Sorry to try to sneak in one more and then I'll like fall back to the queue. [indiscernible] No, this is all me. I've got a handful of investors ask me for updates on timing of the debt financing and if there is any real change and I think by extension upside what you guys embedded into your original deal model for interest expense assumptions. Could you speak to timing and whether there is any change in how you're thinking about maybe upside associated with interest expense? Thank you.","MattMcGrew","Sure. Yeah, I mean from a timing perspective, I still think we've kind of talked about trying to be in the market a little bit closer to when we closed. I mean I think we're still talking about a Q4 close here. So I think that the timing will be a little bit closer to that, but as Tom kind of said, we talked about the GE update we issued the equity in Q1 and the debt financing here is clearly going to be held by the lower rates.","There is no question about that. I mean, we're probably not going to update any of our guidance that we kind of provide to you earlier. But I think the combination of the tailwinds that the businesses \u2013 the GE business is off to a pretty good start and where the rates are right now, like we will have some sort of benefit. But I think from a timing perspective, still sort of TBD but a little bit closer to when we bring the kind of when we get to close here.","Doug Schenkel","Thanks again.","Matt McGrew","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research.","Tom Joyce","Good morning Steve.","Steve Beuchaw","Good morning. Thanks so much for the time here. Just a couple from me. I mean a couple of clarifications for Matt and then one on the commercial side for Tom. Matt, it sounds like the thinking for the core growth of the total company level is going higher relative to what we had before, is it fair to say that that, well, fair to say that first of all.","And second of all, is that a reflection of a fairly balanced view across Environmental, Applied Diagnostics, Life Sciences. Second clarification for Matt is, has anything meaningfully changed in terms of non-op or tax rate outlook for the full year that you would flag here? And then I have one for Tom.","Matt McGrew","Sure. So from guide perspective, I think for the full year, we had talked about at the beginning of the year, kind of, in December, we had talked about approximately 4% core for the whole year. Obviously, a pretty good start here with \u2013 in the first half and what we are \u2013 our guide here of approximately 4.5% in Q3. So I think from a full-year perspective, our thoughts now are that we are probably approximately 5% here for the full year from a core guide.","As far as \u2013 balance on that. Yeah, I think, where we've seen in the first half as you see Life Sciences and Diagnostics have been much better and EAS, I think EAS would be the one piece in the second half given the water comp and the comp at PID, they are both here in Q3, going to be comping kind of their toughest comps in the quarter.","But other than that, I suspect that it's been pretty balanced, I don't think we see a vast difference here in the first half or the second half, I think we just have had a little bit better start than we may have thought in December. As far as non-op stuff in tax, I don't think there's anything that I would call out, Steve, that would be different here in the second half.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay. Thanks, Matt. And then Tom, I wonder if you could reflect a little bit more on IDT and now that business in isolation. But what IDT in the broader life science portfolio is doing in terms of cross-selling opportunities. There's probably some synergy between IDT and Beck LS just to pick one example and just would be interested to hear about where you think you might be doing better in terms of share gains, not just as a function of the commercial investments, you've made.","But in terms of product synergies whether it's around IDT or may be Phenomenex, as we've been hearing more about Phenomenex on checks here of late. Thanks so much.","Matt McGrew","Sure, Steve. It probably will come across as somewhat surprising that despite what you might think across a broad set of analytical modalities that we provide in Life Sciences that there aren't a really significant number of cross-selling situations that we would point to that where there's real materiality.","And the reason for that and I'll come back to IDT in a second. But the reason for that is that our operating company-centric model that we have maintained for virtually the entirety of Danaher's history is one that puts an extremely high value on an individual operating company and its commercial organizations being uniquely focused on the specific needs of that customer set.","And we've seen a number of situations looking across different industries, where businesses have hoped for commercial synergies by bringing sales organizations together and creating heavier bags for their commercial organizations, thinking that customers actually were looking to buy a broader suite of instrumentation from the same sales team.","When the reality is that only serve to dilute the focus, the technical capability, the level of service and support. And so we've actually maintained much more focus within our individual operating companies on the unique needs of that end-market's customers and really I think continue to maintain that even, in particular with newly acquired businesses.","Going back to IDT, that approach to maintaining a unique focus of a commercial organization on their unique customers is particularly important for newly acquired businesses for us, because it's so easy to get the commercial organization confused by adding additional products to their bags from another operating company that ultimately dilutes that sales force's effectiveness, and so we look clearly for situations, where we can deliver higher value, I think you mentioned Phenomenex.","Phenomenex and SCIEX are clearly a closer opportunity, where the synergy between chromatography column obviously and the sample preparation associated with mass spectrometry is much more technically and workflow oriented synergistic and so that's probably a better example of where we see that.","And then in certain cases in high growth markets, I think I would point for example to our Dental business, where having a unified sales organization, bringing a consolidated set of products to a single end market, meaning the dental market in China, which has structured a little bit differently than the end markets in the developed countries.","That's really delivered value and that's actually one of the things that has helped drive that double-digit sales growth in China, but again those are unique situations that we only do that where there is clarity around how we bring real value to customers.","Steve Beuchaw","Well, that's great color. I really appreciate the time here this morning.","Tom Joyce","Thanks Steve.","Operator","Thank you. I will now return the call to Matt Gugino for any additional or closing comments.","Matt Gugino","Thanks Laurie and thanks everyone for joining us this morning.

We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter in which the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, strong core operating margin expansion, and record free cash flow. Despite the more challenging economic landscape, particularly in our industrially-oriented markets, we continued to build our competitive advantage and drove share gains across a number of our businesses. As always, the Danaher Business System is the foundation for our team's outstanding execution.","We also made meaningful progress toward establishing a new industrial growth company, Fortive, which will be spun out of Danaher later this year. At our year-end Investor Meeting, we announced Fortive's name, branding, future operating structure, and additional leadership positions. We also achieved an important milestone in December, filing Fortive's Form-10 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are confident that Fortive will launch with a strong foundation and will be poised for success upon completion of the separation in the third quarter of 2016.","For the full year, our investments in organic growth initiatives helped drive solid 3% core revenue growth. With the addition of our recent acquisitions and other portfolio moves, our total annual revenues are now over $20 billion. From an M&A perspective, 2015 was a historic year for Danaher. Including Pall, we announced or closed 14 acquisitions for nearly $14.5 billion, expanding our capabilities across the portfolio. Looking forward, our funnels at both Danaher and Fortive are strong and we'll continue to focus on small and mid-size transactions throughout the separation process.","In 2015, we generated a record $3.2 billion of free cash flow, including over $1 billion in the fourth quarter. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio in 2015 was 123%, representing the 24th consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income. We recognize the importance of this metric, particularly in a more challenging macroenvironment, as strong free cash flow is the fuel used to fund both our organic and inorganic growth initiatives.","Now, turning to the fourth quarter, sales grew 12.5% to $5.9 billion, while core revenue was roughly flat. Core revenue growth, particularly for our consumables businesses, was negatively impacted by four fewer selling days in the quarter. In addition, the impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 17.5%.","In a weakening global macroenvironment, the Danaher Business System help protect and expand many of our market-leading positions driving share gains at Hach, ChemTreat, Matco, Gilbarco, Radiometer, SCIEX, and Videojet. In the high-growth markets, declines in Latin America, Russia, and the Middle East were more than offset by double-digit growth in India and high single-digit growth in China. Notably, annual revenues in China exceeded $2 billion for the first time and we remain well-positioned in the most attractive sectors in the market. In the developed markets, revenues were down slightly due to incremental softness in the U.S. and Western Europe.","Gross margin for the quarter was 51.2%. For the full year, our gross margin was 52.3% and our gross profit increased by almost $900 million. In the quarter, core operating margin increased 120 basis points with all five segments improving by 60 basis points or better. Our reported operating margin was flat at 16.6%, negatively affected by the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and acquisition-related transaction costs. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.27, which represents an increase of 13.5% over last year. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $4.30, up 8.5% from 2014.","Turning to our five operating segments, Test & Measurement revenues decreased 9% while core revenues were down 5%. Core operating margin increased 110 basis points, primarily due to new product introductions and good cost management. Core revenue in our Instruments platform decreased at a high single-digit rate with declines across most major geographies.","Fluke core revenues were down high single-digits as industrial markets continued to weaken in North America, Latin America, and the Middle East. In December, Fluke acquired Pacific Laser Systems, a leader in hand-held laser alignment tools, to enhance its product offerings for professional contractors, electricians, and general maintenance customers.","At Tektronix, core sales declined high single-digits; declines in North America, Latin America, and the Middle East more than offset growth in China that resulted from solid execution by our local sales team. The team's continued investments in innovation placed Tek in a position of technology leadership within its industry. This quarter, Tek launched the MDO4000C, a mixed domain oscilloscope that combines up to six instruments in one unit. The new MDO4000C is completely customizable and upgradable allowing engineers to start with a high-performance oscilloscope and add functionality over time as needs change or budgets allow.","Matco, a business that will be a significant contributor to Fortive's results delivered its third consecutive year of double-digit core growth in 2015. Even after three decades as part of the Danaher portfolio, Matco continues to find new ways to improve using DBS. By deploying such DBS tools as web marketing, accelerated product development, and lean conversion, the team continues to expand its franchise distribution network, gain market share, and expand margins.","Turning now to our Environmental segment; revenues grew 1%, with core revenues up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 60 basis points and reported operating margin expanded 260 basis points to 21.8%. Water quality core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate. A combination of fewer selling days and slower demand from our more industrial customers in the developed markets resulted in essentially flat core growth at Hach, while ChemTreat grew slightly. Trojan had another very good quarter, driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American muni market.","Hach delivered another impressive year in 2015. In addition to mid-single digit organic growth, Hach continued its healthy cadence of bolt-on acquisitions. The team has done a terrific job implementing DBS in newly acquired businesses to help improve sales and drive innovation. One such example is BioTector, which was acquired in 2014 and had double-digit growth in the quarter.","BioTector provides online total organic carbon analyzers that help our customers monitor water quality in real time and reduce waste. BioTector's early and effective application of DBS tools such as lean conversion and funnel management led to more than 200 basis points of margin expansion, significant inventory reductions and market share gains in the chemical and dairy segments.","Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew high single-digits with strength across the platform. In the U.S., point-of-sale solutions and dispensers increased over 20% as our customers continued to upgrade their payment systems to comply with EMV security requirements. We expect EMV-related demand to continue to accelerate for the next several years.","Moving to Life Science & Diagnostics, core revenues grew 2% with reported revenues up 34.5%, largely due to our recent Pall, MicroScan and Devicor acquisitions. Core operating margin expanded 75 basis points. Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform increased low single-digits with growth in the high-growth markets partially offset by slight declines in developed markets. As previously mentioned, fewer selling days in the quarter negatively impact our recurring revenue streams across the platform.","At Beckman Coulter, core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate led by our immunoassay and urinalysis solutions.","Utilization rates in Asia remain healthy leading to high single-digit growth across the region. In Europe, we celebrated our first orders with the commercial launch of our VERIS Molecular Diagnostics System. VERIS' streamlined sample-in, result-out workflow offers breakthrough ease of use in a market that is experiencing a shortage of skilled technicians. In short, it's helping our lab customers process more tests, reduce training requirements and save money, and thus far customer feedback has been extremely positive.","Radiometer's core revenues were up slightly, a deceleration from previous quarters due to the effect of fewer selling days and a difficult comparison in instrument sales. Geographically, we saw healthy growth in China and Japan, while Latin America and the Middle East declined.","Leica Biosystems had a good finish to the year, delivering low single-digit core growth as strong demand across most major product lines was partially offset by the impact from fewer selling days. Notably, the team delivered a record year of placements for our BOND Advanced Staining Instrument.","Last December, we closed the acquisition of Devicor, a leading provider of breast biopsy devices and markers that moved Leica further upstream in the anatomical pathology workflow. Devicor continues to track well and has exceeded our expectations, posting high single-digit core growth or better in each quarter since acquisition.","Core revenues in our Life Science platform were up low single-digits with growth in both developed and high-growth markets. SCIEX core revenues grew mid-single-digits with continued strength in our clinical and applied end markets.","2015 marked the fifth year since our acquisition of SCIEX. Since then, SCIEX has proven to be a remarkable example of how thoughtful application of DBS principles can drive tremendous financial results. The team has taken a business that was growing below market rates to mid to high single-digit growth and share gains. We've seen significant improvement on the cost side as well, which has enabled SCIEX to invest those savings into higher impact growth initiatives.","Progress at SCIEX continues today and 2015 marked one of the most important product innovation years in SCIEX's history with the launch of its X-Series mass spectrometry platform. The X-Series introduces an entirely new design, easy-to-use software and custom models for targeted application in routine food, environmental and forensic testing labs.","Leica Microsystems' core revenues were essentially flat as strong performance in China and Japan was offset by declines in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America.","Turning now to Dental, segment revenues increased 17% largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition. Core revenues were up slightly. Core operating margins increased by over 500 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to consistent DBS implementation across a number of operational areas. Reported operating margins were 15.8%.","Revenues in our consumables business were negatively impacted by fewer selling days in the quarter, but our team continued to execute well and saw a strong demand for several product lines throughout the year. In particular, our investments in innovation have provided us with truly differentiated technologies such as SonicFill, TF Adaptive, and elements free, which all launched in 2014.","In dental technology, we saw our first quarter of positive growth since the fourth quarter of 2014. Top line results continued to be impacted by destocking within our U.S. distribution channels but to a much lesser degree than in previous quarters.","December marked the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of Nobel Biocare. The team has quickly embraced growth, lean and leadership tools of DBS, helping to not only accelerate growth, but also improve operating margins by over 300 basis points since the acquisition.","Moving to Industrial Technologies, revenues declined 8.5% while core revenues were down 4.5%. Core operating margin expanded 80 basis points and reported operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 21.6%. Automation core revenues decreased at a high single-digit rate due to weakening in industrial markets in China and North America. Despite the challenging market and revenue decline, the team continues to identify cost savings opportunities and delivered solid core margin expansion in the quarter.","Core revenues in our Product Identification platform were up slightly. In the fourth quarter, we continued to extend our reach into new product idea adjacencies with the acquisition of Laetus, a leading supplier of track-and-trace inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants. Increasingly, pharmaceutical tracking is becoming a regulatory and public safety concern and Laetus gives us exposure to this important vertical, and we're excited to welcome Laetus to the Danaher team.","At Videojet, core revenues were up low single-digits, as strong performance in Europe and North America was somewhat offset by weakness in the high-growth markets. Results were negatively impacted by fewer selling days in the quarter. Throughout the full year, Videojet has placed a major focus on digital investments, driving key innovations in areas such as network monitoring, Remote Service-enabled printers and predictive maintenance. As a result, we achieved record new equipment vitality of over 40% for the year. These tremendous technology capabilities have not only solidified Videojet's leadership position in the market, they have also meaningfully improved our customers' experiences.","So to wrap up, we're pleased with our record fourth quarter results. During the quarter, the team delivered double-digit earnings growth, significantly expanded core operating margins, generated record free cash flow and announced several bolt-on acquisitions. Despite the more challenging economic landscape particularly in our industrially-oriented markets, we continue to execute well.","Looking back, 2015 was a remarkable year for Danaher. We completed the largest acquisition in our history with Pall, announced our pending separation into two independent publicly-traded companies with Fortive and drove excellent overall financial results. With the Danaher Business System as our foundation, we believe we'll continue to deliver earnings outperformance and create long-term shareholder value in 2016 and for years to come.","We're initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1 and $1.04 which assumes approximately flat core revenue growth. As we announced at our Annual Investor Event in December, we continue to expect full year 2016 core revenue growth of 2% to 3% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.95, which would represent a 12% to 15% increase year-on-year.","Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Leo, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question from Scott Davis of Barclays. Your line is open.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I think \u2013 I mean given that it's been about a month since you gave the last guidance in mid-December \u2013 the formal guidance, I guess \u2013 things seemed to have degraded a bit on the macro side. I mean, what confidence do you have? I mean, now that you've seen I guess most of January, I mean, have things stabilized? I mean, your guidance seems to indicate that you think that was a bit of a blip, I suppose, so just a little color there.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Scott. I think, Scott, what we're assuming is that what we saw with some of the slowing in December is essentially the environment that we're going to see in the near term here. It's clearly impacting our more industrial businesses more than our other businesses, so we're not immune to the slowdown but I think we took some appropriate actions in the fourth quarter.","Those actions are going to pay off here certainly from a margin standpoint, but I think the other thing to keep in mind is that the portfolio that we have today truly does differentiate us. And I think when we look at the opportunities that we have in our Life Science businesses, our Diagnostic businesses, some improvement that we're seeing here in our Dental businesses, continued good progress at GVR, while we remain cautious in some respects around the macroenvironment and are not assuming things get materially better there, we're playing offense in a number of areas that I think will bode well.","So, I don't think there's anything particularly optimistic in our outlook around the macro, but I think some of the things that we're doing from an investment standpoint and across our growth initiatives should continue to position a very good portfolio and a differentiated portfolio and continue to move it into an even better place.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Makes sense. And then just as a follow-up, the emerging market currencies have degraded a fair amount. I mean, are you able to get local price to offset that? I mean, how do you manage that volatility, specifically, just given the exposures you guys have?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I mean, it's an issue; I'd probably bifurcate the answer. Where we have the aftermarket business, the consumables, the service, we typically able to get price; with equipment and instruments, we're not able to, and we're taking a little bit of a margin hit there. Fortunately, the euro has stabilized so the overall currency impact is not what it was in 2015, but there's a little bit of a negative right now.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Good luck. Thanks. I'll pass it on.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Nigel.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, so just on the $0.40 from Pall, can you maybe just first of all comment on how Pall is tracking or how it tracked through the quarter? Maybe comment on the Industrial versus Life Sciences sides? And yeah, has the composition of the $0.40 in the plan changed at all in the last couple months?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Nigel, we're very, very happy with how we've gotten started with Pall, starting with the team that we have in place, a terrific team, both the Pall leadership team, many of whom have taken on added responsibilities. But in addition, the added resources that we've put in place and the leadership that we have brought to bear in the business, I think together, that team is off to a terrific start.","We'll talk to the $0.40 and the cost opportunities that we have here in just a minute, but coming to the growth side of the house, about what we expected: continued very good progress and growth rates on the Life Science side, keeping in mind that that business has an exceptional position in the biopharma market in Life Science. So, we're seeing continued good growth there. We're also seeing outstanding growth in single-use technologies, which are a key part and a key growth driver of the biopharma segment of the Life Science business as time goes on.","On the Industrial side, again, what you \u2013 what we would've expected, which is a slowing on that side of the house. We've seen that \u2013 those businesses impacted far more than obviously on the more Life Science-oriented side of the house. But I think it's also important to keep in mind that that business is also strongly skewed towards consumables. In total, the portfolio is about 70% aftermarket, consumables primarily. And so, that's a strong foundation and I think continues to give us confidence that while we'll have some segments that are challenged, the business overall will continue to perform quite well.","Relative to the cost side of the house, again, off to a very good start. You heard us in December take the 2016 number up to $100 million because we had gotten off to an earlier start. We're getting the kinds of cost reductions that you would expect us to get out of a public company in the early going. The public company cost, beginning to get after some of the indirect cost leverage that we get and some of the procurement cost leverage that we get by consolidating procurement across our other businesses where appropriate. And over time, we'll see some of the benefits coming from \u2013 on the gross margin side as we look to the operational footprint, but that will obviously take a little bit more time.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, but that's helpful. Thanks. Thanks, Tom. And then on the balance sheet, you've taken down a lot of \u2013 an impressive amount of debt since the acquisition of Pall, I think about $3 billion of debt paydown. Given the bit more challenging macro, is there a change in your bias towards delevering this year?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Nigel, I think we remain in that kind of $2 billion target for M&A this year. We are incrementally encouraged we're able to get some deals done in December, granted they were small, but we actually saw a flurry of deals get done towards the end of the year. Clearly what's going on in the high yield market has made it very difficult for the private equity parties, let alone industrial companies that have a lower credit rating. So, some of the anxiety out here is definitely helping some of the conversations. So, on the margin, we're a little bit more encouraged than we were 60, 90 days ago on the M&A front.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Oh...","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sorry, Nigel.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We may have lost Nigel there. Hope I didn't offend you, Nigel.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Operator, we can move to the next question.","Operator","Very good. Our next question is from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. How's it going?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Steve.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you just maybe talk a little bit more specifically about Pall industrial trends? I mean, what is the organic \u2013 what kind of organic are you seeing there and what are you expecting for 2016, a little more precisely?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Steve, for the four months that we owned the business on a constant-currency basis, Pall grew about 4% on a combined basis. Clearly, it would've been accretive to our core growth here. Life Science was up high single-digits; Industrial was down low to mid-single digits. We see that for the near-term, not a bad way to be looking at the business. Certainly, the industrial piece is more challenged but more than making up for it with a very strong growth on the Life Science side.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, what was Pall's contribution to free cash flow in the quarter?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the working capital side where we contributed north of $300 million of cash out of working capital, Pall was a nice piece of it, but maybe 15%. The working capital improvements were very broad-based, really exceptional performance across all the five segments. So, it was a nice contributor, but it was not an overwhelming piece.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then just one last question. What's the restructuring contingency look like in 2016? Is there any change to that as you kind of exited the year at a bit of a weaker rate, or are you in normal day-to-day planning? How extreme are things around some of the more industrial businesses?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Steve, I think one of the things that we learned from 2015 and we're pleased about is that we did a number of things throughout the course of the year from a productivity perspective. And I think particularly in an environment like this, it's important that we stay cognizant of the fact that there may be opportunities that present themselves, some things that we may need to do. So, we're going to keep the teams active at looking for opportunities throughout the course of the year, and we'll take advantage of those as they come up.","So, I think we got a lot done in 2015. We got a lot more done in December than we anticipated, probably $20 million north of what we thought in December. So, that's a good thing; sets us up well a little bit more than we would have anticipated. But again, I think it's important that we stay (31:07) cognizant of the environment business-by-business and look for opportunities to take action where good projects present themselves.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good morning, guys.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Steve.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. What was the Fortive versus Danaher core growth, if you split it that way, for the quarter?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Looking at Fortive probably being rough down 2% to 3% and Danaher go-forward up 1%, 1.5%. So, I think that's roughly the way it would split.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And just a couple of things...","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Steve \u2013 I'm sorry, Steve. Sorry to interrupt. Just wanted to make one other quick point just for clarification on that. It's important to recognize on the Danaher side of the house, that 1% to 1.5%, that side of the house has a higher percentage of consumables and recurring revenue than you do on the Fortive side. And as a result of that, the fewer selling days in the fourth quarter has a little bit greater impact on the Danaher side. So, when you normalize for the days impact on the Danaher side, that's going to be potentially could be 1.5%, 2% maybe even on that side. Again rough numbers, but it has a little bit more of an impact there.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Oh, okay. All right. And then just on a couple of the segments, so I think this was the \u2013 it's been at least eleven quarters since I've seen Fluke go negative. So, maybe a little commentary on what's going on in the industrial environment, specifically on Fluke.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And then also Life Sciences & Diagnostics, it's the lowest I think I've seen in 14 quarters. So, you went through a lot of detail there, but to what extent are we \u2013 should we be concerned about any kind of bleed over from the broader environment into their markets?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Sure. We'll start with Fluke. Fluke clearly impacted by the downshift in the macroenvironment in the quarter, Fluke being one of our more industrially-oriented businesses. I think the macroenvironment, while it had its impact on us on a broad basis, also had an influence on the way our distributors were thinking about inventories during the course of the quarter.","So, I think one of the things that \u2013 although we don't have all the numbers right now for full transparency on what happened to channel inventory, it's a pretty good hypothesis right now based on some early data we have that would suggest that there was some inventory control that went on in the channel that certainly would've had some impact as well.","So, I think those two factors combined, again broad-based macro on sellout and probably some impact on sell-in based on inventory contraction.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the Diagnostics side, Steve, the bigger piece is obviously Diagnostics, that's largely consumables, Diagnostics were up 4% organically for the year. And as you remember, Q1 when we had the extra days, we were up 6%; Q4, when we had the fewer days, we were up 2%. So, actually on a days-adjusted basis, Diagnostics tracked pretty close to that 3% to 4% rate all year including the fourth quarter.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Maybe one other thing to add there is that best we can tell, Steve, we didn't see any year-end budget flush there in the fourth quarter. That's a little bit more of a Life Science-oriented phenomena than a Diagnostic-oriented phenomena. But in some past fourth quarters we've seen the impact of that. We didn't see any of that in the fourth.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good news and bad news on that front has an impact on the fourth quarter. Sometimes that budget flush can drive some inventories out that then create some go-forward weakness as you start the New Year. We're hoping we \u2013 and the early numbers coming out here in January look like we're off to a decent start.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That's good. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Jeff. Good morning.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. Thanks for that color on Fluke. I wanted to ask that question a little bit more broadly. To what extent do you think kind of the more industrially-oriented organic growth rates clearly reflect end demand versus maybe a broader channel liquidation? I don't know if you have any good insight into your other channels or any even anecdotal color there would be helpful.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't have much there, Jeff. I know the teams are still out talking to customers and trying to get a better sense of that. One reason for a little bit more insight on Fluke than and less so \u2013 Fluke's a little bit more concentrated with some big distributor partners that we can get a little bit more transparency a little bit more quickly. Some of the more automation sensors and control businesses and so on, more fragmented channels and it's just taking us a little longer to get any sense of channel inventories.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And just shifting gears a little bit, any thoughts on how the device tax plays through? Do you see any change in demand there or any change in the way people are pricing competitively, and maybe just size what you think the impact could be to your business this year?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Jeff, when the device tax was first put in place, the impact of that was very fairly modest on us. There's money at stake but overall, not a huge number. So, what comes back in terms of a little bit of a lift to operating margins is also modest. I mean, net-net, it's a good thing for the industry. We didn't see much impact in the market from a pricing standpoint when it all happened \u2013 I should say, from a competitive standpoint. We did get some of that back in price over time and probably some competitors did as well, but in terms of real impact to competitive dynamics, I think it's too modest a change, certainly to the scale of our business and maybe to the scale of others to really impact the competitive world.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Jeff, I think we said in 2013 it was about a $0.05 hit. We recovered some of that in price. So, I think it'll be less than a $0.05, but maybe $0.03 benefit here in the year.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","We'll move next to Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe on Dental, can you just give us a little bit more color just sort of on the progress you made throughout the year? It looks like ending the year, you had some of your best results obviously adjusting for the days. And so, as we sort of now rolled Nobel into the sort of core and we think about the margin progression of that business over the year, help us think through kind of the pushes and pulls and how happy you are with the progress made.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Ross. I think 2015 was a year of very good progress across the platform. You mentioned Nobel; let me just start with that. We have a tremendous team of folks at Nobel. Largely the leadership team that was in place when we acquired the business, they have really embraced DBS and are off to a terrific start, both in terms of continuing to use DBS tools to drive growth, but also in my comments earlier, some great progress on operating margins. And now, as that goes core to the Dental platform, we'll see some impact of that to the good.","On the business that existed prior to 2015, I think again 2015 was a year of a lot of progress. I've mentioned a couple of times that we've had outstanding relationships with our distribution partners. We work in a collaborative way with them on channel inventories throughout the course of the year. That was obviously somewhat of a painful process to go through in the sense of the impact on core growth, but net-net, a very good process in terms of positioning the channel efficiently.","So we're pleased that the vast majority of that's behind us. There can always be a little bit of a tail to that of stuff we're still moving out in slower-moving inventories, but again, I think a ton of progress. We've also got a very good leadership team in place in our Dental platform today with some new players in place that I think are doing some wonderful things in terms of driving innovation. It was a very good year of new product introductions and I think we'll see the benefit of that as core growth improves this year. So we know we still have work to do there, but good news is there's opportunities for value creation as we go on here.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Great. And maybe just quickly a little color more on the M&A pipeline. Can you just give us a sense \u2013 I mean there's obviously been a ton of equity market volatility. We've seen obviously a shift in how the private equity folks are also sort of transacting. Just give us a feel for maybe healthcare versus industrial-oriented assets and the like, whether there is more activity at one side of the spectrum versus the other and how sort of the valuation dislocations have been kind of digested by the various groups, because you're obviously doing smaller things at this point and it's obviously the large end of the market that's probably been most impacted.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Well, I'll let Dan comment in a second on kind of the environment that we're seeing. But if you just look at what we did in the fourth quarter, which I think is a bit instructive, we got four or five small deals done in the fourth quarter. And by the way, a couple \u2013 two or three of those deals were Fortive-related. I mentioned Pacific Laser Systems in my earlier comment, but there were a couple other smaller situations that we were able to complete during the quarter for Fortive's benefit, along with a couple on the Danaher side.","So, I think the fourth quarter was indicative perhaps of some things opening up a bit. I think the environment is generally a favorable one for businesses like ours with a balance sheet that's ready to deploy into small and midsized situations. And I think to your question, there are some folks who are perhaps a bit more on the sidelines right now than in previous days.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Great.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Your line is open.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Morning, guys.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. So Test & Measurement and Industrial Tech are both generating pretty good core margin expansion here despite these mid-single-digit declines. Can you give a little more color on how they're managing to do that? I mean, both of them have pretty good leverage in the models so that's a lot to offset. And what's going on in those businesses and can they continue?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Shannon, it is a real testament to those businesses given the challenging environment they're in from a core growth perspective that they are getting the operating margin lift that they're getting without the benefit of the top line dropping that through. I think it is a testament to the strength of the Danaher Business System, the tools that we use not just in newly-acquired businesses, but in businesses with long histories with Danaher that have gotten a lot done using DBS in the past and are still getting it done.","If you think about some of the businesses in T&M, be it Fluke and the associated acquisitions around Fluke that have been done quite a number of years ago, think about other businesses like Qualitrol, like some of the businesses in our automation sensors and controls areas. Those guys are using DBS, whether those are lean tools specifically in the plants or deploying those tools in areas of SG&A, they're just demonstrating that those tools are still highly effective in businesses with long histories with Danaher. So it's kudos to those guys and they continue to get her done.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then you talked a little bit about the diagnostic comps and things, but Radiometer, that's been one that seemed like it was just going to grow to the sky forever in the equipment business.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Was a little weaker there. So maybe a little \u2013 just color, anything there to be concerned about.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, no. Radiometer is a tremendous business with a long track record of high single-digit growth at Danaher. I'm sure Matt or Dan can find how many quarters it's been, but it's quite a number of them in a row that we've been high single-digits and taking share.","It's a high consumables business. It's probably in the 80% neighborhood of consumables so the days impact was fairly significant there. They also had a challenging comp in the fourth quarter on the instrumentation side, a couple of big orders that had some impact there. So, I think Radiometer is in as good a shape today as it's ever been. No meaningful shift in the competitive dynamics there, so we still feel very good about it.","I think there was anything there, Shannon, that wouldn't be unique to Radiometer it's simply the fact that some of the growth that we have seen in the high-growth markets, while still strong in places like China and India, are still now very weak in Latin America, in Russia, in the Middle East. And so, even our best businesses are probably going to feel a little bit the impact there.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Shannon.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Just back on the Dental business, Dan, any chance you could give us the impact of the fewer days on core growth overall and how should we think about margin expansion for the year?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, it has less of an impact on equipment. We were up slightly in the quarter. It's the first time we've been up, albeit modestly, but it impacts consumables probably up, and as Tom alluded, to probably 1.5 points, 2 points when it comes to consumables.","Good progress on the margin side granted we had a pretty weak performance a year ago, so part of it was a comp. But we've also took part of our incremental restructuring here in Q4 with the Dental, so we should see some continued margin expansion coming out of Dental hopefully with a little better growth than what we've seen here in 2015.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","That's all I got. Thanks.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Brandon.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Just a question around Western Europe. I think I heard you say that sales were down slightly in Q4, having been up sort of around a mid-single-digit pace in the nine-month period. I think a lot of other companies have sort of been saying Europe's okay. So maybe just talk a little bit about what you saw there, specific countries or segments that slowed down.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Julian. I mean I think that was one of the areas versus what we expected at the beginning of the quarter that surprised us a little bit to the downside. It wasn't dramatic. Clearly, our consumables businesses over there were impacted by the selling days and maybe we were not as well calibrated as we should've been.","But having gone through all \u2013 most of the business here's \u2013 in the first couple of weeks here, the tone in Europe is still decent and it doesn't feel like the step-down that our numbers in Q4 would suggest. And we think we'll get back to sort of modest growth here pretty quickly in 2016. Watching that carefully because it probably caught us a little bit by surprise here in the fourth quarter, but again, the tone still seems pretty good.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Understood. Thank you. And you laid out the overall EPS seasonality through the year about just over a month ago. Maybe just talk a little bit about the Pall seasonality of that $0.40, particularly given the industrial organic sales trend in that business right now and how you would contrast that $0.40 impact versus overall Danaher.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, the $0.40 should ramp during the year as we go after costs. Again, we were able to get some more things done in December, and that was inclusive of Pall as well, so we're getting it out of the gate a little bit faster in Q1 from a margin perspective. I think the offset, as you suggest, is the industrial side. So I think we'll get nice accretion here in Q1, but it'll clearly ramp through the year.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Julian.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, guys. Obviously good performance in margin in the quarter. Are raw materials \u2013 lower raw material costs helping at all with price cost? Did price cost \u2013 was it stable in 4Q versus 3Q? Did it improve? I know you mentioned covering FX, but are raw materials helping at all?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't have any great analysis on that yet. Given our gross margin, raw materials tend to be less of a factor for us than a lot of other companies you might cover. We are continuing to get price, still getting 60 basis points, 70 basis points, and it's hard not to think raw materials are helping us a little bit, but for us, it's really on the margin.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Got it. And then how do you get visibility into what to forecast, for example, in the Middle East? I mean, the region looks like it inflected down a bit in 4Q. And with oil's recent leg down, how difficult is it to get visibility? And what do you forecast for 2016?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Andrew, there's a couple of different ways to come at that in the Middle East. One is simply conversations with distribution partners and a lot of what we do in the Middle East does involve some form of a distributor partner, and making sure that we have transparency as much as we possibly can into the opportunity funnels that those distributors are seeing, as well as making sure that the conversations we're having with our own sales team around those funnels as they roll up to our leadership team are as well pressure tested as possible.","The key thing about markets like the Middle East is, particularly in businesses like ours, you have a fairly high level of project or tender-related business and \u2013 at least on the equipment side. And so, really making sure that we understand opportunity funnels and are not overly optimistic about the timing within which funding will be released, as in many cases that funding has some governmental influence to it, is really important. It is easy to have a sales team get overly optimistic that the timing of funding release is going to be the same as it was a year ago or two years ago when the reality is things may have slowed down and tenders may be being let at a much slower pace. So being diligent about how we pressure test those funnels is key.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So it's fair to say you're being pretty conservative with the Middle East forecast.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're trying to be increasingly conservative as we see how government funding is being influenced. I think it was interesting watching the course of the year. Oil continued to drop, as you know, throughout the course of the year and yet we actually saw our Middle East numbers hang in there reasonably well throughout the middle part of the year and it wasn't until the latter part of the year that we saw a more acute shift in the Middle East. And so there was a little bit of a lag there and it's taken a bit of time for the team to fully recalibrate.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, Tom.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, just a quick question on R&D spending overall came in lighter year-over-year and versus our estimates. Did you throttle back on any spending or is that just timing of some of the projects?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. As you probably saw in the numbers that we put out, Deane, we're showing R&D down about 20 basis points, but the reality is, is that that was primarily influenced by Pall. And R&D spending normalized for the Pall influence was actually up on the quarter. So we're continuing to make sure that innovation is a key priority for the businesses and that R&D spending is maintained to the greatest extent possible for the opportunities that we think have the greatest impact in the next year or two.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then just last question from me is the incremental restructuring done in December, did you say what portion of that was Danaher versus Fortive?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It was roughly the split you'd expect, 70%\/30%. And that 70% is Danaher inclusive of Pall.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Deane.","Operator","And I'd be happy to turn the program back over to our hosts.","Matthew E.

Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Tom Joyce, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Dan Comas, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today\u2019s call, our third quarter Form 10-Q and the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on the Investors\u2019 section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Financial Information. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today, under the heading Events & Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until October 27, 2016.","During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance.

Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company specific financial metrics relate to the continuing operations of the company in the third quarter of 2016 and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year.","Today, we will be discussing two recently announced acquisitions of Cepheid and Phenomenex. Both acquisitions are subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and in the case of Cepheid, approval of the Cepheid\u2019s shareholders. We may also describe certain products and devices which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals.","During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Joyce","Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our third quarter results as our team continued to execute well despite the macroeconomic environment. We delivered solid core revenue growth with very strong adjusted earnings per share growth and free cash flow performance. The diversity and strength of our businesses have served us well in this modest growth environment. The recent separation of Fortive was an important step towards optimizing our portfolio and we continue to strategically position Danaher for strong long-term growth through M&A.","Since July, we have announced over $4.8 billion of acquisitions that will strengthen our Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments. In September, we announced the acquisition of Cepheid, a global leader in molecular diagnostics and we recently announced the acquisition of Phenomenex, an outstanding chromatography consumables business that will be highly complementary to our Life Sciences portfolio. Combined with the execution benefits of DBS, we believe these exciting strategic additions will contribute to Danaher\u2019s growth trajectory and superior returns. We look forward to welcoming the Cepheid and Phenomenex teams to Danaher.","With that as a backdrop, let\u2019s turn to the details of the third quarter. This morning, we reported adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.87, an increase of more than 20% over last year. Sales grew 17.5% to $4.1 billion, with core revenue increasing 3%. Core growth was consistent across the portfolio as each of our four reporting segments achieved at least 3% core revenue growth in the quarter. Currency translation had minimal impact while acquisitions increased revenues by 14.5%. Geographically, the high growth markets led the way driven by high single-digit growth in China and high-teens growth in India. Developed market core revenues were up low single-digits. Modest growth in the U.S. and Western Europe was partially offset by declines in Japan.","Gross margin for the third quarter was 55.3%, an increase of 140 basis points from last year. This increase in gross profit enabled us to increase our sales and marketing and R&D spend meaningfully in the quarter. Core operating margins were up 155 basis points in the quarter and 90 basis points year-to-date. This strong margin expansion helped to drive double-digit adjusted net earnings growth in the third quarter. During the quarter, we generated approximately $700 million of free cash flow from continuing operations, up 35% and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was over 150%.","Now, let\u2019s take a more detailed look at the results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, core revenues were up 3% and reported revenues grew over 60% largely due to the Pall acquisition. Core operating margins increased 180 basis points and the reported operating profit margin increased to 15.4%. At Beckman Life Sciences, low single-digit core growth in the quarter was driven by momentum in China, while developed markets were essentially flat. The backdrop of government investment in healthcare in China, coupled with Beckman\u2019s strong execution, contributed double-digit gains in that region.","Beckman\u2019s particle counting characterization business had another good quarter, with double-digit growth driven by global biopharmaceutical demand. The team also launched a new product that supports drug discovery and development. The Vi-CELL MetaFLEX is a biochemistry analyzer that resulted from collaboration with one of our diagnostic businesses, Radiometer. Beckman incorporated the technology behind Radiometer\u2019s blood gas analyzer to create the Vi-CELL MetaFLEX, which analyzes cell cultures, a crucial component in biotherapy production. This crosspollination between Beckman and Radiometer is a powerful example of the unique opportunities we have at Danaher to bring greater value to customers by collaborating across the portfolio.","Leica Microsystems core revenue declined in the quarter. Growth was impacted by weakness in the academic and industrial end markets, particularly in North America and Western Europe. This was partially offset by double-digit gains in the high growth markets as China continued to be a bright spot, particularly for our Confocal business.","SCIEX posted another quarter of mid single-digit core revenue growth led by global strength in pharmaceuticals and food as well as environmental testing. Geographically, we saw declines in Japan and in Europe, where academic weakness impacted results. In the high growth markets, China and India each maintained strong double-digit growth. Our service offering continues to be a differentiator at SCIEX as the team drove further improvements in contract renewals and attachment rates in the quarter.","As I mentioned at the start of the call, we recently announced our acquisition of Phenomenex, a leading player in chromatography consumables that supports a variety of analytical testing applications in the health, research and environmental segments. Phenomenex is 100% consumables, a high margin business in an attractive mid single-digit growth industry that is adjacent to where SCIEX participates. We expect to achieve a double-digit return on our investment in less than 5 years and believe that Phenomenex will help us to continue creating long-term value that\u2019s part of our Life Sciences portfolio.","Pall delivered another quarter of good growth and execution. Continued strength in biopharmaceutical end markets and demand for single-use technologies underpinned strong growth at Pall Life Sciences. Pall\u2019s market leading solutions are the forefront of the biopharma evolution, and 9 of the 12 new biologic drugs cleared by the FDA last year specified Pall products in their processes. This is a tremendous testament to the quality and reliability that Pall provides to its customers everyday.","Pall Industrial revenue was down in the quarter with solid gains in aerospace and microelectronics offset by declines in energy and machinery as heavy industrial end markets remained challenging. August marked the one year anniversary of our acquisition of Pall Corporation and the team\u2019s exceptional implementation of DBS has been a critical driver of what we have been able to accomplish thus far. Since the beginning of the year, Pall has achieved more than 150 basis points of gross margin expansion and improved operating margins by over 350 basis points. At the same time, we have been able to put some of that benefit back into sales and marketing and R&D. This reinvestment, combined with the team\u2019s thoughtful use of DBS growth tools, like accelerated product development and [indiscernible] has resulted in a number of key new products launching ahead of schedule this year. By delivering these impactful new solutions to the market sooner, we can deliver greater value to our customers and further enhance Pall\u2019s growth trajectory.","Moving now to Diagnostics, both reported and core revenues increased 3%. The team\u2019s solid execution generated 250 basis points of core operating margin expansion and reported operating margins increased to 16%. Sustained strength in China and India was complemented by modest growth in the developed markets. Core revenue at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics was up low single-digits, with growth in emerging markets partially offset by softer demand in North America and Europe. Recent installed base growth in China contributed to strong immunoassay performance in the quarter, with the business achieving double-digit recurring revenue in the region.","One of our five core values at Danaher is customers talk, we listen, and Beckman Diagnostics recognizes the importance of helping customers drive performance across multiple labs with different needs and different test volumes. One of the ways we differentiate our offering is to partner with customers and help them integrate Danaher Business System tools and processes into their labs and workflows. The results can be tremendously impactful, better speed to results, operational efficiency and ultimately improved clinician workflows. The effectiveness of one such collaboration was recently highlighted by a customer that operates one of the largest regional lab networks in the Midwestern United States. Within 6 months, Beckman helped them implement over 180 analyzers and 4 automation lines at 30 different hospitals and lab locations without any patient disruption. This customer was recently awarded a prestigious Advance Laboratory of the Year award for 2016 and has mentioned their partnership with Beckman and the adoption of DBS tools as a key factor in their labs\u2019 transformational success.","Radiometer achieved mid single-digit core revenue growth led by continued double-digit growth in both China and India and solid performance in the developed markets. We saw robust demand for consumables across our portfolio of acute care diagnostic instruments. At Leica Biosystems, core revenues grew mid single-digits in the quarter led by high single-digit growth in North America and expanding installed base and strong consumable sales contributed to double-digit growth in our advanced staining business.","Back in September, we announced our acquisition of Cepheid, a leading molecular diagnostics innovator in the fastest growing segment of diagnostics. Cepheid has the largest global installed base of molecular diagnostics instruments, combined with the broadest test menu available. We expect this highly complementary addition to our diagnostics portfolio to accelerate our growth strategy and further differentiate Danaher\u2019s diagnostics offering. We also foresee tremendous opportunities with the application of DBS at Cepheid, which we believe will help drive better top and bottom line performance.","Turning now to our Dental segment, reported revenues increased 3.5% and reported operating margins increased slightly to 15%, with 20 basis points of core margin expansion. Core revenues were up 3% driven by our equipment, implant and orthodontic product lines, while we saw softer demand for consumables in the quarter. Positive gains in North America were offset by weakness in Western Europe. Strength in high growth markets was supported by another quarter of double-digit growth in China across all of our major dental product lines. Since 2010, we have grown our Dental revenues in China from $15 million to over $150 million today and we are now positioned as one of the leading players in the region. We have evolved our business model as well in China to position ourselves as more of a localized player by expanding our R&D teams, increasing local commercial coverage and establishing manufacturing capabilities in the region. This approach, combined with our comprehensive product suite, enables us to provide a full service China-centric offering that enhances our customers\u2019 experiences and positions us well for continued growth in this market.","Let\u2019s turn to Nobel Biocare. Nobel Biocare\u2019s core revenue grew at a low single-digit rate with demand for implant systems and regeneratives driven by recently launched new products that have quickly gained traction with customers. Similar to what we saw across our other Dental businesses in the quarter, sales in Western Europe softened at Nobel while China continued to do well. The benefit of the team\u2019s operational and cost improvements using DBS continues to help fuel Nobel\u2019s new product and innovation engine.","Turning to our Environmental and Applied Solutions segment, core revenues grew 3.5% with reported revenues up 4.5%. Core operating margin expanded 60 basis points and reported operating margin was down slightly at 24.3%. In Product Identification, core revenues increased at a mid single-digit rate and we saw strong demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables across most major geographies. Sales growth of our packaging and color solutions offerings improved sequentially and was led primarily by increased demand in the U.S. and Latin America.","Videojet showed solid growth performance delivering mid single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Strength in developed markets and Latin America was modestly offset by declines in China primarily due to industrial end market weakness. Videojet continued to grow the number of connected printers in the market expanding our remote solutions offering for customers and driving high single-digit service revenue growth.","Core revenue grew low single-digits at Esko led by increased demand at MediaBeacon, which we acquired in 2015. As a reminder, MediaBeacon provides digital asset management software that brand owners and packaging managers use to ensure accuracy and compliance. With the help of DBS tools like funnel management and transformative marketing, MediaBeacon has generated greater market awareness and demand for our integrated solutions, which support customers across their full brand and packaging workflows. At X-Rite, core revenue grew low single-digits with strong performance in North America and China partially offset by the rest of Asia.","Lastly, turning to Water Quality, core revenue growth for the platform increased at a low single-digit rate. Hach\u2019s core revenue declined slightly in the quarter as industrial end market weakness contributed to softer demand in North America and China. We saw similarly lackluster activity in Eastern Europe as constrained government funding and political instability affected municipal projects. We anticipate better core growth at Hach in the fourth quarter. ChemTreat core revenue grew at a mid single-digit rate as the team delivered solid commercial execution and expanded their customer base in the U.S. Strength in North America and the food and beverage end markets was partially offset by lower demand in Latin America, particularly in the more commodity-oriented markets.","At Trojan, core revenue increased double-digits driven by consistent municipal demand across developed and emerging markets. Our increased municipal systems installed base contributed to strong replacement growth and bidding activity was up low single-digits globally. A few key municipal project wins materialized in Asia as ultraviolet water treatment solutions have gained interest in the region.","So to wrap up, we are pleased with our performance in the current macroeconomic environment. We believe that the steps we have taken to reshape our portfolio position, it positions us well for stronger growth and value creation. The diversity and strength of our businesses, combined with our team\u2019s focused execution using the Danaher Business System, is what sustains our competitive advantage. We believe that this combination will continue to serve both our customers and our shareholders well. We are initiating fourth quarter guidance for adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations of $1.01 to $1.05, which assumes fourth quarter core revenue growth comparable to the third quarter of 2016. For the full year 2016, we are raising our adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations guidance to $3.57 to $3.61, which at the midpoint would represent an increase of approximately 20% from 2015.","Matt Gugino","Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Erica, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to the line of Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning. Good morning, guys.","Tom Joyce","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis","You see the pattern that since you hired Gugino, you start putting up these big numbers?","Tom Joyce","He has got a big team supporting him, Scott. We love him, but big team, big team. Broad-based.","Scott Davis","Well, anyways, I am intrigued by, it\u2019s your one year anniversary at Pall and I am intrigued on how does that \u2013 have your results matched up with the deal model or kind of specifically, what type of return on capital are you sitting on kind of as you look point in time right now on that deal?","Tom Joyce","Sure. Scott, we are very, very pleased with the performance of the team, both the Danaher team that has joined the team at Pall as well as the legacy Pall associates. The combination of those two teams has gotten the business off to a tremendous start in the first year. DBS has played a huge role in the progress that we have made there. As you might recall, that team had sort of begun the journey before we arrived on the scene, but the combination of the Danaher team that\u2019s gone in and the Pall team have really accelerated the pace of progress. There have been over 350 kaizens that have been completed both on operational side as well as on the commercial side. We have seen the tremendous lift in core operating margins in that business. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we are now seeing investment in some of the sales and marketing and the new product areas start to make a real difference in terms of getting new products, not only launched, but commercialized on time and effectively. So, we are off to a good start. You know we took the improvements from a cost standpoint up from $60 million in the first year to $100 million. So, we are a little bit ahead of schedule in that respect. And I think, obviously, that lifts the returns here in the near term. Relative to where we will end up on a 4-year, 5-year basis and beyond, I think again we are off to a very good start. I think we have a lot of opportunity to lift those returns, but it\u2019s still early days and there is a lot of hard work to be done in the months and quarters and years ahead, but a great start.","Scott Davis","And when \u2013 and just taking on Pall, when Pall Industrial comes back and I would love to hear your view on when you think you move into positive territory there, but when Pall Industrial comes back, would you expect outsized operating leverage on a cost out or how would you think about it, I guess, if you are on our shoes?","Tom Joyce","Yes. Well, first of all, I think we have seen \u2013 while not the beginnings of growth on the industrial side, I think we haven\u2019t seen \u2013 we have not seen another leg down. In other words, we have seen some stability. The industrial side was still down mid single-digits in the quarter, while the Life Science side was up mid single-digits. And so as those businesses begin to improve both from the standpoint of our execution and DBS is playing a role there from a new product execution standpoint and a commercialization perspective. When those improvements kick in and we get some lift from the macro, I think the big benefit you are going to see is in terms of the core growth of that business and the read through on an operating margin basis from that core growth. I don\u2019t know that it necessarily changes a trajectory from a cost-out perspective. We are working on the cost structures, both on the life science side and on the industrial side as well as across the horizontal components of G&A. So, I think the real lift comes when we start to see that core growth turn positive and we start to see the read through from that growth.","Scott Davis","Makes sense. Thanks, guys.","Tom Joyce","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Steve Winoker from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Steve Winoker","Thanks and good morning.","Tom Joyce","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Winoker","To echo Scott, I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 team is important, but don\u2019t forget Matt in all this. So, listen I want to just start with the actual fourth quarter core growth that you just talked about at about the same as third quarter. Just looking for where you might see signs of acceleration, how you think about that trending into next year? I know if I look at 2015, the third quarter was up year-on-year 3%, the fourth quarter was up only 1.5%. So just wondering, is this conservative in terms of how you are seeing, but to give us some sense of the fourth quarter if you could?","Tom Joyce","Yes, I wouldn\u2019t describe it as conservative, Steve. I do think though there is a number of considerations that go into how we look at the fourth quarter. I think it starts with how pleased we are with the performance to this point in the third quarter, with all four segments driving at least 3% core growth. And I think now with a portfolio where greater than 60% of the revenues are in the aftermarket and where there is some stability in these markets, but not necessarily anything positive to write home about macro-economically, I think there is cause for some degree of caution in the outlook. You are reading same macroeconomic news that everybody else is and certainly that we are. There is a number of sources of uncertainty in the market today whether that\u2019s the election uncertainty in the U.S., the Brexit uncertainty throughout Europe, the questions around turns in some of the high growth markets or previously known as high growth markets as I sometimes say around places like Latin America, the Middle East, Russia and particularly those markets with a good deal of commodity exposure and certainly those with a high degree of industrial exposure. So, it\u2019s hard not to be appropriately concerned with some of that sources of uncertainty. But that being said we think we have got an incredibly resilient portfolio right now again underpinned by that level of aftermarket position and a portfolio we think that will continue to perform well despite those uncertainties.","Steve Winoker","And as you think about extending that through next year, what would be the biggest things that would drive you from that 3% level to say something higher, even another 50 basis points? What are the few things we should be looking for?","Tom Joyce","Well, first of all, we have still got plenty of work to do left here in 2016 before we get into 2017. And we will be going through a process here in the fourth quarter around budgets and be in a much better position to give you some specifics when we are together in December. But if you really stand back and you look at us today, I just mentioned the strength of the portfolio and the repositioning and the level of aftermarket that gives us a strong foundation, but I think we are encouraged about the continued improvement and performance at Pall with the addition of Cepheid and Phenomenex coming into the Life Sciences and Diagnostics portfolio and continuing to help us from a growth rate standpoint as well as from an operating margin lift and then as we mentioned before, we think there is plenty of opportunity for continued improvement in growth in our diagnostics business, in our life science, in number of our life science business as well as in dental. So clearly we could use a little bit of macroeconomic headwind but I think there is \u2013 excuse me tailwind but I think we have plenty of opportunities to play offense and make our own way in a good deal of the portfolio.","Dan Comas","And Steve, just to add a few things, one, on a year-to-date basis pause up mid single-digit that\u2019s not been in the core number, as Tom alluded to that\u2019s with no benefit from the industrial side of pause. So even if industrial stabilizes a little bit pause should be a net contributor added to our core growth next year. Our industrial instrumentation business ad hoc has been weak. Our experience that tends to not last very long, I think that would be, we would expect sort of better numbers ad hoc here in the fourth quarter going into next year, so even those two items even before Sepi [ph] had come in, again Sepi [ph] won\u2019t impact our reported core number but will help our pro forma core number in 2017 as well.","Steve Winoker","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I will pass it on. Thanks.","Operator","And we will go next to the side of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Tom Joyce","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Good morning. Could we build a little bit more on your discussion about the outfit [ph] and muni activity, it feels like that has been building for a couple of quarters now and I just wonder if you could give us little bit more color on geographically what\u2019s going on and kind of what the pipeline of business looks here for the next call it 6 to 12 months?","Tom Joyce","And Jeff, specifically on in the muni world?","Jeffrey Sprague","Yes, muni world.","Tom Joyce","Sure, sure. Well I think the brightest spot that we\u2019ve seen in the municipal world around water. Our municipal water business has been a Trojan where we have seen good performance this year, where we have seen double digit growth. In the last quarter, we\u2019ve seen increasing win rates and a reasonable lift in bidding activity. But I wouldn\u2019t say that that bidding activity necessarily suggests that that double digit growth rate is a sustainable one. This is more of a probably a mid single digit type of market. But we have been very encouraged by the performance at Trojan, their competitiveness I think has read through in terms of their win rates and so we are in a reasonable market right now. I think we are winning share. So I think that\u2019s encouraging from an equipment and an infrastructure perspective and we are seeing that globally. I think there is a different side of the story though which is on the municipal business in North America the day-to-day consumables business is not showing the kind of strength that I just represented at Trojan. We are seeing low single digit growth in that market right now still a very good market and that continues to be gaining share there but not nearly at the rate that we are seeing some of the infrastructure build out in certain markets.","Jeffrey Sprague","Right. And then just on Phenomenex, I don\u2019t know a lot about the company obviously but interesting that it\u2019s a 100% consumables and I always think about the strength of your consumable business being tied to the inherent strength in your platform and equipment businesses, you know are there other assets like this that you know are kind of tuck-ins. Are these 100% consumable companies under strategic and competitive threat as you know folks like yourself build equipment business and if there is any perspective on how to think about just kind of the dynamics of that company and how you know that the landscape is there?","Tom Joyce","Well, Phenomenex is a great franchise and it is a \u2013 virtually a 100% consumables business with great gross margins, gross margins in the 70% neighborhood and mid-20s operating margins but still with opportunities for improvement be it DBS and we are thrilled to be able to acquire this asset. We\u2019ve admired that business for a long time. We were able to acquire it at an attractive valuation and I think for those you\u2019ve asked us about return thresholds in the past, this is clearly a business that we believe we will achieve double digit return on invested capital in less than 5 years and so and that obviously for us is very typical for a large bolt-on or a midsize adjacency deal and really opens up a number of other possibilities. Jeff, this is a business to your point about install base versus consumables where Phenomenex has become the leader they are largely because they actually are equipment agnostic and they focus on specific applications and workflows that address unique customer problems and therefore create unique customer value. We\u2019ve had a partnership with Phenomenex at SCIEX for a number of years and it has been a very successful one but as some of you may recall we are also consumable agnostic in the sense of chromatography columns at SCIEX and so what this allows us to do essentially is bring a greater variety, a broader set of solutions to our customers without necessarily having to have those consumables be captive by that install base. Obviously that can be very attractive strategically when you have it but in the particular case of the life science world being able to customize solutions or these unique applications customer challenge is a real competitive advantage.","Jeffrey Sprague","And Tom that doesn\u2019t create a channel conflict for all the other folks they were agnostic with and there are some bleed away on their other business as a result of it?","Tom Joyce","It really doesn\u2019t, Jeff. Again, we have excellent relationships with other partners in the consumables world in life sciences. We had sourced from multiple, I shouldn\u2019t even say sourced, we had \u2013 we customized solutions for customers across a number of different consumable suppliers for a long period of time and we expect to maintain those relationships then continue to be focused on what are the specific needs of the customer, the customers today and how do we serve them best.","Jeffrey Sprague","Great, thank you.","Tom Joyce","Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","And we will go next to the side of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho Peterson","Okay, thanks. Tom, wondering if you can comment on the academic market, you know the NIH data was pretty negative for September I think budget is down about 13%. And I know you called out some softness for Leica Microsystems. So, can you maybe just talk a little bit about what you are seeing on the academic market specifically?","Tom Joyce","Sure. Good morning, Tycho. You know we certainly participate in the academic market in our life science businesses but it\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t have enormous direct exposure to NIH. If you really looked at the direct exposure across a number of our businesses, we are probably in the $150 million or less with direct exposure to NIH funding. Now there is more than that in terms of indirect funding but I would say that funding issue that you mentioned clearly has had an impact on a broad basis when you talk about a variety of things that are indirectly funded or go through a number of different stages before they ultimately get to a supplier like us. We have seen weakness in that market. We have not seen any particular cause for optimism in the academic market particularly in the U.S. Europe has hung in there in pockets. Japan is weak and certainly continues to be that way. So it\u2019s not an area of strength right now and clearly the NIH funding issues have not been net particularly helpful.","Dan Comas","And Tycho, I would add that we probably saw a little bit more of a bifurcation life science in the quarter meaning that biopharma remain very strong, traditional farm, food and environmental remain solid consistent what we saw in the first half but we did see both academic and sort of industrial markets particularly at Leica weaken in the third quarter.","Tycho Peterson","That\u2019s helpful. And then on Beckman if I kind of go back to your comments last quarter, I think you talked about growing at a market rate, if you look at the results from some of the peers, they are still going little bit faster including in the high single digit range for one of them. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about you know your view of whether you can get Beckman back to maybe a mid single digit growth trajectory?","Tom Joyce","We absolutely believe that we can do that, Tycho. We have made terrific progress thus far. We have seen improvement certainly in our clinical chemistry and our immunoassay business. Our urinalysis business continues to perform very, very well. That business is up double-digits in the third quarter. And I think with the addition of Cepheid in a broader position in molecular diagnostics, particularly with the potential growth that\u2019s available in \u2013 at the point of care and potentially ultimately in the physician office lab, we do believe that both the core legacy business of Beckman will improve its growth trajectory over time. With the addition of those higher growth segments that we have acquired will be accretive to that growth profile.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then just one last quick one, can you quantify the biopharma growth from Pall that you saw in the quarter?","Tom Joyce","The life Science businesses overall was up mid single-digits on the quarter and the single use business continues to grow straight at a double-digit rate. And so we continue to see good and consistent performance on the biopharma side.","Tycho Peterson","Right. Thank you.","Tom Joyce","Thank you, Tycho.","Operator","And we will go next to the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken","Good morning gentlemen. So on Dental, it\u2019s sort of interesting, I mean the macro has been alright, I would guess in the U.S., but it feels like on North American consumables, we are seeing a little bit of choppiness, curious that sort of your thoughts for that. And then conversely, it seems like overall the segment is doing quite well, but its equipment, which I guess doesn\u2019t sort of correspond with the macro question. And then on the implant side, where it seems like you are doing quite well with the Nobel acquisition, so help us kind of make sense of what you are seeing in the segment and how much is market related and how much is better execution on your end and some of the segments that are outperforming?","Tom Joyce","Sure. Thanks Ross. Good morning. We are pleased with how the Dental business, the segment performed in the quarter, up 3%. And there was clearly some better execution on our side in a number of different areas and you have heard us speak in the past about some of the changes that we have made both organizationally and operationally. We have realigned our investments into some key areas from a new product perspective and we are seeing the benefits there. Relative to the specific portions of the business that you mentioned, we are seeing strength in our equipment business, up mid single-digits and yes, the consumable business, up more like low single-digits. And really, I think that have to do with a couple of different factors. We are executing well in the equipment side. We have new product initiatives that are making a difference there. And overall, I think we are well positioned from a portfolio perspective. You have heard the narrative from a number of different folks in the market around some softness during the course of July and August. I think we as the quarter came to a close in September we started to certainly see some of that play through. And I think absolutely varies by geography as well. I mentioned double-digit growth in places like China and India, but the U.S. much lower and certainly we are seeing some softness in Europe as well as Latin America and the Middle East. So definitely it\u2019s a tale of two cities. U.S. also about the equipment, the implant side, Nobel continues to perform very well. They have got a number of new products in the market right now, which are helping in that growth rate. And they are executing well just on a commercial basis day in and day out. And some of that obviously has been a function of the implementation of DBS on the cost side where we have been able to reallocate some of those funds into investments in sales and marketing as well as in R&D. Particularly in the third quarter, we made some significant investments in sales and marketing. And I think will pay off \u2013 that we will continue to pay off at Nobel with even improving growth rates.","Ross Muken","Great. And maybe just moving back to the capital allocation, you guys have obviously been quite busy and obviously since you have taken over, there has been a distinct bias towards growth, I guess what should we learn about your vision of what Danaher will be over the next 5 years or 10 years based on these assets, you have obviously gotten some real crown jewels within the tools, complex and Phenomenex and Pall and obviously in Cepheid you got a high growth potential, so how should we think about how you are sort of reshaping this portfolio and what the \u2013 I am not looking for quantitative, but maybe more qualitatively, how do you think about the evolution of these assets at this point?","Tom Joyce","Sure. Ross, we have gotten quite a bit done here in the last couple of years with the separation that took place with Fortive and getting Fortive off to a great start, but then making some very important and strategic acquisitions to shore up really what were three of the most important strategic needs or opportunities that we had. Nobel, on the implant and consumable side, as you mentioned Pall, to enhance our Life Sciences, specifically biopharmaceutical production position and then Cepheid, to improve our position relative to molecular diagnostics. We have had a focus strategically on the consumable side of Life Science and Phenomenex to use your term, a crown jewel in the consumable side of Life Science. So I think we feel very good about where we are right now. I wouldn\u2019t trade our portfolio, the four segments that we have today of Diagnostics, Life Science, Dental and Environmental and Applied Solutions for any portfolio in the market. And I think the game plan in the years ahead, as it has been in the past, is continued to deploy our free cash flow strategically with a strong bias towards M&A into these highly attractive segments. And I think the game plan, at least in the near-term here, given the current position of the balance sheet and all that we have to do operationally with these acquisitions is to focus on probably small or midsize bolt-ons that are strategically important to our position, that hopefully will, as these have done, will be accretive to our growth rates and improve our growth trajectories. And hopefully, that would be the case certainly on the margin side, if not initially, certainly over time. So I think that\u2019s the game going forward and it\u2019s been the plan over the last couple of years.","Ross Muken","Great. Thank you.","Tom Joyce","Thank you, Ross.","Operator","And we will go next to the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen.","Doug Schenkel","Great. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. My first question is on high growth market trends, in the third quarter, high growth market revenue growth was I think around, I think you said mid single-digits, as you described that there continue to be some headwinds relative to what we have seen at least compared to historical trends, recognizing a lot of this is out of control, I am just wondering if you would speak a little bit about the actions and investments you are taking to better position these markets for better growth in 2017?","Tom Joyce","Sure. Thanks for that question. I think we have \u2013 as we look at the high growth markets today, I am not sure we would necessarily say that there was much of a change recently in those markets, we have continued to see strength in China across a number of our businesses, if not all, business in China is up high single-digits. Real strength in Life Science, in Dental, in Diagnostics, some softness in the market and VideoJet, those are businesses where that softness largely comes from equipment than more industrially oriented end markets. And you have heard me mention a number of times, the strength that we have seen in India, which has been very consistent level strength over the last couple of years. And with those two markets being what they are, both the scale of those markets, the inherent growth rates in those markets and the strength of our positions, those are really where a great deal of our investments are going. We are largely doubling down in the markets where we have the greatest opportunities for growth in the near-term. We \u2013 what improvement we have seen and it\u2019s been very modest in places like Latin America, Brazil specifically and Russia are really more about easier comps than materially improved market conditions. And the Middle East continues to be weak. And so while we have sustained our positions there in terms of our feet on the street and our investments in commercializing new products in those markets, those have not been markets where we are significantly accelerating our investments today. Instead, the biggest incremental investments are going into those markets where we are seeing continued strength.","Doug Schenkel","Great, that\u2019s helpful and insightful. Thank you for that. My second question is on Diagnostic core margins, they improved 250 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. Yes, there was some nice improvement in the first half of about 210 basis points year-over-year. So, it\u2019s got even better in Q3. Some of this maybe a function of comps, but to the extent it isn\u2019t, could you provide a bit more detail on what\u2019s really driving accelerating improvement and how we should think about sustainability?","Tom Joyce","Well, we are certainly seeing continued improvement in the margin performance at Beckman Diagnostics. Across our Diagnostics portfolio, you have Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, both businesses we have owned for a number of years and have made tremendous progress in enhancing their operating margins. Beckman, obviously a more recent acquisition, but still 5 years ago, we have seen great lift in those operating margins to this point. But as I mentioned, Beckman represents a large business. It still has quite a bit of headroom for margin improvement. And so we have seen at this point, but we think there is more runway ahead.","Doug Schenkel","So really \u2013 sorry...","Dan Comas","Yes, Doug, it\u2019s Dan. We did benefit in Q3 with a slightly easier comp despite having said that, again, it was a very strong quarter of core margin expansion. What we are seeing is continued increase in the gross margin side, continued leverage on the G&A side while we are also stepping up R&D and sales and marketing. So, we are seeing the mix you would like to see from a margin perspective where we are getting the expansion, where we are taking part of that and putting that into more growth investments.","Doug Schenkel","That\u2019s great. That\u2019s kind of what I was getting at, is it a continuation of trend which has been good or things actually getting a little bit even better which it kind of sounds like they are. Last one, there is clearly been a lot of questions about what\u2019s going on in different geographies and different end markets and you guys have been great at providing a lot of directional qualitative information to help us out there. I just figured I would ask in case you guys will be willing to whether or not you could just give us core revenue growth by end market and by developed geography in the quarter across all businesses?","Dan Comas","Well, we don\u2019t give quite that level of detail, but we did talk about continued double-digit kind of mid-teens growth in India, high single-digit growth in China. Both the U.S. and Western Europe were up low single-digit. That\u2019s been pretty consistent. I would add as a footnote probably seeing some incremental signs of weakness in Western Europe where our overall numbers in Q3 were pretty comparable to what we had in the first half. Tom alluded to the academic comment seeing a little bit of that industrial weakness in places like Hach, not a big change, but probably on the margin the tone is a little bit cautious in Western Europe. And Japan, we continue to be down low to mid single-digits.","Doug Schenkel","Okay, thank you again.","Tom Joyce","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","We will go next to the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Derik de Bruin","Hey, good morning. So, before I ask another geography question, I just wanted to ask a Diagnostics question. So, it\u2019s been \u2013 you have closed the Cepheid or you haven\u2019t closed it, but you have announced the Cepheid transaction, you have had a little bit more time to think about it. Any further additional thoughts on where you think you can ultimately get the gross margin on the Cepheid products? That was sort of a topic when we did the call the last time, I just wonder if you have any further thoughts on it?","Tom Joyce","Derik thanks. I don\u2019t know that we have a lot more to offer. During due diligence, we were able to spend a good deal of time with the team and understand the roadmap that they have laid out for gross margin. You have heard a lot of that from the business in terms of the opportunities around improving the cost structure of the cartridge. We think those are \u2013 that\u2019s very credible. We think they got solid roadmap for executing on those improvements. And obviously, once we have closed the transaction, we can engage directly with them, we will be bringing the tools of the Danaher Business System that we have used successfully in a number of other businesses to improve gross margins. You just heard Dan commented what we have done at Beckman and we will obviously bring that to bear at Cepheid and I think you will see those improvements come through.","Derik de Bruin","Great. And just one more Western Europe question, are you seeing \u2013 is it budget delays that you are seeing or people just canceling orders or people just hesitating on spending? Just a little bit more color on what\u2019s going on in terms of specific trends, if there is anything you can sort of draw from what you are seeing across the businesses?","Tom Joyce","Derik, was that a Europe question, I am sorry?","Derik de Bruin","The Western Europe question, yes.","Tom Joyce","Yes. Much more in terms of delays, event cancellations, we tend to see both at the tendering level as well as at the purchase order level folks hanging back in certain cases, it\u2019s because budgets haven\u2019t been fully approved yet. In other cases, they are just trying to get paperwork through approvals. And normally, that\u2019s a circumstance where because of some levels of austerity folks are just slowing things down.","Derik de Bruin","Great, thanks.","Operator","And our final question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Thanks, guys. Good morning.","Tom Joyce","Hi, Nigel.","Dan Comas","Hi, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Yes. So, we covered a lot of ground, so I will keep this relatively quick. But I did want to come back to Dental there is obviously a lot of noise from some of the competitors regarding the U.S. channel. So, I am just wondering given the vocabulary we have seen, the large recovery we have seen core growth rates in dental, how confident are you \u2013 you can sustain this level of growth in the sort of the 3% plus bracket?","Tom Joyce","Well, clearly, there is some cause for concern or caution around that given some of the narrative that we heard from the channel during the course of the quarter. We saw some of that in the month of September come through in terms of the order rates on the consumable side. So, I think we feel pretty good about continuing to improve our own execution, particularly on the equipment side, also at Nobel. But I think on the consumables side, we will need to make sure that we are seeing some improvement in the sellout either from a programmatic perspective or just from an overall macroeconomic perspective.","Nigel Coe","Great, okay. And then Diagnostics, we don\u2019t have a great history on the quarterly performance of Diagnostics, but it does feel like last year, we saw maybe an unusually large Q-over-Q step down in margins in 3Q followed by a pretty big pickup in 4Q. Would you expect to see a similar 4Q buildup out of 3Q? And then more broadly on 4Q restructuring across the portfolio, in the past, Danaher had the very heavy restructuring actions in 4Q, I know this year is not going to be anywhere like that, but maybe just comment on how you see 4Q restructuring actions across the portfolio?","Dan Comas","Yes, Nigel. On Diagnostics first, seasonally, Q3 tends to be a little lighter, so that play out again this year, there was big improvement versus Q3 a year ago and we do expect a nice, seasonal pickup in Q4, I would expect margins above where they were a year ago Q4, which was north of 18%. Regarding restructuring, we continue to take actions throughout the year. We don\u2019t really kind of call those out. I would expect our overall restructuring spend to be in the same ballpark as last year, again probably a little bit more evenly distributed through the year.","Nigel Coe","Okay, guys. Thanks a lot.","Tom Joyce","Thanks, Nigel.","Operator","And at this time, we would like to thank everybody for their participation on today\u2019s conference call.

We were very pleased with how the team executed throughout the year, delivering solid core revenue growth, significant margin improvement, adjusted EPS growth of more than 20%, and outstanding free cash flow.","The Danaher business system continues to be our foundation, our competitive advantage, and a key driver of our performance. You've heard us talk about running the Danaher playbook, meaning that we're consistently driving our businesses to improve gross and operating margins and lower G&A, all while reinvesting more into R&D and sales and marketing. In 2016 alone we improved both growth \u2013 gross and core operating margin by more than 100 basis points. At the same time we reduced G&A and meaningfully increased R&D and sales and marketing spend as a percent of sales.","For the full year, our differentiated portfolio, investments in organic growth initiatives, and good execution helped drive 3% core revenue growth in a challenging macro environment. With the addition of our recent acquisitions and other portfolio moves, our total annual revenues are now nearly $17 billion.","From an M&A perspective in 2016 we closed eight acquisitions across all five platforms for nearly $5 billion, including our two largest deals, Cepheid and Phenomenex. We also completed the spinoff of Fortive, which was an important step towards optimizing our portfolio and strategically positioning Danaher for long-term outperformance.","We generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow in 2016. And our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was greater than 115%, representing the 25th consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income.","Turning now to the fourth quarter. Sales grew 6% to $4.6 billion with core revenue increasing 3.5%. The impact of currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 4%.","Geographically, high growth markets revenue was up high single-digits. China and India continued to lead the way, while Latin America, the Middle East, and Russia all returned to growth in part due to easier comparisons. Developed market core revenues were up low single-digits, led by growth in the U.S. and Western Europe.","Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 54.5%, an increase of 230 basis points from last year. And core operating margins were up 170 basis points. These strong margin results are a testament to our team's focused execution and helped to drive double-digit adjusted net earnings growth in the fourth quarter.","Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.05, which represents an increase of 15% over last year. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $3.61, up over 20% from 2015.","Now let's take a more detailed look at results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue was up 6% and core revenue grew 4%. Reported operating profit margin increased to 16.8%. And core operating margin increased 345 basis points. This increase was driven by great execution using DBS, particularly at Pall, where the team drove a number of meaningful operational improvements.","Beckman Life Sciences core revenue grew low single digits in the quarter, led by our Flow Cytometry and Particle Counting businesses. A strong finish to the year in China was capped off by another quarter of double-digit growth in the region, while weakness persisted in Latin America. Growth in North America was driven by demand for CytoFLEX, which continued to be a meaningful contributor to share gains in our Flow Cytometry business.","At Leica Microsystems, we saw incremental improvements in the quarter with core revenue up low single digits. This was largely driven by North America and China, offset by declines in Japan.","SCIEX increased core revenue at a mid-single-digit rate, led by growth in China and Western Europe. SCIEX's service offering had another quarter of double-digit growth. And we saw continued strength in the food, environmental and pharmaceutical end markets, particularly within the fast-growing biopharmaceutical space.","In 2016 our Life Sciences platform delivered a significant number of new products to our biopharma customers in order to improve their bio production processes. One example is at SCIEX, where we just launched the X500B, the latest model in our X-Series mass spectrometry platform. You may remember that the first model in the series, the X500R, was designed for routine food, environmental, and forensic testing labs. Now we've added the X500B, which is specifically designed for complex biologics characterization. The X500B brings simplicity and high performance to one of the most compact mass spec footprints in the market. Its ease of use makes it accessible to even novice mass spec users and helps customers get better answers faster in their bio processing work flows.","During the fourth quarter we successfully closed the acquisition of Phenomenex, a leading player in chromatography consumables that operates in an attractive industry adjacent to where SCIEX participates. Phenomenex is off to a great start, and we're excited to have the team on board.","Over at Pall, mid-single-digit core revenue growth was driven by Pall Life Sciences, where we saw continued demand across our Biopharmaceuticals business with particular strength in single-use technologies. Pall Industrial delivered positive results for the first time since the acquisition, with low-single-digit core revenue growth supported by strong execution in microelectronics and aerospace. This growth was offset by declines in our Process Technologies business.","2016 was a great year for Pall. And the team improved execution both operationally and commercially using the Danaher Business System. Pall delivered more than 400 basis points of operating margin expansion, improved on time delivery by over 1,500 basis points, and significantly increased their market visibility.","By applying DBS principles to Pall's R&D initiatives, the team has been able to combine Pall's innovation prowess with greater executional focus to launch a number of new technologies ahead of schedule. In total Pall launched 35 new products this year, a 50% increase over last year. And the team was able to get these new products to market 25% faster.","Moving now to Diagnostics. Reported revenue increased 11% and core revenue increased 3%. Core operating margins grew by 80 basis points. And reported operating margins declined to 12.6%, predominantly due to the acquisition related charges from the Cepheid transaction. For the full year Diagnostics core operating margins were up 200 basis points.","Core revenue at Beckman Coulter was up low single digits in the quarter, led by our immunoassay solutions. Growth across all major geographies was led by demand in high growth markets, including double digit gains in the Middle East and China. We saw better performance in North America. And importantly the team continues to drive improvement in customer retention and win rates.","Radiometer achieved high single digit core revenue growth in the quarter. We saw positive performance in all major regions, with high-growth markets led by double digit growth in Latin America and China. Both our blood gas and AQT lines performed well. And we believed Radiometer continued to gain share in 2016.","At Leica Biosystems core revenue declined at low single digits with growth in Western Europe and China offset by softness in North America and the Middle East. Advanced Staining Consumables achieved double-digit growth, while we saw weakness in our core Histology and Pathology imaging product lines.","In November we successfully closed the acquisition of Cepheid, a leading innovator in the fast-growing area of molecular diagnostics. Cepheid is off to a good start, delivering double digit revenue growth in the quarter. And we continue to see tremendous opportunity to deliver better top and bottom line performance over time through the application of DBS.","Turning to our Dental segment. Reported and core revenues increased 50 basis points and reported operating margins decreased slightly to 15.4%. While we had solid growth across our specialty product line, including Orthodontics and Implants, this was mostly offset by continued market weakness in our traditional Dental Consumables and Equipment businesses. We anticipate that these more challenging market conditions will persist into the early part of 2017.","We've mentioned before that we're approaching the entire Dental platform as a new acquisition. And despite the recent market weakness, we're encouraged by the early results. In 2016 the team improved core revenue growth, added over 75 basis points of gross margin, and increased core operating margins by 90 basis points. We also lowered our G&A costs by 50 basis points, which was helped in part by a 30% reduction of our manufacturing and back office footprint. By improving the cost structure we facilitated greater investment back into the business to drive growth.","We increased R&D spend by approximately 10% to reinvigorate new product development. And our investments and go-to-market initiatives are up 5% year on year to help improve our commercial execution. So overall, we feel very well positioned with our Dental portfolio and remain focused on enhancing our foundation for long term growth.","Moving now to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 3.5%, with core revenue up 4%. Good execution by the team generated 210 basis points in core operating margin expansion. And reported operating margin increased to 24%.","In Product Identification core revenue increased at a mid-single-digit rate. This growth was led by strong demand for marketing and coding equipment and related consumables across most major geographies. Sales growth of our Packaging and Color Solutions was led by positive momentum in both North and Latin America.","Videojet closed out a great year on a strong note, delivering high single digit core revenue growth in the fourth quarter. The business grew across all major product lines and geographies with particular strength in North America, Western Europe, and Latin America. Videojet also achieved another quarter of double digit service growth. And we believe that we continued to gain share relative to the market.","With over 15 years of experience applying the Danaher Business System, Videojet continues to utilize DBS to drive improvements across the business. By applying DBS to drive disciplined marketing, R&D, and service growth initiatives, Videojet has achieved mid-single digit core revenue growth or better in each of the last seven years, while meaningfully expanding margins. The Videojet team continues to set a tremendous example of how we can continuously sharpen our competitive advantage with DBS.","At Esko core revenue increased at a mid-single digit rate on strength in both North and Latin America. While at X-Rite, core revenue was up low single digits, driven by good performance in Pantone's Color Standards business.","Finally, turning to Water Quality. Core revenue growth for the platform increased at a low single digit rate. At Hach, low single digit core revenue growth was supported by modest improvements in municipal and industrial performance in the U.S., partially offset by sluggish project activity in Eastern Europe. We are, however, encouraged by mid-single digit bookings growth in the quarter, as we saw improving order trends in both the U.S. and Western Europe.","Earlier in the year, Hach launched the TU5 series turbidity meters, an innovative new technology that dramatically improves water quality testing for customers. A first in the industry, the TU5 series uses the same new detection technology in both online and lab instruments to deliver fast, accurate measurements that consistently match. This is important, as it now provides drinking water professionals with identical online and lab results, giving them superior confidence that they deliver clean, safe drinking water to their communities. This successful launch of the TU5 series has been driven by Hach's highly effective new product commercialization process and is also a great example of how Hach continues to deliver breakthrough innovation to our customers.","During the fourth quarter, Trojan increased core revenue at a low single digit rate off a tough prior-year comparison. Trojan had very strong performance in 2016, achieving high single digit core revenue growth for the second consecutive year, helped by continued demand in the municipal disinfection end markets in both the U.S. and Western Europe.","And finally at ChemTreat, core revenue grew at a high single digit rate during the quarter, as the team continued to gain share relative to the market. Strength in both North and Latin America benefited from improved conditions in certain industrial end markets, including mining and steel. It's worth noting that in 2016 we marked ChemTreat's 49th consecutive year of growth, a tremendous accomplishment and a testament to the team's commitment to DBS and their best-in-class commercial execution.","So to wrap up. We're very pleased with our strong fourth quarter results, capping off a transformative year for Danaher. In 2016 the team delivered double digit earnings growth, meaningful margin expansion, and strong free cash flow. We also executed on a number of strategically significant acquisitions during the year, including Cepheid and Phenomenex. We believe that the strength of our portfolio combined with the power of DBS provides the foundation for enhancing our growth trajectory and delivering long-term outperformance.","We're initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $0.82 and $0.85. This assumes core revenue growth of approximately 3%, which is modestly impacted by one less selling day year on year in the first quarter.","As we announced at our annual investor event in December, we continue to expect full year 2017 core revenue growth of 3% to 4% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.85 to $3.95.","Matthew E. Gugino - Danaher Corp.","Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Roxanna, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Morning, Scott.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Dental is kind of a business that seems to come in and out of favor for you guys every couple years and problems here and there and good times, bad times. But I know it's a global business, so it's hard to isolate exactly. But would you always \u2013 I mean when you think about fixing it \u2013 \"fixing it,\" it's still a pretty darn good business. But is it more of a product fix? A channel fix? A cost fix? I mean how do you \u2013 and how is it \u2013 how difficult is it? I mean just give us a sense. Because I feel like I've heard this fix Dental speech a few times before in the Danaher history.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Sure, Scott. Thanks for the question. My history with the Dental platform is about I guess 2.5 years old. And as far as favor goes, I've long been in favor, at least in the last 2.5 years, of the Dental platform, largely because I think it has tremendous opportunities. I think it has such fundamental growth drivers on a global basis.","And I think our performance over a number of years has not been up to our capabilities. In other words I think we have a tremendous opportunity to improve both the growth trajectory and the margin performance of the platform. So I'm very much \u2013 I'm very favorably disposed towards the platform, both from the standpoint of the fundamentals of the market on a global basis as well as the opportunity that it represents.","Relative to what we have been doing and will continue to do and the challenges associated with it. I think it started with that approach that I mentioned both in December as well as on this call, about thinking about it as a new acquisition, essentially taking a new approach. You might say a somewhat more radical approach. In other words when we approach a newly acquired business, we tend to not approach it through small, incremental improvements. You look at what we've done at Beckman, you look at what we've most recently done at Pall, and you see much more significant amount of activity around DBS. A much more significant infusion of talent and as a result of that, more significant levels of improvement.","You asked about product, channel, cost, et cetera. I would really go back to this comment I made about running the Danaher playbook. It does involve cost. It does involve rationalizing a number of dimensions of the platform that has an impact on the cost structure. It involves rationalizing the manufacturing footprint, the instrumentation and equipment platforms, the brands, even the operating structure from a people perspective.","But the playbook then has that cost not all dropping to the bottom line. You've seen good operating performance this year. But it really involves reinvesting some of that back into the business to drive growth. And I think what the team has done so successfully in the last year is both drive that operating margin performance up and reinvest with, as you heard me comment, 5% to 10% increases in R&D and sales and marketing to get the growth engine moving. And so I think it's going to take some time. But I think we're on the right track. Again I think the fundamentals are solid and the room for operating improvements are significant.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good answer. Just a real quick follow-up.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Sure.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","How do you do M&A when you don't really know the tax rate of what you're buying? Is that something right now you kind of put back on hold till you have more clarity on tax? Or is it not as important as maybe we think?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Well, Scott, given all the various proposals out there, it is a little bit of an unknown. But the two or three sort of leading candidates of a new potential structure based upon the analysis we've done would all suggest it would be neutral to positive to us. So I don't think there's a structure out there at least that's high on the list right now that would be a negative for us. And that would worry me a little bit from an M&A perspective, but I don't think that's the case.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. Okay. Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Hey. Thanks, guys. Just while \u2013 before we go to the next question, Roxanna, I just want to make one other point on the back of Scott's question about the Dental platform. I think if you step back for a second. I know we get a lot of questions about the Dental platform. I think it's important to recognize that the Dental platform does represent about 15% of the corporation. And there are a number of businesses inside of that platform, like our Implant business and our Orthodontics platform that continue to perform quite well. And you've got the other 85% of the platform that from a core growth perspective is well on its way and I think is performing quite well. So I think it's also important to put the Dental platform in context, relative to the scale of it within the corporation.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Fair point. Thank you, guys.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. Tom, I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on some of the areas where you saw an improvement on the industrial side. You talked about Pall picking up low single digit core revenue growth. Can you maybe just talk about what the order book looks like and expectations for 2017? And similarly with Hach, you talked about mid-single digit bookings. So what's the outlook there?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Sure. Thanks, Tycho. Good morning. We were encouraged somewhat by what we saw, I would say in the latter part of the fourth quarter and certainly in December on the industrial side. Pall Industrial clearly being one of those, our first quarter of positive core growth certainly since \u2013 in some time and since we've owned the business. So we're particularly encouraged by that.","Water Quality, while that's been somewhat challenged from an industrial perspective during the course of the year, we saw some improvement there in the fourth quarter. Our PID business, which it's admittedly not as industrially oriented as perhaps Pall Industrial is, clearly seeing some excellent performance there.","And then finally I think our Life Science business, which has some industrial exposure, particularly at Leica Microsystems, to name one example, also showing some improvement. So I think we're not really ready to call an inflection point, Tycho, but I think there are some signs in the order book that I think are encouraging.","Relative to expectations in the first quarter, again not calling an inflection point, but I think we would expect some similar performance in the first quarter to what we saw in the fourth quarter, not a dramatic change. The 3% core growth overall that we have dialed in in the first quarter implies a level of consistency there. A little bit of an impact of days that dampen the numbers slightly. But in general I think we would expect some stabilization in the industrial markets that we saw late in the fourth quarter to continue into the first.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then for a follow-up just a clarification on Dental. You mentioned in your comments you thought Dental softness would persist in early 2017. What gives you confidence that things improve in the back half of the year? And is there a distributor work down dynamic? We've heard about that from a number of your peers as well.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Relative to the last part of the question. I think the commentary around sell-out from distribution, and you heard that commentary earlier in the middle part of the year, the third quarter in the year. We saw the impact of that in terms of our sell-in, certainly in the fourth quarter in the more traditional consumables and equipment. I think that's giving the channel some \u2013 setting a tone of caution if you will. And so when you have caution that comes from some moderating sell-out, it's going to have some impact there. They're going to do some, what I think is probably some right-sizing of inventory in the channel with an abundance of caution before they start to see sell-out improve.","So I think \u2013 when we think about the fundamentals of the market, it's hard to see, Tycho, or pinpoint any particular reasons why we wouldn't see the traditional consumables and equipment start to pick up a bit as the year progresses. I couldn't tell you much more than that, other than the fact that we've not seen these types of air pockets if you will persist over a long period of time.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Thanks, Tycho.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Hey, Steve.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, could you maybe talk about within Pall, you continue to ratch up very good numbers. So how is it looking relative to that original $300 million synergy guide? Where are you on your thinking on that?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","We feel very good about that, Steve. We got off to a fast start and an early start. We got that rate north of the $60 million that we talked about for the first year to more like $100 million. And I think that's really a function of the impact of the team in place, both the legacy Pall team as well as the Danaher team that went in to help out. It's a function of the impact of DBS and the over 300 kaizens that we got after. And so I think we feel great about our opportunities to get to that $300 million target.","I think as we look forward and you've heard us say from the very beginning that some of the more challenging tens of millions of dollars in that run rate are going to come in the latter periods as we work on some of the more challenging dimensions of the supply chain, the manufacturing footprint.","And so I think as we think about the timeframe, I think the overall timeframe of achieving that kind of rate in the four- to five-year period is still the numbers that we'd hang onto, only given the fact that it's just a little bit more challenging each year to affect those changes in the supply chain and the manufacturing footprint.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","If $100 million was achieved in 2016, what's embedded in your forecast for 2017?","Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.","Our sort of \u2013 and we originally planned roughly $60 million a year over that five-year period. We would expect to be in that $60 million plus range this year. So by the end of 2017, we will still be ahead of \u2013 we would expect to still be ahead of our original schedule.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then on the SG&A, how much of that 110 basis points was G&A versus sales increase? Year on year?","Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.","The G&A was down. Sales and marketing was up overall as a percentage.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right. All right. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys.","Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.","Oh and then \u2013 you mean in the fourth quarter?","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, yeah, yeah.","Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.","Yeah. A fair amount of that is noise in Cepheid. But organically, G&A \u2013 excluding Cepheid, organically G&A was down and sales and marketing was up as a percent of revenues.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Co. Please go ahead.","Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. This is actually Chris Lin on for Doug today. Thanks for taking my questions.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Hey, Chris. No problem.","Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Just a first \u2013 just a question on Cepheid first. It appears that on a full calendar Q4 basis it grew 15% to 20% year over year in Q4? Is this right? And then can you just provide some commentary on the key drivers to the strong performance in the quarter by test category?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Sure. We did grow in that range during the course of the fourth quarter. So you do have that right. And when we think about the growth of the business, the growth has been very consistent. We continue to see the hospital acquired infection business, which is a large part of the business, continue to perform well and pretty consistently. We continue to see good growth in infectious disease, in sexual health, and in virology. So when you think about the individual product segments of the business, we've seen a good deal of consistency in terms of those growth rates across the four I just mentioned.","Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. On then just on a higher level, could you just provide some updated thoughts on how the Cepheid integration is progressing? And how you are initially leveraging DBS at Cepheid?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Sure. So it's early days obviously. We just closed the transaction in November. We have an outstanding team of people leading the Cepheid business, largely the Cepheid associates, but with the addition of some key Danaher associates as well, which has been consistent with how we've approached organizations newly acquired in the past. The team has quickly embraced a number of the tools of the Danaher Business System. Dan and I were out at Cepheid just a couple of weeks ago, out in Sunnyvale. We had an operating review out there. And we toured the manufacturing facility and met with one of the R&D teams as well.","I was incredibly impressed by what I saw on the shop floor, the before and the after impacts of the use of kaizen on the shop floor. Five-day kaizens that involved Danaher teams combined with Cepheid teams that were making improvements on the shop floor. The tools of DBS that impact new product development were clearly on display when I met with the Omni (35:22) team and saw the impact of what they were working on and the kaizen there.","So I think the team is off to a very good start. I think they're off to a fast start, given that we're just about two months post the close of the acquisition. So we're very pleased with how things have gotten started, Chris.","Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Hey, Ross.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Just focusing in on sort of the Pharma market. Obviously you provided us a bunch of color, but it seemed like results there reasonably strong relative to the trend we've seen. And obviously bioprocess continues to be a standout. As you sort of enter 2017 with all of the sort of noise around drug pricing and maybe some of the headline issues that have happened on the pipeline side, do you see any disruption to that market whatsoever? And I guess can you tease out whether it differs in terms of CapEx versus some of the more consumable items? If there's any differential in growth rates?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Sure. Thanks, Ross. So, Ross, let's maybe just \u2013 to answer your question let's take a step back for a second and try to put a context around our position in Pharma. So our pharma exposure is say between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in overall revenue. The largest segment of our exposure, the segment where we're most largely exposed, is Biopharma. And we're seeing high single digit growth in those areas where we're exposed to Biopharma.","The largest segment of that is in the production side of Biopharma. So call that $1 billion of that revenue. And that's largely at Pall in Biopharma production, which we expect will continue to be a terrific growth market. That's really driven, as you probably know well, by the growth in Biopharmaceutical, drug production itself. And the pipeline today is a rich pipeline. It's never been bigger than it is it today in terms of the number of drugs that are \u2013 the large molecule drugs that are currently in development. And we also see single use technologies in biosimilars being key drivers of growth over time. So we feel very good about that.","In terms of drug discovery, so outside of production, call that about $0.5 billion worth of exposure. And that's where SCIEX and Beck LS [Beckman Life Sciences] and Molecular Devices participate. We continue to do well in those businesses; no real slow down. We think we've got some terrific products that are highly differentiated. And so when it comes to large molecule drug discovery, we continue to see again, based on the pipelines and the continued investment in those drugs versus small molecules, that those to be great opportunities.","And then finally, we have some positions in small molecule pharma. That would be at SCIEX and in a couple of other places. And there's still some excellent revenue growth there, but probably not as significant as we see on the Biopharma side. So we feel very good about those markets, largely as a function of where Pharma is investing today and is likely to invest consistently in the future.","Just going back though for a second to the largest portion of that, that $1 billion dollars or so in Biopharma production at Pall. I think the key thing to recognize is that filtration plays an incredibly valuable role in that bio production process. And yet on a relative basis is a fairly low cost component of that overall production process. So we love businesses where we deliver high quality, high value consumables that are relatively low cost relative to the overall production process or the workflow. And so that creates an incredibly strategically important position for us and one that we think is quite sustainable over time.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","That's super helpful, Tom. And maybe just quickly, Dan, sequentially interest expense ticked down quite a bit, probably more than certainly I and maybe others modeled. Just is this the new base? Or was there something with sort of the mix or favorability in some of the rates you got on financing Cepheid, et cetera? What's the explanation? And then the cadence off of that?","Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.","Part of it is very attractive rates, particularly in Europe where our commercial paper program is essentially 0% right now. In some cases we're actually getting paid for borrowing money in Europe. I think we're thinking about roughly $40 million a quarter going into next year as a run rate.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Thanks, Ross.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Please go ahead.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Morning, guys.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Hey, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","I guess I got to go borrow some money in Europe apparently.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","If we're having a tough quarter, we're just going to borrow more.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Tom. On Videojet I mean you talked about the long track record of core growth there. I mean what is it that Videojet has gotten right so consistently over so many years that other businesses that you have that are in arguably maybe even higher growth end markets haven't been able to consistently translate? What's the gap that you're trying to close there with the other businesses?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Yeah. Shannon, that business and the team that has led that business for a long period of time now has really created what we sometimes refer to at Danaher as a flywheel, a combination of initiatives that continue to build momentum over time and do so on a very consistent and continuous basis. You heard me mention the great core growth and the long track record. It's really those initiatives are a combination of things. It starts with day to day execution using the tools of DBS without question.","The Videojet was really the birth place of a number of key tools that we now use throughout Danaher around day to day commercial execution. We call those tools transformative marketing, under a broad heading of transformative marketing. And it really involves outstanding market visibility, tailored messaging, and outstanding communication to targeted end customers and tremendous field sales follow-up, backed up by an exceptional service organization, which as you heard me say is growing double digits.","That flywheel of commercial execution is now accelerating based on terrific innovation. The team would tell you today they probably have the most exciting line-ups of new products that they've ever had in their history. Some of those products are already in the market today and just getting commercialized. And you see some of the impact in the recent quarters of core growth. And others are coming. The team would say it's the best line-up in probably 15 years.","And they continue to invest, frankly, in some areas where there's still opportunities commercially, like in high growth markets. They've done some acquisitions of distributors recently. They've added feet on the street in a number of markets. And they would quickly say that there's still opportunities to improve growth in a couple of those high growth markets where perhaps they haven't put the playbook to work as consistently as they would have liked. So it truly is a combination of things. It's a tribute to the team. It's a tribute to DBS. And it really is something that we're very proud of.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just on the core margin improvement for the year across the company, clearly really strong and above what you would typically target. How much of that do you attribute to a deal like Pall that's getting after some extra margin initially versus more mature pieces of the portfolio that are just beating their plan?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Shannon, it really was an exceptionally strong year and very broad-based in terms of core margin expansion. But Pall was a meaningful contributor.","But Diagnostics up 200 basis points for the year, almost 100 basis points at Dental despite a very sort of tepid end market, particularly in the second half. So really good execution.","And I think what was most noteworthy this year was the increase in the gross margin side. That was all organic. For the full year it was driven by new products, as Tom alluded to, in the PID side, as an example. Coming up with new products at higher gross margins, really good execution in the factory, really taking advantage of our purchasing leverage.","And that 100 basis points of gross margins obviously both fell through to the operating margin side but also let us really step up some R&D and sales and marketing investments across a number of the businesses. So that's a number we watch very carefully and our execution on that was as good as it's been in 2016.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Thanks, Shannon.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey. Good morning. Hey, just one more quick one on Dental if I could. Could you just provide us a little more color on how to think about Dental margins? How they play out in 2017, as we kind of work through these cross-currents of restructuring actions and associated payback you hope to get from them? And anything to be kind of aware of, first half versus second half, et cetera, as that plays out?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Jeff, for the full year I would expect a kind of similar dynamic that we saw in 2016, which was kind of low single digit or very low single digit organic growth, but still churning out 75 basis points of core margin expansion. It's perhaps a little bit less than that in the first half, because we are sort of continually taking some cost action. You might see a little bit more of that in the first half. But again I think we can kind of cover elsewhere. But I think for the full year, we'd like to see a little bit of pick up on the top line. But even if we don't I think we could replicate what we did in 2016.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. And then I just wonder if you could give us a little more color on China. It sounds like things were better in a few of your businesses. Do you think there's some legitimate kind of economic traction starting to happen there? Or are there comp issues? Just your bigger picture on China right now.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Jeff, we continue to perform very well in China. I think a couple of businesses that I'd highlight would be the \u2013 our Dental business that continues to deliver terrific double digit core growth in China. And that's a broad-based growth rate across all the product lines of Dental. We've got a terrific team over there. We continue to invest in feet on the street. And the overall fundamentals of the Dental market in China continue to suggest that's going to be a terrific growth driver for us.","Our Diagnostic business has also continued to perform very well there. We're seeing good growth in that business. We have at Beckman Diagnostics for a long period of time. Our Radiometer business continuing to perform well. And Leica Biosystems is now developing products in China for China. So a more localized approach to ensuring that we're hitting the right kind of price points in that market.","I think on the flip side, looking at where there's been some challenges, I think where we've had a little bit more industrial exposure in China, there have been some challenges. I think Water Quality, to name one, is an area where we've seen some challenges, given the slowdown in the industrial market. So we're expecting to see a little bit of a pickup there as we come into 2017 across the industrial markets. But that's really been where the softness has been is the more industrial exposure we had, the lower the growth rates in China.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thanks. I'll leave it there.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.","Derik.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Hi, Derik.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A couple of quick housekeeping questions, then a follow-up. So the housekeeping \u2013 and if I missed it I apologize. The FX guidance, what's embedded for FX into Q1 and for your full year guidance? And also the free cash flow guide for fiscal 2017?","Daniel L. Comas - Danaher Corp.","Sure. For the full year what we highlighted in December when the euro was $1.06 \u2013 and I think it's $1.07 \u2013 is about $0.08 negative year-on-year impact, a little bit less in Q4 and pretty much evenly \u2013 the other $0.07 roughly evenly distributed among the first three quarters.","And then free cash flow, we don't give out specific guidance. We again ended very strong, full-year conversion. It was a little bit lighter in Q4. That was primarily driven by the timing of some tax payments, including some kind of one-time payments related to separation that we had highlighted when we announced the separation of Fortive that we ended up paying in the fourth quarter. We would expect a very \u2013 again very strong free cash flow conversion in 2017. Maybe even a little bit better, because of some of the one-time items we had in 2016.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And more of a \u2013 more just a theoretical question. We've been getting this from investors, but I think there's some concern about if the trade issues sort of escalate and we go into some sort of a trade war with China. I guess the question becomes \u2013 is like are Diagnostic products and some of things that are so critical into those markets less subject to some of the bans and like that? And do you have any historical precedence in terms of how we could think about potential trade conflicts in some of your products?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Derik, I don't know that any of us here could speak to \u2013 sorry \u2013 a historical precedent relative to what we might be facing.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. All right. Fair enough. Fair enough.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","But I think there is an important point. Let me \u2013 all kidding aside, our positions in China and let's \u2013 I think you were asking maybe a bit about the Diagnostic business.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Our business in China, we have manufacturing in China for China. I just mentioned LBS (50:31) just a minute ago, now designing products, manufacturing products for the Chinese market. We do $2 billion roughly in revenue in China. And so that's really the core of our China business. When we went to China years ago, we went less for the purposes of low-cost manufacturing, more for purposes of being a local player. And I think that's key to our strategy. So I think in that respect, I'm probably a little bit less worried about the impact on us specifically relative to China-related tariffs. Time will tell, obviously.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Thanks, Derik.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions here.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Sure, Steve.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","One very broad question and then one more specific question. The very broad question, maybe taking the concept that Derik introduced with the question around China trade, let's think about it more broadly. We're in a period here where not just Danaher, but Danaher's customer base is thinking about an array of different potential policy changes in Washington. Are there areas where you're hearing from your customer base? Any incremental animal spirits or conservatism that we should think about as we consider trends in the business into 2017?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Steve, I think one of the terrific advantages that we have at Danaher in this portfolio is being a multi-industry science and technology portfolio. And what that means is that we don't have any particularly significant exposure to one end market or one customer set in one geography versus \u2013 relative to the whole.","Specific to your question, I would say no. We have not sensed \u2013 I think what you asked about is animal spirits or animal instincts in any way. But I think you ought to use the term conservatism. And I think certainly there probably are some pockets of end markets today where there's probably some conservatism. I think there were a couple pockets of our Diagnostic businesses where we sensed that there could have been a little bit of conservatism in the fourth quarter perhaps, as people were a little bit uncertain about what the future would be of ACA.","That's again something that's rather nuanced and somewhat speculative on the end markets' part. But I think there's so much uncertainty in the world today that there must be pockets of conservatism in some places. But we are not hearing anything consistent or at a particularly \u2013 at a high-volume level from customers that would diminish our view of the end markets.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then so if I take a step back and look at Diagnostics, which was my follow-up question. If I look at results in the quarter, considering the comp, I look at the Abbott results, I look at the Thermo [Fisher] results, and a couple of the smaller players, it does look like things across the Diagnostics channel in the fourth quarter might have been a little bit lighter. Safe to say your view right now is that that's a function of just a little bit of a pause? And what are we looking for to call any recovery there? Thanks so much.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Sure. You bet, Steve. Again, Steve, there could have been some conservatism due to uncertainty in the market. But we were very pleased with actually our performance in Diagnostics in the quarter, and particularly at Beckman Diagnostics, where we saw some improved performance. We're seeing continued progress in customer retention and new customer win rates. We see continued outstanding performance from Radiometer on a broad basis with high single digit growth rates.","And probably the only weak spot that we saw was at Leica Biosystems. However in the case of Leica Biosystems, they had an incredibly strong third quarter. And so a bit of a difficult back-to-back quarter situation and a bit of a challenging comp perhaps. So we feel pretty good about where we sit in Diagnostics and continued good performance.","So some conservatism out there? Maybe. Some uncertainty? Without a doubt. But we'll continue to play offense. And we feel pretty good about where we are.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Tom.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, we've covered a lot of ground here. I did want to address, there's a lot of intrigue in the industrials regarding the pending sale of GE Water. And I know you can't be specific, but might there be any particular business that would be coming out of GE Water that might fit with Danaher's Water Quality platform?","And then just a related question is one of the issues that GE struggled with is trying to manage both a Membrane business and a Chemical business. In many ways those are diametrically opposed. But you all have done this successfully. So what has been part of your secret sauce in being able to have both those technologies within one platform?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Thanks, Deane. And you're right, we don't comment on any specific transactions. And yeah, it's certainly public knowledge about what's going on at GE Water. And it's certainly fair to say that we look at and consider everything that might be available.","Deane, you've come to know and hopefully love our Water Quality position over a number of years. And so I think you know well, we really have a bias towards high margin, lower ticket instrumentation and consumables. Sort of goes along with what I was talking about earlier when I was talking about the Pall Filtration business, high value products that contribute meaningfully to workflows, particularly regulated workflows, and that's terrific recurring revenue streams. And that means that we're not as favorably disposed towards large infrastructure or lower gross margin businesses that might also bring along lower growth rates.","So I think to your question about our success to this point in having different types of businesses in the same platform, I think the key to that, Deane, has been keeping those businesses that are quite different from one another separate and distinct in their organization structures. ChemTreat today exists in the same organization structure as an independent, truly autonomous operating company, as much so as the day we bought it.","Our Pall Water business that came along with the overall Pall acquisition by the way has now been moved into Hach, but is set up as a separating \u2013 separated business unit from the rest of the business. And so that focus on the end markets with a unique operating structure that's distinct from others in the platform is really key to maintaining the consistency and performance of those businesses. So we like where we are.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's real helpful. Thank you.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - Danaher Corp.","Thanks, Deane.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I will now turn the conference over to Matt Gugino, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Gugino, you may begin your conference.","Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Ashley. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Tom Joyce, our President, Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Comas, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'd like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call, our second quarter Form 10-Q and the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com under the heading Financial Information. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events and Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until August 1, 2016.","During the presentation, we will describe certain to more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance the supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics relate to the continuing operations of the company in the second quarter of 2016, and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over the Tom.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter was a busy and exciting one for Danaher. Despite challenging economic conditions, we are pleased with our performance as the team's consistent focus on execution helped deliver solid core revenue growth, high teens adjusted earnings per share growth and strong free cash flow performance.","On July 2, we successfully completed the spinoff of Fortive Corporation, a new industrial growth company. The earlier than expected completion of the separation is a testament to our process orientation, execution focus and exceptional teamwork. We continue to believe that the separation will provide significant opportunities for both Danaher and Fortive to independently build even greater shareholder value in the years ahead.","Since we own Fortive through the end of the second quarter, we will start with financial highlights that reflect the combined Danaher and Fortive results. We'll then provide detail for the businesses remaining with Danaher, outline our planned new reporting segments, and provide guidance for Danaher's continuing operations excluding Fortive for the third quarter and the full year. Since the Fortive team will be reporting their second quarter results separately next week, we'd ask that you please save any questions about the Fortive businesses until then.","Now, turning to the details of the second quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.25, an increase of 17% over last year and our third consecutive quarter of mid-teens or better adjusted EPS growth. Sales grew 16.5% to $5.8 billion and core revenue increased 2%. The impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by half a percent while acquisitions increased revenues by 15%. Danaher remain core revenue was up 3% while Fortive core revenue was down slightly.","Geographically, high-growth market revenues were up mid single digits led by double-digit growth in China and India. We saw better sequential performance in Latin America and Russia in part because of easier prior-year comparisons. Developed market core revenues were up low single digits led by growth in Western Europe. The U.S. remained roughly flat and we saw declines in Japan during the quarter.","Gross margin for the second quarter was 54.4%, an increase of 110 basis points from last year. Reported operating margins were 17.9% with core operating margins down 30 basis points. More than 80 basis points of core margin improvement were \u2013 we had more than 80 basis points of core margin improvement at both Dental and Life Science & Diagnostics, which was offset by declines in Test & Measurement and Environmental segments.","Free cash flow continues to be one of our most important financial metrics, enabling us to pursue organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter, up 14%, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was over 150%.","Now, let's take a look at more detailed results across the Danaher portfolio. In Life Sciences, core revenue increased mid single digits led by strength in high-growth markets and Western Europe. At Beckman Life Sciences, we continue to outperform. High-single-digit core growth in the quarter was driven by strong demand in flow cytometry particularly in North America and China.","The robust growth in flow cytometry was largely driven by demand for our new CytoFLEX product based on the breakthrough technology, which we acquired as part of the Xitogen acquisition in 2014. This bolt-on acquisition has been a tremendous success and is a great example of how we incorporate novel technology into our portfolio to enhance our offering and expand our customer base. CytoFLEX has been a significant contributor to recent share gains in our flow cytometry business.","At Leica Microsystems, we saw improved results versus previous quarters as recent new product introductions helped drive low-single-digit core revenue growth. Two such new product introductions included are Leica DVM6 digital microscope launched at the end of 2015 and our new Leica M530 neurosurgery microscope, which is off to a great start in China after successful launches in Europe and North America last year. The M530 is a standout combination of our high-resolution optics technology with improved ergonomics, helping neurosurgeons stay focused during their demanding high-precision procedures.","Core revenues at SCIEX were up mid-single digits, as we saw continued strength in pharmaceutical, food and environmental end markets. We had another very strong quarter in China as new regulations from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration helped drive increased demand around drug testing and food safety.","In June, SCIEX announced a number of new workflow solutions at ASMS, the American Society of Mass Spectrometry annual meeting. These solutions are geared towards fast-growing markets such as biologics, proteomics, food and environmental testing. We showcased the latest QTRAP 6500+ mass spectrometer that provides enhanced sensitivity and selectivity to create a powerful workflow solution for biologics analysis. We also rolled out BioPharmaView Software 2.0, which accelerates automated data processing and simplifies reporting, enabling biopharma researchers to make better decisions faster.","At Pall, core revenues were up mid-single digits for the quarter compared to last year as a stand-alone company. Continued strong demand in biopharma, particularly single-use technologies, led to double-digit core revenue growth in Pall Life Sciences. In Pall Industrial, revenues were down low-single digits, but we're continuing to see some signs of stabilization in those end markets.","Pall continues to ramp exceedingly well across a number of key metrics. The team's commitment to the Danaher Business System has resulted in on-time delivery improving by more than 1,500 basis points with greater productivity and quality driving improved customer satisfaction.","Since acquisition, faster-than-expected cost savings and meaningful operational gains have contributed to sizable growth and operating margin improvements. As a result of the team's impressive start, we've been able to redirect some of that benefit into R&D and sales and marketing investments. By pursuing this combination of margin enhancement and growth opportunities, we believe we can continue to drive innovation and improve Pall's competitive advantage.","The Pall team showcased a number of innovations such as acoustic wave separation in our new single-use bioreactor at the INTERPHEX biomanufacturing trade show in April. Our expanded single-use product offering has enhanced our competitive position as pharmaceutical companies look to shift from traditional large infrastructure stainless steel systems to more efficient production processes.","Pall's bioprocessing solutions help our customers save significant time, energy and money, while greatly reducing cross-contamination risk, which provides the flexibility to easily and safely make multiple products in one facility.","Moving now to Diagnostics; core revenues increased low-single digits with double-digit gains in China and India, partially offset by weakness in the Middle East and the Americas. At Beckman Coulter, core revenues were up low-single digits, driven primarily by strengthened high-growth markets. This past June marked the fifth anniversary of the Beckman acquisition. We've made tremendous progress since then, significantly improving quality, delivery and our overall customer experience, while using productivity gains to help fund new product development and add feet on the street.","Another quarter of good execution by the Beckman team contributed to healthy core operating margin expansion, and we continue to reinvest in high-impact growth opportunities. New menu additions are gaining traction, including our vitamin D and AMH fertility test in our amino assay business. Our recently launched molecular diagnostic platform, VERIS, continues to gain early traction in Europe. New product developments like these, combined with opportunities at recent bolt-on acquisitions like MicroScan, will continue to help build meaningful runway for growth at Beckman going forward.","Radiometer achieved mid-single-digit revenue growth, with healthy performance in Western Europe and China, partially offset by weakness in Latin America and the Middle East. Our growing installed base of blood gas instruments and AQT analyzers contributed to solid consumable sales in the quarter. The Radiometer team also recently launched the TCM5 FLEX, a new transcutaneous monitor design. This noninvasive monitor measures ventilation per patients in critical condition. And the TCM5 updated design is easy to use and reliable, providing nurses and doctors with improved usability while maintaining accuracy and precision. At Leica Biosystems, core revenues grew mid single digits. Results were driven by a combination of strength in high-growth markets and continued growth of instrument placements in advanced staining and core histology.","Moving now over to our Dental segment. Core revenues were up mid single digits with growth across consumables, equipment and implants. We saw particular strength in our restorative and Ormco product lines. Geographically, China had another strong quarter with double-digit growth, and we maintained positive momentum in North America and Western Europe.","Nobel had another good quarter, with mid-single-digit core revenue growth. We've improved operating margins at Nobel by more than 500 basis points since acquisition, enabling us to direct some of our savings into expanded product offerings and accelerated sales and marketing efforts. This is similar to what you've seen us achieved at other large acquisitions like Beckman and Pall, where operational improvements help fuel renewed focus on new product development and go-to-market initiatives.","The Nobel team has launched more than 20 new products since acquisition and featured a number of these recent innovations at the Nobel Biocare Global Symposium in June. Nobel's new On1 implant base remains in position during the entire restorative workflow; from implant placement to finalization and for the lifetime of the restoration. This helps simplify the dental surgeon's workflow and allows for an improved patient experience.","And our new NobelParallel CC implant is a straightforward, highly versatile implant system providing an efficient treatment flow that can be used in a wide variety of implant cases. Both of these new innovations help us serve our customers with better solutions to improve their patients' experience and treatment.","Turning to product identification. Core revenues increased low single digits. We saw increased demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables across most major geographies, partially offset by softness in some of our packaging and color solutions offerings.","Videojet's substantial and growing installed base contributed to mid-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Strong market performance in North America, Latin America and Western Europe offset softness in certain high-growth markets. Videojet recently introduced a new service offering that enables our technicians to remotely gather data from a printer that's experiencing a fault or a failure condition. This helps our customers return to normal operation much faster, often without a site visit. With our range of comprehensive, preventive services, we're able to improve end-user productivity over the course of a printer's lifespan, ultimately reducing operating costs and enhancing customer satisfaction.","In June, Esko successfully launched a number of new products and innovations at drupa, the world's largest printing equipment exhibition, which is held every four years in Germany. This is the most important tradeshow in the industry. Esko introduced more than a dozen significant hardware and software innovations at drupa this year including a suite of powerful new software tools to help customers simplify, automate and integrate their complex packaging and label production work flows. We originated a record number of leads and orders at drupa, which we expect to help drive improved growth at Esko and across the Product ID platform in the second half of the year.","Lastly, turning to Water Quality. Core revenues grew low single digits with strength in Western Europe, India and China partially offset by lower demand in Japan and Eastern Europe. Hach had a solid quarter with mid-single digit core revenue growth. Results were driven by strength in U.S. municipal markets and Western Europe. We saw improved growth in China as Hach continues to benefit from ongoing regulations around water quality monitoring and analysis in the region.","Hach's on-line water monitoring solutions are in place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for next month's Summer Olympics. Our solutions are installed at the majority of event sites, including the largest soccer stadium in the world. We'll apply our expertise to monitor water quality in order to help Brazil execute a successful Olympic Games. After the events wrap up, the Hach systems will be transferred to municipal water plants across the country, benefiting local communities for many years to come.","At Trojan, high-single-digit core revenue growth in the quarter was a result of a number of project wins in North America, Western Europe and Australia as well as robust demand in municipal markets. And finally at ChemTreat, core revenues grew low single digits despite exposure to weaker industrial and commodity-oriented end markets.","So to wrap up, the Danaher team executed well in a challenging macro environment. The thoughtful application of DBS continued to drive results with meaningful process improvements enabling reinvestment in high-impact growth initiatives. One of Danaher's core values is innovation defines our future, and the successful new product launches we've seen across the portfolio demonstrate our commitment to providing customers with truly differentiated technology to strengthen our collective competitive advantage.","Following the launch of Fortive, Danaher will be a diversified multi-industry science and technology company united by common business models and the power of DBS. We remain focused on improving growth, margins and cash flow and will continue to pursue meaningful organic and inorganic opportunities to strengthen our market-leading portfolio of businesses.","Going forward, Danaher's businesses will be organized across four segments: Life Sciences, including all of Pall; Diagnostics; Dental; and Environmental and Applied Solutions, which includes our Water Quality and Product Identification businesses. For further details, please refer to the supplemental information that we posted on our website this morning. This marks the start of an exciting new chapter for Danaher and we look forward to the exciting opportunities we see in the years ahead.","We are initiating third quarter guidance for adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations of $0.80 to $0.84. We are assuming third quarter core revenue growth of 3% or better. For the full year 2016, we are anticipating adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.53 to $3.60, which at the midpoint would represent an increase of approximately 20% from 2015. Both our third quarter and full year guidance exclude the impact of Fortive.","Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Ashley, we're now ready for questions. As a reminder, we just ask you to please keep your questions specific to Danaher and save any Fortive questions for their earnings call next week.","Question-and-Answer Session","Unknown Speaker","Thank you. We will take our first question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, Tom. So, I just wanted to just fill in the gaps on the FY guide. You said 3% or better for 3Q. Is that the working assumption for 4Q as well? And then, what assumptions are you making in terms of the corporate dis-synergies in the back half of the year? I mean, obviously, there's a corporate line which is unallocated but then there's some corporate absorbed by the segments. I'm just wondering how that impacts margins in the second half of the year. Any color would be helpful.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So Nigel, this is Dan. So, Q3 we're talking about 3% or better core. I think if we \u2013 in that zone, in part because we have a little bit of easier comparison in the fourth quarter, core could be a little bit higher than that. Regarding the corporate on a combined basis, we've talked since the beginning and we're still sort of in that zone about $70 million to $80 million of corporate dis-synergies from the two entities, and going forward, corporate will remain in kind of the low $40 million for Danaher.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, does that impact the segment line as well, Dan? Or is it just within that unallocated line? So, I guess what I'm saying is the 2Q, 1Q pro forma segment numbers for new Danaher, is that a good base for the second half of the year?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then just on Dental, you gave some details on the moving parts, will work out better in 2Q. But I'm just wondering, given the pretty soft acceleration from 1Q to 2Q, was there any pull forward or pull back from 1Q to 2Q? Was there some channel volatility? Or is this just natural volatility that we will see from time to time?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Nigel, we did see some core improvement without a doubt in Dental, 4% core growth in Dental, and a good part of that was clearly around better execution and to some extent, a little bit easier comp. We saw good performance in implants and equipment at mid-single-digit growth. Consumables, more like low single digit. Terrific performance in China continued. You've heard us talked to double-digit growth in China and we saw that continuing. U.S. and EU getting a little bit better and the high-growth markets, still challenging for sure but we are rounding around some easier comps. You heard me talk about good solid performance at Nobel. That continued.","That said, relative to your question about any impact, there may have been a little bit of pull forward on some revenues just based on the nature of the calendar and the way the calendar worked on the end of the quarter but, in general, I think we were very pleased with the performance. Given seasonality, we could see some moderation in the Q3 growth rates at low-single digits. That's typically a function of more European exposure and the summer tends to be a little bit slower. So, we won't necessarily see a straight line to the improved performance, but we were very, very pleased with the execution in the second quarter and we think we've got a very good trajectory behind us that bodes well for, I think, the quarters to come.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. Thanks a lot.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Nigel.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks, and good morning, guys.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Steve.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, Tom. Just on the segmentation, the new segmentation front, a couple of questions here. One, why is Pall Industrial stuck in Life Sciences? And then secondly, on Environmental and Applied Solutions, I thought maybe Water Quality and Product ID would be stand-alone. Are they just not big enough yet? Or is there a strategic thought here, number of segments? I mean, how are you thinking about those two?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Thanks, Steve. Relative to Pall, we did think it was important to keep those together in a single segment. Obviously, the Life Science part of the Pall portfolio is the larger part of the portfolio. There's commonality internally at Danaher from a reporting standpoint, both in terms of both businesses, both sides of the business reporting into a President at Pall as well as an EVP overseeing all of Life Sciences. There's also commonality across R&D and supply chain and operations.","So, there's a lot of reasons operationally to keep the businesses together and therefore, somewhat from a reporting standpoint as well. I mean, realistically, we probably could have split them up, but I think we would probably reevaluate that over time. And see how we might run the businesses in the years to come. But I think for right now, that's probably the best approach is to keep them together.","In terms of Environmental and PID, I think those businesses do share some commonality in terms of serving some different applied end markets. We could have kept them separately. They would've been far smaller segments. So, I think we felt that those kind of went together and provided some flexibility for us as we defined ourselves as remaining a multi-industry company, there obviously is some flexibility maintained in terms of how we might add to that segment over time.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then I suppose sticking on the same M&A or the same theme here on M&A, I know it's bumpy, but you did six last quarter I guess and zero this quarter. Was it \u2013 were you busy with separation, things just didn't come together? How's the pipeline looking going forward? What should we kind of expect in terms of momentum or pace on the M&A front?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Steve, it didn't have anything to do with being busy or in any way focused on other things. Acquisition volume kind of ebbs and flows over time and so we think the pipe \u2013 we know the pipelines remained quite good. We have active conversations in each one of the platforms, so we feel very good about where we are. We have obviously a terrific balance sheet to work with and I think we'll see good things in the quarters to come.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And you emphasize the multi-industry diversified nature as well as science and technology, but are you as optimistic on the Environmental and Applied Solutions I supposed in Pall Industrial front as you are on the other parts of the business?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We are. We continue to have teams that focus as we always have in each one of the operating companies and in each one of the platforms focused on developing funnels, ensuring that we have active cultivations and yes we remain bias towards applying our free cash flow to each one of the businesses across the portfolio.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. I'll hand it off. Thanks.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Steve.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Next we will take Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. How are you doing?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Congrats on getting Fortive done. Hey, just maybe a couple of business-related questions, drilling in a little bit. Tom, could you elaborate a little bit what was going on in Environmental core margins in the quarter, why they're under pressure and kind of what the trajectory is looking forward?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jeff, thanks for the question. In general, we feel very good about where those businesses are. I'll speak specifically to the Hach business. We had very good performance in the prior quarter \u2013 in the same quarter last year. In addition, we're making some investments from a growth standpoint in those businesses. So, I think we'll continue to see margin expansion from the Water side of the Environmental segment and I think those investments overall are going to pay off in terms of good growth rates in the quarters to come. So, it's not an area of concern for us.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And Jeff, two things to add. One is Gilbarco had better growth than the Water business, so there's a negative mix in there for the segment and we had our best \u2013 best segment was Q2 last year was probably 150 basis points, 200 basis points better than any other quarter we had in 2015. So, a little bit of a comp issue as well. But as Tom alluded to, we are investing pretty heavily right now in the Water business organically.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Speaking of investment, maybe just kind of a total new Danaher question but the idea of kind of restructuring, be it quiet or otherwise, is that likely part of the equation here as you progress through the year? And could you give us some idea how to think about that?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jeff, as we, I think, showed last year, we've established a cadence of restructuring that has gone on, you might say quietly but I would say more consistently and appropriately throughout the course of the year. As opportunities have come up, we've taken advantage of those in each of the quarters. And so, we still have opportunities for some level of restructuring in the third and fourth quarter. But in general, we've been more balanced through the course of the year. And I think that has served us well in terms of the operating margin expansion that you've seen over time late last year and this year as well.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then finally, just back to Environmental and Water, specifically in the muni markets. So, we've been kind of hearing for a couple quarters that things are gaining traction; obviously, had a strong quarter at Trojan. Could you speak a little bit to the forward visibility there? What's going on in order activity? Do you have top-line visibility into that business now into 2017?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Jeff, it's probably a little bit early to kind of comment on 2017. The muni strength continues to be broad based, both at Trojan and at the Hach business. And at the Hach business, we're seeing it both in Europe and the U.S. Very consistent and healthy spending there. The offset of that both for Hach and ChemTreat is where we serve the industrial or any commodity-oriented markets. They've been challenging.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Right. Thank you very much.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Just on this emphasis on reinvesting some of the synergy upside at Nobel and at Pall into new products, go-to-market investments. What kind of lag are you expecting from that? I mean, when do you expect that to translate into improving organic growth for those businesses and just what you're seeing?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Shannon, it varies depending on where we direct those funds. I think in some cases, when we put investment directly into, say, feet on the street in either a developed market or a high-growth market, we tend to see those investments pay off in just a quarter or two. If we're talking about investments that go into new product development, those tend to have much more of a lag time. As projects get kicked off into early business case-oriented toll gates, you could have several quarters to it, at times, even a couple of years before you might see the impact of a new product investment, again, depending on how early or late stage an existing project might be in the pipeline. So, it's varied.","I think in the case of Nobel, just to talk to one of the businesses, we've seen those investments pay off relatively quickly. You've seen it in good core revenue growth consistently in that business. They have relatively shorter cycle times in terms of new product development. In businesses like Beckman, for example, and at Pall, the product development cycles are longer, certainly significantly longer at a place like Beckman where oftentimes, we'll have clinical trials and\/or regulatory clearances. And so, those new product investments can take some time, obviously.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then, yeah, maybe a follow-up to that. I mean, in terms of \u2013 in diagnostics, you talked about Beckman's growth being driven by high-growth markets. What's going on in the developed markets and then maybe it kind of gets to some of your comments you just made there but maybe fill out what's it going to take to get some better growth in developed markets for Beckman?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Yeah, a little bit slower growth in the developed markets. I mean, in general, the developed markets, from an overall perspective, are slower growth markets to begin with. We've always seen better market growth in the overall in places like China and India and the Middle East. So in general, I think we're tracking closer to the market growth rates than anything else. Still have work to do; there's no question about it. We have improved our retention rates and our competitive win rates, but there's still work to do in terms of both go-to-market as well as new product development. And over time, we do believe those will pay off and better growth rates in the developed markets.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question is coming from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. Tom, just wondering if you can talk about some of the gives and takes, where you're feeling a little bit more constructive by segment in the back half of the year. You talked to the gives and takes on Dental, so maybe you can pass on that. But is Pall Industrial kind of bottoming out here? Could you see some improvement there? Obviously, the academic fund flows may pick up in the back half of the year and that could help SCIEX. So, could you just talk by division where you're feeling a little more constructive for the next couple quarters?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Good morning, Tycho. Thanks for the question. We do think that we're \u2013 as you mentioned, we've seen good performance in Dental. Again, not necessarily a straight line but we're very encouraged by the performance we're seeing. In terms of the other businesses across the second half, I think we'll see continuing better performance across the Diagnostic businesses in particular. We're starting see the benefit of a number of the investments across those businesses. I think we'll see continuing good performance from Water Quality. PID has been pretty consistent along the way, so I think we will see that continue. Our Life Science businesses have also performed well particularly SCIEX as well as Beckman Life Science.","So, I think we'd see some modest incremental growth there. I would also remind you that we're coming around through some easier comps in the second half as well and so we will get a little bit of benefit from those easier comps really across the entire portfolio.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And since you called out Europe as a source of strength for Life Sciences and Radiometer, are you kind of comfortable with the macro plan in the back half of the year for these markets?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think the Brexit situation certainly has created uncertainty around not just the U.K. but across European theater at large. Uncertainty is rarely a good thing for markets in terms of people's willingness to make investments particularly in instrumentation and higher cost instrumentation. So, I think that uncertainty could potentially result in some slowness in the second half but it's very early to tell.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Tycho, we've been (38:43) on Western Europe. We've been consistently in kind of a pretty healthy low-single-digit number across Western Europe. It's been pretty broad-based. It is an area where I think because of some of the uncertainties in the last couple of years, we've probably taken a fair amount of share as we've seen some people kind of pull back in Western Europe over the last couple of years. So, it's been a good market for us and we're also seeing Pall doing quite well in Europe but those are, obviously, not in the core numbers yet.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, just lastly on the capital deployment question, earlier you touched on the framework a little bit. Can you just remind us where you're comfortable picking up leverage? And maybe, just any comments on what you're seeing in terms of valuation given how much of this space is run?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, Tycho, we've obviously spent the last year in a significant effort on deleveraging. We're in really good shape. We're south of two-and-a-half times at this point. Initially, we're close to four times leverage. So, we're back to a mode of spending our free cash flow plus and we talk about a couple billion of capacity for this year but going into next year, you're back to more $3 billion to $4 billion of capacity per year. And that's not without \u2013 that's without really stretching the balance sheet.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tycho.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning, gentlemen.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","So I appreciate, I know you gave us already some color on Pall single use and on SCIEX, but I'd love it if you could tease out at all sort of pharma demand based on sort of customer types of sort of separate maybe pharma from biotech or emerging biotech to see if there's any sort of discernible trend you've seen amongst and it's clear Pall, obviously, having pretty strong growth across the board. But I was wondering if any of the end of markets, whether it's generic or CRO, et cetera, you're seeing any change in demand.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Ross. SCIEX is probably the best business to think about when you think about your question about pharma versus, say, biotech. SCIEX has exposure to both those end markets and we're seeing good performance, healthy demand and fairly consistent demand from both sides of the house there. I'd have to do some follow-up to get you some detail on anything to do with the generics or the CROs, specifically. But clearly in the aggregate, these markets are doing quite well. Pall, as you mentioned, we've talked about the growth that we're seeing in the Life Science side, specifically around our single use technology product offering, where we're seeing continued double-digit growth rates in that area, and that clearly is associated with the growth in biopharmaceutical specifically in the growth in large molecule drugs.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","I guess what I was getting at is more on the zero charts (41:57), so maybe I'd ask it differently. In terms of just the high-growth markets and it's clear China has been good but outside of China, how would you sort of characterize the rest of the key markets? Obviously, LatAm has kind of been a mixed bag overall, but India and some of the other key geographies.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd say China in particular, India as well, are very good markets for us. But I would say that there's still a long runway ahead for those markets. Some of the generic and the CRO movement into those markets has been on balance, a positive, but there are also components of the market that are still relatively nascent, particularly in terms of what might be going on there in the future relative to large molecule drugs. So, I think there's still a pretty good runway ahead.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thanks, Tom.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank, Ross.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Derik.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, could you talk a little bit about capital deployment? I'm just curious now that sort of Fortive has spun out. How do you sort of view your overall strategy in the Life Sciences space? Do you still feel like you want to stay focused on the core \u2013 stand-alone core brands or do you feel the need to sort of become a more integrated provider in the space? Do you think you need to add anything to your Life Sciences & Diagnostics armament?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Derek, I think, first of all, starting at a Danaher level, our bias towards M&A is not \u2013 and the use of our free cash flow to M&A is not specifically skewed towards any of the four segments that I mentioned. We've had a consistent track record of capital allocation across each of those four segments that we'll be reporting on in the future, and I think you'll continue to see us do that. Now specifically to your question around Life Sciences & Diagnostics, what you've seen us do in Life Sciences is continue to broaden our product offering over time and I think you'll continue to see us do that. We have had a bias and we continue to have a bias towards businesses with not only strong brands and significant installed bases, but installed bases that drive good, consistent recurring revenue and consumables growth.","The diagnostic business is inherently that way, typically, and you've seen us buy businesses with those same characteristics; strong brands, significant installed bases and strong recurring revenue and consumable streams. I think you'd see us continue to do that. We think there is certainly room to continue to expand our Diagnostic product offering and provide hospitals with broader bundles of product. Today, we provide products obviously to the central laboratory, the core clinical laboratory as well as anatomical pathology and to the acute care areas of the hospital. And with expansion of MicroScan into microbiology with IRIS opening up urinalysis for us, I think those types of expansions of our footprint would certainly be characteristic of the types of things that we would hope to do in the future","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. That's really helpful. Just one quick follow-up. It's been over a year since you launched the VERIS platform in molecular. Could you talk a little bit about what you see in terms of installed base and competitive wins and essentially, where is that going? What's the customer type? And then, I assume you're taking share from people because most hospitals have molecular platforms of that size, could you just talk a little bit more and some color on that?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Thanks, Derek. Just for everyone's benefit, the VERIS platform is a high-volume, random-access molecular diagnostics instrument that was commercialized for the first time in Europe in the second half of last year. That product line serves the core or central clinical laboratory of major hospitals. And again, as I mentioned, it's a high-volume platform. We're very pleased with the early traction that we've gotten. It is still early. During the first year of a significant new product introduction like that, the first of its kind by Beckman Coulter, it does take a while to build the funnel, but we've been very happy with how that funnel has built the sales opportunity funnel in the last year.","The installations that we have thus far are running very well. We have four assays in the market right now, but the four assays really are just the beginning. There's a significant roadmap of assay development ahead that will ultimately be commercialized both in Europe as well as in the U.S. That product will need to go through regulatory clearance in the U.S., so it'll be some time before we see the volumes ramp beyond the early days here in Europe. But the feedback from customers has been very strongly positive, and we feel good about the start we have.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And when is FDA approval expected? Thanks.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I usually hesitate to try to put any bets on FDA clearance. There's a fair amount of work to do, even before we file for that clearance. So, I'll probably have a better sense of that in the quarters to come but I couldn't put a date on it today.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Morning. Just a question on margins, firstly. So, the core margin in total Danaher fell about 30 bps in Q2. Could you give that comparable number for the remaining business and how you think that will trend in the second half? And tied to that, I guess going back to the Environmental and Applied Solutions segment, the headline margin there was down 300 bps plus in Q2. Should we see that coming back in the second half as the comps on margins get much easier?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Sure, Julian. On the last one, yes. And as I mentioned earlier, part of the Environmental issue was a comp issue that margins, on a historical restated basis for the Environmental and Applied Solutions were 200 basis points higher in Q2 a year ago. So, you expect that to sort of normalize. Core margins were relatively flat for Danaher. Ex Fortive, that was again somewhat of a function of the prior-year compare. For our full year, we continue to expect 50 to 75 basis points of core margin expansion for Danaher, ex Fortive, and you'll see better performance. So, very good performance in the first quarter. You'll see better performance in Q3 and Q4.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks. And then, just on Pall Industrial, you called out the overall organic sales trend year-on-year. Is there any sort of color you'd give there on specific verticals or markets within that? Any changes?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. I wouldn't say we've seen necessarily any changes, Julian. I think to the extent that there's good news there, I think it would be that we've seen some stability found in those markets. We continue to make some excellent progress in terms of our go-to-market initiative. We've done over 40 growth-related kaizens at Pall since we acquired the business. And a number of those kaizens have been going on in the industrial markets. And that involves installing DBS tools such as funnel management and transformative marketing that we think is improving our execution in those markets. So, I think the combination of seeing some stability across each one of those end markets in combination with the application of DBS tools, I think has gotten us to a pretty good place. So, I would hope to see some incrementally better performance late this year and certainly entering next year. But I think in general, we're pleased that things have stabilized.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our final question is coming from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, guys. Thank you. I just want to ask another question on Pall Industrial. If we look back prior to the acquisition, that business was obviously growing a little slower than the Life Science side. But curious if you could maybe take a bigger step back and give us a sense of what you think it will take for Industrial to return to growth. Is it mostly a function of end markets, or is there really more of an execution issue?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Isaac, good morning and thanks. I think it's both. As I was just mentioning to Julian, I think we've seen the markets themselves from a macro standpoint stabilize a bit; in other words, not get any worse. And we will need to see some improvement in the macro environment to see some meaningful or step function improvement in growth. But we're not waiting for that. Our focus is on ensuring that we have the best sales team on the field, that we're providing those teams with exceptional new product development, that we've got our coverage set up appropriately across geographies and across each one of those verticals. And I think the combination of good market coverage, DBS tools, new product development and some improvement in those end markets is what it's going to take. Obviously, the majority of that we hope to be in our control but a little help from the end market certainly wouldn't hurt.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, that's helpful. And then one other question on Beckman. If we \u2013 just trying to square up kind of what we saw last week with some of the peer groups in Diagnostics with what you said. Obviously, you've got VERIS and CytoFLEX helping out. If we pull those out, just trying to get a better sense of how you think you're pacing versus the overall market for Diagnostics. And any color there, especially in North America, would be helpful. Thank you.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Thanks, Isaac. Well, as you know, we had come from behind here from the standpoint of the big five in the overall market. I think from a pacing standpoint, we've now gotten to a point where we are very close to, if not at market growth rates with a couple of the competitors as you mentioned that reported last week posting better growth rates. And in doing so, in some cases, as a function of their positions in certain higher growth markets but, in other cases, we simply have work to do in terms of continuing to drive our new product development and our go-to-market initiatives. We're ahead of a couple other competitors in that market and we have demonstrated where, from a competitive win perspective, we've become far more competitive in the overall market.","So, I think we've made a ton of progress but clearly work to do, and that work is, as you've referenced, is represented by some folks that are still putting up some pretty good numbers. So, I think we've got the initiatives and the investment levels in the right place to continue to make progress, and it'll take a bit of time, but I think we're on the right track.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it.

We're off to a great start in 2019 delivering first quarter results ahead of our expectations. We achieved 5.5% core revenue growth, and believe we expanded our market leading positions at a number of our operating companies through a combination of new product innovation and strong commercial execution.","Our growth was broad-based with all four segments delivering better than expected results, and we continue to see healthy conditions across our major end markets. Combined with solid adjusted EPS growth and free cash flow generation, our performance is a testament to the power of the Danaher business system. Our team's focus execution is continued to accelerate our growth trajectory and drive long-term value creation. And we're excited about what lies ahead for Danaher.","Over the past few years, you've heard us talk a lot about building a better, stronger Danaher. An important and transformational component in that pursuit is our pending acquisition of the GE Biopharma business, which we announced on February 25th. GE Biopharma is a leading global player in the attractive biologics production market and will bring complementary strengths to our life sciences platform across the bio processing workflow. We expect this acquisition will be accretive to Danaher on multiple levels, and will further advance our evolution into a higher growth innovation-driven company. We could not be more excited about this business, the team and what they'll bring to Danaher. The transaction remains subject to regulatory approvals. And we're making good progress towards closing, which we continue to be -- which continues to be on track for the fourth quarter of this year.","Turning to our first quarter results. Sales grew 4% to $4.9 billion, driven by 5.5% core growth. Acquisitions increased revenues by 2.5%, while the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 4%. Geographically, high growth markets grew high single-digits led by double-digit growth in China. Across the developed markets, we saw mid single-digit growth in the U.S. and low single-digit growth in Western Europe.","Gross margin for the first quarter was 55.7%, and operating profit margin was 14.8%. Core operating margin increased 40 basis points despite a meaningful foreign currency headwind from a stronger U.S. dollar year-on-year. Excluding this foreign currency impact, core operating margin would have been up 90 basis points. First quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.07 representing 8% growth year-on-year","Now let's take a more detailed look at our first quarter results across the portfolio. In life sciences, reported revenue was up 10% and core revenue grew 7%. Reported operating profit margin was up 60 basis points to 19% with core margins increasing by 100 basis points. Segment life sciences core revenue was up double digits making this the business' seventh consecutive quarter of high single-digit or better core revenue growth. Broad based strength across most major regions and product lines was led by double-digit growth in flow cytometry and sanctification. Ad we believe the team's combination of high quality innovation plus commercial execution continue to drive market share gains across the business.","Leica Microsystems achieved high single-digit core revenue growth. Strength across North America and China was driven by demand in life science research as we continue to benefit from new product introductions. Most recently Leica launched the THUNDER Imaging Systems, a new class of wide field instruments designed specifically for high speed, high quality imaging of 3D biology. Scientists used this imaging technology to study organisms, tissue sections and advanced cell cultures for use in microbiology, neuroscience and cancer research.","Core revenue at SCIEX was up low single digits with good performance in pharmaceutical, academic and applied markets, partially offset by the impact of a tough comparison in our North American clinical business, which was up meaningfully last year.","Pall's core revenue increased at a high single-digit rate with growth across all major geographies. Pall Industrial was up mid single-digits led by aerospace and process and industrial, and we continue to see solid order trends within both businesses.","Double digit core revenue growth in Pall Life Sciences was driven by our biotech business, particularly single use technologies where we're seeing robust demand for our iCELLis bioreactor system in gene therapy applications. The iCELLis provided excellent cell growth conditions for adherent cells, which are used to produce gene therapies. And it is the most widely used cell adherent bioreactor on the market today. iCELLis was recently highlighted at the Interphex Bioproduction Trade Show along with the number of Pall's other market leading bioprocessing innovations.","Moving to diagnostics. Reported revenue grew 1% with core revenue growth of 5%. Reported operating margin decreased to 15.2% with both core and reported margins down 110 basis points. This decline is predominantly attributable to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements.","At Beckman Diagnostics, core revenue was up mid single-digits, as we saw continued improvement in North America and double-digit growth in China. By product line, immunoassay and automation led the way. And in hematology, we're seeing early sign of the positive impact from our new product introductions, including the DxH 520 and DxH 900 analyzers for low to high volume settings. Beckman recently received 510K clearance from the U.S. FDA for the DxH 520 and for the Early Sepsis Indicator to be run on the DxH 900. These additions in hematology are key examples how we're enhancing our competitive position and accelerating our growth trajectory assessments.","Radiometer delivered high single-digit core revenue growth led by performance in China. And we believe this team continued to gain market share in North America. During the quarter, Radiometer expanded their install base globally across both our blood gas and AQT product lines. We acquired Radiometer in early 2004. And the first quarter marked their 15th anniversary as part of Danaher. During that time, the team has become a champion of DBS helping to evolve the tools and processes that are shared across Danaher today. As a result of this strong DBS execution and leadership, Radiometer has achieved tremendous results, including more than 1,000 basis points of operating profit margin expansion. And over the last five years, the business has averaged high single-digit core revenue growth compared to low single-digit growth at the time of acquisition.","As one of our longest tenured operating companies today, Radiometer provides a terrific example of the long-term power of DBS. Through a balanced approach, implementing growth, lean and leadership tools, Radiometer has established a market leading position that it continues to enhance today.","Leica Biosystems also had an excellent start to the year with core revenue up high single-digits led by Advanced Staining and core histology across the developed markets and in China.","At Cepheid, core growth was down slightly against the prior year comparison of over 40% growth, which is primarily driven by last year's severe flu season. The team continued to expand Cepheid's market leading installed base, and is gaining momentum in North America with Integrated Delivery Networks or IDNs. Cepheid cartridge based molecular test is a uniquely well suited solution for IDN and their patients as it ensures consistent results across the network, whether the test is done in a large hospital lab or in a physician's office.","Turning now to our Dental segment, reported revenue declined 2%, while core revenue grew 2.5%. Reported operating profit margins declined to 7.3% with both core and reported margins down 30 basis points. This decline primarily reflects the impact of ongoing investment spend focused on new product development. We saw growth across our specialty and traditional product lines. And we remain encouraged by the stabilization we've seen in the North American end markets. High growth markets led the way geographically with China up double-digits. The Dental team continues to pursue one of its key strategic priorities. That is accelerating growth through innovation. At two recent industry trade shows IDS and Chicago Midwinter, we featured more than 20 new products and technologies from across the Dental platform, really the culmination of strategic investments in R&D and sales and marketing over the last few years.","At Nobel, Xeal and TiUltra are new implant surface technologies that enable better bone and tissue integration, while improving aesthetic results. And the KaVo OP 3D is a scalable modular imaging system that provides clinicians with the flexibility to upgrade to the latest 3D imaging technology as they expand their capabilities and grow their practices. So we're excited about the cadence of new production introductions, and believe that with expanding portfolio solutions we\u2019ll further distinguish our Dental business going forward. We're also making good progress as we work to establish the platform as a separate publicly traded company in the second half of this year.","Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions Segment. Reported revenue increased 3% and core revenue was up 5.5%. Reported operating margin increased 110 basis points to 23.2% with 140 basis points of core margin expansion due to outstanding execution across the segment. In product identification, core revenue increased at a low single-digit rate. Videojet core revenue was up mid single-digits led by results in the developed markets. Growth was broad-based across all major product lines with good traction for newly introduced products like the remotely connected CIJ 1580 industrial inkjet printer. Using DDS growth and innovation tools, Videojet has continuously expanded its product portfolio and getting higher impact products to market faster. This growing innovation execution differentiates Videojet's customer solutions and is a key driver of the team's consistent market outperformance.","Core revenue in our packaging business, which includes Esko and X-Rite was flat, but recent order trends are improving, and we expect better performance as we move through the year.","Finally, turning to water quality, core revenue growth for the platform was up high single-digits. Hach core revenue increased at a mid single-digit rates as end market demand remained healthy. Europe and China led the way. And we continue to see solid order trends across both municipal and industrial applications globally. Hach is consistently growing above the market over the last several years, in part driven by best-in-class commercial execution. The team has aligned their go-to-market strategy to better meet customers' needs. And a great example of this is the expansion of Hach's e-commerce platform. The team's double-digit e-commerce revenue growth in the quarter is a testament to how our innovative commercial strategy is delivering even greater value to customers.","At Trojan, core revenue increased by more than 20% as a result of a few large municipal projects in North America and in China. The team sustained a solid customer win rates and continues to benefit from recent new product introductions like UVSigma and UVFlex.","Lastly, ChemTreat delivered mid single-digit core revenue growth with the team's sales execution driving strong performance in North America by end market, chemicals, metal processing and oil and gas led the way. ","So, to wrap up, we're very pleased with our first quarter results, and look forward to building on this momentum as we move through the year. Our team's commitment to continuous improvement helped us achieve our sixth consecutive quarter of 5.5% or better core revenue growth, high single-digit adjusted EPS growth and solid operating margin expansion. We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.13 and $1.16, which assumes core growth of approximately 4% to 5%. We now expect full year 2019 adjusted diluted net EPS to be in the range of $4.72 to $4.80, which reflects the dilutive impacts of our recent equity offerings, partially offset by our first quarter performance.","Looking ahead, 2019 will be a transformational year for Danaher. We will be welcoming the GE Biopharma business to our Life Sciences platform and are establishing our Dental platform as a separate publicly traded company. These are incredibly important portfolio moves that we expect will maximize value for our shareholders, customers and associates, and help all of us realize greater potential. With DBS as our foundation, we're well positioned to continue building on our growth trajectory and are excited about the opportunities to come.","Matt Gugino","Thanks Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Laurie, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan.","Tycho Peterson","Want to start with China. You guys continue to put up really good numbers there. We've had some interesting data points slightly. One of your peers talked about destocking on the diagnostic side yesterday. And then, there's been more noise on the crackdown on generics kind of impacting the pharma market. So can you maybe just looking ahead talk a little bit about how your expectations for China have evolved? And are you seeing any headwinds from either of the dynamics?","Tom Joyce","Tycho, we actually feel really good about where we are in China right now, double-digit growth across the businesses, this by the way with the ninth consecutive quarter. And I think what's most encouraging in this the growth that we're seeing is broad based. All four of our segments were up double-digits in the first quarter. So whether you look at Diagnostics or Life Sciences, the Dental platform, certainly water quality everybody, I think doing a nice job by driving the four segments to double-digits in the quarter. I think, if we look at anything where there might be a little bit of slowness, I think I'd probably point to PID, Product ID over the past couple of quarters, but not in the sense of a meaningful step down. And of course, PID is only about roughly 5% of our China revenues. So we feel very good about how we're positioned. And these end markets, as you know well, are our terrific end markets to be in China. So over the span of time three to -- last three to four years, we've been high single-digits to low double-digit kind of across the board. Could we see a little bit of softness in the second half? I think that would only be a function right now related to the comps that we have, particularly in water. I think Q -- middle of the year to back end of the year, our water business was up greater than 25%. So I think that will be a tough comp. But in terms of the fundamentals, in China right now, and I -- by the way, Tycho, I was just there. I was there two weeks ago and met really one of our teams, spent some time with customers, talking with our -- certainly DS customers in the hospital market as well as in bioprocessing. And that the tone was really quite good. So I think we feel good about the markets. We feel good about our position in those markets.","You asked about generics. We understand there is some policy moves uplift there. That has -- can have impact on pricing, at the same time we may have an impact on access and volumes. And generally we benefit from expanding access and volumes. But we're not that dynamic that we're really in the crosshairs of. We would be a second or third derivative of how we might actually benefit from expansion of generics in that market. So those will be our thoughts.","Matt McGrew","Yes. And Tycho, besides your earlier question on the diagnostics, we clearly are not seeing bad dynamic from the destocking perspective either.","Tycho Peterson","And then on Beckman, you're continuing to put up great numbers there. Obviously, you've had a couple of competitive launches. One of your peers talked about, I think two thirds of competitive accounts in Europe at this point. Maybe you just talk about your confidence in holding share. I know you're going to have a product refresh at some point. But just talk a little bit about chemistry and immunoassay and your ability to hold shares there. And then any metrics you can put on customer retention rates with the new hematology systems and now your confidence in that driving growth?","Tom Joyce","Sure Tycho. We continue to have an ever improving cadence of new product introductions at Beckman. Hematology is going to a big step forward in that. It's been one of the areas that where we've had a challenge over years since we acquired the business. But we think we've stabilized that and really around the cusp of starting to improve our position there on a more material basis. If we look at what the flow of new products that are coming on the core clinical chemistry and immunoassay side, we feel very good about those products, particularly how they will enhance our competitiveness in low and mid-volumes environment, and we'll see those really over the next year to two years. Those will also come with enhanced menus as there have been a couple of menu gaps over time. Those are new products. Those new architectures will also bring along enhanced menus that will improve our competitiveness. So we feel very good about that. We've always led the way in larger volume environments, particularly with automation. We've even stepped up our automation gain recently with the introduction of the DxH line of automation equipment. And so, I think the combination of the products that have just come to the market more recently, the recent FDA approval, also our clearances, and those that are coming over the next year to two years, I think we feel very good about improving the trajectory of Beckman from a core growth perspective. And you see that in the numbers this quarter, saw the numbers last quarter. If you look at the overall diagnostic platform of which Beckman obviously is a big part, now putting up 6% core growth in the past. And in that 5% to 6% range now with little bit more consistency, we feel very good about that. And of course, that was against the very tough comp of a quarter ago. Relative to metrics that we track, we do track retention and win rates very carefully across our businesses, Beckman included. We don't publish those numbers. But I can tell you that we look at those numbers consistently every month and we see a continuing improving trend and have for some time now in both retention and win rates.","Tycho Peterson","One very quick one from a group before I hop off my comments to. So I would ask on GE Biopharma. How much actual free cash flow is this business generating?","Matt McGrew","They're generating about $1 billion or so.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin","Just one quick question. Did you see any sort of impact at all in the U.S. from the government shutdown earlier in the year?","Tom Joyce","No. Well, we saw it in traffic, I mean, in Washington, out my window in Pennsylvania Avenue. Everybody loves being able to get to work a lot faster. But in all seriousness, no, we can't point to anything in the shutdown. That would be of any consequence at all. Of course, we don't -- we have -- to say almost zero. I tell you that almost zero revenue that actually is directly attached to federal government activity. At most we are linked to funding that comes from the federal government to NIH, and then out from NIH into the broader Life Science market. But in terms of any direct linkage to federal government spending, I would say, I would say none at all.","Derik De Bruin ","So can you elaborate a little bit more on the diagnostics operating margin? I mean your -- all your businesses have essentially the same -- essentially, the same FX. So what was it about -- what is it about your diagnostic mix that took the corporative margin down in this quarter from FX whereas the other segments and you saw good expansion in EAS and good expansion in the life sciences?","Tom Joyce","Yes. Well, there's a couple of factors going on there. You have, first of all, the FX and tariffs together. And so when you take those kind of things, you'd -- FX and tariffs alone would bring those otherwise negative OMX numbers up to, probably flat or maybe even a hair above that. And then there's a little bit of a mix component that was going on there. Obviously, Cepheid's operating leverage that we had last year coming off of greater than 40% core growth. And then add to that, Beckman DX improving the mid single-digits at somewhat lower margins, obviously, you get the combination of those two factors Cepheid against Beck DX. And then some targeted investment spend, no question we continue to ramp up our new product spending at Beck Dx, as well as Cepheid. So I think it's a really a combination of those things. But as we look forward, those, certainly, the FX and tariff headwinds will continue a little bit in Q2, but as you look into the second half of the year, we'll see better OMX in the second half, for sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore.","Ross Muken","So maybe on the biopharma side, and it feels like across number of parts of the business that end market customer vertical remains quite robust. It seem like Pall had quite good growth in the quarter on what's, I think, increasingly tough comp, so strong underlying. I guess, how are you thinking about sort of that end market broadly? And then, in terms of Pall, specifically, in terms of sustaining kind of the elevated growth we've seen, you feel like, you've got pretty good visibility on that remaining kind of these kind of high single-digit, low double-digit kind of levels on the biotech side?","Tom Joyce","Sure. Let's start with the overall market. In general, the life science end markets remain very good. And we put up 7% core growth across our life science businesses in Q1, so another really strong quarter. This is a fourth straight quarter of a high single-digit growth across our life science businesses. And we're making -- it happen organically through better innovation at each one of the businesses, more innovative new products launched on time, commercialized effectively, and some tremendous investments in taking our products to market in each one of the businesses. And that's, by the way without IDT being core. IDT goes core here in this quarter, and they're off to a terrific start and really beating our initial expectations. So I think the combination of our good execution in fundamentally solid end markets sets up really well for continued performance in life sciences. We continue to see good performance across the biopharma end market, our single use technologies. And the work that we're doing around continuous bioprocessing is garnered tremendous interest in the end marketing. And we're seeing sales continue to grow in those areas, but applied markets have been solid, academic and research has been solid, and even the smaller portions of sort of the industrially oriented life science market has been solid as well. Geographically, China, as you've heard me mentioned already, continuous strong U.S. a good quarter. And Europe, I would say is stable, but that the markets that we're watching closely. And it's held up so far. But there are always some concerns about what's going on in Europe at the moment. So we're watching that carefully.","In terms of Pall going a little deeper there, we have very good visibility to the product development pipelines of both large and small pharma customers and biotechs. We continue to work those early stage opportunities well. And I think that's what bodes very well for continuing this high single-digit growth across Pall and the double-digit growth across our biotech business around SET, continuous bioprocessing. And really innovative products like the iCELLis bioreactor that I talked about in my prepared remarks. So overall, it's the -- that end markets good placed to be right now.","Ross Muken","And maybe just on Dental, obviously, we see in the margin a little bit more investment there but the growth albeit an easier comp kind of improved. I guess how are you thinking, in general, about sort of the trajectory there and kind of what you put into the business and sort of types of investments that are being made now ahead of sort of the potential separation?","Tom Joyce","Sure. We're very encouraged, actually to see the better top line performance that we put up and the underlying market stabilization that that underpins some of that. But our performance we believe, beyond the market stabilization has really been driven by the new product innovation that we continue to invest in, as well as some of the investments around commercialization. Some of those investments are really specific to things like our clear aligner program and our intraoral scanner and a number of new products that I mentioned earlier around Nobel. And so these are -- we believe these are really important investments to be made strategically to set this business up for success. If we look at the quarter, we saw sellout continue to be pretty encouraging, and that's pretty broad based. Even more encouraging, I think around the traditional consumables and equipment, which had struggled in the past, and where we had adjusted inventories with the channel in the past. Now channel inventories are really in good shape. So I think we combined those investments with and improved cost structure that we worked so hard to establish. And you heard me talk about this before about how we rationalize the cost structure around the overall footprint of the business over the last three to four years. I think we'll continue to see some incremental improvements in the growth rates, and particularly in the second half around core operating margins. So I think, second straight quarter a solid low single-digit core growth and a little better than our expectations. And I think we're positioning the business well for later in the year.","Ross Muken","And quick one, Matt, it looked like with the dilution from the equity deal, net sort of the deep, the underlying operating guide, you actually came up. I don't know maybe a $0.05 or so. I guess, if we think about the Q1 being fairly balanced top and margin line, is there anything notable in terms of that delta, and in terms any of the segments or if it's more an organic versus OMX type tweak?","Matt McGrew","No. I think your frame of kind of talking about kind of got the -- for the full year, the change being kind of $0.09 of dilution from the equity offering, kind of offset by that $0.04 beat. And that $0.04 beat is very operational, was pretty broad across most of our segments, I think came in better than we thought here. So, yes, that $0.05 reduction, I think is the way to think about it is that it's $0.09 of dilution offset by $0.04 operational beat here in the quarter. Yes, kind of results if you take a step back, and we kind of look at it, we're going to have EPS growth here for the full year, call it 6%, 7% now. And effectively, we've got all the dilution from the equity issuance kind of behind us as we get into the second quarter.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen.","Doug Schenkel","Maybe just building off of Ross's last question, Q1 core growth was 5.5%, and you expect core growth of 4% to 5% in the second quarter against a tougher year-over-year comparison. While Q3 has another tough comp you get an extra selling day in Q4. I understand why you might not want to provide a formal update to top line guidance given we're only two weeks into the second quarter and only around three months into the year. And that's said, I haven't heard anything coming off of a strong Q1 that would suggest there's any change in positive trend or that there were any transitory issues that made Q1 uniquely strong. So mathematically, it does seem like you're on track to exceed your original full year core revenue growth guidance of 4% by at least 50 odd basis points, if not a little bit more. Is there anything I'm missing here?","Matt McGrew","No, I mean, I think like you said, we're very encouraged by Q1. The underlying market does remain good. I don't think we would dispute that. But kind of that being said, like we've talked about before, we are -- as you mentioned we are three months, and we typically like to kind of get through the second quarter here. We'll kind of comeback folks in July. Talk to the second half of the full year. We'll kind of update everybody there. We've done that last couple of years, and that's worked out well. So clearly, we feel good about where we're at. But we're going to kind of do that again and we update everybody in July here.","Doug Schenkel","The second topic is SCIEX. I was hoping to get a bit more color on performance in the quarter. I believe you indicated growth moderated to low single-digit levels if I heard that correctly. So it -- one way the other would be helpful to get a bit more color on product mix, geographic trends and recognizing your bid under index to bio pharma within this business relative to peers. It would be good to hear how demand in that end market shaped up in the quarter. And then looking ahead, I think you noted that you were up against the tough clinical comp within this business, but that's said SCIEX grew at least high single-digits every quarter last year. I'm just wondering if you are expecting continued moderation in SCIEX growth over the balance of the year, if you expect this to pick up.","Tom Joyce","I think you've got most of the facts. We did have a tough comp overall. We were high single-digits, in fact, in the first quarter, a year ago. And at this point, we're sort of coming off our fourth straight quarter, as you know, of high single-digit core growth. It was, as I mentioned, largely driven by pretty meaningful declines in clinical market, which is skewed towards North America. And that was up meaningfully in the first quarter of '18. So we can kind of do the direct comp to those to that particular -- our end markets. The other end markets are generally pretty solid. The farmer market really pretty good. If we look geographically, that market is pretty solid on a global basis. The applied markets are good. That's kind of a food testing oriented market. There's sort of a nascent market around cannabis testing where that we expect to grow over time, and the academic markets pretty good. So I think aside from that challenging comp around clinical, we feel pretty good about where we sit relative to those end markets. We have a broader footprint today with Phenomenex in separations consumables. That business was up mid single-digits. And our service business, which has always been an important part of both growth and margin expansion at SCIEX, continues to be good as well, generally tracking high single-digits to low single-digits. So we feel good about how that business is positioned despite that tough comp. And I think we'll see some improvement over time.","Matt McGrew","Yes, Doug, we're like Tom just said, and we are kind of expecting here kind of mid single-digit for the second quarter and the balance of the year here from an outlook perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Deutsche Bank.","Dan Leonard","Hello, I will stick with a question on the tools business. So first off, you mentioned strengths in flow cytometry and centrifugation and Beckman tools. Can you flag for me, what are the applications driving that strengths? And I'm specifically wondering if there's any play here on some of the cell therapies that you're seeing strength and other parts of your platform?","Tom Joyce","Sure, Dan. In terms of flow cytometry, the real strength of that business is around leukemia and lymphomas. And I think the combination of our historical technologies with the more breakthrough technologies that have been associated with our acquisition just a few years ago of","Xitogen that is now led to the innovations embedded in our CytoFLEX product line. The combination of those strong application areas with more novel technologies have really helped to drive the flow cytometry business pretty consistently. It's been a key growth driver for Beck LS for a number of quarters.","Centrifugation is a much more broadly defined set of applications. We play in a number of different segments from an end market perspective. And it was an architecture that's generally oriented towards higher volumes, certainly above the table top kinds of volumes. And, but I wouldn't attribute centrifugation purely to any particular end market. I think the team's done a nice job with innovation around centrifugation. They've done a nice job in terms of positioning their commercial organization more effectively in terms of being able to take those products to market more broadly across that fragmented end market. And I think those are the underlying sources of growth at Beck LS.","Dan Leonard","And just a quick follow up. Can you offer us the Cepheid growth rate in the quarter, excluding the flu comp? And is it safe to assume that that business gets back to double-digit growth in Q2 and beyond?","Tom Joyce","Yes. So if you think about Cepheid, excluding kind of flu in the high growth markets HBDC stuff, it was up double-digits.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erin Wright of Credit Suisse.","Erin Wright","So on the Dental side, do you think we're at an inflection point here? Have you seen stabilization continuing quarter-to-date? And can you breakdown the trends that you're seeing across both North America and rest of the world what's driving more growth? And if you could just give us an update on the timeline of the spin, when we should hear more about your outlook for remain co business, et cetera? Thanks.","Tom Joyce","Erin, I don't know that I would call this an inflection point. I think we've seen now over at least the last two, maybe even three quarters of progressing level of stabilization. And when we measure that stabilization in terms of some things that caused some disruption in the past, a series of adjustments in the channel relative to exclusive relationships between manufacturers and distributors, some disruption among some channel sales forces, some inventory bill that needed to be rectified, all of those things really over -- that was a really over a couple year period, I think, evolved to a point where we now have a much more stable end market. And we're seeing that both in terms of the alignment between our sell-in and sell-out through the channel, we look at it in terms of inventories, we look at it by category to see how the traditional consumables and equipment are trending versus the more specialized products. And so, in general, I would say the overall trend in the market today could certainly be called a far more stable than it was a year or two ago.","In terms of the broader trends that are happening in the market, I would say continued move towards what would be broadly described as digital dentistry, the importance of imaging systems, and particularly -- and that's an area where our KaVo Kerr business is real leader in imaging technologies. And the linkage of those imaging technologies through software to treatment planning and treatment execution with important novel innovations happening in term, in the specialty areas, our implant business around Nobel continues to be a leader in those areas, where digital dentistry really matters, where imaging leads to treatment planning, leads to novel implant systems and procedures that end up with greater levels of patient satisfaction. And I think that's a broad based trend, not just in North America, but really on a global basis. I think the other thing that\u2019s certainly noteworthy is the emerging middle class, and the importance of dentistry in our in high growth markets. China being one, we've talked a lot about being double digits. But we're going to see good growth across our Dental platform in a number of markets where an emerging middle class is putting greater demands on the practice of dentistry. ","And then finally, around your question around the timeline of the spin, we remain focused on the timeline as we've laid it out, which is to affect that spin late this year. The intention is to launch an IPO of that business. And that was largely be a business that would probably put 19.9% of that -- of that equity into the market. And we would retain of the balance that for a period of time. And so there's been no change to those plans.","Erin Wright","And then this is a bigger picture kind of broader question, just there has been a lot of volatility in the market, primarily to speak alone, just on reimbursement, regulatory kind of concepts here in the U.S., and regardless of the actual likelihood of anything actually being implemented. How do you think about some of the opportunities, risk factors across your business? When it comes to some of these concepts related to reimbursement pressures, drug pricing scrutiny, more recently PAMA, for instance. What are you seeing there? And are there -- is there anything that you're more meaningfully concerned about from a reimbursement perspective that could impact your business or your customer base? Thanks.","Tom Joyce","To cut right to a simple answer to your question about, are we incrementally concerned about something around the dynamics that you just mentioned. The answer would be no. Yes, there are lots of things being bandied about around healthcare and reimbursement today and the Affordable Care Act, those at the moment are not having any material impact on us whatsoever, or immaterial impact. PAMA, we\u2019ve seen occasional impacts of that. But then again, price pressures are our standard operating procedure in the diagnostic markets. I think, Erin, probably you step back from our business for a moment, and you think about what we do in diagnostics, providing diagnostic capabilities to hospitals in the central laboratory, in anatomical pathology, in acute care, in the emergency room, in molecular diagnostics for acutely ill patients around infectious disease. Diagnostics today represents about 2% of costs of healthcare broadly defined. And yet it informs well north of 60% of the decisions that are ultimately made in healthcare today. So we play a vital role in the overall market, but are relatively small portion of the overall cost structure. And while the factors that you mentioned are very important for us to attend to keep in mind, and be aware of any potential impacts. Today there hasn't been any meaningful change in any of those in the recent quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard","Tom just a follow up on the Dental business. Any chance you could tease out the performance of the traditional portfolio versus the specialty lines in the first quarter and then, specifically curious how the U.S. consumables business did in the period?","Tom Joyce","I think pretty solid, as I mentioned, second straight quarter of low single-digit growth across the platform. So we feel pretty good about all of that. The orthodontics business was up mid single-digits. And we see really good performance across those businesses. Nobel was up low single-digits, but on a tougher Q1 comp, but still mid single-digits on a 2-year stack basis, and generally in line with what we've seen the last couple of years. I think in both of these cases, around specialty consumables, we're making significant investments in new product innovation. Obviously, around clear liners and then the digital support through intraoral scanners that will really make a difference in our orthodontics business over time. We have new Damon level, Damon line products that have been introduced into the market as well. And then at Nobel, these new surface technologies are exciting new technologies that are going to make a difference over time. And so, I think today those businesses are tracking reasonably well, but we're really encouraged by the new product innovations that are coming out in both of them. North American traditional consumables and equipment remain good, low single-digit growth with a reasonably stable market. The imaging business, as the trends are good. We're seeing mid single-digit growth around imaging. And when we look at sell-out, the sell-out looks pretty solid. So we're continuing to manage sell-in to make sure the channel inventories are in line. So we don't have that kind of disruption in the future. And I think, overall, we feel pretty good about where the Dental platform fits today.","Brandon Couillard","And so maybe a follow-up for Matt. EAS segment continues to be pretty solid, pricing up 1.5 in the period. Can you talk about the sustainability of that and where that's coming from? And secondly, what do you think pricing might improve somewhat of the Dental business? And what's been, I guess about five quarters of weakness on Dental pricing?","Matt McGrew","Yes, that's -- I was going to say general kind of in that range for the last four or five quarters. I'm not sure that we've got anything intentional that is driving that in Dental. So that seems to kind of be the runway of where they operate here today. So I'm not sure there's kind of an inflection or change that's necessarily being planned for Dental. As far as EAS goes, yes, they do a very nice job in pricing. I think it's -- both of those businesses have been around a little bit longer than some of our other businesses. And we talked about kind of some of the things that they're able to do and passing through some of the prices that they get. So I'm not sure there's anything from a trend perspective there that will change either. I think we've seen price there in that range for the last four or five quarters. I'm not sure a whole lot that was new here in the quarter from price perspective.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Daniel Brennan of UBS.","Daniel Brennan","I wanted to ask first starting on GE. If you could share some -- maybe some of the early customer feedback that you're receiving, I mean should that learn if some of the customers look at the combined Danaher and GE offerings, possibly providing some share gains to be possible broader solutions provider?","Tom Joyce","Our team has spent expensive time with customers. We obviously share quite a number of customers. And we also the opportunity in situations where we don't share customers to potentially bring a broader portfolio of solutions to that end market. I was actually, as I mentioned earlier in my comment, I was actually in China last week or two weeks ago, and actually met with the -- one of the key customers in the end market. And I think they represent sort of broadly a view across that market of real enthusiasm. GE does a tremendous job in the China market as does our Pall business. And I think the opportunities that those end customers see today are for really innovative solutions where we can bring a broader perspective to the overall bioproduction workflow, and work collaboratively with them to ensure that we meet not only their needs of today, but the needs that they'll have as their capacity expands over time. And as they evolve their processes, more towards single use technologies and more towards continuous bioprocessing capabilities. They see the combination of the broad set of tools that we bring at Danaher not just associated with Pall, but across the broader portfolio, and then inclusive of GE is being something really exciting.","Daniel Brennan","And maybe just one final follow up just on China. Obviously, the growth has been tremendous there, but with the tariff noise in the economy grinding lower, that's always a question mark with how sustainable that is. Maybe could you just characterize amongst your four different businesses and all the different secular initiatives China has ongoing likely. Where do you see the biggest runway still for growth dependent upon like where China is with some of their kind of secular -- kind of build out if you will? Thank you.","Tom Joyce","Sure. Thanks, Daniel. It's almost hard to choose because when we think about the investments that are being made in China, in diagnostics, in life sciences, and in and around the environment, along with the dynamics, I just mentioned, a couple of minutes ago, around an evolving middle class and the needs for advanced dentistry, there are important secular drivers in really, I would say, all four of those markets that I just mentioned. And I think we feel that our leadership position in each one of those markets has served us well in the past. We continue to enhance that those leadership positions with innovative products, some of which are designed in China, and many of which are made in China for the Chinese market, combined with continued investments in feet on the street and end market facing associates who are continually looking for new and novel solutions to drive innovation for customers. Those are just great end markets to be in. So I'm not sure, I'd necessarily differentiate a great deal between the diagnostics life sciences, the environmental and the Dental end markets, because I think they all represent important secular drivers that will benefit we have benefited from in the past, and we benefit from in the future.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call to Matt Gugino for any additional or closing remarks.","Matt Gugino","Thanks, Laurie. And thanks, everyone, for joining us.

Lawrence Culp","Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone. We were pleased by the solid finish to 2012, which was broad based across most of our businesses. Core revenues grew 3.5% in the fourth quarter, with incremental strength most pronounced in Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Product Identification and Dental. Additionally, the team's application of the Danaher business system led to good earnings growth, core margin expansion and outstanding cash flow performance, including a record $3 billion of free cash flow generation in the year.","From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets grew low double digits with particular strength in Latin America and the Middle East. China delivered high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter, again led by Life Sciences & Diagnostics and Dental.  In the U.S., year-end demand helped drive low single-digit growth in the quarter. Western Europe was modestly negative. Of note, revenues from the high-growth markets grew to more than 25% of our total revenues in 2012. While approximately 1\/3 of this revenue is generated in China, we have also built an increasingly large presence in Latin America, with more than $750 million of annual sales; in the Middle East and Africa, with about $500 million in sales.","We are proud that we have been able to replicate our success in China in other key growth markets. High-growth market revenues now surpass those from Western Europe and are a strong base for future growth and serve as a hedge against the uncertain economic outlook in Europe.","In 2012, we strengthened the Danaher portfolio, spending $1.8 billion on 14 acquisitions, most notably X-Rite and IRIS. Over the next 2 years, we have ample balance sheet capacity to deploy on acquisitions with a continued focus on our strategic growth platforms, which now account for more than 90% of total revenues. So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter.","Today, we reported fourth quarter diluted net earnings per share of $0.89, representing a record fourth quarter for Danaher and a 12.5% increase as compared to our diluted net EPS last year. Included in these results is a $0.02 per share benefit from a mark-to-market gain from the change in value of a currency swap agreement. For the full year, diluted net EPS increased 16.5% to $3.23, which includes more than $120 million of second half restructuring. Revenues for the quarter increased 5.5% to $4.9 billion, with core revenues up 3.5%. Acquisitions increased revenues by 3%, partially offset by the negative impact of FX, which decreased revenues by 1%. Our full year 2012 revenues were up 13.5% year-over-year to $18.3 billion, with core revenues up 2.5%.","Our year-over-year gross margin for the fourth quarter increased 190 basis points to 51.2%, while our operating margin in the fourth quarter increased 80 basis points to 17.3%. For the full year, our gross margin was 51.6%, and our operating margin was 17.3%. If we exclude the impact of the Apex JV, our full year operating margin was 17%.","DBS continues to be the primary driver of our outstanding cash flow performance. 2012 operating cash flow was $3.5 billion, a 28% increase compared to 2011. Free cash flow from continuing operations was a record $3 billion, and our free cash flow from continuing operations to net income ratio was 132%, representing the 21st year in a row where we delivered free cash in excess of net income.","During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of 5 businesses with aggregate annual revenues of approximately $250 million and which are expected to strengthen our Environmental, Dental and Life Sciences & Diagnostics segments.","In 2012, we also repurchased approximately 12.5 million shares of company stock at an average price of about $52 per share.","Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues increased 1% for the quarter with core revenues down 2%. For the full year, revenues declined 0.5%, with core revenues down 1.5%. Test & Measurement's reported operating margin was down 280 basis points to 18.7% due to both core revenue declines and higher year-on-year restructuring spending. Fluke core revenues decreased at a low single-digit rate in the quarter, marking an improvement from the double-digit declines we saw earlier in the year. Bookings turned positive this quarter, and we believe this momentum could lead to positive core revenue growth in the first quarter. Fluke recently launched several new products, including the VT02 visual thermometer, an innovative entry price point temperature measurement tool with an integrated visual heat map.","At Tektronix, core revenues declined at a high single-digit rate, a modest improvement from the mid-teens decline experienced in the third quarter. Sales improved sequentially in North America, although demand in Europe, Japan and China remains weak. Despite market softness, we continue to receive an industry recognition for our innovative new technologies. In the quarter, Electronics Design Network named TEK's THS 3000 handheld oscilloscope series and Keithley's 2657A high-voltage, high-power system SourceMeter to their 100 Hot Products of 2012 list.","Core revenues from our communications businesses grew low single digits in the quarter led by healthy demand for our enterprise tools and network security solutions in most major geographies. Accelerated product development via DBS at Fluke Networks yielded nearly 50% product vitality in 2012, with 35 new product introductions during the year. We believe we are gaining market share as a result of this robust portfolio of fiber, WiFi and enterprise troubleshooting tools and systems.","Sales at TEK Communications network management solutions declined in the quarter, primarily due to difficult prior year comparisons. We expect this business to return to growth here in the first quarter. During the fourth quarter, TEK Coms launched its Deep Packet Classification solution that enables operators to protect against revenue drain and identify new opportunities from growth -- for growth by deepening their understanding of per subscriber network utilization.","Environmental segment revenues increased 5.5% in the quarter, with core revenues increasing 3%. For 2012, revenues increased 4%, with core revenues up 3.5%. The segment core operating margin was up 150 basis points in the quarter with reported operating margin increasing 110 basis points to 23%.","Water Quality core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate. At Hach Lange, sales of our core lab instrumentation used in industrial applications were particularly good due to -- due in part to the recent launch of the DR 3900 spectrophotometer and the HQD Benchtop meter. Hach Lange again drove double-digit revenue growth in Latin America this quarter and exceeded $100 million in revenue throughout the region for the full year.","ChemTreat continued its growth streak with the fourth quarter marking its 10th straight quarter of double-digit core revenue growth. In 2012, revenues eclipsing $350 million, up from just over $200 million when we acquired the company in 2007.","Gilbarco Veeder-Root's fourth quarter core revenues grew mid-single digits, led by healthy dispenser sales in North America. In Mexico, we believe we are capturing significant market share, shipping nearly 5,000 dispensers to that country in 2012 to help customers comply with recent regulatory changes. During the quarter, Gilbarco announced the pending acquisition of Automated Fuel Systems Group, a leading provider of fuel management solutions to government fleet and mining customers in South Africa. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter.","We also announced the acquisition of Navman Wireless, Danaher's first acquisition in the attractive fleet in asset management adjacency. Navman Solutions enable fleet owners and operators to track and monitor their assets real time, achieve savings on fuel and maintenance and manage operator workflows. Customers here include local business fleets, off-road users and construction and mining, schools and municipalities and long-haul transporters.","Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics, revenues for the quarter increased 6.5%. Core revenues were up 7% in the quarter, and for the full year, revenues increased 40%, with core revenues up 4.5%. Our segment core operating margin was up 160 basis points in the fourth quarter. However, reported operating margin increased 120 basis points from the prior year to 14.2%.","The Diagnostics businesses continued their strong performance with mid-single-digit core growth in the fourth quarter. At Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, core sales grew at a mid-single-digit rate, our best quarterly performance since acquiring the business. Sales were robust in the high-growth markets, particularly China, where continued government investment in healthcare infrastructure as part of the national healthcare reform has resulted in increased demand for our clinical chemistry and immunoassay analyzers, as well as our automation solutions. We remain bullish on the high-growth markets and believe that we will continue to benefit from our expanding installed base of instruments.","We continue to be impressed by the Beckman team's use of DBS with noticeable improvements in quality and service contributing to improved customer satisfaction and leading to increased profitability. Radiometer's core sales increased at a low-teens rate led by solid growth of both our core blood gas instruments and AQT immunoassay analyzers. AQT's installed base now exceeds 1,000, with the number of tests per day per instrument increasing more than 20% over the past year.","Leica Biosystems sales increased at a low double-digit rate with advanced staining and core histology sales up mid-teens and high single digits, respectively. Growth was balanced geographically with North America, Europe and China all contributing during the quarter.","We closed the previously announced acquisition of Aperio Technologies, a leader in digital pathology. The combination of Aperio and Leica Biosystems is expected to build upon our existing digital pathology innovation and go-to-market capabilities to foster better outcomes for physicians and patients alike.","We also closed the previously announced acquisition of IRIS International, a leading manufacturer of automated in-vitro urinalysis diagnostic systems and consumables. IRIS' well-respected brand and market position provides an attractive entry point into this fast-growing IVD segment.","Our Life Sciences businesses core revenues increased high single digits in the quarter. AB SCIEX core revenues -- core sales grew low double digits in the quarter, with particular strength in China and North America, led by the ramp in sales of our new 6500 Triple Quad system launched earlier this year.","During the quarter, we also announced a -- we also opened a new application support and training center in India to assist our customers in this important growth market.","Both AB SCIEX's TripleTOF 5600 and Beckman Coulter's MoFlo Astrios Cell Sorter were part of a ground-breaking research initiative performed by Dr. Yamanaka at Kyoto University in Japan, who was recently awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize in the field of medicine. Dr. Yamanaka's work aimed to reprogram adult cells into so-called induced pluripotent stem cells that can be used to cure certain diseases. This is obviously an outstanding achievement for Dr. Yamanaka, and we are proud to support his research.","Leica Microsystems core sales increased at a mid-teens rate in the quarter with strong demand for our SP8 confocal microscope in most major geographies. We began shipping the SP8 modular confocal laser-scanning microscope earlier this year and are encouraged by the sales ramp-up in the past couple of months.","Turning to Dental. Segment revenues increased 3.5% in the quarter with core revenues up 4%. For the full year, core revenues grew 3.5%. Operating margin increased 430 basis points to 15.2% in the quarter. We are particularly pleased with Dental's margin performance this year with OP margin increasing from less than 12% in 2011 to 14.5% in 2012. Dental consumables core revenues grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter led by robust global sales for our orthodontic solutions, general dentistry consumables and infection prevention products.","KaVo core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate led by double-digit growth in North America. We've seen solid demand for our imaging products in the U.S. with record quarterly unit shipments of our i-CAT 3D Cone Beam imaging solution. While Europe remains weak, we are pleased by the success of our recently launched E30 mid-price point treatment unit, with more than 500 units shipped in the second half of 2012.","Our Dental businesses picked up an impressive 17 Townie Choice Awards as voted on by dentists and dental practitioners in the December Dentaltown Magazine. Townie's recognized the most reliable products, and their peer-recommend products and services across the dental industry are often leading indicators of potential growth.","During the quarter, we acquired Aribex, a leading provider of portable and handheld imaging systems. Handheld and portable imaginers are among the fastest-growing segments in the intra-oral imaging systems market with Aribex well positioned to capitalize on this growth as a result of its patent's intellectual property and a robust product pipeline.","Moving to our Industrial Technologies segments, revenues increased 10% for the quarter with core revenues up 2.5%. For the full year, revenues grew 6% with core revenues up 1.5%. Our core operating margin increased 90 basis points in the fourth quarter, while our reported operating margin was flat at 18.1% due primarily to the impact of recently acquired businesses.","Product Identification core revenues grew high single digits in the quarter led by solid demand for Videojet's continuous inkjet printers in all major geographies. During the quarter, we launched 4 new products including the 1550 and 1650 next-generation CIJ printers introduced at PACK EXPO in October and a CIJ printer designed and produced in and for China to target pipe-marking applications there. Videojet has seen great success with localized products in the Asian market, introducing 5 new key printers over the past few years for that region.","Esko's core revenues grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter with good balance globally. At our analyst meeting in December, we showcased Esko's next-generation packaging management software, Suite 12, that targets consumer packaged good brand owners. Customer response thus far to Suite 12 has been very good.","Revenues at X-Rite, our largest acquisition of the year, grew at a high single-digit rate in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago when it was a stand-alone company. If you picked up the Wall Street Journal in early December, you likely saw Pantone's 2013 Color of the Year announcement, emerald green. Response to the announcement was nothing short of extraordinary with extensive TV and print media coverage, as well as blogs, Twitter and Facebook all talking up Pantone's pick.","In Motion, we saw core revenue growth at a low single-digit rate in the quarter due in part to an easy prior year comparison. Our core industrial automation and engineered solutions businesses continue to be weak. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement we've seen at Kollmorgen and by the pickup in order activity, which turned positive for the first time in over a year this quarter. However, we believe Motion core revenues will continue to decline year-over-year during the first half of 2013.","So to wrap up, the fourth quarter finished obviously strongly, contributing to a solid year at Danaher. Our teams executed well amidst economic uncertainty with record free cash flow, superior earnings growth and operating margin expansion throughout the year. The structural cost actions undertaken in the fourth quarter position us well for further margin expansion and will allow us to fund growth opportunities where they present themselves.","Financially, we're well positioned to take advantage of what we believe will be an attractive acquisition environment in 2013. Given that we now expect to close the pending divestiture of Apex Tool Group within the next 2 weeks and thus will have no earnings contribution either in the quarter or the full year from Apex, we are updating our full year 2013 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance to $3.32 to $3.47 from a previous GAAP diluted net EPS range of $3.40 to $3.55. We are initiating first quarter adjusted net EPS guidance of $0.72 to $0.77. The adjusted guidance excludes the anticipated gain on the disposition of Apex, as well as any benefit related to the retroactive reinstatement of certain federal tax provisions contained in the American Tax Relief Act of 2012. We anticipate low single-digit core growth here in the first quarter.","Matt R. McGrew","Thanks, Larry. Charlonne, that's the conclusion of the formal comments. We're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll have our first question from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Guys, there's a little bit of a disconnect when you think back to your Investor Day in mid-December, you were pretty cautious overall even including Life Sciences, and you came in with a pretty strong volume. And now you're getting a little bit more cautious for 1Q as far as core growth they're giving you [ph]. Was there a pull-forward at all in that last couple of weeks of December in Life Sciences or anything and related to book-to-bill that would give you some concern about the start to the first quarter?","H. Lawrence Culp","Scott, I don't think in terms of the big picture there's really any change 6 weeks on here from what we said in New York in mid-December. Clearly, we finished more strongly than we had anticipated even then when we were together. But I don't think we're at a point here where we would extrapolate too much too soon from that strong finish. Clearly, we saw the new products that we launched midyear in Life Sciences & Diagnostics, particularly in Life Sciences at AB SCIEX and Leica Micro finish quite strongly, both in terms of the underlying order book but also the product we were getting out the door. I think we would also acknowledge that in Dental, another business that kind of led the way here for us in the fourth quarter, they probably saw a bit of a surge in demand at the end of the year, in part, just because of all the uncertainty around tax policy in general and the Section 179 depreciation dynamic particularly. I think if you look at the exceptionally strong finish we saw in North America in Dental equipment, particularly around imaging, it's hard not to attribute some of that to the uncertainty around the tax situation. And I think we saw a nice pickup, particularly in the U.S. It looked more like a sprint to the finish as opposed to anything we're going to call structural at this point in some of the industrial businesses. Again, we mentioned Fluke going positive in the fourth quarter. PID was quite good. So I think if you look at Life Sciences & Diagnostics, for example, I think that second half core growth of 3%, probably a little bit more indicative of what we we're looking at going forward, pretty much in line with that 2% to 5% guide we gave you in New York. I think Dental, again, we'd say maybe it's 1 point of a core that we'd adjust downward to try to look at the run rates given what we saw here in North America. So again, I think we're pleased with the finish. We wouldn't -- but we think it's premature to try to cast that strength too far at this point given what we have seen.","Daniel L. Comas","And Scott, the other dynamic we have in the first quarter, we have one less business day. And it probably doesn't impact much the 60% of the business that's equipment and instruments, but as we look back, it definitely impacts the 40% that's consumable. And that alone probably impacts the first quarter by 0.5 point to 1 point.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sure. Yes. No, that's helpful. Just as a follow-up, guys, I mean, we've seen a real pickup in China in medical spend, I think, consistently across most of the companies that we cover, and what's your experience here? I mean the sustainability. I mean there was a history in some of these markets that the government would have big spend cycles for a quarter or 2 and then not spend for another couple quarters. I mean is there something this time around that might lead us to believe that this is more of a sustainably higher level of spend that is a new trend given government initiatives? I mean how do your guys over there thinking about that?","H. Lawrence Culp","Scott, I was in China 2 weeks ago, and we spent a fair bit of time on this subject. I think it's interesting if you just look at our own trends through the course of last year, we really saw quite the bifurcation between our industrial businesses and our healthcare businesses, both LS&D and Dental. We were basically up 20% for the full year, and we saw that strength throughout the year on the healthcare side of the portfolio. We were down nearly double digit the first half on the industrial side, and our improved overall numbers in China were a function of industrial basically getting to a flat level in the second half. I think when we look at what's happened in Life Sciences & Diagnostics, we are clearly the beneficiary of a multi-year buildout with respect to the healthcare delivery, particularly in the West but also increased utilization. And I think that will continue. That program clearly stood up when others didn't during the government transition here of late. I think on the Life Science side, we're clearly benefiting as others are from the government's effort to build out an indigenous research and development base. And I'd say that the dental market is still in its infancy, and our own execution there has gotten quite good the last couple of years, but it was an area where we had clearly underinvested and thus, underperformed. I think we see that as part of a long-term trend just given the demographics in China. So our sense is that this is not a quarter or 2, but healthcare's important for a whole host of different reasons over there, and we're well positioned. I think on the industrial side, what our folks were pointing to was, again, stability, some sequential strengthening but probably a point of view that things get better through the course of the year as we have more certainty as to who's in some of the lower-level jobs as the new regime takes shape. Once those decisions are made, we'll see hopefully an initiation of more spending than we've seen. Clearly, in infrastructure, we're keen to see some of that I think given some of the recent headlines around the environment. We'd be well positioned if that were an area where we saw increased interest both on the -- obviously on the water side. So I think our view on China for '13 is good. Again, longer-term, I just don't see these healthcare trends that we're seeing in our own numbers, Scott, tailing off. We just don't.","Operator","We'll go next to Jon Wood, Jefferies.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So Beckman Diagnostics, like to touch on that. Looks like that business, actually above market for the first time in quite some time in the fourth quarter. You spoke to some of the high-growth market trends, but can you speak to the developed world, what you're seeing in that business, particularly in the U.S.? And then just comment, why is a low single-digit number still relevant vis-\u00e0-vis that fourth quarter trend?","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. Well, I think, Jon, the outlook, as you suggest, for this year is still low single digit as opposed to mid-single. We were at low singles through the first 3 quarters and really thought that's where we would be in the fourth quarter. I would say that clearly from a geographic perspective, the growth we're seeing at Beckman is really a function of, if you will, stability in the West with strength in the high-growth markets. I think we still have work ahead of us as we pay off some of the inheritance tax here in the U.S., again encouraged by retention and win rates in that regard, but that's a multi-year effort to get what is fundamentally a business where the consumables drive the growth, and that's a function of the installed base. It's just going to take us a while to do that, though, again, we were very encouraged by the fourth quarter with respect to the AU, the new AU series. I think with respect to Europe, I don't think we're really expecting the European market to contribute to growth but stability there even if it's a low single-digit grind down. If we're executing better, as I think we will in 2013, that's not as much of a drag on us as it has been the last couple of years. So we -- maybe we're conservative with respect to what we're capable of delivering in this market in the West, but I think at least here in '13, the general mix will be similar to what we've seen. We can do better. Obviously, we'd love to do that but really see that mid-single-digit growth more in '14 than this year.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's good color. I know you're going to refrain from kind of committing on the FDA front, but anything in your correspondence with them that would suggest kind of that troponin submission is further out than we may think? Or has the feedback from that organization been just again procedural at this point? I guess I'm looking for any color you're willing to share on where we are on the troponin situation in the U.S.","H. Lawrence Culp","Jon, well, I appreciate the way you frame that because as you know, our practice has been to, I think, respect the sanctity of the dialogue with the agency and not be too public with the details. I would characterize the conversation as constructive, productive and ongoing. So we've, I think, publicly tried to avoid being too specific about where this conversation takes us and the time frame in which we get to final resolution. I think we continue to be optimistic that we will have that product on the market in the future. Again, it's tough to put a finger on the calendar as to exactly when, but we're no less convinced that, that will happen in time as we work through the topic with the agency. Again, I would reiterate that while that is an open switch here in the U.S., it continues to be a product in the market in many other places around the world. And with so many of the other improvements that we're making at Beckman in the U.S. that customers can see in terms of quality, in terms of service, other new product introductions, the way our call patterns are set up, there's just so many positive effects from the implementation of DBS that even without the troponin assay in our arsenal today, you're seeing those improvements in retention rates and win rates. So I understand the focus. It's a very fair question. But customers weigh a lot of different things when they're making a decision. And increasingly, many of those other things are in Beckman's favor, and obviously, when troponin is back on the market, that'll just be one more check on our side of the ledger, but we're not there today.","Operator","We'll go next to Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Larry, could you give a little more color on the positive bookings turn at Fluke, I mean, in terms of geography or end market or any other color?","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes, I would say that really what we saw, Shannon, probably more than anything was a little bit better performance here in the U.S. I think Europe continues to be a bit of a struggle for us. I think the high-growth markets, again, broadly speaking, have continued to be really the highlight for us at Fluke. We got a little bit of a benefit, I think, as we wound down the year, as we saw some of the inventory adjustments in China really come to a close. But we're not expecting, as you know, a big pop back in T&M. Generally, Fluke will be an important part of that, but we like to think that T&M is up in line with the corporation in '13, and I think Fluke will be an important part of that on the instrument side to be sure.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then in Motion, you said the bookings there turned positive, I think. I don't know if it was for all of Motion or just Kollmorgen. Why do you expect that -- the core revenue growth to still be negative in the first half of '13?","H. Lawrence Culp","We have some tough one-off comparisons there in the Motion businesses, Shannon, and again, I think given some of the underlying demand trends that we see, I think it's going to be sluggish there through the first half where we have vertical exposure, particularly in TEK and certainly in some of the renewables. We had a very tough 2012, but we still had some business that will create a little bit of a year-on-year comparison challenge for us here in the first half as well. But hopefully, we're -- clearly, with the guide that we gave you last month, we think Industrial TEK will really be the -- probably in the 5 hole relative to performance on the core side in '13, unfortunately in part or in large part because of what we'll see at Motion. The obvious contrast there is Product ID, which finished strongly. I think it's really going to be one of our outperformers here in 2013.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. So no underlying real change in the trend in Motion then?","H. Lawrence Culp","I don't think so. I think in terms of the industrial capital equipment markets that we serve, they have been challenging. They've been challenging here to a degree certainly in Europe and in China. I think that continues here for a couple of quarters as we see it.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Larry, I was wondering if you could address deals a little bit, and really the essence of my question is just the environment and valuations. Obviously, the stock market is maybe frothy. Maybe it's not, but we've been on a nice run. So it sounds like you see things in the pipeline, but how do you balance that against valuations and the ability to kind of get things done on reasonable terms?","H. Lawrence Culp","Jeff, I think we are optimistic about getting things done in 2013. I think that's a function of the pipeline to be sure, and it's a pipeline, again, rarely dominated by public companies. I don't want to suggest that public company valuations are irrelevant to us, and I'm hopeful that we do some public company deals this year. But a fair bit of what we do is often on the private side, be it with families or independent owners and at times, PE, but PE's really not a big source for us, let alone a real competitor. I think one of the dynamics that really works to our favor is our breadth of scope and where we would like to build out. Clearly, in all 5 of our segments, we've got areas where we clearly would like to put capital to work. So when certain segments might be bid up, our discipline stays intact. We'll move into some other areas and be a bit more active there. Through a cycle, I think you see a pretty good -- you've seen a pretty good distribution of the deployment of capital. So I think in terms of how we work through that, ultimately the backstop is the discipline that I think we've demonstrated over a long period of time, strong focus obviously on the strategic quality of the business, operationally our ability to add value. But when the math doesn't work and we can't generate positive returns, cash-on-cash returns for our shareholders, I think Dan and I are very comfortable letting things go. I think it's as simple as that.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Can you give us a sense, if you have the numbers, even roughly? Maybe Dan has them. $1.8 billion spent on 2012 on 14 deals, kind of the aggregate valuation on that basket and how it stacked up [ph] relative to history?","Daniel L. Comas","It's probably in the zone of -- X-Rite would be the biggest 1, and that was sub 10x EBITDA. IRIS was -- so probably overall, I'd say about 10x EBITDA, maybe 10 to 11. I would say in that $1.8 billion of spend, and it's kind of the benefit of doing bolt-ons and that's really -- and adjacency deals, a lot of margin expansion opportunity across that revenue base. So I think that's a 10, 11x that we can get to sort of 8x without any revenue growth, and that's obviously the benefit of when we're doing these kind of bolt-on and adjacency-type deals. And if you look at -- so I feel pretty good about the valuation overall. I didn't feel like we really had to stretch for any of those deals and all sort of in that zone when we think we'll exceed a 10% return within 3 years.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Right. And just a follow-up on healthcare, Larry, you hit a lot of it with your comments a moment ago on Beckman. But just overall, as the calendar rolled over, is there a measurable sense of different momentum, whether it's a positive because of the alleviation of the uncertainty of who's President or the negative because of uncertainty about device tax? Is there -- just across the whole fleet, if you will, in the U.S., anything to discern here early on?","H. Lawrence Culp","No. Again, I think what we saw in terms of the acceleration at year end perhaps is more of a bit of uncertainty. Some of which has been addressed clearly on the tax side, but I don't think anyone is really taking too much for granted here. Clearly, the medical device excise tax is something that we're going to have to work through as are others, not only in Diagnostics but also in Dental. Really doesn't impact the Life Science space, the research space directly. So I think it's hard to discern anything that's material or structural that's different, particularly here in D.C. I think folks know that while there was some clarity in terms of who's going to be President and in the short term, clarity around fiscal policy, in many respects, that can was kicked down the road, and there are going to be open questions still to be addressed through the course of the year. But I think by and large, where we play in terms of research tools, our new product cycles position us well to get our own fair share of the spend there. Clearly on the Dental side, an improved stock market. Just a little bit of a better tone in the U.S. should help patient traffic. We can execute well there. And I think on the Diagnostics side, again, given our starting point at Beckman, we can make a good bit of our own luck there. And if you look at Radiometer and Leica Bio as an indicator of that potential, while we've never said we'll be a high single, low double-digit grower at Beckman Dx, we do think in the short-term, we can offset any headwinds that might be out there.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just first question, can you give a little clarity on the 100 basis points of additional SG&A as percentage of revenue this year versus last? Just maybe dive into that, tear it apart?","Daniel L. Comas","Steve, I'd have to look at that off-line. I suspect part of that is the full year impact of Beckman. Last year, we only had Beckman for 6 months, and I think if we normalize that, you probably would have seen some SG&A leverage. So I think it's a little apples to oranges given the Beckman full year versus 6 months a year ago.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, that'd be great if we could do that off-line then. I'd like to just make sure on a pro forma basis to understand what's happening on the G&A part. But overall, I mean G&A, you're not -- are you investing globally in any additional initiatives beyond expectation or where you were? Or...","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think the attitude, Steve, is still to be lean and tight from a G&A perspective, but certainly, as we've gotten bigger and the high-growth markets have become more important, we've been reshaping what constitutes, if you will, the Danaher overhead piece, so we have more capability on the ground in places like China from a Danaher perspective. Jon Clark, as you know, one of our group executives, member of the Danaher leadership team, is now in China as the President of Danaher China, really to make sure that we're doing more as Danaher China in that regard. I think similarly, as these platforms have really taken on a critical mass, there are things we're going to be able to do in Life Sciences, in Dental much as we have in Water and in T&M as a platform. Again, we want to keep the G&A lean, but I think we're also going to be putting and trying to achieve more strategically in terms of harvesting synergies at a platform level. Again, we want to avoid bureaucracy. We want to avoid undue costs, but I think these regional and platform level efforts have really paid some early dividends for us. And that's probably what's most top of mind for me and Dan as we look at the -- not only the level of the G&A spend but the nature and shape of it.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the growth side, a little more specifically, where are you in terms of the regulatory approvals for Ballast Water and on the IMO and Coast Guard? How are you thinking about that product on the approval path [indiscernible]?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, a little like other regulatory approvals, the -- while the strategic intent and the spend level is unchanged, the time frame there relative to our certifications is a bit more unpredictable, Steve. But clearly, the internal testing that we've talked about at Trojan is underway. I think we're hopeful that some of that, the validation work in essence is completed here in the first half of 2013. We did get our first installation late last year. Pleased with that. But it's been a bit unpredictable, which is why we really haven't laid in a lot in terms of '13 contribution at Trojan from Ballast Water.","Operator","Next, Ross Muken with ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about maybe some of the new product momentum you're seeing in some of the key businesses, whether it's on the Life Science side or also in the T&M business?","H. Lawrence Culp","Ross, I'm sorry, I didn't catch the first part of your question. Could you please...","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry, new product momentum, new launches, sort of key things to look out for over the course of the year in terms of contributing to growth sort of outside, just the macro.","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. I think we, again, are clearly in Life Sciences, particularly in a very strong new product position. I think at SCIEX with the 4500, the 6500 you're seeing strong traction, that's something to watch. That's not a 1-quarter dynamic. I think similarly at Leica Micro, we're in a good place. The SP8 will continue to be an important growth driver for us as we ramp there, and that's really the way I would think about Life Sciences. Again, Diagnostics, as you well know, is a little bit tougher to turn. But I think as we ramp the AU series, the new clinical chem family at Beckman, we're going to be in particularly good shape. And as you go to the shows this spring, ASMS and the like, I think you're going to see SCIEX, Leica, Beckman all continue to launch really a steady bucket of new product introductions. I think in T&M, again, I think at Fluke, particularly in thermography, we're encouraged by the early response to this new visual thermometer. There are other products that we plan to get out in '13, really in the back of the -- some of the technology that was brought in last year. I think in T&M, particularly on the scope side, we're in a good place. We've talked about some of the awards that we've seen with the launches that are still due to ramp through the course of 2012, and there's more to come in that regard. Clearly, innovation is important in both of those segments. We'll continue to invest in R&D, spend a lot of time deploying the DBS tools to accelerate those product launches and drive as much commercialization success as we can.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And -- great. Maybe just one other quick one. So I'm looking at sort of indication on the stock this morning. It's off a couple bucks. I'm looking at my inbox. People are obviously talking about sort of the guidance commentary, and I think in general, it's very consistent with what you talked about at JPMorgan not long ago. I mean, as we think about sort of the progression over the year, really, is it just sort of we're early in the year, sort of a function of we're just starting to maybe turn a bit on the cycle, and we're not sure where we are. I mean, what are you looking for on either the macro front or just within the business in terms of getting more comfortable and maybe a more constructive outlook in terms of core growth in the business for the year?","H. Lawrence Culp","Ross, again, I think you're spot on. We're trying this morning not to say anything that is fundamentally different than what we said in New York in mid-December or what we said at the JPMorgan Conference earlier this month. I think we're pleased certainly with a stronger finish to the year. I think we're acknowledging some of that might have been a pull-forward from 2013. But I think all things being equal, we think we're looking at a challenged growth environment in the West, one that's getting better and the one could continue to improve sequentially through the course of the year. But it's not going to be a high-growth market story for us as it will be for most companies. In terms of increasing our guidance in any form, I think 6 weeks on is just, again, premature. But we'll certainly, as is our practice, literally look at everything, how China's ramping not only in terms of what we're shipping but order books, other leading indicators, looking at POS and T&M, particularly on the instrument side, will be another important marker for us. But I think that the way we're going to operate in this environment is really no different than way we've operated before in terms of recognizing the macro reality and the challenges that are out there and trying to make as much of our own luck as we possibly can. But again, there's no change here from what we said earlier this month, let alone the middle of last month.","Daniel L. Comas","And I think we're pleased with the restructuring we got done here in the fourth quarter as Larry alluded to, over $120 million. I think we're going to track well to those savings here in 2013. And one of the challenges that we had was the Test & Measurement segment margins, particularly in the second half, which were down like 300 basis points year-on-year. That's going to get better here, and both because growth is getting a little better there, but also because that segment had a disproportionate amount of the restructuring here. I think we're feeling better about how T&M is shaping up here early in the year.","Operator","We'll go next to Julian Mitchell, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. I guess just firstly, when you think about the gross margin, you've had 3 years in a row now where it's been above kind of 50%. It's up the last couple of years, and you've done a bunch of restructuring. So when you think sort of longer-term -- I mean do you think that kind of mid-50s run rate is achievable, obviously, depending on timing of and size of deals?","H. Lawrence Culp","Julian, I think we do have gross margin expansion potential here. As Dan just highlighted a moment ago, clearly, one of our higher gross margin businesses, certainly one of our higher BCM businesses, T&M, had a tough 2012, and they're back on a more normal trajectory. That's accretive in that regard. Clearly, as we drive the installed bases of these new products in LS&D, we get good gross margin sales in the short term, but overtime, as those -- as that installed base grows and the higher-margin consumables course through those instruments, that helps us as well. You're right. We've done a lot of restructuring the last few years. We don't have a lot teed up here in the next 90 to 120 days, but there's always structural costs still to come as well. So I wouldn't put a target out there because as you alluded to, the next acquisition may come in, in a way that helps or hurts the gross margin temporarily. But I don't think we've, in any way, pinned the gross margin number on the ceiling here just yet.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just in terms of your own plans around R&D and CapEx, I mean R&D to sales is sort of flattish at about 6% in the quarter in the last couple of years. Is that a good run rate going forward? And then on CapEx, that was up by about 5%, I think, in Q4. How are you feeling about your CapEx plans for the year ahead?","H. Lawrence Culp","Julian, we certainly focus on the R&D figure more so than we do the CapEx. I think CapEx is probably going to be in, what, $550-ish million range this year, just to give you a number there. I don't think, again, from an R&D perspective when you look at where we finished and where we're likely to be 6, 6.5 in that band, that we're really managing R&D with those ratios foremost in our minds. I think what we're trying to do is make sure that strategically we know what we need to be doing to drive growth, investing in both technology and new product development and then positioning ourselves to fund those programs within businesses across the portfolio that represent the best opportunities for us. And if that means we ought to spend a little bit more or we could spend a little bit less, we'll do that. I don't think we're of the school that you really want to just manage R&D through that ratio because you can end up, I think, spending money that you don't necessarily need. But clearly, part of what we did with the restructuring, as we alluded to through the course of last year, was to set ourselves up this year to increase any growth funding, be it R&D, be it on the sales and marketing side as well perhaps, that might be warranted as opportunities come forward.","Operator","We'll have our last question from Deane Dray, Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","We're coming down to the wire on Apex. Can you just remind us the after-tax proceeds, the gain and then the use of the proceeds? I know we've -- you've baked in some buybacks already, but just those targets for 2013.","Daniel L. Comas","Sure, Deane. The -- our half of the JV, we expect gross proceeds of about $800 million, after-tax proceeds of a little bit over, I think, $650 million. We'll report a gain of about $0.19 a share here in the first quarter. Given we've -- we purchased about 12.5 million shares of stock here in the second half of last year in the kind of low 50s, I think our expectation is the lion's share is close to targeted towards May here in '13.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then, Larry, in terms of the Water side of Danaher, the 2 businesses that I'd like to touch on, 1 is on ChemTreat, very quiet success story, 10 quarters of double digits. Just remind us what the strategy there has been because a lot of people thought this is a chemicals business, but it's more of a solutions business. But you've grown this gain share over this time period and just you're targeting specific end markets that are more attractive. That's first question. And then second one on Trojan, some pushouts in the third quarter, didn't sound like that repeated in the fourth quarter, just give us some update on that, too, please.","H. Lawrence Culp","Sure. You bet. Well, I think that at ChemTreat, the story in many respects is a simple one. This is a business, largely a domestic business, that has just done over time before we were involved, but clearly, over the last 10 quarters, an exceptional job of taking very good care of their customers. You're right. They transact typically through the supply of water treatment chemicals, but what they -- what customers really buy though is the expertise, the service and the quality of the support that their local ChemTreat team provide. I think being in a position where we've been able to build that team over time continue to enhance the overall service and quality levels of the business has really been just a daily execution story, much more so than any grand strategy. And again, our hats are off to the team at ChemTreat. They've just been outstanding partners with us, and we're really proud of the results they've delivered. Trojan's been another very strong story for us, going through I think a couple of tough quarters here to be sure as we've seen some of the bigger projects roll off around the world and at the municipal market, particularly around some of the bigger-ticket capital programs, tighten up here. But I think as we look forward at Trojan, continue to be convinced around the UV disinfection opportunity. Trojan's position, I think you know, Deane, better than anybody, the Ballast Water opportunity is out there. I think it's going to come, just a matter of getting the timing down. So there's some uncertainty in the short term, but I think longer term, again, that's going to be a meaningful opportunity for Trojan on top of what they do today for their municipal and their industrial customers.","Operator","And at this time, I'll turn the conference back over to Mr. McGrew to offer any additional or closing remarks.","Matt R.

We're pleased with our performance in the third quarter, as we delivered mid-teens adjusted earnings per share growth, strong margin expansion and free cash flow, and improving core revenue growth.","Our two most recent larger acquisitions, Pall and Cepheid, continue to perform well and both teams have gotten off to a great start as part of Danaher. With the Danaher Business System as our foundation, the team's commitment to continuous improvement was a key driver of our results.","Our performance in the quarter, combined with a healthy balance sheet, is helping us build momentum for the balance of 2017 and into next year. So with that as a backdrop, let's move into the details of the third quarter.","Adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1 exceeded expectations and represents an increase of 15% over last year. Sales increased 9.5% to $4.5 billion and core revenue grew 3%. The impact of currency translation increased revenues by 1 percentage point and acquisitions increased revenues by 5.5%.","Geographically, core revenue in high growth markets was up high single-digits, led by double-digit gains in China. The developed markets increased at a low-single-digit rate with solid results in the U.S. and Japan. Gross margin was 56%, an increase of 70 basis points from last year. And our reported operating margin was unchanged at 16.9%. Core operating margin increased by almost 100 basis points with the strong performance led by our Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments.","We generated $935 million of free cash flow from continuing operations, resulting in a net income conversion ratio of over 160%. This outstanding free cash flow generation also represents an increase of more than 20% versus last year, and we continue to anticipate double-digit free cash flow growth in 2017. In terms of M&A, so far this year we closed five transactions, totaling more than $100 million of spend.","Now let's take a more detail look at our performance across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue increased 5% and core revenue grew 3%. Reported operating profit margin increased by 230 basis points to 17.7%, and core operating margin was up 185 basis points. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of 100 basis points or better of core margin improvement. And for the first time, our Life Sciences segment EBITDA margin exceeded 25%.","At Beckman Life Sciences, core revenue increased at a high-single-digit rate on broad-based strength across all major product lines and regions. Growth in automation was driven by continued demand for the Biomek i-Series Workstations. The new sample preparation platform, the Beckman launched earlier this year. And in Flow Cytometry, the team's continuous innovation around the CytoFLEX platform contributed to further share gains during the quarter.","We've expanded CytoFLEX capabilities with the recent launch of two new UV laser offerings, providing higher level analytical sensitivity on the same platform. This differentiated technology is driving sales in new research market by enabling science is to study a wider variety of advanced cell functions and viability, using our system to learn more about diseases and the effectiveness of new treatment options.","Leica Microsystems delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth led by strength in North America and Western Europe, primarily in the applied and medical end markets. Earlier this month, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to three scientists for their development of cryo-electron microscopy of visualization technology that enables researchers to observe molecular processes that have never been seen before.","This achievement is particularly meaningful to Leica as the prizewinners used to our solutions to conduct their work. This is the third time in the past five years that Leica technology has been cited in Nobel Prize winning work, further evidence of the vital role that Leica plays in such critical and revolutionary scientific research.","Core revenue with SCIEX was up mid-single-digit with good growth in Western Europe and China. Food and forensic testing led the way in the applied market and we saw sustained momentum in pharmaceutical testing driven in part by heightened regulatory requirements in China.","At PALL, core growth declined primarily due to the negative impact of the recent hurricanes in Florida and Puerto Rico. Our thoughts with our associates, customers, suppliers and the communities have been impacted by these events, and we continue to prioritize their safety and wellbeing. We take a look at PALL's performance despite the hurricane impact, our microelectronics and single-use businesses continued to be strong through the quarter, while we saw slower demand across our medical and lab, food and beverage product lines.","As we look ahead, we're encouraged by mid-single-digit order growth over the last six months, including double-digit order growth in our biopharma business this quarter, and we expect PALL's core revenue growth rate to improve meaningfully in the fourth quarter.","Operationally, PALL continues to execute very well, and the team has delivered more than 600 basis points of operating profit margin expansion since we closed the acquisition two years ago. We've reinvested a portion of these savings for growth and use DBS tools like speed design review and strategic product planning to focus our innovation efforts on high impact opportunities. These initiatives have resulted in a 50% increase in annual new product introduction since acquisition, and we are getting these new solutions out into the market faster.","Moving to Diagnostics, reported revenue increased 19.5% and core revenue grew 4%. Reported operating margin increased 80 basis points to 16.8%, and core operating margin was up 245 basis points, driven by the team's solid execution across the platform.","At Beckman Coulter, core revenue increased at a low-single-digit rate. We saw solid growth in North America and in the high growth markets. Strength in China and the Middle East offset declines in Latin America. Our immunoassay product line performed very well with continued installed base growth and strong demand for our vitamin D assay.","Radiometer's core revenue increased high single-digits with broad demand across developed and high growth markets. The team's execution continues to drive share gains globally in both our blood gas and AQT product lines. Leica Biosystems achieved mid-single-digit core growth, led by strength in Western Europe and China. Growth across all major product lines was led by advanced staining and core histology. We also recently launched the new PELORIS 3 tissue processing system.","PELORIS 3 provides our lab customers with high quality traceable results in a shorter turnaround time. An integrated barcode scanner eliminates the need for manual records and reduces specimen handling, helping us address our customers' workflow challenges and improve their lab processes.","We're approaching the one-year mark since we closed the acquisition of Cepheid and we continue to be encouraged by the team's performance. Cepheid delivered another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth and meaningful margin expansion, sustaining the sizeable operating profit improvements achieved over the past year. Earlier this month, Cepheid received FDA clearance for the Xpert, Xpress Group A Strep test, which provides reliable results in as little as 18 minutes.","The speed and accuracy of this test allows patients and healthcare providers to access a definitive diagnosis right at the point of care and eliminates the need for lengthy bacterial cultures to confirm the result.","Turning now to our Dental segment, reported revenue was up 2.5% and core revenue increased 1%, as growth in our equipment and specialty consumables businesses was mostly offset by continued weakness in traditional consumables. Reported operating margin decreased 30 basis points and core operating margin was down 15 basis points.","By product line, performance across our equipment and traditional consumables businesses remain consistent with what we've seen so far this year. Core revenue growth in equipment was up low single digits, while traditional consumables declined meaningfully, driven by continued inventory adjustments in the distribution channel.","While we expect this inventory impact to moderate, the recent realignment of certain distributor and manufacturer relationships may have a negative impact on equipment revenues in the near term.","Turning to the other half of our Dental portfolio, we were particularly pleased with our specialty consumables businesses, achieving mid-single-digit core growth across our orthodontic and implant offerings. At Nobel Biocare, core revenue growth improved to mid-single-digits. Since acquiring Nobel nearly three years ago, we made targeted growth investments to bolster our innovation capabilities and commercial execution.","We've invested in a double-digit increase in our feet on the street in North America and achieved strong growth in the region during the quarter as we began to gain traction from this go-to-market initiative.","We have also increased our R&D spend meaningfully and launched more than 20 new products since acquisition, delivering breakthrough technologies like our Trefoil system, a revolutionary new treatment option that significantly reduces the time required to restore the lower jaw, now making it possible to place the full restoration on the day of surgery.","By providing customers with superior products on a faster launch timeline, we've enhanced Nobel's competitive position since acquisition and are delivering sustainable core growth improvements.","So moving to our Environmental and Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 8% and core revenue was up 3%, reported operating profit margin decreased 190 basis points and core operating margin was down 105 basis points. These margin declines were primarily due to the impact of recent acquisitions and incremental growth investments.","In product identification, core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate led by strong demand for marking and coding equipment, and related consumables across most major geographies. Sales growth of our packaging and color solutions offering improved sequentially and with led primarily by increased demand in China and Western Europe.","Videojet core revenue increased mid-single-digits in the quarter with broad-based growth across most major product lines and geographies. Last month at Pack Expo, North America's largest packaging event, Videojet showcased six new printers and technologies including the new 6330 and 6530 Thermal Transfer Overprinters. These medium at high speed printers now feature an industry first in line print quality assurance system.","The patented sensors on the inside of the printer recognized common code defects to help customers improve quality, productivity and efficiency on the packaging lines. By identifying customers workflow needs and delivering advanced technological solutions to fill those gaps. The team continues to meaningfully improved customers experiences and enhanced Videojet leadership position in the market.","At Esko, core revenue increased at a mid-single-digit rate, driven by strength in our brand owner software and digital hardware businesses. And at X-Rite, core revenue was up low-single-digits, with strength in China and Latin America, partially offset by declines in North America.","Finally, turning to Water Quality, core revenue grew at a low-single-digit rate with good demand in China and Western Europe, while the high growth market saw weakness primarily in Latin America. Hach's core revenue was up low-single-digit with solid performance across our core municipal and industrial end markets in North America and Western Europe, and continued growth in China.","At WEFTEC, the wastewater trade show in Chicago last month, Hach launched the Claros Water Intelligence System, a platform that brings together instruments, data and process management to provide customers with valuable operational insight to manage their water processes in real time. At Hach and many of our other businesses at Danaher, we have an extensive installed base of instruments that generate a tremendous amount of data every day. Claros is a great example, how we are harnessing this information to create actionable insights for our customers, so that they can make the right decisions and be more efficient.","Core revenue at Trojan declined during the quarter due to the timing of certain large projects. We are however very encouraged by healthy order trends at Trojan. Those continued to build on an increasing customer win rate. We believe this will position Trojan well to deliver better core revenue growth in the fourth quarter.","Finally at ChemTreat, core revenue grew at a low-single-digit rate during the quarter, and strength in the oil and gas, and food end markets. So to wrap-up, this is a terrific quarter performance from core revenue growth to margin expansion, EPS growth and free cash flow generation.","Looking ahead, we are encouraged by a number of strong growth drivers across the businesses. And we'll benefit from recent acquisitions like Cepheid and Phenomenex becoming part of our core revenue. One of our five core values at Danaher is we compete for shareholders, and we believe that the power of the Danaher business system combined with significant opportunities across the portfolio and our strong balance sheet positions us to create meaningful long-term value for our shareholders going forward.","We are initiating fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.12 and $1.16, and expect core revenue growth to accelerate from current levels. We are raising our full-year 2017 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance, which we now expect to be in the range of $3.96 to $4.","Matthew Gugino","Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Tracey, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan.","Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan","Hey, good morning.","Thomas Joyce","Good morning, Tycho.","Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan","Good quarter. I want to start off with bioprocess. I'd say there is fair amount of noise in this channel right now, just from our discussions with investors between one of the pre-announcements we saw this week, and then Roche getting hit a bit today on the biosimilar stuff. So you had double-digit biopharma order growth there, which was great to see. Can you maybe just talk through the various pieces here in your outlook? I guess, Pall was up in North America, but then you commented on the hurricane impact, and then Asia was down, so I'm just wondering on some of that discrepancy as well.","Thomas Joyce","Sure, thanks, Tycho. We continue to be very positive on the bioprocess market overall. And I think the dynamics in the quarter was such that, we obviously saw the related softness on the shipment side that was associated with the hurricane impact. And those impacts were significant. But I think the order growth that we mentioned and you heard us talk about gives us great encouragement that we're going to see a meaningful acceleration in the top-line associated with biopharma in the fourth quarter.","So we feel good about the overall dynamics. The hurricane impact was significant. We were shut down for two weeks in Puerto Rico. We were also shut down partially for two weeks in Florida, associated with our Beckman Life Sciences facility. And so, while the recovery has been a challenging one, we expect to get some of that production recovered in the fourth quarter, probably not all of it. Some of it will extend probably into the first quarter. But we're very confident in the positive underlying growth drivers in the bioprocessing market.","Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan","And have you seen any of the destocking that one of your peers mentioned this week with their pre-announcement on the customer side?","Thomas Joyce","Tycho, we have seen some of that, absolutely. And we come to understand those dynamics literally on a customer-by-customer basis. And we're working through those individual customer situations. I think we have a sense of where each of them are. And we worked through like I think a good deal of that in the last quarter or two. It wouldn't be unusual, I think to see a little bit of that carry through into - through the fourth quarter, particularly given that some of those customers have facilities in Puerto Rico by the way.","And so, that will take a little bit more time to work its way out, but we do think that's certainly a temporary phenomenon.","Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan","Okay. And then for the follow-up I want to ask on Dental, it's great to see Nobel bounce back here. As we think about kind of the anniversarying these destocking headwinds, can you maybe just give us a sense as to how you are thinking about that business return to growth and any color you can provide on outlook for traditional versus specialty consumables going\u2026?","Thomas Joyce","Sure. Well, clearly, I think as we all know, 2017 has been a challenging year for the dental industry broadly defined, but we're actually encouraged by a number of things that we're seeing. Very encouraged by the performance in our specialty consumables business, Nobel and Ormco represent nearly half of our Dental segment. We saw mid single digit growth in the third quarter and it's possible that some of that specialty business growth in those markets are taking a little share of wallet if you will from traditional consumables.","And clearly, we've seen some of the sell-out impacting sell-in, and the resulting inventory destocking. However, I would say we have a sense that there is a stabilization going on there relative to traditional consumables. There is probably - there is certainly still work to do, to realign the inventories on the equipment side, relative to some of the manufacturing distributor alignment, realignments that have gone on.","So I think there is a number of things that we're very positive about and a couple of dynamics that we think we'll still need to work through. But I think in summary, if we step back from our relative performance in a challenging market, we feel really good about the execution side of what we've done. The team has done a number of things associated with our operational improvements that I think repositioned us very effectively for reinvesting in innovation and go to market that will help us in 2018.","Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas Joyce","Thanks, Tycho.","Operator","And we'll go next to Scott Davis with \u200eMelius Research.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning, guys.","Thomas Joyce","Well, welcome back.","Scott Davis","Thanks. I'm excited to be back. And, Tom, only you could talk about PELORIS 3 and get excited about a tissue product. And maybe offline you can explain to me what a tissue product actually is, but\u2026","Thomas Joyce","Glad to, Scott. But in all seriousness, we're glad to have you back, good morning.","Scott Davis","Thanks. And good morning to you guys, but thank you. I'll focus in just - because I don't know how many of us industrial guys are left here, but on the industrial businesses, the - it seem like you're increasingly more excited about what you are seeing at Pall. And I assume you're more cyclical businesses like Pall Industrial, Product ID, Videojet, et cetera are setting up for a reasonably accelerating growth. Is this something your - I mean, we're seeing the macro data, but is that something you're seeing in your order books so it's leading some of your enthusiasm there?","Thomas Joyce","I think there is a bit of tailwind there, Scott, in the industrial markets. But I think if you talk about businesses for example, like Videojet that mentioned, that's really more a story of outstanding execution. And it's a combination in execution between terrific new product execution, investments in go-to-market and a tremendous service footprint that creates a real competitive advantage for a business like Videojet.","An area where we have seen a really strong market dynamic would perhaps be coming back to your question about Pall and the industrial side of Pall would be in microelectronics, where we see continued growth in that segment of the business, wonderful underlying dynamics, but certainly in Asia, associated with an accelerating amount of chip production associated with the sensors that are now increasingly going into whether it's the telecommunications arena, certainly the iPhone, increasing number of sensors in cars. All of those things are contributing to a pretty strong market in microelectronics. So that will be an example of something that - where there is a market tailwind. But, I think to a great extent, we're more relying on our underlying execution in our industrial businesses than we really are on the market dynamics themselves.","Scott Davis","Okay, fair enough. And maybe you mentioned, I just didn't hear it, but what was the cause of margins going down in Environmental? Was it the Trojan revenue decline or is there some sort of mix issue in the quarter?","Thomas Joyce","We clearly had some investments in a number of businesses around Water Quality, and a little bit of the top line softness in ChemTreat, had a little bit of impact there. ChemTreat is by the way was another one of our businesses that was impacted modestly by the hurricane. In the case of ChemTreat, it was actually impacted in Houston where we have a blending facility that had some disruption. And so, just a little bit of the mix on the top-line I think and some investments that we made in those businesses was the source of that impact.","But we feel very good about how Water Quality will perform in the fourth quarter. We'll see some improvements there in the fourth quarter and we'll see some reasonable margin improvement as well.","Scott Davis","Perfect. Thanks, guys. I'll pass it on. Best of luck and keep up the good work.","Thomas Joyce","Thanks, Scott.","Daniel Comas","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","And we'll go next to Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin","Hi, good morning.","Thomas Joyce","Good morning, Derik.","Derik De Bruin","Hey, back on bioprocess and I'm going to go over the Diagnostics for the follow-up. But on the bioprocess, can you just put a little bit more color on the orders? Are you looking at more traditional biologic manufacturers, biosimilars, or are you actually still - is it orders from some of the small-molecule people because you do sell there? And I guess, is it just - could you also parse out sort of like demand on single-use systems versus kind of traditional consumables. I'm just trying to give a little bit more color on where the demand is.","Thomas Joyce","Sure. And I don't have a precise breakdown, Derik. Let me start with that caveat around the order rates from small molecule customers versus large molecule customers or even by facility on that basis. But in general, what we've seen over this year has been a reasonably balanced order book across those two segments of the bioprocessing market.","Relative to your question about single-use, single-use continues to be a double-digit growth business for us, both in terms of the order book as well as what we saw actually in the top line in the third quarter. So we feel terrific about how that business is continuing to trend for us.","Daniel Comas","I think part of the encouragement in the third quarter order book in the improvement as Tom noted, single-use has been strong throughout the year, including the third quarter just like some of the hurricane issues from a shipment point of view, but the order recover was more broad-based.","Derik De Bruin","Great. Thank you. And on Diagnostics, I know it's probably too early to get a read, but are you seeing any signs at all from hospital labs on what they're purchasing patterns may look like? Order patterns may look like, as they sort of gear up for the PAMA pricing world they're facing next year?","Thomas Joyce","It is too early, certainly. For those on the call it may not be quite as tuned into this reference that Derik made to PAMA. Essentially there is a dynamic going on in the market associated with reimbursement rates associated with test that are done or reimbursed on what's called the clinical lab fee schedule. Derik, it's still early days as you know even that ruling or that those recommendations associated with PAMA are in a comment period now.","The industry have raised issues associated with narrow dataset that was used to compared private payer rates with the actual Medicare reimbursement rates. And so, I think, we got a little bit of time here, first of all just to wait to see how does that fee schedule ultimately gets set post the comment period.","And then, I think, it's natural to assume that for the small portion of our business that is in - essentially in the outpatient environment and reimbursed through that fee schedule that there would be some pricing pressure. But pricing pressure is a natural dynamic as you know in that market and so we'll just have to wait a bit of time and we can come back to you with a little bit more of an update as things settle out.","Derik De Bruin","Great. Thanks very much.","Daniel Comas","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel","Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions.","Thomas Joyce","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Schenkel","I guess, I want to stay on the topic of Diagnostics. You have the highest core growth rate in at least six quarters, I believe. I'm just wondering, if you would talk a little bit more about the key drivers to this improvement and specifically how much of this was from the ongoing Beckman stabilization and growth initiatives. How should we think about sustainability, especially as we are modeling out Q4 2018 and beyond?","Thomas Joyce","Sure. We did have a good quarter without question in Diagnostics. We saw a really good execution certainly led by Radiometer, which delivered high-single-digit growth in the period Leica Biosystems and anatomical pathology, mid-single-digit grower, and we saw improvement in Beckman Diagnostics as well. So we feel good about that, I think we can sustain a growth rate there that certainly probably north of 3%.","But Beckman does face the toughest comp that they will face this year against last year's fourth quarter. So we could see a little moderation there against that comp in the fourth quarter. But we do get Cepheid into the core, only for half the quarter, if we got it in for the full fourth quarter, we'd probably be pushing up to - probably in the 4% neighborhood for the full quarter. So we feel good about the progress we are making, Beckman is absolutely still on a journey of improvement across the number of different fronts, but we are really encouraged by the new product innovations that are coming out.","We're encouraged by some of the talent infusion that we've made in that business, and certainly a great start at Cepheid and the sustained growth rates in operating margin improvements there have allowed us to continue to reinvest across the platform in R&D, and sales and marketing. Put that together with some new product innovations and we think we are setting ourselves up for some continued improvement in 2018.","Doug Schenkel","Thank you for that. And that's a good segue to my next question on Cepheid. It looks like Cepheid grew 15% year-over-year, and I was looking back at our standalone Cepheid model, and the comp was actually pretty tough, I think they grew 25% year-over-year in the last year quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what's going on with Cepheid? How much of this is a function of DBS efforts? Essentially, what inning are you in there? And well, why don't I just pause there, because I think that's the crux of the question.","Thomas Joyce","Sure, sure. A terrific quarter without question, at Cepheid. Double-digit core growth, pretty balanced driven across both developed markets and the high growth markets, and most major product lines. Infectious disease, sexual health, both double-digit. Hospital acquired infections is a softer market of course, but we feel good about how we're positioned there.","And so I think both geographically and from a product line perspective, we couldn't be more pleased with what's happening at Cepheid. And the investment that continues to on at Cepheid associated with innovation and new products, I think, bodes well for the future. We also continue to invest in their geographic footprint. We're building a team in China right now, it's still early days, but that team is growing nicely, and we expect to see some continued good growth in the high growth markets over time.","And then relative to the impact of DBS, I mean, DBS is having an impact at Cepheid, initially around the operating margin improvements, which you saw jump up pretty significantly just in the first six months after we acquired, and we've sustained those and continue to increment those in the six months that follow.","And that's really been around a number of initiatives that start with the low-hanging fruit and works then to some of the more challenging things around procurement in the supply chain both direct and indirect costs in a number of different opportunities that we've identified. In addition, DBS is having an impact on continuing to sustain the double-digit growth rate.","We've implemented DBS tools associated with new product introductions to become more efficient and more timely in those new product introductions and introduce products with the highest possible quality right at launch. So I think, there's a number of different areas, and if I step back for a second, I'd say one of the most encouraging thing is how readily the tools of the Danaher Business System have been adopted by that team. It's been just terrific to see they have chosen those tools that make the biggest impact on the business, and it put them to work I think in the areas that made the most sense in terms of overall performance. So good to go, we look forward to another good year next year.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Thanks for all that detail. And congrats on a good quarter and all the progress.","Thomas Joyce","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","And we'll go next to Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Joyce","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Beuchaw","Thanks and good morning, hey, guys. I'll throw two. They're a little bit more financially oriented, here real quick. One maybe more of a Dan question, one maybe more of a Tom question. Dan, I wonder, now that we have clarity post Veris on some of the cost savings, how you are thinking about those cost savings is contributive to the margin profile for the Diagnostics business next year. Does that drop through? Do we split that between incremental reinvest by - reinvestment on the commercial side. How should we think about the Veris savings as accretive to margins? And then, for Tom\u2026","Thomas Joyce","Okay. Go ahead, Steve.","Steve Beuchaw","Sorry. For Tom, on the last call you introduced or perhaps reintroduced some parameters in terms of how you think about what makes an attractive acquisition target. I wonder, if you could just give us a sense for as you - maybe a little bit more active, given where we are relative to the balance sheet and thinking about what the right thing is to do with that capital? How do you think the environment has evolved in terms of the potential returns on capital, and how those might be different between smaller versus larger assets? Thanks so much.","Daniel Comas","Steve, I'll kick off, yeah. We're tracking pretty well as we go into next year with an expectation of about $40 million of costs coming out of the Beckman P&L, because of what we've done here with Veris. We are taking a portion of it, probably close to half of that number, and investing that in Cepheid. As you know, we're going to - they're going to take over kind of broader molecular effort here, and we think that investment will help them accelerate some of their activities.","Thomas Joyce","Thanks, Dan. Steve, associated with your question on M&A. First in terms of the environment, I'd say we've seen some modest improvement in activity around deal opportunities. So that gives us some encouragement that there's opportunities perhaps breaking free, but we'll see always hard to predict. Relative to our viewpoint on acquisitions, we have always valued the balance between small and mid-size bolt-on acquisitions that are really accretive both strategically and financially to our platforms.","Balanced with larger acquisitions that sometimes add a new leg or an adjacency to a platform or occasionally in our history that have added a new platform. As I've said in the past, our focus really is on the five platforms we have today and looking at adjacencies that might materially improve those platforms as they exist.","From a priority standpoint, we always prioritize markets first, and we look for attractive global markets with good growth dynamics. And then we look at companies secondarily, and we look for companies with good growth dynamics and margin opportunities. We certainly value the consumables and the aftermarket side of companies.","You've seen us build the portfolio now into the 60 - 65% of the portfolio is in consumables, and that obviously is a key source of underlying growth and stability, a lack of cyclicality and inherently good gross margins. And so we remain very consistent, I think, in those views of what markets and companies are attractive.","And then finally, we look at valuation. And we've always valued a disciplined approach to returns. We've consistently said that small and mid-size bolt-on acquisitions, we look for those double-digit returns to be in - roughly a three year timeframe. And then if we're talking about a larger acquisition or an adjacency those double-digit returns still remain vitally important, but the timeframe associated with those maybe a bit longer.","Historically, we've targeted inside of a five-year timeframe. Occasionally, those get a hair longer than that, when the strategic value and the long-term opportunity really warrants it. So I would say, our views in terms of the characteristics we look for and the approach, we've taken remain very consistent with our history.","Steve Beuchaw","Thanks, Tom. Really appreciate the refresher there.","Thomas Joyce","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with UBS.","Steven Winoker","Thanks. Good morning all.","Daniel Comas","Hey, hey, look who is back. Welcome.","Steven Winoker","Yeah, Scott and I'll take those every time we can.","Thomas Joyce","Hey, Steve. How are you doing?","Steven Winoker","Good. How are you?","Thomas Joyce","I'm good. Thanks. Thanks for joining.","Steven Winoker","Pleasure. Thanks for having me. So listen, just moving back to a couple of topics you already hit on, but I like to go a little further. I remember, when you guys first purchased Beckman. We were really talking about mid-single-digit growth over a long timeframe. So you've seen mid-to-high, and you've seen obviously improvement, right, from flat to low. I'm sure Florida took a little bit of a chunk out. But if you had to kind of point to - has your expectation there changed, shifted? Is there something fundamental? Or it's just all been just a temporary issue that you're kind of working through, and you really believe the growth is there?","Thomas Joyce","Steve, your recollection is a good one. And we do - did and do have a view that Beckman Coulter, the acquisition that we did those years ago, has the potential to become a mid-single-digit growth business, and we would obviously see to drive that beyond that but particularly as we broaden the exposure to certain end markets, like the molecular market, which Beckman obviously did not have exposure to in the past, and where Cepheid now plays such an important role.","And it has been a journey, one thing I would maybe remind everybody is that the Beckman Coulter that we acquired was then initially split into two different businesses. And our Diagnostics business became a separate business from our Life Science business. Beckman Coulter Life Science, we often described in those days as an $800 million start-up that we had to kind of take from a flat to declining business and drive to growth. We've done that very successfully Beckman Coulter Life Science has become an innovator in its market and has now driven consistent mid-single-digit growth and great operating margin improvements. And so, we're really pleased with that.","On the Dx side, it's been a longer journey. There was a pretty significant inheritance tax that we had to pay, and have continued to have to pay associated with lack of innovation, some quality and regulatory related matters, and frankly, long sales cycles, and frankly, long customer memories. And those have been a challenge for us. We're really pleased with the progress that we've made, taking that flat Dx business, probably actually - probably on its way to declining slightly, and improving it, and improving the operating margins and driving working capital improvements, improving retention rates and win rates.","But it's been a long journey and there is still a journey to go. And so, we still believe that the opportunities there are significant and we'll see continuous improvement. But it's been slow going, but we're confident in the improvement potential ahead.","Daniel Comas","And, Steve, to add to the point, if you put the two Beck together, for example, in the third quarter, they were combined mid single digit growers with a lot of margin expansion.","Steven Winoker","Okay. That's helpful. Second on Environmental and Applied Solutions, you talked about it a little bit. But I would have thought in the constructive environment that is out there today and given some of the secular tailwinds behind some of the newer parts of that business, that's relatively newer, that you would have seen better than 3% growth core. So again, maybe just talk a little bit about what's going on in terms of the ability to accelerate that even a little.","And also, kind of adjacencies as you sort of look at that business and think about kind of adjacent paths that might also supplement forward organic growth after the acquisition's anniversary.","Thomas Joyce","Sure, thanks, Steve. So, important to separate EAS into Product Id and Water Quality, so Product ID remained very solid, mid-single-digit growth in the period, continued outstanding performance from Videojet and good performance from both Esko and X-Rite. I'll come to those relative to your adjacency question in just a minute.","But on the Water Quality side, in the third quarter we were little lighter on the core growth side, a low-single-digit growth. Hach showed improvement in - relative to the second quarter and - but we still saw some softness in the environmental business. But again, we firmly believe and we understand that that's more project timing. The muni and industrial side of Hach continues to perform very well. The other dynamic in the quarter, relative to Water Quality was, again, really around project timing at Trojan.","Trojan has seen terrific growth - order growth rates this year and good top line performance. In the quarter, we just simply saw some project delays and - but we saw double-digit orders and we think there is actually pretty good potential that Trojan might show double-digit core growth in the fourth quarter. And again, a little bit of a shortfall at ChemTreat related to the Hurricane impact, but ChemTreat has been a very consistent performer.","So I think to step back from all that at the Environmental and Applied Solutions segment and we would say we feel very good about the performance there. The underlying order rates are good and we'll see improved performance in the fourth quarter.","Relative to your question about adjacencies, I think those two platforms underneath that segment are actually great examples of how we have extended a platform through acquisitions into adjacencies and broadened the number of solutions we bring to customers. If you think about how we broadened Water Quality originally with the extension into treatment at Trojan and into ChemTreat, and ChemTreat how it was accretive to our growth rate, I think great examples.","I think Product ID as we extended Videojet back into packaging workflow, all the way back to the brand owner designing that packaging with Esko and X-Rite and Pantone. I mean, those are just textbook examples of how we think about expanding the platform and improving growth rates and the - and our strategic heft if you will.","And so, those are good models. We would attempt to continue to extend those models. Again, it's all a question of cultivating the right targets and eventually breaking them free. But we have active pipelines in each one of the businesses that, each one of the platforms to do just that.","Steven Winoker","Great, very helpful, guys, I look forward to working together going forward. Bye.","Thomas Joyce","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.","Thomas Joyce","Hey, Jeff, good morning.","Jeff Sprague","Good morning. Hey, just a couple of quick follow-ons, one back to water. Tom, your confidence on that Q4 timing, I asked that kind of in the spirit that we are hearing about some delays in other pockets in muni work. I'm wondering if these projects that didn't start in Q3 have already started in Q4, I mean, it sounds like the orders and backlog are there. But I guess just to address the risk of potential further push-out.","And then secondly, just as we think about your comments back on Dental or maybe equipment now stepping down, I would assume that's going to create some absorption issues in the plants and maybe some other ripple effects, just what are the ramifications for Dental margins in Q4 when you look that swirl of kind of specialized consumables little better and maybe equipment taking a step down?","Thomas Joyce","Okay. Thanks, Jeff. So relative to water in the fourth quarter, we do feel good about water in the fourth quarter associated with the order rates that we mentioned. Your question specifically about project delays, I mean, to some extent there is - that's always a dynamic that can exist in the muni market, but when we're in as close as we are right now, usually we have a pretty good sense, for example, at Trojan in terms of what's going to ship when relative to construction schedules and those kinds of things.","Some of what has gone on in our, what we call, our environmental business, which is more associated with government funding and releasing tenders associated with more natural resources like rivers, lakes and streams and monitoring of deep ocean, that's where I think it can be a little bit more uncertain. So balancing all that, I think we have pretty good line of sight to the fourth quarter.","Sure, there can always be one thing or another that gets pushed out. But in general or on balance across ChemTreat, Trojan, Hach and the broader portfolio, again, we feel pretty good about where we are. Relative to your question about Dental equipment, this is an uncertain environment in terms of some of the manufacturer\/distributor realignment that I mentioned, and the potential impact on equipment. So, I mean, I think we dialed in our outlook reasonably conservatively and we manage the cost structures in the factor associated with the volumes that we see coming, so\u2026","Daniel Comas","And, Jeff, maybe to add to that, so the equipment side, we will have a couple of tough quarters here, because of what is likely to be a destock in the equipment side. And that will hurt the equipment margin. I still think we get an offset, because we've gone through this destock period on the traditional consumables and we feel like we're kind of getting towards the end of that. And if anything, consumables are more profitable than equipment.","So as Tom said, I think it will probably align, equipments going to get tougher on the margin side, but consumable - traditional consumables will start to see some recovery here in Q4.","Jeff Sprague","Okay, great. Thank you.","Thomas Joyce","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","And we'll go next to Dan Arias with Citi.","Thomas Joyce","Good morning, Dan.","Daniel Arias","Hey, good morning. Thank you. Maybe just on Diagnostics on the topic of the selling environment, if I think back to the beginning of the last year, it kind of sounded like you weren't really sure whether ACA and everything associated with that were material factors. So I guess, as we push through the year, I'm curious what your thoughts are there. Do you feel like health reform issues are affecting demand, or is it more of the - it is sort of the fringe element that's not really impactful on results?","Thomas Joyce","Dan, it is hard to pin down. There is no doubt that the backing and forthing in Washington associated with ACA creates uncertainty in the minds of our customers and uncertainty is never good as we all know. And it creates a little bit of hesitancy, not in all customers, but in some customers, but it's hard to pin down the materiality of that. I mean, there are a couple of things, there is one in particular that is a little bit easier to pin down and that's med device tax. If ACA is repealed as it's been proposed a number of times, the med device tax typically would - it has been - would go out the window permanently.","It's been in suspense so far all this year. That had a really very, very modest impact on us, both when it came into being, then when it went into suspense. So, I mean, but that's a more practical and specific example, but again, the materiality of the uncertainty, very hard to pin.","Daniel Arias","Okay, helpful. And maybe just to finish off that last point, with Dental forecast, unless I missed it, do the puts and takes there net out at Dental, core growth staying up modestly to finish the year or is that not necessarily something we should count on? Thanks.","Daniel Comas","I think the planning assumption we had going into the second half of being Dental relatively flat, granted we were up kind of 1% here in the third quarter, is a good planning assumption for the fourth quarter. But as we talked about more broadly, we expect accelerating core growth in the fourth quarter. We talked about Pall, we talked about the inclusion of Cepheid. We expect water to get better. So for us the 3% we posted here in the third quarter, we think we'd be looking more to 3.5% to 4% range from core growth in Q4.","Daniel Arias","Okay, thanks.","Thomas Joyce","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Matt Gugino for any closing or additional remarks.","Matthew Gugino","Thanks, Tracey. And thanks everyone for joining. We're around all day for questions.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

(Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt McGrew, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. McGrew, you may begin your conference.","Matt McGrew","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call today are Larry Culp, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Dan Comas, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Matt Gugino, our Director of Investor Relations. We are also joined by Steve Rales, our Chairman of the Board.","Given last night\u2019s announcement on the CEO transition, our earnings calls can be slightly different format here this quarter wherein Steve will open with a couple of remarks on the transition before getting into the details of the quarter and then the Q&A. So with that, let\u2019s get through the disclosures.","I'd like to point out that our earnings release, a slide presentation supplementing today's call, our first quarter Form 10-Q and the reconciling and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available in the Investor section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Financial Information.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Lawrence Culp","Matt, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I\u2019d like to say a few words about the announcement we made yesterday regarding the CEO succession. Next year, marks my 25th anniversary with the company with more than half of that time as President and CEO. I\u2019ll be in the fortunate position next year of having 14 years in the CEO saddle, while yet still shy of my 52nd birthday.","Although many CEOs do not serve this long, I am sure last night\u2019s news comes as a surprise for many of you not because of my tenure, but because of my age. I am convinced in my head that it\u2019s the right time for a transition, both for Danaher and for me personally. This decision is mine. So let me answer the obvious question, why? It\u2019s pretty simple actually, after spending half of my life with this great company, I\u2019d like to do something different in the next chapter of my life.","Danaher today is strong, I think you see that in our results and we have every conceivable strategic degree of freedom in front of us. The team is strong and Tom is the right person to be our next CEO. I\u2019m a life-long student of Thomas Jefferson and have always been struck by the wisdom of what he has written about the benefits of revolution every twenty years or so.","So while I don\u2019t anticipate a revolution per se at Danaher, I do take a fresh look of free swing to be a value to the company. That said, this decision is hard on the hard. I love this job and more importantly the people with whom I get to work every day. I will miss them greatly.","So many of you have asked so what I am going to do. Well, after this call, I am going to go back to work. We have a lot going on and there is much I want to do before next March. First, Tom, the rest of the team and I will be working closely to effect the smooth Danaher class transition.","In turn, I am looking forward to spending more time in some areas of real interest to me, particularly education and perhaps even teaching. I am also keen doing some things with my family with the 24\/7 nature of this job to make difficult. And I am hopeful that I will be able to bend the rod more regularly than I had in recent years.","But good bye to the long way off today. So let me stop there and hand it over to our Chairman, Steven Rales for a few comments before we discuss the details of the first quarter.","Steve Rales","Thank you, Larry and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to begin by saying that the Board fully endorses everything that Larry has just said. He has done an outstanding job to this company for 24 years and in particular as CEO during the past 13 years. As most of you know, we will be sorry to see Larry eventually move on, but we respect his personal decision and are fully confident we will have a smooth transition just as we did with our two previous CEO transitions.","As all of us well know, Larry has been instrumental in driving Danaher\u2019s success. Just a few highlights. Revenues I have watched them grown from about $4 billion to nearly $20 billion while our market cap has grown from under $10 billion to more than $50 billion. Shareholder returns of five times that of the S&P 500 index since Larry took the rings. Our annual revenue and high growth markets has increased ten-folds from less than $500 million to now $5 billion and free cash flow has exceeded net income every year of his tenure. At the same time. Larry has played a central role in expanding the Danaher business system and is building Danaher into a science and technology company. He has also developed the deep and talented management team that is ready to take on new challenges. Larry is the first to acknowledge that there is always more work to be done, but mean time, Board and management recognizes his many achievements and we thank him for his (Inaudible).","Fortunately, Danaher has a history of developing strong managers and Tom Joyce is ready to become our next CEO. Tom has spent 25 years with Danaher and in 53 still has plenty of runway ahead of him. He has succeeded throughout his career and challenging assignments in all parts of Danaher. Tom is a superb strategic thinker with strong operating and people skills. He is currently responsible for our water quality, life sciences, and diagnostics platforms which collectively represents $9 billion of annual revenues. He help shape the current portfolio with the acquisition and integration of many of Danaher\u2019s leading brands including Beckman Coulter, AB SCIEX and ChemTreat. He is also a seasoned teacher and practitioner of DBS and has played a key role in enhancing many of the tools and metrics upon which DBS is built. All of us have great confidence in Tom\u2019s ability to lead Danaher to execute on our strategic priorities and in turn with the supporting cast and 65,000 plus associates create significant value for our shareholders.","Now, let me turn the call back to Larry to talk about earnings.","Lawrence Culp","Happy with that Steve, thank you. We are off to a good start in 2014 and our team\u2019s execution a function of our commitment to the Danaher Business System show better than expected top-line growth, outstanding margin expansion and solid earnings performance in the quarter.","We saw positive impact to DBS across our portfolio for the acceleration of new product introductions and go to market initiatives help drive mid-single-digit growth or better and a broad range of our operating companies including Hach, Gilbarco, Radiometer, AB SCIEX, Implant Direct, Videojet and Esko. This strong growth coupled with our solid cross-management by the team led to core operating margin improvement of more than 125 basis points in four of our five segments.","So with that as a backdrop, let\u2019s move to the details of the quarter. This morning we reported adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.81, up 8% and representing another record first quarter for Danaher. Revenues for the quarter grew 5% to $4.7 billion with core revenues up 3.5%. The positive impact of acquisitions increased revenues by 2%, which was partially offset by negative currency translation of 50 basis points. Despite the headlines, high growth markets remained strong increasing at a high single-digit rate. China grew approximately 10% led by our Water Quality, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics and Dental Platforms.","Latin America and the Middle East both grew at a double-digit rate and India was up high single-digits. The developed markets grew at a low single-digit rate as both the U.S. and Europe grew low single-digits. This mark the third consecutive quarter of positive growth in Europe. Japan sales increased at a double-digit rate.","Gross margin increased 30 basis points to 52.6% and gross margin expansion along with the productivity and efficiency initiatives made in 2013 has allowed us to grow our investments in R&D and sales and marketing. Core operating margin expanded 100 basis points with reported operating margins at 16.9%.","On the capital allocation front, M&A remains our primary focus and in the first quarter we deployed approximately $160 million on five bolt-on acquisitions to further strengthen our competitive positions within our Test and Measurement and Environmental segments.","We also increased our annual dividend to $0.40 per share from $0.10 per share in February. With a healthy balance sheet and robust acquisition funnel, we remain confident in our ability to deploy more than $8 billion in M&A capacity.","Turning to our five operating segments, Test and Measurement revenues grew 2% with core revenues up 1%. Core operating margin expanded 125 basis points and reported operating margin increased 20 basis points to 22.1%.","Core revenues in our Instruments platform grew low single-digits. Fluke core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate for the second quarter in a row led by demand for Industrial Test products in China and Europe and calibration products globally.","Next month, we are launching Fluke Connect, a collection of 20 fluke tools that wirelessly connect to a smartphone app allowing maintenance technicians to capture, store and share data on mobile devices and in the cloud using data captured in our analytical software, technicians will now be able to quickly and proactively address problems with critical equipment before it fails.","We have also closed on the acquisition of Unfors RaySafe, a global leader in testing devices, software and systems for diagnostic imaging equipment. Unfors complements Fluke\u2019s existing offering of biomedical testing products.","At Tektronix, core revenues declined slightly, as solid growth in Latin America and the Middle East was more than offset by weakness in U.S. military and government verticals. Core revenues from our Communications platform grew low single-digits as strong demand for mobile network monitoring and enterprise network analysis tools was partially offset by weakness in network security.","At Fluke Networks we introduced the LinkSprinter network tester and cloud service, a pocket-size tool that allows network specialist to view emails store and analyze your test results on smartphones or in the cloud.","Revenues from new products such the LinkSprinter have increased 20% from the comparable amount in 2013 and now represents nearly a quarter of Fluke Networks\u2019 total sales.","Apart from evolving to take full advantage of the tremendous opportunity may possible by today\u2019s computing and communications technologies, both Fluke Connect and Fluke Networks\u2019 LinkSprinter launches are examples of that shift and provide our customers with the ability to not only perform complex testing but to access, analyze and act on critical information in real-time.","Moving over to our Environmental segment, revenues increased 6% with core revenues up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 145 basis points, while reported operating margin was up 30 basis points to 18.9%. Our Water Quality platform\u2019s core revenues grew at a low single-digit rate led by a double-digit increase in the high growth markets.","Hach had another strong quarter led by double-digit growth in service and healthy municipal demand in Europe. During the quarter Hach expanded its product line with the acquisition of BioTector, a global provider of online TOC or Total Organic Carbon analyzers that monitor water quality and help reduce waste primarily the petrochemical and food and beverage industries.","At Trojan, we received IMO type approval for our full suite of UV ballast water treatment products in early March. With this approval our team can now see the opportunity to help customers who have been waiting for an IMO approved ballast water solution. Importantly, our testing was performed at a U.S. certified lab which provide us with an advantage as we seek U.S. type approval in the next stage of the regulatory process.","We believe Trojan low energy requirements, small footprint and ease of use differentiate our solution and position us to capitalize on this tremendous opportunity. Gilbarco Veeder-Root core revenues increased mid-single-digits led by point-of-sale and payment solutions globally and strong dispenser demand in Western Europe and China. Our comprehensive product suite continues to differentiate us in the marketplace and GVR was recently voted the best POS system and fuel dispenser manufacturer by the Petroleum Marketers Association of America.","In life sciences, and diagnostics, revenues grew 6% with core revenues up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 75 basis points and reported operating margin was up 50 basis points to 13.2%. Core revenues in our Diagnostic platform grew at a low single-digit rate.","At Beckman Coulter, core sales were up led by healthy demand in the high growth markets. Beckman continues to strengthen its competitive position with first-quarter wins in North America exceeding those made during all of 2013. This marks Beckman\u2019s best quarter since the acquisition and expanding its install base.","We also achieved an important milestone on the regulatory front receiving closure of the last two FDA warning letters at our Chaska and Miami facilities. Earlier this month, Beckman expanded its world-class automation capabilities with the introduction of the UniCel DxH Connected Workcell. This scalable work flow management solution enables our hematology lab customers to connect up to three analyzers to a slide maker stainer, increasing efficiency and reducing turnaround time for each critical test.","Radiometer\u2019s core sales increased high single-digits as we continue to benefit from our growing install base of acute care instruments. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth or better for Radiometer. Demand was strong across all platforms with core blood gas sales up high single-digits. High growth markets remain robust led by China and the Middle East each of which grew over 20%.","Sales at Leica Biosystems were up mid single-digits led by mid-teens growth in advanced staining and digital pathology. Core histology revenues decreased mid single-digits impart due to a large project shipment in the prior year. During the quarter, we received FDA clearance for the Leica BOND Oracle HER2 IHC System on the Leica BOND-MAX. This HER2 test is used to help determine the appropriate treatment for breast cancer and in combination with the speed and efficiency of the BOND-MAX provides patients with quicker access to important test results and treatment plans.","Our life sciences platform had a good start to the year. Core sales increased mid single-digits with all major geographies contributing to the growth.","AB SCIEX core sales grew high single-digits as strength in the clinical and academic markets drove double-digit growth. Earlier this month we expanded the capabilities of our mass spec offerings in clinical settings with the release of a newborn screening assay for use on the 3200MD IVD system in Europe. This assay allows labs to detect metabolic disorders in newborns more accurately and more efficiently than traditional diagnostic tests.","In our separations business, we launched the CES IMS which helps our customers more accurately predict the efficacy and reduce the time to market for pharmaceuticals. Leica Microsystems core sales were up mid single-digits with growth in most major product lines. Geographically, high growth markets grew double-digits with sales of Japan up more than 20%.","Dental had an outstanding start to 2014 with the investments we\u2019ve been making in new product development help drive excellent top-line and operating margin performance. Reported and core revenues grew 6% representing the segment\u2019s best quarterly performance in three years. Both core and reported operating margin increased 170 basis points to 14.8%.","At the Chicago Midwinter Dental meeting in February, we were excited to announce the formation of the KaVo Kerr Group, which strategically unites our leading dental consumables, equipment, hi-tech and specialty brands, under one global platform and get our brands at the scale they need to better drive innovation, improve clinical outcomes and simplify workflows. Both customer and end-user reception since the launch has been very positive. Dental Consumables core revenues grew mid single-digits with broad based demand across all major geographies. Orthodontics, professional consumables and implant revenues all grew mid single-digits or better. During the quarter Kerr launched the SonicFill Dental composite system in China and Japan further expanding the products\u2019 global application. SonicFill is the only solution that enables clinicians to perform cavity restoration in posterior teeth, with an easy-to-use single-step Sonic activated handpiece. SonicFill has already been a tremendous success around the world with more than 4 million sets shipped worldwide since the initial launch in the middle of 2011.","Dental Technologies core revenues also increased mid single-digits with solid demand for our suite and imaging products. At the Chicago Midwinter Show we launched more than 20 new products including the DEXIS CariVu, a portable imager that pairs with our software and uses illumination technology to better assist doctors in identifying lesions and cracks in teeth.","And finally the Industrial Technologies\u2019 revenues grew 4.5% with core revenues up 3% and core operating margin expanded 185 basis points while reported operating margin increased 160 basis points to 22.5%.","Motion platform core revenues improved sequentially from the fourth quarter, but still declined at a low single-digit rate. Strong sales in North American distribution was more than offset by a weak defense market and the impact of exiting certain lower margin product lines. We expect to complete that transition in the second quarter. We remain really pleased with the team\u2019s execution on operating margin which increased more than 200 basis points from the prior year.","Our Product Identification platform core revenues were up mid single-digits with growth across most major geographies. Videojet\u2019s growth was balanced with mid single-digit growth in both consumables and equipment. During the quarter Videojet launched the 8610 thermal inkjet printer, world\u2019s first TIJ printer specifically designed for fast drying ink enabling customers to print high resolution codes on non-porous surfaces, four times faster than other inkjet technologies.","At ESKO, our suite of packaging management and design software grew double digit as the need for more efficient solutions across packaging workflow continues to build. ESKO remains the workflow management software provider of choice for brand owners with sales increasing more than 30% in this market.","So to wrap up, we are off to a very good start in 2014 as our teams\u2019 execution drove better than expected revenue growth, outstanding margin expansion and solid earnings performance. The Danaher Business System has helped build momentum across the portfolio by driving continued share gains and funding increased growth investments.","We believe this momentum along with our robust balance sheet and confidence on the acquisition front position us well in 2014. We are initiating second quarter diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.90 to $0.94 which assumes core growth comparable to the first quarter.","We are also reaffirming our full year 2014 diluted net earnings per share guidance of $3.60 to $3.75.","Matt McGrew","Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. Debbie, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We'll go first today to Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi, good morning guys.","Lawrence Culp","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Congrats Larry on a great run. Also, just having the guts to make the decision, I mean, a lot of guys would sit around and kind of milk this job for a while. Obviously you are not doing that, so congrats.","Lawrence Culp","Thank you, Scott.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Is there any risk, I mean, how do you avoid with the change in 12 months out, I mean, how do you avoid 12 months of inertia here? How are guys going to think about deals? As this increase your \u2013 I mean, how does it change? I would be kind of awkward I think to announce the substantial deal and that passed on to Tom at this juncture. But is that the wrong way to think about it?","Lawrence Culp","Scott, I understand the concern, but I think that\u2019s the last way we would think about it. Tom and I have worked together for 25 years. We have been both partners for over a decade. So I think that on the M&A front, Tom begins to be more a part of that conversation as we think about identify and cultivating pursuing targets. We wouldn\u2019t chase anything at this point that Tom wasn\u2019t fully brought into. But we do not slow down here at all in terms of what we want to do from an M&A perspective. I think that we got the time here to effect operationally, organizationally a very smooth transition and I am exceptionally confident that Tom, Dan, the rest of the team and I are going to be able to work together as we always have over these next several months during transition. Tom of course will be spending time with businesses that he doesn\u2019t know as well, getting up to speed on some of the CEO duties that will be his come mark, but from an M&A perspective, I think it\u2019s very much business as usual. And I have to go back \u2013 if you go back to my first year as CEO, I\u2019ll never forget my first Danaher Leadership Conference where we announced three deals that week. So there is think precedent and confidence to suggest here that the transition no way will dilute or impede our activity on the M&A front.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, fair point and I don\u2019t know if Steve Rales is still there available for questions, if he is, I thought to ask one if he is available.","Lawrence Culp","He is here Steve \u2013 he is here Scott.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, great and Steve, I mean, I guess, my question for you is, when Larry took over as you said it was a $4 billion revenue company, now it\u2019s a $20 billion company, so substantially more complicated and quality is definitely a lot higher sure, but how is the mandate for Tom change, how \u2013 stepping into a, he is filling the seats of a guy who just had a five-bagger in market cap and 13 years that\u2019s a pretty tough shoes to fill. I mean, how does the mandate for Tom change? How does the Board think about how this company grows from $50 billion of market cap to something that\u2019s acceptable to shareholders in that same timeframe?","Steve Rales","","Thank you, Scott. I think the conversations about longer-term strategy and capital allocation are regular subjects to the Board. This is the Board that\u2019s not unfamiliar with either of those. We'll examine the market as we always do. We have lengthy conversations with Larry, Tom, Dan and the rest of the team and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunities as we have for the last 25 or 30 years. We think it\u2019s an exciting runway ahead, we\u2019ve never been into better position from the balance sheet standpoint and I think there are plenty of opportunities that will be very exciting and I expect shareholders at the end of the day will be winners as a result.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, fair point. Thanks, Steve. Congrats Larry and good luck to Tom. Pass it on.","Steve Rales","Thanks, Scott, we\u2019ll do.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan.","Steve Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities","Hey, good morning.","Lawrence Culp","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities","Congrats Larry. I echo with Scott\u2019s comments.","Lawrence Culp","Thank you very much.","Steve Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities","How are you guys looking at the macro environment and maybe if you could just talk about specifically what\u2019s going on in China and in Europe?","Lawrence Culp","Sure, I think that we were pretty pleased from a geographic perspective with the way things played out. Just maybe a word on the U.S. we saw \u2013 like a number of companies a slow start to the year, particularly in businesses where getting out every day is important whether that be on the diagnostics side all the way to \u2013 but we really, we are encouraged by the building strength during the quarter and the way we exited the first quarter and even way we\u2019ve begun April here. Europe, third quarter in a row being positive, admittedly it\u2019s up in low single-digits but that\u2019s too has been encouraging just given the history. Our European leadership conference was held just two weeks ago and the mood there, Steve was buoyant as it\u2019s been in several years. So we are optimistic there particularly with respect to life sciences, the dental side of things and TID our oral health position in Europe. China, clearly lot of headline concerns there. But we are pretty pleased to see double-digit first quarter with a bit better balance between our healthcare businesses which in the last few years have really led the way. Dental was up over 20%, LS&D up about 10% with the industrial businesses also doing better particularly in the environmental round. So we are going to watch China carefully, some of the other high growth markets that\u2019s why we said back in December we thought the gap between the high growth markets and the development markets might narrow a bit that play out for us here in the first three months. But still very much the high growth markets in the pole position. So we like what we saw broadly around the world in the first quarter.","Steve Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities","And in the April you said, April was, how good as kind of April started and are you kind of assuming that do you know falls off here in the second half and you are consistent guidance for the second quarter, is there a comp issue in the second quarter with some similar organic?","Lawrence Culp","No, I think \u2013 we are really talking about a comparable core in the second quarter mindful that it\u2019s still relatively really in the year, obviously a host of concerns out there in terms of the macro theme. I think if we look at the way the first quarter played out, we knew we were hurt by one less selling day particularly in consumables and probably helped a little bit given the Japanese tax dynamics. I suspect they wash, while we were thrilled with how strong dental Hach, VideoJet life sciences were relative expectations. We did have a choppy start in T&M, particularly in \u2013 and that's a space both with some of the mobile carriers and with some of our larger enterprise customers we want to watch carefully. So, I think comparable to the 3.5 we rung up here in the first quarter feels about right but we really like the exit rate in March and while it\u2019s just a couple of weeks I\u2019m encouraged by the start here in April.","Steve Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities","And then, one last question. Larry, I know you are probably, this is probably a dumb question, but I guess, in your mindset, are you still of the mind or you may spend some time with your family or this is kind of \u2013 do we take this you are kind of done with the large public company digs, I mean, are you going to take and are you kind of retiring? I mean, politics, have you thought about what the next step is at all, should we be surprised to see you resurface at another public company in a few years or it\u2019s probably like you know a tough question answer obviously at this stage?","Lawrence Culp","But thanks for asking it. Steve, you know I am very fortunate given the great run that we had for a long time here that there probably hasn\u2019t been a large public job that hasn\u2019t been floated my way in the last six, seven years. But you see where I am. This is a great job. Tom, he is a lucky guy to have that opportunity here in a while. My view is, I am going to be full speed up until March 1 and then I am going to be in advisory capacity doing anything and everything that Tom wants me to do including get out of the way. But I am genuine and serious about wanting to do some other things. So while I would say never say never, I think I\u2019ve had a pretty good job here and in this realm, it will be tough to be.","Steve Tusa \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities","Okay, congrats to Tom by the way too.","Lawrence Culp","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","","We\u2019ll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yes, thanks good morning. Hate to sound repetitive, but congratulations Larry. And f you decide on politics I think the government could use some DBS methodologies. So, you think about that.","Lawrence Culp","Thanks, thank you Nigel.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","So, it sounds like March was stronger than Jan, Feb and it doesn\u2019t feel like the weather had a big impact on your organic performance. I am wondering the impacts on consumables with equipment and whether that dynamic had any impact on your margin improvements during the quarter and how that maybe \u2013 shake up by segments?","Daniel Comas","Sure, Nigel. This is Dan. Good morning. Consumables were up 4% during the quarter which has been pretty consistent, maybe 50 basis points lighter than what we saw in the second half of last year. I think you could really explain that entirely by the one less selling day. I think what was really encouraging during the quarter was the equipment side. We were up 3.5%, that is the best number we posted in a number of quarters, balance stability it was the first, as Larry alluded to, better breadth in China. It\u2019s the first quarter in a long time that all five segments were up in China. Healthcare was up more than industrial but again seeing some footing there. We were up 100 basis points in terms of core margin expansion. Some good improvement there, do we make a little bit more money on consumables and equipment we do but it didn\u2019t really seem to impact margins at all during the quarter.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just going back to the \u2013 it\u2019s obviously a pretty healthy debate on capital deployments, PE seems to be pretty active, pushing up multiples to some pretty high levels. A lot of public companies that are out there saying they want to do more M&A. I am just wondering, is the environment tougher to deploy capital and then maybe just turning to that as well, what is the message on dividends? You obviously increased as four folds during the quarter, still a lot low in terms of pay out. But what is the message on dividends?","Lawrence Culp","Nigel, let me speak to M&A, maybe Dan will talk a bit to dividends. I think from an M&A perspective, there is no question that the environment given valuations first in the public market and the spillover effect in the private markets has been more challenging in the last couple of years, I think we have acknowledged that. But fortunately given the breadth of our portfolio and the inventory of markets we have an interest in, we don\u2019t have to buy market indices, right. All we are really looking to do is identify and invest in discrete companies which we think are great fits with the Danaher portfolio and it\u2019s really from that perspective that we are out talking to a lot of people really across the entire corporation about opportunities that we think would be glove fits for Danaher and for DBS. So, different environments are challenging in different ways, I don\u2019t think that they \u2013 that we see private equity even with their resources being a primary competitor for us. It continues to be rare for us to see PE as the competition around an asset that we might cover. Clearly, the last several months have had some situations where we\u2019ve been mentioned in combination with private equity, but largely around assets where our interest was partial not full. When we have strong interest in an asset in its entirety, I think we have great confidence in our ability to carry the debt. Dan?","Daniel Comas","Nigel, on the dividend, it\u2019s like the increase we know it\u2019s still relatively modest, it represents at $0.40 a share would represent about 10% of our free cash flow per year. So we are not trying to signal anything there. The strong bias is still very much M&A and expect that to continue. But it does create another vector to return some capital to shareholders.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thank you very much guys.","Lawrence Culp","You bet, thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Thank you. Good morning everyone. Larry the accolades are going all year, I'll just echo them. We\u2019ll miss you.","Lawrence Culp","Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Good luck. I just want to come back again, maybe, approach M&A again to the question that Steve Rales is still there and to take another one. You have kind of unique position with your involvement with full effect also obviously and they do seem to be able to get that done over there. And I guess it does brings the question, is it simply a law of large number of dynamic that has come to bear as it relates to Danaher? Is there a need eventually to revaluate the portfolio or think of a new leg to open another vector for capital deployment? Do you think a question of size only has the ability to kind of perpetuate the business model?","Steve Rales","Thank you, Jeff. But first let me say yes, I am a shareholder of Colfax Corporation, full stop. Second, going back to what we talked about earlier, our Board has a very long view and our objective is to continue to try and find the way along with the management to make our businesses better and add value for shareholders. It\u2019s an evolving process. It\u2019s an ambulatory process. We are constantly looking at M&A, there is a certain vicinity if you will to the law of large numbers but we think more about opportunities and making our businesses better. Truthfully, Larry and Dan do a very nice job of communicating the company\u2019s view on M&A, so I would defer to either them on the question.","Lawrence Culp","Jeff, I would just add that, we really don\u2019t think beating a $20 billion revenue based company, a $ 50 billion market cap in anyway get in the way in terms of doing M&A. I think it\u2019s just the opposite. At every step along the way as we\u2019ve gotten bigger and in terms stronger, we\u2019ve had more degree to freedom, we\u2019ve had more \u2013 more capacity to do the things that we think really build an outstanding company over time witness Beckman Coulter. If you look at the way we\u2019ve run M&A on a daily basis, it really starts with all the strategic platforms which would be great mid cap companies all by themselves if they were stand alone entities and it\u2019s really that family of mid-cap companies working their market\u2019s funnels around competitors, distribution, technology, bolt-ons that maybe of interest in addition to the adjacencies which give us the bulk of our flow around the smaller transactions that you see. The team here in Washington, which I think is outstanding. It\u2019s really the group that targets the new space with the larger situations which naturally are going to be less frequent and at times more meaningful decisions this year amount of capital deployed. So I don\u2019t think that while we have great respect for Steve and the team at Colfax, we don\u2019t really think that there are lessons there that will help us deploy the next eight plus billion in capital we intend that will build out our companies.","Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","All right, fair enough. Just a quick one for Dan if I could. You did get a number of small deals currently in the first quarter, can you give us an idea of how many transactions were in there and what the average valuation was?","Daniel Comas","Jeff, we closed five acquisitions in the quarter which was an increase and we are seeing actually an increase around small deals which hopefully will be a positive sign about potentially getting something bigger done. Spend about a $160 million so relatively modest. A mix, some of those are businesses that are relatively low margin today, but it will come in as bolt-ons or create opportunities on the margin side, so those are all situations where we think we can get a 10% return, exceed 10% within three years.","Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","All right, thank you very much and good luck Larry.","Lawrence Culp","Thanks, Jeff. I\u2019ll still be around a while.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Co","Thanks, good morning and obviously, I\u2019ll echo that congratulations Larry, fantastic.","Lawrence Culp","Thank you, Steve.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Co","So, hey, since you are a student of Thomas Jefferson, I can\u2019t help, but recite one of his quotes right delay it\u2019s preferable to err on the capital deployment side, you didn\u2019t say that second part, but, it\u2019s a great quote and I understand that sort of how you are thinking about it. Is that $8 billion still the right number, I should be thinking about?","Daniel Comas","Steve, it\u2019s Dan. I mean, clearly if you look at the balance sheet, the breadth of our, the quantity of our free cash flow, you can pencil out a larger number that until we obviously get some deals done aside, I think we will stick with the $8 billion.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Co","Okay and Dan while I\u2019ve got you, since we are in this period where M&A is a lot smaller in terms of reviewing the portfolio right now, the \u2013 where can ROIC go and I am just assuming that there is a continued delay for a little bit of time and how do you see ROIC kind of playing out in that event?","Daniel Comas","Well you\u2019ve been seeing at 50 to 100 basis point increase in annual ROIC, given that we\u2019ve had fewer acquisitions. I would be happy to see that stop for a little bit. We\u2019d bring in some larger ones but, I think if you look at Q1 I think representative of last year, up 3.5% core growth and earnings up 8% we are getting I think good relative performance on the top-line and good margin expansions along with it and that's obviously increasing our overall returns.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Co","Okay and sir if I could add one more just on the earnings side, the dental strength that you guys had was a surprise to me anyway. What do you really attribute that to? Is it sort of product, market, or what can you identify kind of that and give us a sense for the sustainability, or you just think it\u2019s sort of a lumpy demand and we just have to be like this quarter?","Lawrence Culp","Steve, I think if you look both at the consumables versus technologies divide as well as the look around the world, the strength was very broad based. I don\u2019t think they continue at that rate. We did get a little bit of help from Japan given the VAT increase. But it was once said dental is a mid single-digit grower, strong imaging and digital franchises and technologies, and while they are rarely home run products in consumables we had a wonderful wave of products launched at Midwinter. The team continues to execute better both in the U.S. and in Europe while China clearly is a concern for a lot of folks, our dental business continues to do very well there. So, again I think we probably come down a little bit from what we saw in the first quarter but dental ought to continue to be a contributor to it for us as we go through the year.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Co","Okay, great. Thank you.","Lawrence Culp","You bet, Steve. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities","Good morning guys.","Lawrence Culp","Good morning Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities","Congrats Larry. Great job and really happy for you. Good luck with the next part of the journey but we will have you around for a while. Hey, you mentioned, speaking it being around for a while, you mentioned wanting to get some things done before you leave, I mean, are there any sort of big things on that checklist that you think you want to make sure you get done before you hand it off?","Lawrence Culp","I\u2019d like to write a few more checks before I go.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities","Okay, so, it\u2019s mainly M&A focused anything other than that sort of that internal initiatives or other things that you feel like you want to bring to posture now?","Lawrence Culp","Well, I think a lot of our internal initiatives are around the high growth markets, around what we are doing in terms of taking full advantage of the web, what we are doing increasingly at a platform and regional level is work that we won\u2019t finish when Tom hands. This is the work that Tom and I and the rest of the team has been engaged in together for some time. Tom and I will be dividing and conquering over the next year and that\u2019s where I\u2019ve been focused and we\u2019d expect to continue to be focused. Clearly, getting the team ready as well, as they assume the new and additional responsibilities will be part of \u2013 of where I\u2019ll be focused. But also just making sure that Tom's ready. I can vouch now from experience that this is one of the more meaningful transitions that you have as an operating leader. Tom is more than capable, but we want to make sure he is just tuned all the way up come March 1 to be ready to go as I know he will be.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities","Okay, thanks. And then, you\u2019re seeing some of these other encouraging trends across the businesses\/ where do you think the tech instruments business is at this point? You had some of this military government pressure that\u2019s one vertical, but maybe talk across the others and where do you think that is and what\u2019s it going to take to get going?","Lawrence Culp","Well, I think that we will take this stability that we are seeing in some of the larger tech verticals like computers, communications, semi and alike. The broader distribution business has actually been decent, but again because of the gov dynamics particularly in the U.S. here at the start of the year which we saw \u2013 I know some competitors have spoken to, puts us in that flattish zone. We\u2019d like to thin k we see a little bit of an uptick from there but don\u2019t anticipate necessarily a pronounced spring back at Tektronix through 2014, but gradual improvement.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities","Okay, all right thanks a lot guys.","Lawrence Culp","Thank you, Shannon.","Operator","We will take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Congratulations. I just had a quick question on broader one test and measurement really. If you look at the organic growth in that segment, the last ten quarters, it\u2019s about 0.5%. I just wanted to know something with the portfolio you needed some major work in \u2013 or it\u2019s just a function of sluggish macro factors?","Lawrence Culp","Julian, thank you. Relative to your question, I think you really have to look at the segment in two halves, the communication platform has really been a nice performer for us, particularly around the mobile networks build out that we\u2019ve been a large part of. We think that opportunity that challenge is to keep up with the explosion in bandwidth demand that we are all generating which will be with us for a while. Soft start to the year in network security, but as you know the last couple years, that\u2019s been a strong performer for us and we are optimistic that it will return the type of performance as we go through the year. But on the instrument side, Fluke has had a tough goal of it, particularly in places like China where there is the slowdown in the industrial factor has been particularly pronounced. At Tektronix we just spoke to that a moment ago with Shannon, I think those dynamics are well known. But we are encouraged by Fluke here putting up another quarter of positive growth. We really like these new products that are coming out and a review just last week with the commercial team I really liked what I saw in terms of the launch plans for the second quarter and the second half. So while Fluke is unlikely to be a high single-digit grower for us any time soon we think we get Fluke back here to a more normal low to mid single-digit range as we go through the course of the year and while tech will be challenged we build on that stability and hopefully get them back to growth as we go through the year.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great, thanks and then life sciences, the last couple of years, each year you had large expansion about 150 BPS each year, Q1 was up 50 BPS, life science is larger, is that kind of the run rate going forward just because I guess most of that savings is now been squeezed out?","Daniel Comas","Julian, we were \u2013 core margins are up about 75 basis points in the first quarter. So there was a little bit of acquisition noise. Life science was stronger than diagnostics, and again I think diagnostics, their shipments were up low single-digits that was \u2013 we believe largely impacted by one less day. If you look at their orders, they were up mid single-digits. So I think that\u2019s encouraging. That creates a little bit of negative mix just because if the incremental sales of consumables is at higher margins. So I think you will see continued very good margin performance and expansion in the segment.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks, Dan and just lastly on the CapEx, I think you talked before about low mid single-digit CapEx increase this year, Q1 was up lot more than that. Do you change the full year or it was just (inaudible)","Daniel Comas","Well, it\u2019s coming up in part because of increased placement at Beckman, because of our leasing model. That shows up in CapEx. So some of the increase in CapEx is less traditional PPV, it\u2019s actually expanding our installed base at Beckman which is obviously a good sign for the business.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great, thank you very much.","Lawrence Culp","","Thanks, Julian.","","Operator","","Ladies and gentlemen, we will take our final question today from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies","","Thanks, good morning.","Lawrence Culp","Good morning, Brandon.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies","Larry, could you elaborate on what you saw from an order perspective at Beckman understanding weather and one less selling day were headwinds, but given your comments about win rates in the U.S. when do you think that we see that translate into a core revenue inflection in the Beckman diagnostics unit?","Lawrence Culp","Well, I think that, we did a bit better from a bookings perspective and again better in bookings than we did in shipments. But the trend through the quarter was positive for us in that regard primarily with consumables but that North American equipment comment that we made, we think it\u2019s significant, because it\u2019s really the combination of so much of the work the team has done the last several years. As you know, it will take a while to get those orders converted into new boxes on the floor and in turn see that consumable stream. But we think that as we move forward sequentially through the course of the year that we will see a pick up as a result of those as increased wins here in North America, done unlike what we are sitting already in terms of early benefits from the return of the component to our whole suite of analyzers. So it will be gradual, I wish it was more rapid, but we will take the early indicators here of progress and then we can build on the print through the course of 2014.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies","And then just one for Dan, operating cash flow is a little soft even excluding the discrete factors from last year. What\u2019s your operating cash balance for the year and how quickly would you expect the timing dynamics from the first quarter to normalize?","Daniel Comas","I think, you are seeing on an improvement here in Q2 as Larry alluded to given the stronger shipments in March relative to the first few months that hurt us a little bit from a timing perspective on CapEx but I think that will shortly reverse itself.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies","Okay, thank you.","Daniel Comas","Thanks, Brandon.","Lawrence Culp","","Okay, thanks everybody.

Our fourth quarter results round out a tremendous 2018 for Danaher. During the year, strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion delivered double-digit adjusted EPS and mid-teens free cash flow growth. We delivered 6% core revenue growth for the full year, which was a meaningful step up versus prior years, led primarily by the impact of new product innovation and commercial initiatives. ","The Danaher business system continued to serve as the driving force behind our execution and our ability to take share in many of our businesses. We generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow in 2018, resulting in 16.5% growth year-on-year that helps position us for significant capital deployment going forward. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was a 127%, representing the 27 consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income. ","We deployed over $2 billion of capital during the year, including the acquisitions of IDT and Blue Software. IDT joined our life science platform adding best in class genomics consumables capabilities, and Blue Software now part of Esko enhances our offering across our packaging development and production work flow. We are excited to have both these businesses as part of Danaher. ","Turning now to the fourth quarter, sales grew 5.5% to $5.4 billion, as the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenue by 2%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 2%. Core revenue increased 5.5% with all five platforms delivering better than expected results. Geographically, high growth markets grew high single digits, led by double digit growth in both China and India. Across the developed markets, we saw high single digit growth in the US, while Western Europe was up low single digits.","Gross margins for the fourth quarter; gross margin was 55.1%, and operating profit margin was 17.9%. Core operating margin declined 15 basis points, driven primarily by accelerated investment spend, foreign currency impact from a stronger US dollar, and tariff related costs. Full year gross margin was a record high 55.8%, and we increased our core operating margin by 70 basis points. This marks the fourth quarter consecutive year that we increased our core operating margin by 70 basis points or more. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.28, bringing full year adjusted diluted net EPS to $4.52, our fifth straight year of double digit growth. ","Now let\u2019s take a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results across the portfolio. In life sciences, reported revenue increased 10.5% and core revenue was up 7.5%. Operating profit margin declined 30 basis points to 19.7%, as a result of foreign currency impact and accelerated growth investments. For the full year, life sciences delivered an outstanding 180 basis points of core operating margin expansion, a testament to the teams\u2019 strong DBS execution. ","Turning to the individual operating companies; Beckman Life Sciences achieved high single digit core revenue growth for the quarter. More than 20% growth in automation was driven by demand for new products like the Biomek i Series, Beckman sample preparation platform launched last year. We further enhanced our automation capabilities with our recent bolt-on acquisition of Labcyte Corporation. Labcyte brings complementary technology to the core Beckman offering, with an acoustic dispensing method that is used for liquid handling in life science applications. ","The non-contact low-volume dispensing technique eliminates cross contamination risks and greatly reduces fluid loss, helping scientists around the world to achieve better results. These organic and inorganic growth investments are helping us provide best-in-class solutions for our customers and contributing to Beckman Life Sciences above market growth rate. ","Leica Microsystems\u2019 core revenue was up mid-single digits with positive performance across most major end markets and regions, led by life science research in North America. Over the last few years, the Leica team has significantly improved their cadence of innovation through the use of DBS tools. Leica introduced three times the number of new products and technologies in 2018 versus the prior year, while improving their project on time delivery by more than 2000 basis points. The combination of better R&D processes along with enhanced commercial execution have contributed to a meaningful step up in Leica\u2019s core revenue growth over the past few years. ","Core revenue at SCIEX was up high single digits. Strong results in North America and China were broad based driven by demand across the clinical, food testing and forensic end markets. Phenomenex, our separations consumables business achieved high single digit core revenue growth. It\u2019s been two years since we acquired Phenomenex and the team has made tremendous progress with a number of DBS commercial initiatives including funnel management and transformative marketing. Through these and other DBS driven growth initiatives Phenomenex has increased the size of their addressable market by 30%. ","At Pall, high single digit core revenue growth was driven by similar results across both our life sciences and industrial businesses. Biotech was up double-digits, led by strong performance in single use technologies where demand for new products like the iCELLis bioreactor system continues to help drive share gains. IDT delivered mid-teens revenue growth with positive performance across all major regions and product lines. The team continued to build upon early progress with DBS and the business has consistently exceeded our initial performance expectations. ","Moving to diagnostics, reported revenue increased 3.5% and core revenue was up 6%. For the full year, diagnostics delivered 6.5% core revenue growth, meaningful step up versus prior years driven by both organic growth investment and the continued evolution of our diagnostics portfolio. Reported operating margin declined by 70 basis points to 18.8% in the fourth quarter, however core operating margin expanded by 20 basis points. ","At Beckman Diagnostics, core revenue increased at a mid-single digit rate, led by China and improved results in North America. By product line, immunoassay led the way and we saw good growth in automation as well, driven by early success in Europe with our recently launched DxA 5000 automation system. In hematology, we are encouraged by early customer feedback on our new DxH 900 high volume analyzer and the DxH 520 for low to mid volume setting. These are two of the many new products that Beckman introduced this year that expanded our offering and improved our competitive position in the core lab. ","At Radiometer, high single digit core revenue growth was driven by strong quarter in North America, Western Europe and China. Our blood gas and AQT product lines delivered outstanding results, and we believe Radiometer continued to take share in the acute care market. Leica Biosystems, core revenue was up mid-single digits, with broad based strength across most major regions and product lines, led by double digit growth in Advanced Staining. And at Cepheid, double digit core revenue growth was driven by North America and Western Europe. The business achieved a significant milestone in the fourth quarter, placing its 20,000 instrument globally further expanding Cepheid\u2019s market leading installed base. ","Continued innovation around our test menu has also been a meaningful contributor to Cepheid\u2019s outstanding results. The team maintained their cadence of innovation with the recent CE-IVD marking of the Xpert HBV Viral Load test, a new rapid test for the quantitation of the Hepatitis B Virus that delivers results in less than an hour. With the addition of this test, Cepheid now offers a complete virology test menu suitable for any laboratory setting, making high quality testing and disease monitoring accessible to even more clinicians and patients. ","Turning now to our dental segment, reported revenue was flat and operating profit margin increased by 70 basis points to 13.8%. Core operating margins declined by 185 basis points, primarily as a result of ongoing investment spend focused on new product development. Dental core revenue was up 2.5%, one of our better quarters in some time. We remain encouraged by science of end market stabilization, particularly in our North American traditional consumables and equipment business where we saw another quarter of positive sell-out data. ","Our dental business in China, now over 200 million in annual revenue saw a double digit growth again this quarter. Our approach as a more localized player offering a comprehensive product suite positions us well for continued growth in the region. Our specialty consumables business was up low single digits versus a tough prior year comparison with solid performance across orthodontics and implants. Growth was led by performance in high growth markets with particular strength in China and Eastern Europe. ","At the Greater New York Dental Show in November, we featured a number of new technologies from across the dental platform. These included the DEXIS titanium inter-oral sensor and Nobel\u2019s X-Guide for computer guided dental implant surgery. Both important products that support the team\u2019s focus on providing customers with the best-in-class, fully integrated digital workflow. ","In addition, Ormco\u2019s full-scale Clear aligner system, Spark continues to be very well received in Australia and as a reminder the team obtained FDA 510-k clearance for Spark earlier in the fourth quarter. This is obviously an important step as we continue our expansion of our Clear aligner offering. ","Moving to our environmental and applied solutions segment; reported revenue was up 4.5% and core revenue increased 5%. Reported operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 22.7% with modest core margin expansion. In product identification, core revenue increased by mid-single digit rate led by demand for marketing coding equipment and related consumables. ","Videojet core revenue was up high single digits, with positive performance across all major regions, end markets and product lines. The team continued to expand Videojet\u2019s powerful installed base, which now includes more than 10,000 remotely connected printers. Using data analytics, we\u2019re able to help customers run their packaging product season plants more efficiently and with fewer instances of disruptive down time. ","Videojet\u2019s industry leading connectivity provides unique insights to help us serve customers more effectively and this differentiated offering is a key contributor to Videojet\u2019s above-market growth rate. 2018 marked Videojet\u2019s 9th consecutive year of mid-single digit or better core growth. Our packaging business which included Esko and X-Rite was down low-single digits, but we\u2019re encouraged by recent order trends and feel well positioned by our improved performance in 2019. ","Finally, turning to water quality, core revenue growth to the platform was up mid-single digits. Core revenue increased at Hach at a high single-digit rate of momentum in both municipal and industrial end markets. Geographically, the developed markets in China led the way. For the full year 2018, Hach achieved 10% core revenue growth. The Hach team has consistently combined our expanding commercial execution with innovative new products to deliver this market-leading growth. ","Hach\u2019s developed our best-in-class digital marketing platform that we\u2019ve now rolled out across our other Water Quality businesses, and the team has meaningfully expanded Hach\u2019s addressable market with new products like the CM130 chlorine analyzer for dialysis applications and the Claros Water Intelligent Software system. The team\u2019s commitment to continue its improvement has helped Hach differentiate its customer value proposition and further strengthen its competitive advantage. ","At Trojan, core revenue declined due to a tough prior comp comparison, but we saw healthy levels of project bidding activity during the quarter and we\u2019re encouraged by the underlying momentum in the market. Lastly, ChemTreat\u2019s high single digit core revenue growth was driven by strength across North America and Latin America primarily in the food, chemical and oil and gas end markets. The team\u2019s commitment to commercial excellence has helped ChemTreat sustain a remarkable track record with 2018 marking their 51st consecutive year of core revenue growth. ","So to wrap up, 2018 was a tremendous year for Danaher and we\u2019re well positioned as we begin 2019. Over the past several years through a combination of organic and inorganic growth initiatives, we\u2019ve transformed Danaher in to a higher growth, higher margin and higher recurring revenue company, with strong footholds in attractive, fast growing end markets. Our portfolio today combined with the power of the Danaher business system positions us well as we focus on delivering long term shareholder value in 2019 and beyond. ","We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1 and $1.03 which assumed core growth of approximately 4%. We continue to expect full year 2019 core revenue growth of approximately 4% and adjusted diluted net EPS to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.85. ","Matt Gugino","Thanks Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Christy, we\u2019re now ready for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. ","Tycho Peterson","Maybe want to start on margins, obviously a lot of moving pieces here between FX, tariffs, M&A and then some of the dental investments. I know it\u2019s going to be maybe more of a backend loaded year for margin expansion this year, can you maybe just talk about when some of these acquisitions may turn margin accretive? And then can you also comment on your diagnostic margins, looked like they contracted quite a bit, can you maybe just touch on that as well?","Tom Joyce","Sure Tycho. Obviously we did a few things here in the fourth quarter to take advantage of what we saw was a pretty strong quarter evolving particularly in the latter month of December, and so we did accelerate some investment, some spend in a couple of areas that impacted both the cost of good sales line and SG&A. We accelerated some investment in life science in particular and in R&D and sales and marketing and also did a few things accelerating some cost actions in diagnostics and make some investments in new products around dental. So I think a few things that really made some good sense there and to your point clearly FX and tariffs were headwinds in the quarter and made a difference. ","I think if you put those aside, overall margins would have been up roughly about 50 basis points were it not for the FX and tariff impact. So we do see margins continue to improve during the course of the year. Obviously we\u2019ve got a terrific track record here. In terms of acquisition related impact on the margins, IDT turns core here in April, so we\u2019ll start to see those starts to move through. It will take a little bit of a while here before we see the impact of Labcyte obviously our newer acquisition, but IDT obviously will be a much more material contribution. So we\u2019ll see that starting in April which will be a help. ","On the DX side, as I mentioned, we did accelerate some cost actions and some investment there. We got a terrific line-up of new products that are coming through and so continuing to invest in our automation product, hematology, some new products that are coming a little bit out in the future around immunoassay and clinical chemistry, I think are certainly also are having an impact there, but we think those investments make tremendous sense. ","Obviously we had a bit of a comp there with Cepheid coming off with a fourth quarter in 2017 where Cepheid\u2019s top line was up north of 25% a year ago and was up low double digits in the fourth quarter here. So a little bit less \u2013 a little bit of a tough comp there that had some impact on margin, but again specific to DX just coming back very briefly to FX and tariffs, if you put those aside, DX would have been up about 50 basis points in the quarter. ","Matt McGrew","And Tycho maybe just kind of a more color. If you think about the first half headwind that we\u2019ve got in FX, we\u2019re going to see the margin ramp throughout the year. Q1 we\u2019re going to have, of the 400 million of revenue headwind, 200 is going to be in Q1, that\u2019s probably going to be $0.05 or $0.06 of EPS hit in Q1. So if we wouldn\u2019t have had that in Q1 I think we\u2019ve probably would have seen more like double-digit EPS growth at the high end, and the FX impact here in the first half is going to be greater than it will be in the second half heading into \u201919.","Tycho Peterson","That\u2019s helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on dental, obviously nice recovery there, how much of this you think is kind of broader end market strength versus some of that Danaher-specific factors like the Nobel China strength, and any thing we should be thinking about in terms of Clear Aligner launch in the US in terms of revenue contribution for this year?","Tom Joyce","Sure. Well clearly we\u2019ve seen some stabilization in the end market as I commented in my remarks. And that really is coming in the form of improved sell-out in North America, and specifically in the areas that were more challenged in the past several months in quarters which was on a traditional equipment and consumable side. So end market stabilization definitely a contributor, but our execution continues to improve as well, and a number of the steps that we\u2019ve taken over the last several quarters and that has continued to enhance the way we\u2019re executing in that market. ","From a Clear Aligner perspective, again things are going extremely well in Australia. But we\u2019re trying to take a very thoughtful approach to the way we expand our geographic footprint, making sure that we are cultivating the right customer target as we did in Australia, the digitally savvy end customer dentist and orthodontist, who has historically taken advantage of our insignia product line as an example. And so as we think about geographic expansion, we\u2019ll be thoughtful about where those markets are well set up from our standpoint for commercial execution and obviously we\u2019re in the process of ramping our own capacity and so that will be an impact as well.","I would not expect that we would be talking to material contributions to the dental platform for growth rate this year, but perhaps as we go in to next year we\u2019ll start to be looking at some numbers that are starting to make a difference. ","Operator","Our next question is from Ross Muken of Evercore. ","Ross Muken","So it seems like you had sort of better execution in Beckman this quarter. You know the business has been doing reasonably well relative to your peers. You\u2019re a little underweight in immunoassay. It seems like that had a quite a good quarter. Just give me a little bit of a feel for the execution at Beck and how you feel about sort of that growth step off in to next year, given maybe some of the things you\u2019ve also done in the portfolio there?","Tom Joyce","Ross, the fourth quarter was clearly one of Beckman Diagnostics\u2019 better quarters in some time. And that really comes to or is driven by improved commercial execution in a number of regions and new product innovations starting to drive some impact. And we saw mid-single digit core revenue growth in the fourth quarter. That was really led by immunoassay and automation and those are obviously key drivers here. 2018 is the first time that our immunoassay business has tipped over and become a bit larger than our clinical chemistry business. ","So you see the impact of our commercial execution there and some of the automation related competitive advantages we have that are driving that immunoassay growth rate, and that growth rate has been very consistent in most cases with our competitive set. And so now we\u2019re mixing upward our core revenue growth by virtue of that performance. North America in particular saw some improvement in growth rates and obviously that\u2019s a key battleground for us, and we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in our competitive win rates and our customer retention rates. ","So, I think a meaningful step up here in to the 3%ish kind of growth rate and what we\u2019re looking for is kind of another 40 to 50 basis points of step up going forward, and I think what we\u2019ve seen historically over the last couple of years is that very thing. Automation is going well as I mentioned in my remarks, hematology, you know that\u2019s been kind of a drag for us. We\u2019re seeing a much more competitive product line because of both the high volume and the low and mid volume offerings now. ","And I think with what\u2019s coming around low and mid volume immunoassay and clinical chemistry as well as some of what we\u2019re doing in terms of menu gaps that we\u2019ll start to see continued or we will see continued performance improvement there. I think one thing to keep in mind is we \u2013 I know we often talk about Beckman its obviously the biggest business in our diagnostic portfolio, but it\u2019s also important to remember the DX platform grew 6.5% in 2018 and so as we do the comparisons appropriately to broad based competitors in the market, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about how the portfolio is stacking up right now. ","Ross Muken","That\u2019s helpful Tom. And may be just \u2013 I feel like you guys have consistently highlighted given where the balance sheet is now and how strong the cash flow is, sort of the M&A fire power opportunity. Obviously though it\u2019s sort of been a choppy or a volatile public equity market which sometimes will make transactions more complicated. But I guess how are you thinking about sort of your ability to execute on something at least more sizeable in the current environment and how are you thinking about valuations as you look at them broadly and whether or not you\u2019ve seen sort of sellers given some of this volatility get a bit more sensible around potential prices?","Tom Joyce","Sure. Well in terms of our ability to execute and we talked about this a fair amount when we were all together in December. We feel terrific about where we are. Some really good acquisitions this year obviously $2 billion or better executed this past year, IDT and Blue and a few other smaller deals are terrific additions to our portfolio. But the balance sheet today it\u2019s in as good a position as almost we have ever been. ","If you think about our leverage ratio today, we\u2019re talking about being about two in terms of net debt-to-EBITDA, that\u2019s the lowest level since pre-Pall and so in terms of our capacity, our ability to execute both from a balance sheet perspective, and of course also from a talent perspective we feel very good about where we are. ","In terms of the valuation in the market today, we all know that M&A can be episodic, we are nothing if not patient about looking for and cultivating the most strategic and financially attractive deals. ","But the pipeline is good today, our cultivation levels are as good as ever, you\u2019ve heard us talk about the breadth of that cultivation which is across all the platforms probably with a little bit less emphasis as you might imagine right now in terms of large capital deployment, a little bit less emphasis perhaps on doing that in dental, but certainly the other four platforms are off the front line and with the capacity we have, and the ability to deploy a significant amount of capital this year, we\u2019re hoping that things break our way. ","In terms of sensibility of valuations well of course the sellers have always think their valuations are sensible. This volatility helps clearly, I think the shake up in the latter part of last year may have gotten some folks thinking about what they might do, but things have sort of stabilized here. So it\u2019s early, a little tough to tell, but we\u2019re in great shape and are prepared to do things of consequence. ","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Davis of Melius Research.","Scott Davis","Overall a really strong quarter, I would love to have a little bit color around what you\u2019re seeing out of China, just given the variability of results that we\u2019ve seen across the board from both cyclical and non-cyclical companies have had a range of outcomes that are pretty broad, but what are you guys seeing in China, what are your local guys telling and what kind of confidence do you have in 2019 in the region?","Tom Joyce","Sure. Scott I know there\u2019s a lot of interest in China right now, there\u2019s been a lot written about what appears factually based to be a slow-down in the broad redefined Chinese market. We are not seeing anything specific that we could point to today that is impacting our businesses in China. I think you can start with the fact that we\u2019re really well positioned to cross our core market. Diagnostics, life sciences, water quality, product identification, consumer, packaged goods and of course dental, which as you heard again growing double digits, are great markets to be in. So, I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s what you\u2019re reading about today which appears to be more of a consumer-driven slow-down in the Chinese market would be as obviously in our businesses. ","Our business in China was up double-digit in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s the 8th consecutive quarter or better said the second straight year of double digit growth for us in China. And that was pretty broad based, pretty much across the board; we can\u2019t really point to any particular slow-downs. Over the past three to four years, our China growth has been up high single digits, low single digit. So could we start to see a little bit of an impact there? I think we could. I think these consumer driven impacts can start to move across in to even in the industrial markets psychologies. And while we have a very little industrial exposure left broadly defined at Danaher, whether that\u2019s a Pall Industrial or Hach Industrial or PID Industrial, probably less than 10% of Danaher today and therefore at even a smaller portion of our China business.","Those are the things we\u2019ll watch carefully as indicators as to whether or not we\u2019re seeing a broader slowdown. ","Scott Davis","And just a little bit of a nuance question here, but when I see companies take a step up in investments, discretionary investments, always begs a question of are you catching upon spend or you\u2019re getting ahead of spend. And obviously the nuance there being, if you\u2019re catching up, its\u2019 more of a new normal, if you\u2019re getting ahead its more pulled forward. So do you have a comment on that?","Tom Joyce","Sure. It\u2019s an interesting question Scott, because I think it\u2019s probably \u2013 I think if you look across how broad our portfolio is in a number of operating companies, I\u2019m sure we could find examples of both. But I think largely we try to get ahead. We try to look for those things where based on what we were anticipating in the quarter, we thought we might now have room for and some things where we can use some good discretion about investments that would have some impact on a relatively near term basis. And so clearly I think there could always be a mix there, but the strategic intent is to look for those things that we knew were right to do, were anticipating that we would do at some point and we wanted to get ahead to try to continue to enhance the growth trajectory of the business.","Operator","Your next question is from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derik De Bruin","Couple of questions, first one is any pull forwards budget flushing that \u2013 given the tariff issues and just concerned on spending and just net of anything different about spending trends in the quarter?","Tom Joyce","Not that we can see Derik. The order rates looked pretty solid. We said when we spoke in December; we said we had a pretty October and November. That remained consistent in December, and I think in general our businesses are probably a little bit less exposed if you will to budget flush, pull forward, given the 70% recurring revenue which is obviously largely made up of consumables and in some part service. But when 70% of your revenue is driven by that recurring revenue, you\u2019re a bit left whether it\u2019s exposed or vulnerable or however you might want to describe it to a bunch of flush or a pull forward at year end. ","So I\u2019m sure there could be a couple of circumstances whether it\u2019s a high-end Leica microscope or a couple of things that Beck has left where somebody might do that. But in terms of materially of it, it doesn\u2019t appear that that had much impact. In terms of tariff, I\u2019m not sure that it had much impact at least as we look at our China numbers throughout the course of the quarter. We\u2019re not a significant target, but right now I wouldn\u2019t say in the cross-hairs, at least if you measured that by virtue of the financial impact. We\u2019ve talked already to about $12 million to $13 million of impact per quarter or about $50 million annually with about $30 million of incremental impact in 2019 versus \u201918.","So, we\u2019re doing some things obviously to try to offset that. But in terms of the impact of that dynamic on orders or pull-forwards, again limited exposure probably to some extent a limited level of even the awareness level at the China end market level. So, nothing to point to specifically at the moment in terms of the impact and orders of volume. ","Derik De Bruin","And just a follow-up question, have you made any decisions in terms of how much debt you\u2019re going to put on the dental spend, and just a question of sort of like at the time of the spend what\u2019s the RemainCo leverage ratio is going to be?","Tom Joyce","I would say, what we do with Beck with forward there\u2019s probably a good proxy here. Our intention is to launch the dental business with a strong balance sheet with an investment grade rating and ability to use their free cash flow to add incrementally to their portfolio through some inorganic moves, some M&A moves. So, I think our history is probably a good proxy for what we would do going forward. And I think we would do that in a way that also leaves us in perfect shape from a RemainCo perspective.","Obviously we start with a great position here in the beginning of 2019. It\u2019s hard to imagine being in a better shape, but I don\u2019t think that dental given it\u2019s a scale will ultimately impact us in terms of RemainCo being set up to win from a capital deployment perspective. ","Matt McGrew","Derik may be the simple way to think about it is. We\u2019re at two times, two turns today. If we did the spin today we\u2019d likely do dental at two-turns. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw","Actually maybe we\u2019ll just jump off from the conversation there about dental and the spend which is to a couple of more questions around the assumption there. I guess first off any change to the thought process on timing. I think we all remember before that you guys were able to execute a little faster than initially planned. And as you think about the plan for dental for this year, did you anticipate any impact channel inventory fluctuations, and then maybe last around dental is, as you think about the trajectory of margins there, you clearly put a lot of capital to work driving accelerated commercial investments. How do you think about that line in \u201919?","Tom Joyce","Talk first about the spend; we\u2019ve said all along we expected it to be in the second half of this year. That is still our expectation right now. I think about it at the [inaudible] and I would probably say it\u2019s \u2013 we did four to kind of right at the mid-point. I think dental is more or like probably, I would call it mid-to-late in the second half. You know as we said when we announced, we want to continue to see this market stability. We are encouraged by the fourth quarter performance clearly and deposit sell-out data, but I\u2019d like to see a bit more of that. ","And we need to obviously make absolutely certain that the business is ready to stand up on its own and continue to make good progress, and so we\u2019re encouraged by all of that and that\u2019s out just in the last two quarters, we\u2019re really going to have that for much longer than that so we\u2019re making good progress. ","One thing that\u2019s clearly on our mind and you guys have all read about it is, the federal government in Washington has reopened, but the shutdown certainly help our timing for IPOs and spends. You probably read in the news the backlog in SEC filings and text ruling and so on so forth are likely going to create some delays. So I think if you put all those things together we\u2019ll continue to make progress. But we need to be aware of some of those factors. ","In terms of the channel inventories and your question about that and being influx, we worked really hard over the last couple of years to ensure that we built sustainable processes in partnership with our channel customers, our channel partners to ensure that we have great visibility and transparency around those channel inventories. We talked a lot about that over the last couple of years and have been key to ensuring that we have those channel inventories in good shape for all of our benefit, for both the benefit of our customers as well as ourselves is to make sure that we good transparency and visibility. And I think we\u2019ve established that and a good dialog month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter with our channel partners. ","So, I feel good about the stability of those. There is obviously always some variability with sell-out at category-by-category, but as a general rule I think our processes are much better as are the processes in the channel. Finally in terms of margins and commercial execution, again we\u2019ve done a number of things here that we feel good about in terms of driving performance. First of all the cost structure is in much better shape that it was three to four years ago. You\u2019ve heard me talk about consolidating from 10 up close to 3 and probably now north of 30% reduction in manufacturing and back office facility. ","So the cost structure is in better shape, but we\u2019re continuing to invest significantly in new product innovation. That will normalize a bit as we go forward, and I think you combine that with the impact in terms of continued topline improvements and that leads us to really continuing to be very positive about our long term growth and margin opportunities and the platform. ","So, I think we expect to see some modest growth and core OMX here in the first quarter. But we also expect that to continue to improve throughout the course of the year. ","Steve Beuchaw","Got it, really helpful, and then just one quick follow-up. You\u2019ve flanged a couple of times and it\u2019s very true that the business has transformed significantly over the last couple of years, faster growth, some changes inorganically that have been really helpful. And so I have imagine if you feel maybe better now than you did even a couple of years ago about your ability to drive growth for target investments. ","When you think about 2019, maybe we\u2019ll set aside the inorganic, but think about where you can drive organic investments, and what are your top priorities? And then I\u2019ll get back in the queue. ","Tom Joyce","I think we\u2019ve got a number of priorities, but clearly they would be consistent with where we\u2019ve invested really over the last couple of years. We\u2019ve invested significantly in our diagnostic platform organically. I\u2019ve talked about new products that are now having an impact at places like Beckman Diagnostics. We continue the investment rates at Cepheid sustaining those double digit growth rate both in terms of investments and instrumentation, the evolution of the architecture as well as the expansion of the menu. ","In life science as well, we continue to make investments; a number of organic investments, but of course inorganic has played a key role there. And obviously with a back on those investment businesses like Pall that have helped to transform the platform, but even as recently as this past year, with the additions of IDT and LabSite, those inorganic moves are not to be overlooked in terms of their impact on improving the growth rates. ","But water quality and PID are making investments as well. Those new CIJ printers at Videojet that are helping us to drive connectivity and enhancing our service offering to customers is having an impact on sustaining that growth rate at PID and Videojet specifically, and water quality investing in things like the CM130, opening up a whole new market like dialysis testing where water plays a critical role, those are having an impact. ","Now the investment may not be as material there as what might go on say at a new platform at Beckman, but before it has an impact when we roll those things out to the market. So, it\u2019s broad-based but I think within a given platform for an operating company it\u2019s very specific relative to new product innovations that we think can have a material impact on growth rates. ","Operator","Your next question is from Julian Mitchell of Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Welcome to Matt in your new role. Just a first question around environmental and applied, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been touched on yet. Wondered if you could give any update on how you\u2019re seeing all that happens that, particularly in some of the more industrial weighted businesses and also flipping over to Pall, what are your expectations for the microelectronics unit there given the CapEx seems to be coming down?","Tom Joyce","Sure. So let\u2019s start with environmental and applied, just broadly, a very good quarter, really driven by a consistent performance in PID and terrific performance across water quality and specifically at Hach. I think those businesses are tracking quite well. They are to your question, each of those businesses, including Pall; represent some of the limited industrial exposure that we have. I mentioned to Scott on earlier question that we\u2019re not necessarily a terrific proxy in terms of the industrial side with about probably less than 10% of the portfolio being at Pall Industrial and Hach Industrial and PID Industrial. And so our sense is, we could see some moderation there in 2019, but in general the underlying trends remain pretty solid. ","So, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re necessarily making any kind of macro call here. But given where we are in the cycle, it wouldn\u2019t be unheard of that we\u2019d see those limited pockets of industrial exposure perhaps soften up a little bit. You know so far so good, Pall Industrial, for example, fourth quarter we\u2019re up high single digits and orders were in a similar range two years stack. Hach Industrial pretty good number, PID numbers, pretty solid. So we\u2019ll continue to watch that carefully. ","Specific to your question about Pall and the microelectronics market, that has been a phenomenal market for Pall over the last few years since we\u2019ve been in the business, and so I think it still is pretty solid today as we look at those growth rate, but again I do not think it would be unusual given some of what we\u2019re read about in terms of the let\u2019s just call it the consumer electronics market and similarly what you\u2019ve read about some of the impacts in China to see a little bit of a moderation there. ","It\u2019s been tremendous so far, but we\u2019re not ignorant of the headlines. ","Matt McGrew","And that\u2019s also a business Julian. That micro-e business is a business; it\u2019s got a lot less consumables that some of our businesses kind of giving it a little bit more of that cyclicality as well. ","Julian Mitchell","And then my second question is around margins, one with the \u2013 kind of a follow-up on the dental question and that should we expect the step up in investment to step back down materially once the spin happens. So you will see in the first 12 months of dental as a standalone company, maybe a decent margin tailwind from that? And then some wide, if we think about the core margins, as you said they were down slightly in Q4, do we expect those to rebound in the first quarter, maybe some of our investment spend firm wise cools off.","Tom Joyce","Well on the dental question, you think that there would be a combination of factors that would impact continued improvement in what you see in dental margins. Some of that would be some moderation in the investment spend around new products, because again as I mentioned, we try to be very focused on continuing to set that business up to grow, not only in terms of the investments we\u2019ve made in our digital platforms because of the importance of digital dentistry going forward, but certainly the investments that we\u2019re making in the Clear Aligner business. ","So, some of those may moderate slightly. In the cases of Clear Aligners those actually would probably be sustained. So a bit of a mix there. But again I think in general, in terms of the value creation opportunities of the dental platform, continued improvement in growth and profitability we feel good about those trajectories. ","And then in terms of core margins more broadly, I think there\u2019s an impact here as Matt mentioned earlier around FX and tariffs here in the first quarter. As Matt mentioned probably $0.05 to $0.06, and so those will tail walk, we\u2019ll see better margin performance the deeper we get in to the year, but we\u2019d start out in the most challenging part of the calendar for certain. ","Operator","Your next question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen.","Doug Schenkel","So first a question on growth investments and gross margin, when I think of opportunistic growth investments and the impact on the income statement, I typically look to the R&D and SG&A lines. That said, it looks like there was some impact at the Cogs line this quarter. Is that right and if so can you provide a little bit of detail on what you did and what you expect the returns to be this year? I\u2019m at a high level trying to get a handle on how gross margin was impacted by these investments versus things like FX and tariffs. So that\u2019s another component of the question as well. ","Matt McGrew","Sure Doug. So I think some of the things that we kind of have done is when you think about some kind of cost pull-forwards if you will, specifically around maybe some supply chain related things etcetera like that. I think we saw some of that probably most pronounced in diagnostics, specifically at Beckman Diagnostics. And then also if you think about some of the new product ramps, kind of capacity if you will with Spark at dental and some of our other new product accelerations where you kind of building up for that first time to the degree that we\u2019re able to kind of pull some of that forward here from 2019 and get some of that worked out a little bit earlier to kind of have a more impactful launch and timing some of that with the sales and marketing as well. So you\u2019re kind of holistically planning to pull forward and get a launch out a little quicker. So I think you\u2019ll see a little bit of both that R&D, sales and marketing and those items that impact cost. ","Tom Joyce","I think Doug also, its\u2019 important to think about the situation in the fourth quarter, where again as the quarter progressed we\u2019re seeing the continued good performance on the topline and so we look broadly where there are those opportunities to take advantage of growth investments, and that is one of those fortunate circumstances, it doesn\u2019t happen every quarter obviously, but you look to take advantage of those things because it benefits you both on the short term and in the long term basis and we are clearly not holding back. ","Doug Schenkel","That\u2019s super helpful, and then just a couple of small, unimportant, quick follow-up sun shine. I know that this may not apply to you as much as some other folks, but I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019ve had any success passing along price the offset tariffs in China, and then at a higher level I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019d be willing to share what the growth rate for China is that you\u2019ve embedded in to 2019 guidance? ","Tom Joyce","I would say price broadly defined is achieved across our portfolio largely on the consumables side. It\u2019s a little bit more challenging given the competitive sets in our businesses on the equipment side. So we generally get it on consumables and that\u2019s both true probably broadly and in China. I would not necessarily associate what we\u2019re getting in terms of price which has been very consistent with inability to have us on specific to the tariffs. The tariffs obviously are coming in other commodities than that which impacts our consumables business. So we\u2019re certainly not having a specific conversation with customers about that. But our in general we\u2019re trying to get price on a global basis, and in general we\u2019re on the consumable side. ","And then in terms of growth rates, you\u2019ve heard me mention already today about the consistency of our performance in China in terms of what our expectations are for this year. We embedded an assumption that China would continue to be a high single digit kind of growth rate and could very well be right up there at double-digit growth rate, but I think high single is probably the right way to think about it.

Before we get in to the details of the quarter, I\u2019d like to touch briefly on the announcement we made this morning regarding our CFO transition plan. As I\u2019m sure many of you saw, we announced that Matt McGrew, our current Group CFO of our diagnostics and dental platforms will succeed Dan Comas as Chief Financial Officer of Danaher on January 1 of 2019.","Dan will continue on as an Executive Vice President and a member of the office of the Chief Executive post January 1, 2019, as he begins a gradual transition to retirement. Dan, it goes without saying that it has been and will continue to be a privilege working with you.","For the past 27 years, all of us at Danaher have valued your outstanding financial stewardship, thoughtful guidance and longtime friendship. Danaher would not be where it is today without your leadership, strategic vision, and humility. We are also very pleased that you\u2019ll continue to work with us post-2018 to ensure a seamless CFO transition and provide a strategic counsel we value so highly. ","Many of you know Matt McGrew from his time as Vice President of Investor Relations. But Matt has had a number of important roles during his past 14 years with Danaher. Matt is uniquely qualified to take on the positon of CFO, as he will be able to leverage his extensive Danaher experience in internal audit, M&A, investor relations and as Group CFO with operational experience across four of our five platforms. ","Throughout his tenure with Danaher, Matt has consistently demonstrated superior leadership and played an integral role in the company\u2019s growth both organically and inorganically. We look forward to helping Matt transition to this important role with Dan\u2019s guidance and strategic counsel. ","With that lets\u2019 get to our results. We are very pleased with our strong fourth quarter performance, as the team delivered 5.5% core revenue growth, solid margin expansion and double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. These results capped a solid year for Danaher and we\u2019re very encouraged by the momentum we built throughout 2017. ","2017 was a great example of how we run the Danaher playbook. We improved gross margins to nearly 56%, lowered G&A, increased our investments in sales and marketing and R&D to drive accelerating core growth, all while delivering 70 basis points of core operating margin expansion. This operating model continues to demonstrate how we build a better, stronger Danaher. ","For the full year, our differentiated portfolio, organic growth investments and good commercial execution helped drive 3.5% core revenue growth, including mid-single digit growth in three out of our four reporting segments. Our total annual revenues are now nearly $18.5 billion. We generated $2.9 billion of free cash flow in 2017, resulting in mid-teens growth year-on-year that helps position us for more significant capital deployment in 2018.","Our free cash-to-net income conversion ratio was 117%, and 2017 represents the 26th consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income. From an M&A perspective, we deployed nearly $400 million of capital in 2017 on 10 strategic bolt-on acquisitions, each of which will help enhance their respective platforms. We also remain encouraged by the great performance at our most recently acquired larger businesses, Cepheid, Phenomenex, PALL and Nobel Biocare. ","Turning now to the fourth quarter, sales grew 11% to $5.1 billion, as the impact of currency translation increased revenue by 3% and acquisitions increased revenues by 2.5%. Core revenue increased 5.5%, led by four of our five platforms that grew between 5.5% and 7.5%. ","Geographically high growth markets grew high single digits with China and India continuing to lead the way. In developed markets, we saw acceleration as both the US and Western Europe were up mid-single digits. ","Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 55.8%, an increase of 130 basis points, while core operating margin expanded 105 basis points led by our life sciences and diagnostics platforms. These margin results are a testament to our teams\u2019 consistent execution using the tools of the Danaher business system. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.19, bringing full year adjusted EPS to $4.03 both representing double digit growth year-on-year.","Now let\u2019s take a more detailed look at fourth quarter results across the portfolio. In life sciences, reported revenue was up 12% and core revenue grew 7.5%, which marks the platforms highest quarterly core growth rate in over four years. Life sciences operating profit margin was 20%, with both core and reported operating margins increasing over 300 basis points. This increase was broad based across the platform driven primarily by outstanding DBS execution, new product innovations and better than expected topline performance. ","Beckman Life Sciences delivered high single digit core revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, led by ongoing strong performance in our Flow Cytometry and particle counting businesses. We believe the Beckman team continues to take market share driven by improved commercial execution and new product innovations. ","Over the past three years, Beckman has refreshed its portfolio launching approximately 20 new products. Several of these new products address higher growth areas such as biologic and genomic work flows, setting the business up well for continued strong performance. ","Leica Microsystem\u2019s core revenue was up low single digits, led by growth in Western Europe and China, primarily in the medical and research end markets. Core revenue at Sciex increased at a mid-single digit rate, led by continued strength in the food, environmental and pharmaceutical end markets. In addition, Phenomenex had a very good quarter, growing core revenue high single digits as both Sciex and Phenomenex are starting to leverage each other\u2019s go-to-market capabilities. ","At Pall, core revenue grew nearly 10%, its best quarterly growth rate since we acquired the business as our microelectronics and single use technologies businesses continued to perform very well. In addition, biopharma and process and industrial finished the year on a strong note, as these businesses rebounded nicely from the hurricane disruptions that impacted third quarter results. ","In October, our life sciences platform successfully closed the acquisition of IDBS, a software informatics leader in the life science space. IDBS\u2019s software provides a data management platform enabling its research customers to better capture, manage and report on scientific insights. This platform in combination with our life sciences instrumentation will enable researches to accelerate their innovation efforts helping to make better and faster scientific decisions. ","Moving now to diagnostics, reported revenues increased 13.5% and core revenue increased 6%. Core operating margin grew by 105 basis points and reported operating margin increased 690 basis points to 19.5%. At Beckman Coulter, core revenue grew at low single digit rate led by solid growth in our immunoassay, urinalysis and clinical chemistry product lines. Regionally the growth was driven by China and Latin America. ","At Radiometer, core revenue increased mid-single digits in the quarter, as both our blood gas and AQT product lines continued to perform well. Leica Biosystems delivered high single digit core revenue growth, led by increased demand in both our advanced staining and core histology product lines. Growth was broad based across most regions, with particular strength in North America and Western Europe. ","Turning to Cepheid, the team had an outstanding quarter. Core revenue increased greater than 25% driven by growth in all major product lines and geographies. For the full year 2017, Cepheid\u2019s core revenue grew approximately 20%, which is almost double the expected rate from when we announced the acquisition. This outperformance was driven by a combination of strong commercial execution, test menu expansion and an ever increasing installed base of instruments. ","Overall it was a tremendous first year at Cepheid, with DBS helping to deliver improvements across the company. Since we acquired the business last November, Cepheid has achieved 400 basis points of gross margin expansion, increased operating margins from just above breakeven in to the mid-teens and improved on-time delivery by over 1500 basis points. ","The team has also meaningfully embraced two key commercial DBS growth tools, transformative marketing and funnel management. These tools have helped Cepheid expand its market visibility, generate more potential leads and increase the number of new customers they are serving. As a result, we believe Cepheid continues to expand its leading market position and gain market share. ","Turning to our dental segment, reported revenue increased 2.5% and core revenue was down slightly. Dental operating profit margin was 13.1% as both core and reported operating margins declined. By product line, performance was in line with our expectations. Growth in our specialty consumables businesses, implants and orthodontics was offset by declines in equipment and traditional consumables. ","As expected the declines in traditional consumable growth rate has started to moderate, however, our equipment business was negatively impacted by the recent realignment of certain distributor and manufacture relationships. We anticipate these difficult market conditions to persist through the first half of 2018. ","We continue to be pleased with the performance in our specialty consumables businesses. Nobel Biocare in particular had a great quarter, growing core revenue high single digits driven by North America and China. December marked the three-year anniversary of the Nobel acquisition, and they\u2019ve made tremendous progress. ","Not only has the team meaningfully improved operating margins, but has also increased R&D spend by approximately 20%, launched more than 25 new products and increased their sales force by 15% over the past two years. These growth initiatives along with the execution of DBS tools to streamline sales from our proxies and increase new customer starts has helped Nobel pose mid-single digit core growth in each of the last two years. ","Moving now to our environmental and applied solutions segment, reported revenue grew 12.5% with core revenue up 6%. Core operating margin declined by 50 basis points and reported operating margin decreased to 23.1%, driven primarily by increased productivity initiatives and a deafening spend within our water quality platform. ","In product identification, core revenue increased at a mid-single digit rate, led by strong demand from marking and coating equipment and related consumables. The out-growth in our packaging and color solutions offerings was attributed to increased demand in North America and Western Europe. Videojet core revenue increased high single digits in the quarter, with broad based growth across most major product lines and geographies. The fourth quarter capped off another great year for Videojet as the business continued to compound returns and gain market share. ","Over the past five years, Videojet has averaged mid-single digit core revenue growth, continued to expand margins and also completed a number of strategic Bolton acquisitions. One of those acquisitions Laetus had its best quarter of core revenue growth since we acquired the business in 2015. As a reminder Laetus is a leading supplier of track and trade inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants. ","With the help of DBS tools Laetus has generated greater market awareness and demand within the pharmaceutical tracking vertical and we believe is well positioned for growth going forward. In our packaging and color solutions businesses, core revenue at Esko was up mid-single digits, while X-Rite was up low-single digits. ","Finally, turning to our quality, core revenue growth for the platform at a mid-single digit rate. Hach had its best quarter of the year, with core revenue growing mid-single digits. This growth was drive by solid performance across our core municipal and industrial end markets, with strength in Western Europe and China. ","Hach also continued its healthy cadence of Bolton acquisitions, closing two deals in the quarter, AppliTek and Kipp & Zonen. AppliTek is a leading provider of wet chemistry process analyzers and integrated systems that will help Hach offer a broader suite of parameters to its core industrial and municipal customers. Kipp & Zonen specializes in making instrumentation that\u2019s relied upon by meteorologist through applications such as climate research, water resource management and materials testing. ","Kipp & Zonen will join Hach\u2019s environmental business and nicely complement our existing offerings, providing us an opportunity to deliver enhanced customer solutions. We are excited to welcome both teams to Danaher. ","At Chemtreat, core revenue grew at a low single digit rate, driven by increases in the food, steel and oil and gas end markets, primarily in North America. It\u2019s worth noting that 2017 marks Chemtreat\u2019s 50th consecutive year of revenue growth, a tremendous accomplishment and a testament to the team\u2019s commitment to continue its improvement and their best-in-class commercial execution. ","Lastly, Trojan had a great quarter delivering double digit core growth, driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American municipal market. Trojan continues to execute very well significantly improving customer win rates to help drive share gains relative to its markets. ","So to wrap up, we\u2019re very pleased with our fourth quarter results, capping off a good year for Danaher and helping to build momentum as we start 2018. In 2017, the team delivered double digit adjusted EPS growth; meaningful margin improvement and cash flow generation and saw core revenue growth accelerate through the year. ","We also executed on a number of strategic Bolton acquisitions, continued to focus on integration of our recent larger deals and we now have a balance sheet that positions us well for a more significant capital deployment in 2018. ","As we look ahead, we believe that the strength of our portfolio, combined with the power of the Danaher business system provide us with the foundation to achieve long term shareholder value creation. We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $0.90 and $0.93, which assumer core growth of 3.5% to 4%. ","We continue to expect full year 2018 core revenue growth of 3.5% to 4% and adjusted diluted net EPS to be in the range of $4.25 and $4.35. ","Matt Gugino","Thanks Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Tracey, we are now ready for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Scott Davis with Melius Research. ","Scott Davis","Let\u2019s step back just a bit, the step up in core growth was pretty exceptional really, but can you walk us around the world, I wasn\u2019t clear where the positive surprises came from globally. By business it was clear, but let\u2019s clear globally. ","Tom Joyce ","Scott it was really very positive on a global basis. Of course I think we all know from a macro perspective we\u2019re in a unique time, right, we\u2019re in a time of globally synchronous economic expansion. And I think in many respects our businesses are well positioned to take advantage of that growth rate on a global basis across all the many markets in which we participate. ","What we saw in the fourth quarter was continued good performance in the high growth markets, with exceptional growth in China, in India, as we\u2019d seen consistently throughout the course of the year, some improving performance in places like Latin America and Russia, and frankly still some softness in places like the Middle East. ","But I think what was maybe a bit more noteworthy than the continued good performance in the high growth markets was the incremental strength that we saw in the developed markets. In the US and in Europe both of those markets up mid-single digits is I think where the real difference is on a global basis.","Now clearly our businesses were well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in each of those markets. We saw obviously particular strength in our life science businesses and our diagnostic businesses, up north of 7% and 6% respectively, improved performance sequentially in our water quality business which we expected, and consistent performance in product identification. ","So I think overall pretty well in line with what\u2019s happening in the macro from a geographic perspective, but I think clearly four to five platforms incredibly well positioned relative to those macro drivers. ","Scott Davis","So that just begs the natural question of when you think about your guidance 3.5% to 4%. That first half of the year you\u2019ve got reasonably easy comps and you made positive comments about the global macro. Is there something you\u2019ve seen January that leads to be a little bit more conservative or is this just the standard Danaher, it\u2019s still early in the year, let\u2019s wait and see before we raise that guidance. ","Tom Joyce ","I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s anything in particular that we\u2019ve seen on a near-term basis Scott. I think it\u2019s much more to the latter point you made, which is it\u2019s very early in the year. We are encouraged by obviously the finish we saw. What little we\u2019ve seen of January to this point gives us encouragement as well. And I think it\u2019s just early at this point and obviously we\u2019ll be updating throughout the course of the year. But I think for now we feel very good about the guidance that we have and we\u2019ll watch carefully as this quarter unfolds. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. ","Tycho Peterson","Question on in terms of the delta relative to our model life science certainly stood out. You called out Beckman life science, Phenomenex. Can you quantify what Pall life sciences was up and then was there any catchup affect from 3Q there that you can quantify and any budget flush dynamic that you\u2019re willing to call out. ","Tom Joyce ","So our best stance was the life science was up 7.5%, there was probably about a point benefit, kind of a hurricane recovery, so call it ex hurricane recovery more like 6.5%. That was also followed through with very strong orders. We were I think as we went into the beginning in January slightly worried that there were some budget flush, but our January orders have remained very strong. That\u2019s not only life science but more broadly. ","Tycho Peterson","And then a question on Cepheid, obviously this has done incredibly well. I\u2019m just wondering if you can provide a little bit more color on how much of this is coming from new cartridge launches versus flu trends versus [HVDC][ph] and some of these other markets.","Tom Joyce ","We saw a really broad based strong performance from Cepheid. There were a number of factors that I think contributed to that. Not the least of which certainly was enhanced commercial execution. One of the things we tracked at Cepheid is our installed base and our new customer addition, and since we\u2019ve acquired the business, new customer additions are plus 15% since we acquired the business. ","I think menu is certainly a contributor with Xpress flu, with Flu\/RSV, with strep test all introduced in 2017, all making a difference. Yes, continued strength in the hybrid in developing countries but very good strength in the developed markets as well. Clearly we are in the midst of at least certainly from a patient perspective a very challenging flu season. ","And yes that does drive growth at Cepheid. But I think if you step back and you look at the performance in the fourth quarter, that performance is driven far beyond the early strength of the flu season and really represents I think a number of both commercial execution enhancement and menu expansions that have driven growth in the installed base. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken","Maybe on dental right, some of the underlying trends particularly in the recently acquired business and Nobel seems better, but obviously some of the noise still exist with the channel and maybe on sort of basic consumables. I guess based on what you\u2019ve seen kind of closing the year to start of the year. I mean in terms of cadence and in terms of your thoughts on how some of the changes you\u2019ve made over time are starting to playout and the pieces where you\u2019ve been able to influence it versus maybe some of the market factors you don\u2019t have control on. And what\u2019s your sort of updated thoughts on how that\u2019s gone and in terms of maybe some of the small wins it seems like you\u2019re getting in pieces like Nobel. ","Tom Joyce ","The fourth quarter played out pretty much in line with what we expected. I think we all know that 2017 was clearly a difficult year in the industry. But there are a number of things that actually are quite encouraging for us. Starting with especially consumables business, I mentioned in my comments earlier the terrific performance that we\u2019ve seen in Nobel. We\u2019ve seen very consistent and good performance from Ormco as well. ","And those two businesses especially consumables businesses represent half our dental segment. Mid-single digit growth across that group of businesses combined in the fourth quarter with Nobel being high single digits, and there\u2019s no question I think those are some pretty attractive markets to participate in. ","Could the strength there be taken a little bit of wallet share from some of the more traditional consumables, maybe a little bit tough to pinpoint on that, but in general that half of our segment we were quite encouraged by? High growth markets have continued to perform very well, high single digit growth in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017.","And then operational execution, you know we\u2019ve talked in the past and I think we\u2019ve just finished up our second year of talking about our dental platform, approaching the dental platform as a new acquisition. And we\u2019ve done a number of things to right size the cost structure while we invest in over the last couple of years. ","We consolidated operating companies from 10 down to four, reduced the manufacturing and back office sites by over nearly a third. Gross margins are up a 100 basis points as a result of a number of those changes and yet we\u2019re still reinvesting. R&D up a 100 basis points as a percent of sales, up 20% in 2017 year-on-year, a whole bunch of new products, 25 new products as I mentioned in Nobel. ","So this is a $3 billion platform we have today and admittedly that doesn\u2019t represent an enormous percentage of Danaher and clearly where we\u2019ve seen the weakness in about half of that platform isn\u2019t even a smaller percentage of the overall platform. But these are strong brands and great franchises. Good secular trends around digital dentistry and so on and over all we feel good about the operational improvements and the progress we\u2019re making and we continue to drive to create long term value out of that platform. ","Ross Muken","That\u2019s super helpful and maybe just on the capital allocation front. So you guys free cash continues to be a really tremendous 100% plus of net income. I guess as you\u2019re staring out over the balance of the year, it looks like the leverage levels are going to get back because of manageable place. How are you balancing kind of your balance sheet capacity versus public market multiples, looks like you were a little bit busy on the tuck-in side in the last quarter or two. So help us just think through kind of how that environment looks like for you right now?","Tom Joyce ","We feel very good about where we sit today Ross. The 10 acquisitions that we did in the past year were strategic enhancements to a number of our platforms, and the spend that we executed during the course of the year was certainly within the range of the spend that we anticipated during the course of the year, particularly in light of the capital deployment that had preceded that over the couple of years of \u201915 and \u201916.","As we enter 2018, as I mentioned, I think the balance sheet\u2019s in great shape. It positions us now to take advantage of opportunities as they come along. Optimally we would deploy that capital at or above our free cash flow and for deals that really are strategically important to anyone of our platforms today, we\u2019d be willing to stretch that a bit. ","So we feel great about how we enter the year. We\u2019ve seen activity pick up a little bit. Second half of the year you saw a little bit more activity in those boltons in the first half of the year, and I think that bodes well for how things might open up here with people feeling good about their own valuations clearly as sellers. ","But I think it\u2019s also probably worth noting that now the tax reform has been determined, if you will. That pays a level of uncertainty out of the market, and anytime you eliminate uncertainty, confidence grows and that may help things out as well. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Winoker with UBS. ","Steven Winoker","Dan could you maybe give a little more color on the puts and takes around the gross margin, 130 basis points. Obviously you guys are less sensitive in your cost structure to material inflation than a lot of other companies. But maybe just talk about the price productivity mix impact versus other headwinds. ","Dan Comas","You\u2019re right. I mean all up a big part of the driver is the continued expansion of gross margins at Pall. It\u2019s obviously been a multi-year effort. The big step-up, the 400 basis points step up in gross margin at Cepheid is year-on-year are probably the two biggest drivers. We had a 55% gross margin; we just don\u2019t have that much impact from sort of commodities and direct labor inflation. It\u2019s a little bit of a headwind right now, but at t hose levels it\u2019s relatively modest. And clearly when you\u2019re putting together 5.5% core growth, you get very good fall through including on the gross margin side. ","Steven Winoker","And so you expect that to continue?","Dan Comas","Yes, probably not at the \u2013 we\u2019re not going to get another 400 basis points step up at Cepheid next year in gross margin, but I think we\u2019re very well positioned from gross margin. And I think as we saw on the operating margin side, as many of you\u2019ll remember, we had negative OMX, core OMX in the first quarter of this year and we still ended up at the high end of our range of 50 to 75 basis points of core margin expansion. I feel very good about how we are set up in terms of core margin falling in to \u201918 including some of the actions we took in the latter part of \u201917. ","Steven Winoker","And then maybe just talk through a little more of the margin dynamics gotten it down 50 basis points at Environmental & Applied Solutions. ","Dan Comas","Sure, that was primarily a couple of different factors, Trojan being very strong, a little bit of a negative mix. But the water business particularly Hach came to us kind of early in the fourth quarter with some opportunities both on the growth side and on the cost side to take some actions. It was clear we were having a very good quarter. We let them execute upon those actions both top and bottom line. You did see their growth accelerate. I just saw it for January they had a very strong start to the year. So I think some of their growth investments are still paying off pretty quickly here. ","So I\u2019m not concerned. A fair amount of it was kind of orchestrated through the course, given the strength we had. And again we\u2019re not going to have the uplift we have in that segment that we will continue to have in diagnostics and dental. But I think you\u2019ll see more normalized margin improvement across those businesses. ","And [PID] had a very good quarter in terms of year, in terms of margins. And I think you\u2019ll see water sort of back on track here starting earlier this year. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll next go to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. ","Jeff Sprague","Just a couple of things, just back to tax reform, you guys obviously do a fair amount of boltons and just looking at this provision on deals that are structured as asset deals where you can get immediate expensing of the fixed assets of the target company. I just wondered if you could give us a little context from a Danaher standpoint. On a lot of your bolton deals, typically asset deals and you have the ability to structure them that way, and kind of change the economic lunge you\u2019re looking through when you look at these properties. ","Tom Joyce ","Jeff there\u2019s always been an advantage to acquire the assets as oppose to the stock of an entity, perhaps even more so now. I would say that we\u2019re sort of incrementally encouraged versus where we were two months ago generally wrapped around tax reform. We said in December we thought our rate would be 21%. I think it will be probably close to 20% to 21% this year. ","We talked about a toll tax being probably in the magnitude of 100 million a year for the next five years. We now think it\u2019s going to be more like 50 million to 60 million. So it\u2019s still like sort of incrementally, and finally to your point, as often been the case, often with acquisitions particularly asset acquisitions there is an opportunity to do even more tax work to potentially lower that ETR even more overtime. ","Jeff Sprague","And then on the investment spend in Environmental and Applied, just wondering is that kind of traditional or restructuring or you\u2019re doing something further drive growth. Obviously the tempo when the business seems like its quite strong, I guess there\u2019s always some belt tightening to do around the edges. But is this more growth oriented or is it more restructuring oriented?","Tom Joyce ","It\u2019s little bit of both, more growth oriented, Hach adding both on the R&D side and the feet on the street side. We\u2019re seeing very good numbers on the municipal and the industrial side, they actually got better through the year and we gave some latitude to ramp it up even more in Q4. ","Jeff Sprague","And then finally just on the distributor realignment in dental. Are we just now kind of working through the comparisons associated with the growth realignment that happened in the last several months or so, six months or so, maybe it\u2019s longer than that? And so we\u2019re just kind of working through the annualization of these dynamics or is there still somethings shifting around in the business?","Tom Joyce ","Jeff those relationships changed in a formal way at the beginning last year. So we\u2019re about four or five months in two what is a shift in largely exclusive arrangements that involved our relationship with Henry Schein and Dentsply Sirona\u2019s relationship with Patterson. Essentially changing places in terms of a number of equipment related product line particularly around imaging. ","When that sort of thing happens, there\u2019s a series of adjustments that need to be made. Some of that comes in the form of inventory, some of that comes in the form of actually sell-out that is associated with sales team, learnings new products, shifting incentives etcetera which can further, along with the inventory adjustment have an impact on sell-in. ","So it\u2019s a series of factors that come together that does take a number of months to work its way through the system. At the end of the day the market becomes a little more of a level playing field when you have less exclusive arrangements between manufacturers and distributors. We believe that it will still take better part of the first half of this year for those adjustments to work their way through the system. ","In the meantime, we are encouraged by seeing the traditional consumable side, which has been challenged as well moderate a bit in the fourth quarter. We take that altogether and we still think our dental business is likely to be flattish in the first half of this year with the specially tool of business is continuing to perform quite well, the high growth markets continue to perform quite well and much of the operational improvement that we\u2019re putting in place continuing to improve profitability. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Derik De Bruin","Just got a couple, one quick one and then one follow-up. So net interest expense, interest expense, so what\u2019s the guide for \u201918 could you remind me?","Dan Comas","145 million.","Derik De Bruin","And could you talk a little bit about pharma demand. I mean we\u2019re starting to see some big companies talking about increasing their capital allocations and spending. Could you sort of talk about what you sort of see in the pharma space and sort of order pick-ups in that area on the equipment side or what\u2019s on the bio process side? I\u2019m wondering if some of the stuff you\u2019re seeing directly weighted to some of the commentary that we\u2019re hearing on them stepping up on those spend. ","Tom Joyce ","We feel good about the overall pharma market today, not just in bio-processing, in biologic demand pharma demand, but across more molecules as well. And we would point to the continued good performance in our equipment businesses at Sciex, at Beckman Life Science, at Phenomenex, at Leica Microsystem. Each of those businesses on the equipment side continuing to perform very well, and not all of those businesses have a significant exposure to the biologic side of life science or certainly pharma as we do say at Pall, where by the way we saw some improved performance clearly in the fourth quarter, obviously not all a function of the recovery from the third quarter hurricane disruptions but in fact we saw good order rate trends around biologic and small molecules, good order rate trend around our single use technologies as well. So on balance I would say, the overall pharma market, biologics and small molecules combined continues to be in pretty good shape. ","Derik De Bruin","And the diagnostics side, any possible CapEx or any PAMA blow back?","Tom Joyce ","Not really. Derik, again early relative to PAMA those rates as you know are just going in to place. As I mentioned previously, our exposure there is relatively modest with 60%of our volume outside the United States, this being only a US impact and limited to Medicare reimbursements for outpatient spending which again further mitigates the impact on us. ","It\u2019s certainly reasonable to think that customers will leverage the reduction and reimbursement associated with PAMA more broadly, but then again, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily anything new. I think anytime there are competitive dynamics in a market like the diagnostics market certainly in the central lab there\u2019s going to be some pricing pressure, PAMA will create a little bit of an additional rationale for that. But on a fact basis the exposure there, again US only hospital outpatient and Medicare reimbursement would suggest it\u2019s relatively modest. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. ","Steve Beuchaw","First question is a geographic focused question, because you talked a fair amount here on this call about the developed markets. I wonder if you could spend just a minute or two on China as it didn\u2019t get as much attention on the call. Where in China do you think that we have a particularly good \u201918; how are things evolving there; where in China, given some of the liquidity news items out there should we maybe budget in, something that is a little bit moderate relative to \u201917.","Tom Joyce ","Steve, China has been an important growth driver for us for a number of years. Today we do, I think in excess of $2 billion of revenue in China. We\u2019ve strong positions across each of the platforms and there are extraordinary secular market drivers in China that support our water quality platform with the environmental concerns in China. Product ID even with the growth of the middle class and consumer package goods, diagnostics and life science both receiving significant amount of investment from the Chinese government. And as I\u2019ve mentioned a number of times, our dental business continues to grow high single digits and in certain quarters double digits pretty consistently in China. ","So I think if you step back, it\u2019s a boy this is a portfolio that really lines up well with a number of key growth drivers in the Chinese market. In terms of any changes, you have the impact of a relatively new five year plan in China. Again I think that\u2019s going to be supportive broadly across most of our platforms, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a change there. ","So in general we feel pretty good about continuing contributions from the Chinese market in each one of the platforms. ","Dan Comas","One of the things that was encouraging in China was we were up double digit for the year and we were basically 10%-11% every quarter through 2017. So it feels like we have pretty good momentum. It\u2019s a bigger base now for that kick down a point or two share, but things are still feeling pretty good over there. ","Steve Beuchaw","Good to hear. One more of a big picture question for Tom, it\u2019s hard not to look at the improvement of organic growth to your core growth in the last couple of quarter, and here the really encouraging commentary on new product flow and execution across the businesses and think, hey vow these guys are seeing some step up in R&D, step up in commercial investment, really pay-off. ","It will be helpful just to hear what you\u2019ve learned and how this success, the way I perceive it as a success downstream of an investment effort. How is that changing your thinking if at all about the medium or long term, appropriate level of spend on R&D and sales and marketing in the organization. ","Tom Joyce ","Well clearly this has been an evolution for us. Part of that evolution Steve is the evolution of the portfolio. Many of the changes that we\u2019ve made in the portfolio over quite a number of years not just in the last two years or so, but really over the last probably better than five years has set up a portfolio that is really aligned to markets that have a great growth drivers. ","I think secondly, we\u2019ve seen an evolution in the Danaher business system, as the tools of DBS have evolved beyond lean in to leadership and most importantly in to growth, and we see the tools of DBS which by the way continued to evolve. Even in 2017, we developed incremental growth tools that are having an impact on each of our businesses from a commercial execution perspective, but also in terms of driving higher rates of innovation. ","And I think finally on innovation, I think it has and will continue to play an increasingly important role in our growth rates. And those investments in R&D have paid off and we can point to a number of those examples in our businesses where we see new products from incrementing their growth rates. I point specifically for example the Videojet whose got probably the most robust new product pipeline in its history today with the 1860 fully censored and wired to the internet through greater levels of customer services, Hach\u2019s launch of the [Claro] system leveraging the internet of things as well.","So I think the portfolio evolution, the evolution of the tools on the Danaher business system, continued investment in R&D to drive higher rates of innovation, and then finally inorganically obviously the deals we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years have been incremental to our growth rates. You clearly look at the impact of Cepheid and Phenomenex our most recent acquisitions, but certainly Pall and Nobel having an impact. And those 10 strategic Bolton acquisitions, each of those have strategic impacts on our businesses and the ability to drive incremental growth over time through what at times is kind of early stage investment that can drive long term innovation related growth. ","So it\u2019s really a combination of things, having learned a lot in the process. Certainly we have, but I think that learning has come really as a function of executing a plan. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll next to Richard Eastman with Baird. ","Richard Eastman","Could we just circle back if you will to the life sciences up margin here in the quarter, and maybe just speak a little bit to Pall, the strength that Pall and the impact of mix on that up margin. I\u2019m curious, Dan you flagged Pall\u2019s gross margin improvement as a big factor in overall margin improvement and expansion. But could you maybe just give us a sense to Pall\u2019s gross margin improvement during and for the full year in calendar \u201917.","Dan Comas","As you know Rick when we purchased the business it was a high-teens [OP][ph] business and we\u2019re up a 1000 basis points since the time of the acquisition, and a big chunk of that has been [indiscernible] in the gross margin. I would say that, but one thing that was encouraging in the quarter, was the gross margin improvement in life science is pretty broad based. And none of the businesses grew mid-single digits. Beck life sciences improved their gross margin and then turned their operating margins; we\u2019re seeing the same thing as Sciex good margin expansion. ","Though I noted Pall the big driver of the life science improvement. It was this broad based particularly to put up that sort of number as I\u2019ve seen it, and clearly the better core growth helps. Though all those businesses are doing a good job expanding the growth margins, leveraging G&A, they are off stepping up their R&D in sales and marketing. So we\u2019re getting those margins step up. Back to Tom\u2019s point about investing and grow while stepping up our growth investment. ","Richard Eastman","Again when you look at the out margin here, for the fourth quarter assuming Pall, both Pall life sciences as well as PI were stepped up and rebounded, how do you look at the gross margin in the fourth quarter here is maybe a new structural level here to grow off and leverage off with core growth going forward for life sciences?","Dan Comas","Rick I\u2019d have to look at them more carefully. As you know there\u2019s some seasonal benefit in the fourth quarter in life science with equipment sales, which were very strong. But I believe we\u2019ve made a lot of structural changes in the cost profile across life science. And I have to look at it specifically kind of going to the next couple of quarters, but this step up is real. ","Richard Eastman","And then just last question follow-up on dental, if we look at the dental, I think Tom you had suggested maybe first half of \u201918 would see flattish revenue. So perhaps a little bit of growth in the back half. But I\u2019m curious when you look at the margin expectation around dental for \u201918, do we have enough restructuring, do we have enough growth investment without a great deal of topline to drive 50 to 100 basis points of margin improvement in \u201918. What does the plan look like given the sales outlook for [dental]?","Tom Joyce ","I think we\u2019ve balanced that pretty well over the last couple of years and we\u2019ll continue to do that in 2018. We\u2019ve applied restructuring dollars to drive enhanced productivity in a number of different areas, but at the same time we\u2019ve invested in R&D and we\u2019ve invested in sales and marketing and I\u2019ve cited a number of those numbers as you may recall.","And so I think it\u2019s a balance, and I think we shook that balance pretty well in \u201916 and \u201917 and I don\u2019t anticipate that we will approach any differently in 2018. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our final question today from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. ","Doug Schenkel","I\u2019m going to start on Pall; you guys had a solid quarter even normalized for hurricane effect. Your comments earlier on order trends is encouraging. Specific to bio production is it safe to say that you\u2019ve seen an improvement in demands or at least normalization subsequent to some of the customer inventory rebalancing dynamics you mentioned earlier in 2017. ","Tom Joyce ","Doug it is safe to say that. It was a solid performance even normalized, the order trends are good and those order trends do point to an improvement in the demand profile, because I think you and others know, we saw a number of customers in that market adjust levels in a couple of cases slow down production during the course of 2017, and I think in the late third quarter and in to certainly the fourth quarter, we saw order trends improve. So we\u2019re encouraged by that. ","Doug Schenkel","And maybe just to close out by going back to something we covered at length earlier in the discussion the topic of 2018 guidance rationale. You were clear in saying that based on what you saw in January you don\u2019t think there was any pull forward of revenue from Q1 in to Q4. And we know you have a history of tending to be prudently conservative with guidance especially earlier in the year. ","And that said, I just want to confirm two other things, one, that current FX rates would seemingly cut out as much as $0.10 to full year EPS relative to on the original guidance at least based on our math that those are not fully reflected in current guidance. And second, that you\u2019ve not fully adjusted guidance for the lower tax rate dynamic that you mentioned in response to an earlier question. ","Tom Joyce ","Doug let me try to answer that. We have a \u2013 it\u2019s been in the 12, 13, 14 years we\u2019ve sort of avoided adjusted December guidance when we get to January. Just feels too early, too quick. I also recognized that January call next year will be Matt McGrew\u2019s first call. So I\u2019m not suddenly looking to sort of change things up here. But you\u2019re right there are some tailwinds out there, whether a Q4 demand, December demand, January numbers, they all point to good numbers. ","We are benefitting from the further weakness of the dollar and we are a little more optimistic on the tax rate. Yes, probably a few offsets there, probably a higher share count, but that offsets are modest. So net-net we are feeling pretty good about where we are, and if those good things continue, we\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities to update you through the year. ","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Gugino for any additional or closing remarks.

We're pleased with our start to 2016 as our team continued to outperform in the face of uncertain and challenging economic conditions. In the quarter, we delivered high-teens earnings growth, healthy operating margin expansion and free cash flow that was up over 50% year on year. The Danaher Business System remains the driving force behind our performance, equipping our team with the tools to strengthen our competitive position, the focus to invest in high-impact growth opportunities and the flexibility to position our businesses for long-term success.","This will be an exciting year as we anticipate the upcoming launch of Fortive Corporation which we expect to spin out of Danaher in the third quarter. Since our last update in January, we've continued to build a highly-experienced leadership team, and have named additional members to Fortive's Board of Directors. The team has also made great progress solidifying Fortive's financial, legal and organizational structures. This separation is a unique opportunity for Danaher and Fortive to optimize our respective portfolios and build long-term shareholder value. We look forward to sharing more information with you at our Investor and Analyst Event in May at Gilbarco Veeder-Root.","Now turning to the details of the quarter. Adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.08, an increase of 18.5% over last year. Sales grew 15% to $5.4 billion and core revenue increased 50 basis points as a number of our businesses were negatively impacted by tough prior-year comparisons and one less selling day.","Clearly the economic environment remains challenging in many verticals and geographies, but we were encouraged by signs of sales and order stabilization through the quarter. Our team's focus on portfolio optimization and diligent execution using DBS helped improve and sustain many of our market-leading positions. Finally, the impact of currency translation eased this quarter but still decreased revenues by 2% while acquisitions increased revenues by 16.5%.","Geographically, the developed markets grew slightly with stability in the U.S. and Europe. High growth markets were up low-single-digits as continued growth in India was offset by declines in Latin America and Russia. In China, our teams are well-positioned to compete in several attractive markets, and delivered mid-single-digit core growth in the quarter.","Gross margin for the first quarter was 53.1%, an increase of 50 basis points from last year. Along with the productivity initiatives undertaken in 2015, our gross margin expansion has enabled us to sustain and expand our growth investments in new product development and sales and marketing. Core operating margin expanded 45 basis points with reported operating margin at 16.4%.","Free cash flow is one of the most important metrics at Danaher as it provides us with the agility to invest in both organic and inorganic growth initiatives across our entire portfolio. We had a strong quarter on this front generating $622 million of free cash flow, a significant increase over last year.","Coming off a historic year of M&A, we closed six bolt-on acquisitions in the first quarter, deploying over $100 million in capital. These deals will strengthen our capabilities across many of our businesses. Both Danaher and Fortive have strong and active funnels and we'll continue to focus on small and mid-sized transactions for both companies through the separation process.","Now let's take a look at our five operating segments, starting with Test & Measurement. Revenues decreased 5.5%, with core revenues down 5%. Core operating margin decreased 135 basis points with reported operating margin coming in at 20.9%. Core revenues for our Instruments platform declined high-single-digits as we continued to face a challenging global market environment. All major geographies saw declines except for China and India.","Fluke core revenues decreased mid-single-digits due to declines in the U.S., Western Europe and Latin America, partially offset by increases in China. While still a difficult environment, we did see some signs of stabilization in certain geographies and industrial end markets during the quarter.","A few weeks ago, Fluke announced the launch of the Fluke 279 FC Thermal Multimeter, the world's first test tool that integrates a full-featured digital multimeter with a thermal camera in one device. This combination enables technicians to check for hot spots on high voltage equipment and analyze problems at a safe distance. By combining these important test tools into one, Fluke is helping our customers troubleshoot electrical issues more quickly, safely and thoroughly.","At Tektronix, core revenue declined low-double-digits as growth in China and India was more than offset by declines in all other major geographies.","The Matco team continued to execute well, delivering high-single-digit core growth in the quarter. Notably, Matco has posted mid-single-digit growth or better for 23 of the last 25 quarters and continues to improve its market position. In February, Matco hosted its annual Tool Expo in Las Vegas. The Expo provides Matco franchisees with an opportunity to see new products, attend training sessions and stock their businesses for the upcoming year. This year, almost three-quarters of Matco's franchisees participated, resulting in record attendance and event-driven sales.","Turning to our Environmental segment, revenues grew 4%, with core revenues up 3.5%. Reported operating margin declined 220 basis points to 17.3%. Core operating margin declined 155 basis points and was negatively impacted by incremental investments, including EMV-related spend at Gilbarco Veeder-Root. We anticipate segment margins to return to more normalized levels in the second quarter.","The Water Quality's platform's core revenues grew slightly as one less selling day and a tough prior year comparison had a negative impact. At Hach, positive momentum in the U.S. municipal market continued but softness in high-growth markets resulted in flat core growth for the quarter. Trojan also saw strong municipal demand globally and delivered another good quarter.","Finally, at ChemTreat, the team grew revenue slightly in the quarter despite headwinds in its industrial and commodity-oriented markets. One of the ways that we continue to augment growth, build our capabilities and better serve our customers is through M&A. Our Water Quality platform has acquired more than 40 businesses since 1996 and continued its healthy cadence of bolt-ons this quarter with Hach's acquisition of Lufft Mess in January. Lufft's long-standing precision sensors \u2013 long-lasting precision sensors, are a key part of weather measuring networks along roads, railways and airports and enable us to deliver value to a wider range of customers around the world. The Hach team does an exceptional job of implementing DBS in newly acquired businesses and this is well underway already at Lufft. DBS lean and growth tools are helping us drive more efficient production, strengthen key account relationships and improve funnel management.","At Gilbarco Veeder-Root, core revenue grew high-single-digits for the third consecutive quarter. EMV-related demand in the U.S. drove double-digit growth in point of sale solutions and dispenser systems, and we believe we continue to gain share on both fronts. Many of our customers are still in the process of upgrading indoor payment systems for last October's credit card liability shift. Additionally, we're well-positioned to benefit from the upcoming outdoor liability shift and the Gilbarco team is already collaborating with a number of customers to phase in outdoor upgrades. You'll hear more about EMV and GVRs other opportunities at our Investor and Analyst Event next month.","Moving now to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Core revenues grew 2.5% with reported revenues up 42% largely due to our recent Pall and MicroScan acquisitions. Core operating margin expanded 205 basis points thanks to the team's solid execution using DBS. Core revenues in our Diagnostics platform increased low-single digits led by healthy demand in high-growth markets. At Beckman Coulter, core revenue increased at a low single digit rate. We saw strong demand for our immunoassay solutions and used our well-established installed base to help drive increased sales in India and China.","Our consumable streams remain solid, and we're seeing healthy utilization rates globally. Radiometer and Leica Biosystems both increased core revenues in the quarter with growth in China and India offset by declines in other high-growth markets. Our team is focused on improving our customers' experience every day and shows that commitment by expanding our product offering through both innovation and adjacent bolt-on acquisitions. Beckman Coulter's first major bolt-on, IRIS closed in 2012 and extended our foot print beyond blood testing into urinalysis. Since then, IRIS has delivered double-digit growth and expanded operating margins over 1,000 basis points. More recently, the acquisition of MicroScan expanded Beckman's already-strong presence in hospital and reference labs into the microbiology space. It has been one year since we closed the deal and we achieved double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Both IRIS and MicroScan are helping us serve our customers better and we believe that adjacent acquisitions combined with our consistent application of DBS will continue to enhance our comprehensive workflow solutions across our Diagnostic businesses.","In our Life Science platform, core revenue was up low-single-digits with growth in both developed and high-growth markets. Leica Microsystems core revenues were up low-single-digits as strong performance in North America and China was offset by declines in Japan and Latin America. At SCIEX, core revenues grew low-single-digits driven by demand in China and the Middle East. We also saw healthy sales growth in certain applied end markets and our service business. The SCIEX team has placed a strong focus on improving our customers' experience by pairing service contracts with instrument sales. This has driven record contract capture rates including over 500 basis points of improvement in year-over-year attachment rates in the first quarter alone. SCIEX is a great example of how we use new products to help our customers' most-critical challenges. In the quarter, we launched the X500R, the first model within our X-series product family which was the SCIEX team's largest-ever development project. The X500R is a robust instrument that was specifically designed to serve customers in food and environmental testing labs, two of the fastest-growing end markets in mass spectrometry. Going forward, we expect this to be a significant contributor to our future growth.","Turning to Pall, we are very pleased with our early progress. This quarter, the Pall team delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth led by double-digit growth in our Life Science business due to demand for our biopharmaceutical solutions including single-use technologies. Our Industrial business was down low-single-digits as we faced challenging market conditions. The team's enthusiastic application of DBS including over 100 Kaizen events since close has led to meaningful process improvements and several product introductions across Pall's Life Sciences and Industrial businesses. As a result of our growth and productivity initiatives, year on year operating margins were up over 250 basis points.","As we move on to Dental, core revenues increased by 0.5% due to strong demand for consumables and implants in North America and the high growth markets, as well as healthy orthodontic sales in China. These gains were negatively impacted by one less selling day. Over the last several quarters, the Dental team's focus on execution and disciplined spending has paid off in margin expansion. This quarter, the team grew core operating margins by 250 basis points and reported operating margins by over 500 basis points to 14.5%. Our continued investments in innovation have resulted in a number of differentiated product offerings for our Dental customers. At the Chicago Midwinter Dental Show in February, we launched over 15 new products, including Maxcem Elite Chroma, a revolutionary new cement for dental restoration that changes color to indicate the correct time for a dentist to remove any excess material. The first-in-class color indicator simplifies the dentist's procedure and reduces clinical risk.","At Nobel Biocare, the team drove mid-single-digit average daily sales of implant systems this quarter. Since the acquisition closed, Nobel has achieved over 400 basis points of operating margin improvement and is focused on reinvesting those savings into future growth opportunities.","Moving now to Industrial Technologies. Revenues declined 1.5% while core revenues were also down 1.5%. Despite the revenue decline, core operating margin expanded 25 basis points while reported operating margin declined 30 basis points to 24.3%. The Automation platform's core revenues decreased at a high-single-digit rate due to the weakness in global industrial markets and a difficult prior year comparison. While we expect this dynamic to largely persist in the near term, we were encouraged by signs of stabilization in the quarter.","Product Identification core revenues grew at a low-single-digit rate as increased demand for marking and coding was offset by softer demand for the business's packaging and color solutions. Videojet's core revenues increase mid-single-digits driven by what we believe to be continuing share gains in North America and Europe while high-growth markets remain softer. The Videojet team has delivered mid-single-digit growth or better for 9 of the past 10 quarters.","Last quarter, we announced the acquisition of Laetus, which extends our product ID offerings into track and trace inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants. We're off to a good start with Laetus. The team's early adoption of DBS tools is already driving key process improvements, as quicker service deployment and improved on-time delivery are ensuring that our customers receive the best possible support.","So to wrap up, our team executed well in the face of challenging economic conditions and we're pleased with our start to 2016. The Danaher Business System remains the driving force behind our performance this quarter, helping to deliver high-teens earnings growth, healthy operating margin expansion and 50% year-on-year free cash flow growth.","We're also off to a great start at Pall where the team drove meaningful process improvements and delivered mid-single-digit revenue growth in the quarter. We continue to make progress preparing for the launch of Fortive Corporation, which remains on track to close in the third quarter. Our teams are excited about the unique opportunity to continue developing two separate portfolios of market-leading businesses that we believe will create shareholder value for years to come.","We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1.19 and $1.23, which assumes approximately 2% core revenue growth. We are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance from $4.80 to $4.95, to $4.85 to $4.98, which would represent a 13% to 16% increase from 2015 adjusted EPS.","Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Isa, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now take our first question from Scott Davis from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, Tom and Dan.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Scott.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","China was a bright spot for you guys, and I know last quarter was \u2013 I mean it tracked pretty comparable last quarter as well, but it sounded like things maybe firmed up a little bit. I mean Fluke \u2013 is Fluke your canary in the coal mine in China having that business back in positive territory in the quarter? Maybe just a little color on what you guys are seeing there.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. China unquestionably is \u2013 remains a very good market for us despite much of the headlines that would certainly suggest that there's slowing in various areas. We were very pleased with the performance in China, and I think it was relatively broad-based. If you looked at Danaher versus Fortive, let's say, Danaher was up high-single-digits in China, and Fortive was up mid-single-digits in China. So I think a number of good examples where China remains a very attractive market for us.","Relative to your specific question on Fluke, Fluke is just \u2013 is an exceptional business overall. We've had a \u2013 it's probably one of our most advanced businesses in terms of both go-to-market as well as local production and product development in China. And while there's clearly still some softness around various industrial segments of the Chinese market, Fluke is a very strong brand in that market and has a very strong share position. So I think we're encouraged by some of the stabilization we see in some of the markets, and in other of those markets, we just continue to see very strong growth.","Our Dental business continues to perform exceptionally well in China. Life Sciences & Diagnostics broadly continuing to perform well there. So, again, while clearly the headlines would show that that market has pulled back a little bit in the aggregate, it's still a very good place to be.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful, Tom. And then I just wanted to ask where you stand in Pall versus the deal model. Kind of help us now that we're a year in or so, I mean give us a sense of how you \u2013 what's working, what's not working, what \u2013 Industrial is probably far weaker than you thought it was, but the Environmental, or the I should say, the Life Sciences side is probably far stronger than you thought it would be. So how are you managing that variability? And how does it all really stack up at the end of the day versus what your prior expectations were?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Scott, we're in \u2013 it's Dan. We're off to a very good start there. We had mid-single-digit good growth in the quarter. As Tom alluded, that was a combination of double-digit growth in the Life Science side and a slight decline on the Industrial side. Clearly that would have been a contributor to our overall organic growth at Danaher.","From a margin perspective, we are ahead of schedule. We've talked about north of $100 million of benefit here this year on the margin side, continue to track very well to the ultimate target of $300 million. In addition to this, we are getting favorable mix given the Life Science business is more profitable and we really saw that play out exceedingly well in the first quarter. It'll likely create some opportunities where we'll be able to accelerate some investments here at Pall during this year given we're tracking so well.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's great. Good luck, guys. Thank you.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks. Just to follow on Dan's comment a little bit, the team at Pall has just done a tremendous job. It's, as we've mentioned before, it's a great combination of both some seasoned Danaher leaders as well as an exceptional group of folks who have been at Pall for a long time, who together have really brought DBS to life in that business in rapid fashion. You heard me mention about the 100 Kaizens that have gone on. Those have gone on literally around the world.","And it's just one indication of the rapid rate at which the Pall team has adopted the tools of DBS, and really that has truly contributed to not only the growth dynamic that we're seeing, but certainly has assisted in us getting ahead on the cost takeouts on the margin side.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Steve. Good morning.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just back to Pall just to follow up on that, I think they were doing a little bit better than $100 million in R&D a year, and R&D year-over-year was up I think about $20 million bucks. Is that a little bit of a decline in the core R&D? Or are you kind of getting efficiencies there on the Pall side?","You also mentioned you're kind of walking away from some business there I think in your 10-Q at Pall. Could you just give us a degree of magnitude on that front? And then I have one quick follow-up.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Steve, on the walking away from some business, that's something that Pall had started prior even to our acquisition. It's down to a relatively nominal amount here and we'll be...","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think largely done by the middle of this year.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then on the R&D front, what was kind of Pall's R&D? I think it was greater than $100 million. Are you guys getting more efficiencies there? Do you expect to maintain that R&D budget, increase it?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would \u2013 right now, we're sustaining and I suspect over time that will get increased.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So...","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would just add to that, I think we've mentioned this maybe once before, but if you think back to the play book that we ran post the Beckman acquisition, I think the play book here at Pall is very similar, which is there's a number of opportunities to get cost out of the business broadly defined. And we're working on those, obviously, to start to see the margins coming up. But the play book is to then redeploy some of that cost takeout into investments in sales and marketing in R&D.","You see us do that broadly across Danaher with gross margins going up and sales and marking and R&D on the quarter for Danaher in total up 30 basis points. We did that at Beckman. R&D lifted over time. We started to get the innovation engine going. Innovation at Pall has always been a strong suit there, but we think we can take it up another level. So some of those cost takeouts will ultimately translate into either higher spending or potentially more efficient spending if we find opportunities to do a better job innovating at the same cost rate. We'll see.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just lastly on the free cash flow, a very strong quarter. Obviously, you're paying down some debt, beginning to delever here a little bit. Is there anything about the timing of that free cash flow? Or should we think about kind of normal seasonality off of that base? I know there were some accruals, year-over-year accruals were less of a drag. Maybe there's just some timing. I mean, maybe the bottom line, is what's kind of the annual free cash guide?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, Steve, you know we don't give a specific guide but we're off to a very good start. There was a little bit of timing benefit around some tax payments, but broadly our cash flow was quite strong. As you know, we ended last year with a record number and a very strong second half for free cash flow. We expect that trend to continue. You know, we're not going to be up 40% year-on-year, but we'd expect a very healthy double-digit increase in free cash flow this year.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Okay. Awesome. Thanks a lot, guys.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Our first quarter last year was...","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And we were a little bit light.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","A little lighter last first quarter. So a little bit of benefit there from a comp standpoint.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thanks.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Cole from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks. Good morning.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Tom, so you mentioned you've seen signs of stability. I think that was in relation to Fluke specifically. But maybe if you could just broaden out the conversation to maybe some of the more cyclical businesses within Industrial Tech, Tektronix. What are you seeing today compared to what you saw back in January?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Thanks, Nigel. Our comments about stability were not exclusively associated with Fluke. In fact, I think there's some pockets even around the Fluke business where we've seen stability, but we've also seen still some real headwinds. But I think we have seen stability in some other areas. You asked specifically about on the Industrial Tech side. The Automation businesses, our Sensors & Controls businesses, as we looked at those throughout the course of the quarter, February and March, we saw indications of stability. We saw those order rates kind of firm up a little bit. And while we wouldn't call it an upward trajectory, we would call those a bit more stable than we had seen in the trajectory of the fourth quarter and maybe at the very opening of the year.","You mentioned Tektronix, I wouldn't necessarily put Tektronix quite in that category yet. It had one of the more challenging quarters. It's in one of the tougher markets probably that we face today. And so I think while we're very encouraged by the new product flow at Tektronix and we expect to see those new products drive some improved performance in the back half of the year, tech remains in a pretty challenging environment.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just switching to environmental margins, obviously a lot of noise this quarter. You called out investment spending. I'm wondering if you could maybe help us size that impact. And it seems that this quarter you had a negative mix of consumables versus GVR growth. Is that true and would you expect that to normalize over the balance of the year?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I'll need you to clarify that last question. I'm not exactly sure what you meant by negative mix relative to GVR growth unless you're talking about Water Quality versus GVR within Environmental. Was that your question?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Exactly. Yeah. (32:55) GVR to the margin. Yeah.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. No, absolutely right. Yeah. Thanks, Nigel. You're right on. If you look at Environmental, which as all of you know both has our GVR business as well as our Water Quality businesses, GVR had stronger growth during the course of the quarter, very encouraging signs of the EMV dynamic taking hold. And GVR comes through that with a lower margin mix relative to our Water Quality platform which has higher margins, and specifically Hach. So a little bit softer Hach business, a little bit stronger GVR business during the course of the quarter together causes some of that headwind that you saw on the margin line there.","The reference to investment spend is specific to what we need to do to build the capacity to step up to the demand associated with EMV. And so we see that in specifically in our GVR business, and those are investments that clearly will pay off as we continue to ramp our capabilities. And as we go into the second quarter and beyond, we would expect those margins overall in the segment to return closer to normal levels. Obviously, some continued investment there, but we expect water quality to come up a bit. So, overall, I think there were just a couple unique factors here in the first quarter.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great, Tom. Thanks a lot.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great. Thanks, Nigel.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Morning, guys.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Tom, you mentioned execution and disciplined spending at Dental with the big margin improvement there. I mean that's a segment that you've always targeted getting to much higher margins over the years, but it's been more of a challenge. I mean is this something of a breakthrough here? Or how should we read the performance and those comments?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, you're absolutely right, Shannon. It's been a challenge in the past, and we did set our sights and commit to making a difference there. We have some new leadership in place over the platform. Many of you have met Amir Aghdaei, who has led a number of our businesses over the last several years and some of our more challenging businesses. And he's really put a terrific team together. They've set their sights on specific margin improvements over time. There was some outstanding execution, some disciplined cost control.","But similar to the comments I made earlier around the play book, I made reference to the Beckman play book and how that applies to Pall, while we'll continue to drive margin improvement at Dental under the team's leadership, we'll also take some of that improvement and continue to invest in sales and marketing and in R&D, because we do have opportunities for improvement in terms of our innovation cadence. We saw some modest improvement there in our core growth in the platform during the quarter, but we know there's opportunities to continue to improve that.","We expect it to continue to step up, but some additional investment over time with some of that cost takeout will certainly be a help.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then, Dan, maybe a question for you on tax. Obviously a lot of new tax policies being contemplated and put into place that impact a lot of multinationals. Any, just, thoughts on that in general and potential impacts on Danaher as well as how should we think about kind of the two NewCo tax rates and any differentials there?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Shannon. Yeah, obviously it's something we're spending a lot of time on trying to understand better. I mean our initial read of this is, this is not going to be an impact to us, a material impact to us in the near term. But over time, we could see some rate creep because of it. Now that assumes nothing else happens, and there's no other opportunities, and so sitting here right now, it's not something that worries us a great deal. But it's obviously a potential risk kind of going forward.","I don't think there's a big change in how we think about the tax rates of the two entities. We've talked about Fortive likely coming out closer to kind of a high 20%s tax rate. Again, I think as they begin to do some acquisitions, they'll have an opportunity to bring that down, and I would expect that Danaher would be at our current rate or lower. Danaher RemainCo would be at our current rate or lower.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Helpful. Thanks a lot.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Shannon.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good morning, all. Could you maybe just clarify what \u2013 you talked about Fortive versus Danaher core growth in China. What was it globally for the quarter?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Danaher was up a couple points and Fortive was down one to two points, say 1.5%, I believe.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And, well, I guess everybody, what are you thinking about in terms of, current thinking I should say, on capital structure for the two entities? Where are you still heading for that? I know there have been some private conversations, but don't have a sense for where that is now.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't think much has changed versus what we communicated a year ago. We would expect Fortive to come out as an investment-grade company. You know likely they're not going to be an A-rated company, but something in a BBB range where they would be strong investment grade and clearly have a fair amount of latitude to execute M&A.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And if I could just one more. Tom, in terms of the R&D profile, I know you talked a little bit about it before specifically with Pall, but I guess overall for the company, where is \u2013 what level of R&D are we talking about for the new Danaher going forward? And do you see an opportunity to accelerate that at all as you think about also accelerating core growth in new Danaher?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Thanks, Steve. I've said for a long time I've always believed that there is no magic number for a business with the diverse portfolio that we have today. We really look at continuing to invest in R&D to certain levels specifically at an operating company level. And that's obviously relevant for \u2013 or relative to what's important to those markets, what's important for our competitiveness, what yields the greatest levels of competitive advantage from an innovation perspective. So we really look at it sort of operating company by operating company.","Our track record is a great one and it will continue of taking R&D up year-on-year pretty consistently. We've used our operating margin expansion that's been driven by improvements in gross margin to put some of that back into not only R&D but into sales and marketing as well. And again, we've done that very consistently. I would expect that we will continue to do that. One of our five core values is Innovation Defines Our Future. And we represent that in our metrics by continuing to see that percent of R&D go up year-on-year. So, again, it will vary in terms of the number that we achieve year-on-year by operating company or even by platform, but using innovation to drive competitiveness is key to our strategy.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. But what was it? I mean, what was it in the quarter at least just for the current or for the new Danaher?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We were over \u2013 probably in the same \u2013 Steve, we have the dynamic around Pall where a lot of the application expertise they bring to their customers which is a big part of their value add, they include in sales and marketing than R&D. So the fact that you saw R&D as a percent of our overall revenues go down 40, 50 basis points year-on-year, that's entirely driven by the Pall dynamic. But I would say that Danaher is probably in that zone where you've got some higher R&D businesses. But because of the way Pall accounts for their R&D, it probably averages to where Danaher is today, around that 6% range.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys. Maybe on the Life Science business, just a little bit more color commentary. You called out pharma as sort of a strong end-market it seems like on the SCIEX side. That market's been running hot for a while. I mean, how do you see the trajectory there? And then secondarily on the Pall side, biotech, there's obviously been a lot of concern in the market, particularly with the smaller companies on funding and the like. Have you seen anything in that side of the business, particularly with small to mid-size biotechs in terms of any relevant slowdowns? Thanks.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ross. Yes \u2013 no question the pharma market is an important driver of our growth across the Life Science portfolio. And we have exposure to that growing market across virtually every one of our Life Science businesses. Pall, specific to your question around biotech and small and mid-size, continues to perform exceptionally well across the biotech market. Just to go back and talk about a few things about what's going on in that market, Pall has a billion-dollar business today that's oriented towards biopharmaceuticals.","And the combination of the solutions that they've had for a number of years along with the newer products in single-use technologies continue to drive the exceptional growth that we see there. That growth, as I think many of you know, Ross, and others know is really driven by this move, the growth and the transition from small molecule drugs to large molecule drugs. And not only are those the fastest growing segment of the market, but they're also the drugs that are most significantly represented in the pipelines of both small as well as large pharmaceutical companies today.","So we remain optimistic and bullish on that market, and I think there's every reason to believe that we'll continue to see good growth not only from Pall but from our other Life Science businesses that have exposure to that market.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Great. And maybe just quickly on the capital allocation side. So a lot of equity market volatility to start the year. Private equity has probably been more of a net seller than buyer. I mean how has this sort of impacted asset prices on the private side in terms of what you're looking at? And does it make sellers more apt to maybe approach a process given they saw equity prices up, down, up again, maybe they're afraid they go down again and so they want to take advantage of maybe an opening in the sort of credit markets where larger companies can acquire? I mean I'm just trying to get a feel for kind of how all this volatility has maybe helped you a little bit on the deal front.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean volatility is a net positive for us as a well-capitalized acquirer. Your comment about private equity, it's getting a little better for them, but the leverage markets are still pretty tough. So I think all those factors play to our benefit. Now granted there are other \u2013 a number of other well-capitalized corporate players here. But we're happy to sort of compete in this sort of environment where there's a little bit more volatility and uncertainty.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks, Dan.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ross.","Operator","Question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey. Just a couple. First on SG&A, I guess, Dan, you kind of partially answered it speaking to the Pall R&D. But the SG&A moving up as a percent of sales, is there anything to flag there? And do you expect that sort of upward pressure over the balance of the year?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, if we first just take Pall out of the equation entirely, R&D as a percent of sales was flat year-on-year, but sales and marketing was up 30 basis points, and that was intentional. I mean we've stepped up some investments. We've talked about some of the opportunities in high-growth markets where we see people pulling back, and we see there's some opportunity. I think some of the success Fortive's having in China right now is probably a little bit of an example of that.","And Pall brings in a pretty high sales and marketing expense when you kind of layer that in. That probably sustains itself. We see that as an important part of their go-to-market, not only their go-to-market but as I mentioned also sort of part of their R&D as well. So we don't see ourselves sort of cutting back on those investments, if anything given we have had a little bit more strength here earlier in the year, we may step some of that up.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And on tax, you mentioned creep and maybe there could be some offsets. Have you guys looked at this FASB change on stock comp and determined what, if any, benefit you'll have when you choose to adopt that?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We don't think it would be meaningful.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then just finally, the six small deals, were any of those in Fortive? And if so, what?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","One was Fortive. It was an acquisition for Gilbarco.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And that's on top of a couple more we did late last year. So in the last four or five months, it's three deals, Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, I'd just like to go back to the 2016 guide and just to clarify, has there been any change to the core revenue outlook for 2% to 3%? And then maybe a bit on the cadence of that through the year and how might that split with Fortive?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Deane, no real change to our view of the full year at 2% to 3%. I think our comments referring to some stabilization that we've seen here in the last couple of months I think suggest \u2013 as well as by the way how that was represented in the order rates, not just the sellout but the order rates in the last couple of months, suggest that we still feel pretty good about the 2% to 3%. So I think we're going to stay there.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And how about the expectations for Fortive in the second quarter?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We would expect that Fortive would be in the same zone, maybe a little bit better. Danaher ex-Fortive would be slightly better and that would roll up to be approximately 2% versus 0.5% of core we delivered in the first quarter.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then maybe some clarification on Hach, the softness in the high-growth markets, is there anything specific there? Is it tougher comps? Why might there be some slowing there?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it certainly was a very challenging comp year-on-year. The platform overall I think comped at 10% versus last year, Deane. So it was probably, among the platforms that we have, it was probably the toughest comp perhaps across the entire corporation. So that was certainly challenging. We have seen some delays in some key projects in a couple of the high-growth markets. So that was certainly a factor there. In certain of those high-growth markets, we actually have a little bit more industrial exposure than purely municipal exposure, and that obviously had an impact in those markets.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Again, we don't \u2013 that business, you know it well, Deane, is just one of our exceptional franchises. And we're confident that business continues to \u2013 will continue to grow over time and we'll see that business' core growth rate improve here in the second quarter.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then just last one and still on the topic of Hach. I don't recall ever there being a time where Water Quality has been more front page news in the U.S. with Flint, Michigan. And just what's your expectation about the longer-term implications on water quality, water tests and how is Hach positioned?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Well, we wish we had an answer today to the infrastructure challenges that lead pipes represent in that situation. It's just terrible to see the challenges that that community has gone through. But I think if we try to look on the bright side from the standpoint of the overall market dynamics, situations like that always turn the spotlight up on the importance of regulatory oversight in municipalities around the country, and frankly, throughout the world. And so, if those regulatory drivers continue to be strengthened, to be pointed at the greatest vulnerabilities in municipal and industrial systems, that, again, while challenging for those communities, ultimately benefits consumers and certainly benefits us. Regulatory drivers have always been a key macro driver for that platform, and they will continue to be so for as long as we can anticipate.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Deane.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Good morning.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess on the Q, you sort of indicated that you're still on track to pay the $3 billion dividend from Fortive to Danaher. Is there any flexibility around that number if Fortive discovers a good acquisition? How flexible are you there?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, that's something obviously the Board would need to determine depending on obviously the size of the acquisition and what else they have in the pipeline.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","It's fair to assume that there's some flexibility there.","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Nothing's set until it's set.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just going back to GVR, the EMV investment and both growth and investment, is it fair to assume that investment is going to be front-end loaded Q1 and Q2 but you might see growth throughout the year? Is that the right way of thinking about it?","Daniel L. Comas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. There's clearly some upfront costs. And as Tom alluded, we also had some one-time items in the quarter and that will normalize as we get through the year.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. Just a question on Dental first. The growth rate was lower than I thought, particularly as Nobel should have automatically pushed up the organic growth a little bit and the comp was pretty easy. So I saw you called out Middle East and Africa equipment. But I wouldn't have thought that was a very sizeable piece of the business. So maybe just give a bit more color there.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Well, our Dental growth overall, Julian, was at a half a percent was basically in line with our expectations, modest improvement from where we've been over the last few quarters. And obviously as we talked just a few minutes ago, we're very pleased with seeing the OMX up at the rate that I talked about earlier. We saw solid low-single-digit growth in consumables and sell-out continues and actually is a fraction better than even our sell-in. So we always look at that sell-out. We have good transparency with our distribution partners, and we're encouraged by that.","The Nobel Implant Systems business, mid-single-digit average daily sales growth in the quarter. We were pleased with that. The Ormco business, the orthodontics business continues to do well, and we're continuing to see on a geographic basis as I mentioned the \u2013 a couple of the high-growth markets specifically the \u2013 our business in China continuing to do well.","On the flip side, on the equipment side, we have seen some challenges in Europe actually, and a couple in those high-growth markets where the equipment side has been held back a little bit more significantly. So I think as we annualize over some of those more challenging comps, we'll continue to see that growth improve during the course of this year.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Thanks. And then secondly, just on Test & Measurement, I wondered obviously that the trends year-on-year are sort of similar Q1 as in Q4. I wondered if there was any specific end market you'd call out that's sort of dragging on the growth now? Obviously, you do have some electronics exposure, for example, in T&M. Or if you thought it was sort of fairly broad-based, the weakness?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, there's certainly some broad-based weakness, but if I had to call out a couple of the softer spots, it probably would be the end markets where tech is most exposed and then probably secondarily, it would be on the Fluke side probably the U.S. point of sale has been a weaker spot here through the quarter. Those would be the two I'd probably highlight.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And you're expecting those to be little changed in Q2?","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We are. That's right. There's no indication right now of pick up there. Obviously, we can always be optimistic, but we're not projecting for any improvement there certainly in the second quarter.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Very helpful. Thank you.","Thomas Patrick Joyce - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Julian.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Matt Gugino for any additional or closing remarks.","Matthew E.

Lawrence Culp","Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone. 2013 was a good year for Danaher. For the full year, revenue increased 4.5% to $19.1 billion, with core revenues up 2.5%. Using the Danaher Business System or DBS, our team delivered solid core revenue growth, operating margin expansion and excellent cash flow performance for the year. In addition, our new product development and go-to-market investments drove relative outperformance in many of our businesses. In 2013, we believe we increased our market share positions at Hach, ChemTreat, Gilbarco, AB SCIEX, Leica Biosystems, Kerr, Implant Direct and Videojet. Our focus and commitment to long-term growth investments position us well for 2014 and beyond.","Turning to the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 3.5% organically. All segments grew at or above expectations, led by our Communications, Water Quality, Diagnostics, Dental Technologies and Product ID businesses, each delivering mid-single-digit core growth or better. From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets improved notably from the third quarter and grew at a high-single-digit rate. In China, sales increased high-single digits, with continued strength in Dental, Water Quality, Life Sciences & Diagnostics. High-growth markets now represent more than 25% or approximately $5 billion of our annual revenue, up from $2.7 billion just 3 years ago. In the developed markets, the U.S. grew low-single digits and western Europe was slightly positive for the second quarter in a row.","In 2013, we generated $3 billion of free cash flow, and our free-cash-flow-to-net-income ratio was 113%. This represents the 22nd consecutive year in which we delivered free cash flow in excess of net income. We also strengthened our businesses through acquisitions and deployed approximately $1 billion on 14 strategic bolt-ons in 2013 despite the tougher M&A landscape. Given the breadth and depth of our strategic platforms, we remain confident in our ability to deploy our $8 billion of available M&A capacity in a strategic yet disciplined way.","We continue to deliver solid margin performance even while funding long-term growth investments. Our gross margin was 51.5% and almost 52% excluding productivity and efficiency initiatives in the quarter. For the full year, our gross margin was 52.1% and our operating margin was 17.1%.","In the fourth quarter, our core operating margin increased 100 basis points while our reported operating margin declined 40 basis points to 16.9%, in part due to the impairment of certain intangible assets in our communications platform. Absent this charge, our reported operating margin would have been 17.5%.","We reported fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS of $0.96, inclusive of approximately $100 million of productivity and efficiency investments, which we believe will provide about $75 million of savings in 2014. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $3.42.","Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues increased 4%, with core revenues up 4.5%. For the full year, revenues increased 1% while core revenues grew 1.5%. Core operating margin expanded 150 basis points, while reported operating margin decreased 210 basis points to 16.6% due primarily to the previously mentioned impairment charge. Core revenue in Instruments increased slightly.","Fluke core revenues grew at a low-single-digit rate, an improvement from the first 3 quarters of the year, with demand strongest in the high-growth markets. Of note, Latin America grew in excess of 25% due in part to our increased commercial investments there. Also contributing to the step-up in growth was the successful launch of our Ti400 thermal imager, a wireless high-performance infrared camera with laser autofocus capability that enables service engineers to quickly detect temperature measurements up to 1,200 degrees Celsius and communicate results back to their laptops or smartphones for further analysis. Products introduced in the last 2 years are helping increase vitality at Fluke and accounted for nearly 1\/4 of Fluke's fourth quarter revenues.","At Tektronix, core revenues declined slightly as strength in Western Europe was offset by weakness in U.S. government and computer verticals. In December, Electronic Products magazine named our PA4000 Power Analyzer its 2013 Product of the Year. The PA4000 is the only T&M instrument so recognized, and is an advanced power-testing tool that helps electrical engineers perform critical current measurements with precision and accuracy.","Core revenues in our Communications platform increased low-double digits, with broad-based growth across most of our product categories. Sales of Tektronix Communications network management solutions increased more than 20%, driven by demand for mobile service providers in the U.S., Asia and Latin America.","Arbor Networks ended the year with record bookings, driven by its Pravail enterprise security solutions and the recent launch of Arbor Cloud, an integrated on-premise and cloud-based DDoS protection service. During the first quarter, Arbor will extend into the advanced persistent threat market, leveraging the security analytics technology of Packetloop, a company we acquired last year.","Close [ph] at Fluke Networks' recently released TruView network, an application performance monitoring software, grew significantly as enterprise customers looked for faster, more efficient ways to monitor network performance and troubleshoot problems. After a slow start to the year, we were encouraged by Fluke Networks' mid-single-digit revenue growth in the second half.","During the quarter, Tektronix Communications acquired Newfield Wireless. Newfield's software provides mobile service providers with a visual representation of their network's performance, including call detail, traffic hotspots and usage data. This technology, combined with Tek Comm's network management expertise, will enable providers to optimize their networks and maximize their subscribers' mobile experiences.","Turning to our Environmental segment, revenues increased 10%, with core revenues up 3.5%. For 2013, revenues increased 8.5% while core revenues were also up 3.5%. Core operating margin improved 80 basis points, with reported operating margin down 50 basis points to 22.5% due primarily to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions.","Our Water Quality platform's core revenues grew at a mid-single-digit rate, with a double-digit increase in high-growth markets and solid demand in the North American industrial market. Hach had its best quarter of the year, delivering growth in all regions and major product lines. The business again grew at a double-digit rate in China due in part to heightened government investment in conservation and municipal water quality projects.","ChemTreat had another outstanding quarter, and it continues to gain share as our best-in-class field engineers deliver exceptional service and demonstrate the value of our solutions to customers. As we highlighted at our Investor Meeting in December, development of our sales team in Latin America remains a key priority for ChemTreat, where we have doubled revenues in the past 3 years and grew more than 30% in the fourth quarter alone.","Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues increased at a low-single-digit rate, driven by payment, point-of-sale and environmental solutions. During the quarter, we introduced Insite360, a cloud-based platform that allows retailers to remotely configure and monitor their dispensers, inventory and point-of-sale systems from any PC or mobile device. Insite360 helps retailers identify theft, detect environmental issues and prevent fuel runouts in real-time, thus improving the economics and risk profiles of their businesses.","Earlier this month, we acquired Outcast Media, a leader in digital out-of-home advertising for the retail petroleum market. Outcast enhances our point-of-sale product offerings and combined with Gilbarco Veeder-Root's Applause TV, will help advance promotion delivery designed to grow convenience store sales and enhance drivers' fueling experiences.","Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics, revenues increased 5.5%, with core revenues up 3.5%. For the full year, revenues increased 5.5%, with core revenues up 4%. Our reported operating margin increased 250 basis points to 16.7%. Using DBS, we have been able to improve margins while also expanding our long-term growth investments. During the year, we increased spending on commercial and innovation initiatives by approximately $120 million.","In our Diagnostics platform, core revenues grew mid-single digits for the fourth quarter in a row. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics' core sales grew at a low-single-digit rate, with strength in immunoassay and clinical automation, particularly in high-growth markets. Clinical automation sales were up double digits as Beckman's best-in-class automation capabilities help customers improve workflow, increase efficiency and reduce labor cost. In China, we grew revenues approximately 20%, driven by a combination of our expanding installed base and continued government investment in health care infrastructure.","2013 was an important year of several milestones at Beckman as we resolved many of our remaining regulatory challenges, including FDA clearance for troponin on all of our immunoassay and integrated chemistry systems, while continuing to improve quality and delivery. Though it's still early, we are beginning to see the impact of the troponin clearance, as both our retention and competitive win rates have improved since September.","During the quarter, we introduced a new Vitamin D assay in Europe and Australia for our immunoassay platforms and also obtained U.S. FDA clearance for the next-generation beta HTT assay, which is used as an early pregnancy test. Today, we're positioned better than ever to focus on retaining and winning new customers and to more actively increase growth investments in the business.","Radiometer's core sales were up high-single digits, with growth in most major product lines and geographies. High-growth markets grew mid-teen, with China leading the way. Our instrument installed base continues to grow, with placements of our AQT point-of-care immunoassay analyzer increasing more than 50% and our blood gas instruments up high-single digits in 2013. We believe this momentum positions us well for outperformance in 2014 and beyond, as we benefit from incremental consumables revenue.","Leica Biosystems saw broad-based growth, with sales up high-single digits. All major geographies grew at a mid-single-digit rate or better, with strength in Japan and the Middle East. Advanced staining revenues increased approximately 20% while core histology sales grew at a mid-single-digit rate. We had a record year in the advanced staining franchise, with net instrument placements increasing at a mid-teens rate and believe we are still increasing market share.","Core revenues in our Life Sciences platform grew at a low-single-digit rate, led by the high-growth markets. Sales were up more than 20% in the Middle East and double digits in Latin America and Western Europe. AB SCIEX core sales grew low-single digits, with strength in proteomics and applied markets. AB SCIEX continues to broaden its global reach, opening a new R&D center in Singapore during the quarter, AB SCIEX's first outside of North America. The center brings development and manufacturing closer together while providing localized support for our Asia Pacific customers. In addition, AB SCIEX opened a new technical support and regional office in Dubai to better serve customers there in the Middle East.","As expected, Leica Microsystems' core sales declined at a low-single-digit rate, primarily as a result of a difficult prior year comparison due to the highly successful launch of the SP8 modular confocal microscope last year. Orders grew double digits in the quarter, with confocal microscopes up more than 20%. We are confident that Leica will return to growth here in the first quarter.","Turning to Dental, revenues for the quarter and full year increased 3.5% while core revenues increased 3%. Operating margin decreased 150 basis points to 13.7% due in part to the negative impact of sales mix as our technology businesses grew faster than our higher-margin consumables businesses. Spending on productivity initiatives and on targeted growth investments for new products set to launch in 2014, including 25 new introductions next month at the Chicago Midwinter show, also negatively impacted margins in the quarter. For the full year, operating margin was 14.6%.","Dental consumables' core revenues increased at a low-single-digit rate as demand for implants was partially offset by a decline in professional consumables. We continue to have tremendous success with our digital dentistry initiative. Since its launch in June of last year, we have sold more than 300 Lythos Digital Impression Systems, which, in turn, helped drive record order growth in our Insignia orthodontic case starts during the year. Insignia's digital treatment planning tailors custom-fabricated brackets, wires and aligners to each aspect of tooth movement, thereby decreasing office visits and treatment time while improving the patient experience and clinical outcomes.","Dental technology's core revenues grew mid-single digits as double-digit core growth in North America and China was partially offset by weakness in Western Europe. Our new digital imaging solutions continue to be well received in the market, particularly our new i-CAT FLX 3D digital imager. Since the launch in the second quarter of last year, we've sold more than 200 units, the equivalent of more than 1 per day. Additionally, KaVo's DIAGNOcam, a handheld radiation-free digital imaging scanner, won the German innovation prize for most innovative equipment product in dentistry in a survey of more than 4,000 German doctors.","Moving to our Industrial Technology segment, revenues increased 5.5%, with core revenues up 3%. For the full year, revenues grew 3.5% while core revenues declined 0.5%. Our core operating margin increased 20 basis points, while reported operating margin declined 80 basis points to 17.3% due primarily to increased spending on productivity initiatives and the impact of recently acquired businesses.","Motion core revenues decreased at a mid-single-digit rate as growth in industrial automation and North American distribution was more than offset by a decline in our defense and engineered solutions verticals. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement we saw in orders, which turned positive in the fourth quarter, for the first time in a year. However, we anticipate core sales will remain negative in the first quarter of 2014 as Motion exits some lower-margin businesses.","Core revenues in our Product Identification platform grew mid-single digits, led by high-single-digit growth in our core marking and coding businesses. Videojet had its best quarter of the year, with strength in all major geographic regions. Consumables revenue grew at a double-digit rate as our marketing initiatives and successful product introductions over the past several years have helped expand our installed base. In Esko and X-Rite, our innovation investments are helping accelerate growth, with new products representing nearly 20% of total revenue in 2013.","One of the most exciting new product introductions is PantoneLIVE, a cloud-based color management solution that helps brand owners accurately communicate color specifications across their entire supply chain, improving the consistency of their brand image. During the quarter, Asda, one of the largest supercenter chains in the U.K., became the first retailer to implement PantoneLIVE.","So to wrap up, as we anticipated when we were with many of you last month in New York, we had a strong finish to the fourth quarter, contributing to a solid year for Danaher. Our team's commitment to and application of the Danaher Business System drove relative top line outperformance, solid core margin expansion and excellent cash flow throughout the year. We believe the investments we have made to drive long-term growth and productivity, combined with our robust balance sheet and optimism on the acquisition front, leave us well positioned to outperform in 2014.","We are initiating first quarter diluted EPS guidance of $0.76 to $0.80 and reaffirming our full year guidance of $3.60 to $3.75. We anticipate approximately 3% core revenue growth in the first quarter, which will be impacted by 1 less selling day than the first quarter of 2013.","Matt R. McGrew","Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. Marquita, I think we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nigel Coe with MS.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Good solid end to the year, Larry. Can you maybe talk about January? I know January is a fairly weak month for the quarter. But maybe just talk about 3% in the context of what you've seen so far in January.","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. I think you're exactly right, Nigel. It's hard to say too much about January, given the nature of the month and how early it is. But I think we were particularly encouraged by the way 2013 ended, right? From a geographic perspective, the strength was broad-based. I think the same can be said from a line of business perspective. We probably had a better book-to-bill than we had the year prior, and I don't think there were any unnatural acts that, by and large, occurred. So it was just good to see that sort of strength come into the new year. I don't think we've seen anything in January that would deter us. Again, we mentioned in the formal remarks that we are short a selling day, which will impact us probably more so in consumables than in equipment. We know that Motion is still going to be exiting some of the low-margin business there. But I think all-in, we feel good about things. But when we say approximately 3%, I think we know that we clearly need a few more weeks behind us here to have a better bead on the first quarter. But so far so good.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. That's great. And then, even though no one extrapolates or prorates the [ph] amount, but given the 7-day pressure in 1Q, given that Motion is still going through the rationalization of the product lines, does this point us towards the higher end of that 2% to 4% for the full year, Larry?","H. Lawrence Culp","For the year?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes.","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I don't think we're going to change that 2% to 4%. But clearly, getting off to a good start here in the approximately 3% range would at least put us at the midpoint. And if the macro scene is better, Nigel, I'm highly convinced we're going to do well, right? With our exposures from health care to industrial, environmental, networking, an improved global scene will be very good for this portfolio, and we'll execute accordingly.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then switching to margins. And I just wanted to begin with Industrial. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that productivity initiatives was one of the reasons why we saw some pressure there. But I'm just wondering, are we seeing any pricing pressure within industrial markets?","Daniel L. Comas","Nigel, it's Dan. First of all, if you just normalize year-on-year restructuring, Industrial Tech margins were up 80, 90 basis points. We had a higher -- we had some additional opportunities. We took advantage of it. In terms of pricing, it hasn't -- we definitely saw an impact probably late '12, and we've seen that continue, where we're not getting any pricing in equipment, generally speaking. So we're still getting the kind of pricing you'd expect on the aftermarket. But the period of the prior year, you're getting a point or so on equipment and instruments. It hasn't gotten worse, but since about a year ago, it's probably overall kind of flattish for us right now.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Could you expand on the write-down on the Communications platform, talk about maybe what that investment was about, I think, and typically, how much you capitalize in R&D and sort of think about it from an investor's risk profile going forward? Just a little more perspective there. Was it acquisition related at all or pure new investment and why?","Daniel L. Comas","Steve, I'll start and maybe let Larry chime in. It was investment in a company, relatively early-stage company, that is continuing to perform reasonably well but behind the expectations we had at the time of the acquisition. Because of that, the accounting rules indicated that a write-down of a piece of the purchase price was appropriate. So obviously, we took that. Obviously, the Communications platform, overall, has been a very good, very kind of high return for us. Probably, there'll be a little bit more risk. And you can have situations like Arbor that play out well ahead of schedule. This one, we still believe in. It's tracking okay, but it's a little behind versus where we thought it would be at this point.","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. Steve, that's it exactly. I would just add to that, that we do a number of these things, these sorts of investments, to augment our competitive positions really around the portfolio. And while you never want to see an impairment, to have that business up double digit, contributing is a good thing and a good thing long term. You look at a small investment that we made, that was really to seed core [ph] technology for Lythos, the digital impression system we have up and running at Dental. We did something similar that was really the foundation for what became AQT at Radiometer. So we have a number of these small bets that we make that we don't really end up talking much about. As Dan alluded to, a moment ago, clearly, with the accounting rules, we've got to call this out. But I think it's just really part of the mosaic in terms of the investments we make organically and inorganically to drive long-term competitive strength and profitable growth.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And since we're talking about that segment, what's your sense for the sustainability of that low-double-digit growth in tech -- Tek Communications, I mean?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think we're in a very good spot there, clearly, in terms of the challenges we're helping our service provider customers solve, as well as the folks on the enterprise side, right? Network management, particularly with the mobile explosion, is a continuous challenge. We're well positioned there. From an enterprise perspective, network management, generally, it does not get easier. Clearly, a day doesn't go by with the cyber security headlines being rewritten. So we like where Comms, we like where Arbor, we like where Fluke Network is positioned. I'm not sure we consistently sign up for double-digit growth there. The Tek Comms business can be a little bit lumpy, but I think we like the long-term trajectory there to be sure.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just turning to margins. On the Dental side, a little more color on the restructuring and growth investments there. What -- a little more sense maybe for the nature of that.","H. Lawrence Culp","Sure. I think maybe just a little bit of context. As we hinted in New York when we saw you, I think we had a little bit better visibility at the end of '13 than we have the last couple of years. So we had a little bit more room to do some things, and Dental was one place where we took advantage of that envelope. As we said, about 100 basis points of costs that came forward. Most of that was on the productivity side, just to continue to sharpen up the cost structure there. But we're really in the sweet spot, both from a technical -- or technology perspective given where the product pipelines are, and a lot of that comes out in February at Midwinter. But also on the commercial side, we wanted to pull some things forward, particularly in Asia, all of which, I think, gives us a good start to 2014. And again, the mix bit of it was important as well. I think it's always good to see equipment show strength, but there is a little bit of a squeeze there from a margin perspective in the short term.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just a couple of questions. Larry, just first on the deal front. Can you give us a little more color on where your comfort factor is? And the light in which I ask the question, you may or may not have had interest, but we saw a couple of health care deals trade away in the quarter. Roper, yesterday, was saying a couple of things slipped through their fingers that others took at 20x EBITDA. It still sounds like a very tough market to actually get things done.","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think we'd be the first to acknowledge that, over the last 4, 5 quarters, things have become more difficult in general. But I think our optimism, Jeff, is genuine because we're going to pick through a number of different situations that populate the funnels really across each and every platform. And as we do that, even in this environment, we think there are opportunities for value creation. We're going to stay disciplined, no doubt about that. I think that we take some encouragement from the fact that we did deploy $1 billion last year across, admittedly, 14 smaller transactions. But as Dan and I look out there, as we go through the monthly reviews we do with the businesses, I think that we're well positioned financially and operationally to put that capital to work. But on the margin, you're spot on. So it is a little tougher, given the valuations, particularly in the public arena than a year ago.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So how do we think then about kind of Plan B, another deployment, if the deals don't materialize? And I was wondering also if Dan could maybe give us a little color, like collectively, what the acquired multiple was on those 14 transactions, kind of aggregated multiple and aggregated sales acquired.","Daniel L. Comas","Jeff, overall, about 3x revenue and kind of a low-double digit, 11x, and I may be off by 0.5 point kind of EBITDA sort of multiple. They are largely bolt-ons and tuck-ins, so our confidence with those tend to be higher just because of the nature of what we can do on the cost side.","H. Lawrence Culp","I'm just glad you didn't say it was 22x there. Jeff, the -- just back to Plan B. I think the board and certainly Dan and I and the team are highly cognizant of the earnings power that we have in what is an under-leveraged balance sheet, right? I think the bias that we have, which is discussed and frankly, reaffirmed at virtually every board meeting, is toward the inorganic investments that have worked very well for us in building a strong company and driving a lot of value. Things are going to come in ebbs and flows here, but I think that balance or that bias is intact. And we know that, frankly, just a few years ago, after a somewhat quiet period, we were uniquely positioned to go take Beckman on, right? So again, I think this is a live conversation with a strongly shareholder-oriented board at every meeting, but the pronounced bias that we have is one we continue to think works for Danaher going forward.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I think you guys mentioned $100 million in restructuring and the $75 million in benefits. But I thought you said you did actually take some more here in the fourth quarter. Was that just offset with growth? Is there -- is that just rounding error? Or can you maybe quantify what you did in the fourth quarter and talk about where -- within which segments you did it in?","Daniel L. Comas","A lot of questions there. I'll try...","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's basically fourth quarter restructuring. What was the absolute number and where did you have them?","Daniel L. Comas","So the absolute number was a little bit over $100 million compared to $120 million last year. It was higher in Industrial Tech and Dental, and it was lower in Life Sciences & Diagnostics. So if you look at the core margin expansion of LS&D, up 260, if you normalize restructuring, it'd be more like 150 basis points of core margin expansion. We spent a little bit more than $100 million in the quarter, but you could also see that where we -- we also really stepped up some of our growth investment. So R&D was up 13% year-on-year in the quarter. It'd been tracking up around 8% or 9% through the first 9 months. Sales and marketing, a similar story. We're up 9% in the quarter versus tracking maybe 6% or 7% for the first 3 [ph] quarters, as I already alluded to. Given where we saw some of the strength, there was an opportunity to deploy some money that hopefully will benefit growth in the future.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So it's really -- because that $100 million, I don't think that's necessarily new, relative to what you said in the third quarter. I was under the impression that you had a little bit of revenue upside in the fourth quarter, so you invested some of that away. But I guess what you're saying is you invested that in -- it's reflected more in growth investments as opposed to productivity.","Daniel L. Comas","Sure. I mean our R&D itself was up $40 million, almost $40 million in the quarter. Our run rate would have suggested more like $30 million.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then one last question. Just on -- the Life Sciences & Diagnostics margins were very strong. What is Beckman now doing? And what do you expect for Beckman margins next year?","Daniel L. Comas","We -- for the full year, mid-teens, a little bit stronger in the fourth quarter, though that is somewhat seasonal. But as I mentioned to Jeff, with a little lower restructuring, very strong performance. We're trying to get away from talking specifically kind of Beckman, but it's a big piece of the segment and we would expect that segment to again be one of the larger contributors to the year-on-year margin expansion here that we expect in '14. So things are tracking well. More costs are coming out. Very pleased with how the year trended in terms of their Beckman margins.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And sorry, one last one, just on the day sales thing. You said it's mostly -- obviously, mostly hits in consumables, so that's a higher-margin issue. Is there any way to kind of quantify the EPS impact of that or at least the profit impact of that?","Daniel L. Comas","Well, if you just assume 1-day impact on consumables, no impact on equipment, probably just a little bit, but that would be 0.5 point of growth. 0.5 point of growth on $5 million (sic) is $25 million and that's a 50% fall-through, that costs us a $0.01, $0.015 in the quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Larry, a couple of the businesses that have been tougher, I mean, Motion you talked about orders turning positive in the quarter. Tektronix, I guess, is still down a little bit. Can you give a little color on what you're seeing there? I mean, is that flattening and turning positive dynamic, just a comp issue? Or are you seeing things actually get better there?","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. No, I think at Motion, we were particularly pleased with the finish, especially on the industrial automation side. If you look, we were up basically at a mid-single-digit rate in industrial automation in the quarter. Now that's a portion of the business, but that's really where a lot of our growth investments, from a product and a go-to-market perspective, have been made, Shannon. From a vertical perspective there, it was broad-based. Orders were up double digit in the fourth quarter in the U.S. I think, in China, we finally had traction from an execution perspective. So there's a lot there, frankly, that we're quite pleased with on top of the multiyear margin expansion that, that team has put forward. At Tek, not necessarily thrilled to be down again in the fourth quarter. But I think as we look forward, given the historical lag effect around PMI, we're optimistic that we return to growth here in '14. Things have been a bit bumpy, as you know, there. I think the China space, particularly on the export side, has continued to be particularly challenging. But I think all in all, Tek did a much better job from an execution perspective in a tough environment in 2013. I think we held ground broadly and are poised to get back on the positive side of things here in the new year.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then for the whole company, do you have what equipment and consumables each grew in the quarter? And just maybe any commentary on what you make of that in terms of customers' willingness to invest?","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. I think that's -- actually, I mentioned this earlier, Shannon. As you know, the book of business here is about 60-40, 60% equipment, 40% consumables, and where we've really seen the sustained growth of late has been in consumables. And we thought -- when we talked about as a 2.5% core in the fourth quarter, we thought consumables would lead there. We'd be slightly positive on equipment, with consumables at a mid-single-digit rate. To see consumables, basically, come in line but to have equipment come in a couple of hundred basis points better than that, I think it's another one of the signs that we can take from the fourth quarter to say this broad-based geographic and product pickup that we saw came in equipment, and those are clearly more important decisions, if you will, on the part of many customers. So we're going to look at that, to see how sustained that is as we get started here in 2014, but I think just that snapshot is one that's hard to interpret in anything other than a positive way.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","In Dental, you discussed some mix issues in Q4 and some new product spend. But I guess if I look at the year as a whole, the margin was about flat. How are you thinking about the mix items into 2014? I mean, do you think we should see Dental incrementals pick up much or this is something that could persist?","Daniel L. Comas","Julian, I think you saw an improvement through the first 9 months of the year. Again, the fourth quarter was impacted primarily by the higher restructuring, but as Larry indicated, kind of the mix, with the equipment better than consumables. So given we have a little higher restructuring spend here in Q4, we expect a significant number of new product launches in the first half of '14, I think that bodes well not only for the top line, but also for margin expansion here in '14.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then within Life Sciences, you had a 40% incremental operating margin last year as a whole. Is there a sense in which I guess a lot of the easy or early savings from Beckman have now been squeezed out and so you should see incrementals normalize pretty quickly this year?","Daniel L. Comas","They'll come down a little bit, but even our Radiometer and Leica Bio businesses, just given the high consumable content there, also continues to be very good even in the \"more mature businesses\" in terms of their tenure with Danaher, still seeing good fall-through. But it won't be probably at the level we saw in '13.","H. Lawrence Culp","Julian, I would just add to that, that if you look at the productivity investments that we made in the fourth quarter, LS&D still accounted for about 1\/3 of the overall total, as Dan noted earlier, down year-on-year, but still an important part of that spend, which I think speaks to just the visibility the teams have on opportunities. Beckman's not the only relatively new business we have there. So they're all keen to get after it to continue to get those margins up, again, because we think that segment ought to be a 20%-er.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just lastly on the kind of your own investments outlook. SG&A to sales was flat last year. Do you think that stays sort of flattish this year? And just any color on your CapEx assumptions for the year.","Daniel L. Comas","It should be. I mean, we make -- as I mentioned, our sales and marketing were up 6%, 7% for the year, and we did a good job partially because of the '12 restructuring, actually having our G&A down a little bit. A fair amount of the restructuring in Q4 was also targeting after G&A here in '14. So it probably climbs a little bit given the continued investment in sales and marketing. From a CapEx perspective, we are roughly teed up for kind of a low- to mid-single-digit increase in CapEx, kind of PP&E type CapEx.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with Citi.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On Motion, I might have missed this, but could you size for us the revenue impact on the businesses that you'll be exiting in 2014? And maybe share with us a little bit about what the tipping point might have been. What's the decision-making as to, to exit those businesses?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I'll let Dan answer the first part of that. I think, with respect to the second part, it was really, really simple. I think these were below-margin opportunities we've gotten a hold of that looked a little bit more attractive at a distance than they did up-close. So effectively -- as you know, Dean, we've had a multiyear effort to put a premium on margin expansion in Motion. I think we give the team very high margin in that regard. And the walk from the revenue, even though it impacts the print on the core revenue side of things is the right thing to do, and the team has been at that for the better part of a year now.","Daniel L. Comas","Deane, so we were -- Motion was down mid-single digit in the quarter. Absent the businesses we've exited, it would have been down low-single digit, probably down 1 point or 2. We expect that dynamic to continue here in the first quarter. They're just getting better so we're going to have about a 4- to 5-point hit on growth from the exit of the business, but it should be largely completed -- we have a little bit in Q2, but basically largely completed by the end of Q1.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, good. That's helpful. And then, on China, the 20% up, was that an overall clinical or was that at Beckman in particular? And maybe some color on there in terms of what the mix was. Are these China-for-China products? And maybe a little bit about what kind of business you're seeing in China in Beckman.","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. I would say that if you look at Life Sciences & Diagnostics today and I'll throw Dental in there as well, we're clearly beneficiaries of this China-wide infrastructure build in terms of better clinical delivery. We see that in the Diagnostics businesses, we see that in Dental and as well, from a research perspective, both at SCIEX and at Leica. We are still, I would say, Deane, in the early innings of driving the localized product agenda that I'd like to see us execute upon in that segment. Now we do have a pretty good Asian manufacturing footprint there. A good bit of that is actually in Singapore. You heard me reference in the prepared remarks the AB SCIEX footprint in Singapore. Leica Micro enjoyed a similarly substantial position there. So we have work to do there. But frankly, as these researchers and clinicians often return to China from their overseas educations and postings, they're looking for the same sort of gear. And in turn, I think that's why you've seen Beckman and Radiometer, Leica and SCIEX do so well in China the last several years. Is that helpful?","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, it is.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First one on Dental. Just wondering if you could maybe comment on what you're seeing in the underlying patient volume trends in the U.S. and then maybe what's baked into your assumptions for patient volumes this year.","H. Lawrence Culp","Well I think that we certainly know that, from a macro perspective, patient volumes have been, of late, more sluggish than we've seen over the last 10 or 15 years, particularly here in the U.S., Western Europe to a slightly lesser degree. But I think our view, Isaac, as you well know, is that we really want to drive innovation, couple that innovation with better commercial execution so that we can capture that value that we're adding on a per doctor, per operatory, per patient basis. And I think we've been doing that, lots of examples. Most recently, this digital dentistry initiative at Ormco, I think, is one where we're getting a lot of traction in that regard. And to the extent that we can do that, that drives share, that drives value capture and coupled with what we're doing in the high-growth markets, I mentioned China a moment ago, we think Dental can be a good sustained mid-single-digit grower for us.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then just maybe switching over to T&M. You mentioned some of the investments you're making on the software side of the business, which I would assume is going to carry higher margins over the long-term. So if we assume that the capital equipment side of T&M remains a little sluggish, is it fair to say there'll be enough mix shift here on the underlying business to move the needle on overall margins in the segment?","Daniel L. Comas","Maybe on the margin, Isaac. But it's a 20% segment and while some of the software businesses can carry higher gross margins, they also carry some higher investment levels. I think it's probably more about driving growth there than margin expansion.","H. Lawrence Culp","Right. And that's 1 segment, Isaac, where the variable margins on the equipment are well above the Danaher average. So we don't get as much of a pronounced mix there between core equipment and aftermarket, in whatever form it comes, as we might elsewhere, i.e., Dental, as was explained a few minutes ago.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just last one, if I could sneak it in, on the M&A side. Just given your earlier comments, can you talk a little bit about where you think your funnel is strongest or maybe weakest for M&A by segment?","H. Lawrence Culp","I would say it's pretty well balanced at this point, Isaac. As you know, we've been working the Environmental side of things pretty hard. That's an area where we'd like to do more. There are certainly spots within both Industrial Tech, particularly around Product ID, as well as in T&M, particularly if we can lever the Fluke brand more broadly, that are high priorities for us. So we're working those hard, but I don't mean to shortchange LS&D or Dental. They certainly have a good bit that they have their eyes on as well.","Operator","And we'll go next to Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question on cash flow. I think free cash flow was flattish versus last year. And as we look at 2014, do you expect a pickup in cash flow? We just need to transition after we sort of digest M&A to a more sustainable percentage of net income, which sort of means cash flow, is likely going to be a flattish for another year?","Daniel L. Comas","Andrew, the impact in 2013 was really not a lower -- it's not explained by lower M&A activity. It's a little bit of -- I hate to sort of hide behind this, but a little bit of an accounting dynamic. As you know, we sold both our Tools joint venture and about half of our Align shares. We brought in close to $1 billion from those 2 activities. Those things were below the free cash flow line. However, the $175 million -- $150 million of taxes we paid on those gains negatively impacted our free cash flow. So if we didn't have those 2 discrete items, our free cash flow would have been up $100 million year-on-year.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And what should I think for '14 then?","Daniel L. Comas","I mean, I think if you adjusted for that, we'd have close to 120% conversion. Amortization alone gets us 15 points of conversion. So something in that zone would be probably a reasonable guiding estimate here for '14.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you. And you said between 115% and 120%?","Daniel L. Comas","Yes, something in that zone.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then the question on M&A. As you look at the opportunities, do you think it's easier for you to do deals in sort of $1 billion, $2 billion size? Or do you have an advantage looking at larger deals given the fact that you can extract synergies, you get to keep them and so the economics changes quite a bit, you being a strategic buyer versus the...","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think regardless of deal size, each investment requires a certain level of work. I think we've done large deals, a la Beckman. We've done some smaller transactions. But once you get past that dynamic, I think we feel pretty confident that both, given the size of our financial capacity, and again $8 billion of capital here in the near term, coupled with our operating capabilities, both in terms of the quality of the team and the Danaher Business System, we are advantaged. And that doesn't begin to address the fact that we take a long-term view, right? And we can not only be patient, but we bring that owner's mentality to building out the business and harvesting those top and bottom line synergies. So we've been at this a long time and continue to believe that our organic strategy will complement what we do organically very well and create value for shareholders and build a sustainable franchise along the way.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Charlie Brady with BMO Capital Markets.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","On the Industrial Tech business, maybe a little more color on kind of really what you're thinking on core growth in '14. I mean, Q4 this year was the best -- was the only positive quarter of the year, the best 1 in 4 quarters, and you still have some of those businesses that really aren't going to be strong growers, at least in the first half of '14. So just maybe a little more color on where you're seeing kind of a growth expectation on core for '14.","H. Lawrence Culp","Charlie, what we said -- as you recall, what we said in New York is we thought, for the full year, Industrial Tech would be up 1% to 3%, probably a little bit more of our cyclical exposure there. So if things spring back just broadly, I think we're well positioned. Maybe the industrial automation performance I highlighted a moment ago suggests we're beginning to see some of that. But I think, by and large, what will drive Industrial Tech, aside from some of the headwinds you mentioned, is the very strong performance we have seen and expect at Product ID. Videojet, Linx, the marking and coding business have done very well the last couple of years. We love what they're doing in terms of finding opportunities to invest in growth and their execution around those investments. And while it's still early, at X-Rite and to a degree, Esko, those businesses both play important roles in managing some of the more complex supply chain and brand management challenges that our customers, particularly in consumer goods, face. So there's just -- it's a ripe field of opportunity. The businesses are well positioned, and they ought to lead the way this year.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to our moderator for any additional or closing remarks.","Matt R.

Lawrence Culp","Matt, thanks, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased by the sequential improvement in our core growth and our strong operating margin and cash flow performance in the quarter. Despite the macro headlines, we grew 3.5% organically in the quarter, and the team did an outstanding job on the execution front with an 80 basis points of year-over-year core operating margin expansion, a 31% year-over-year increase in free cash flow and a 31% growth in EPS.","We continue to focus our efforts on capturing market share, driven by DBS, as well as our investments in innovation. Videojet, ChemTreat, Leica Biosystems, Esko, Kerr, Arbor Networks and Radiometer are among the businesses where we believe we have taken market share during the quarter.","Geographically, the U.S. largely continued its strong start to 2012, with our Q2 revenues growing mid-single digits, though we did see some pockets of weakness as we exited the quarter. In Western Europe, our sales were flat in the quarter, which, by and large, resonates with the headlines. China was mixed but flat in the quarter. The bright spot in China for us has been healthcare with both our Dental and Life Sciences & Diagnostics businesses growing double digits in the quarter. The rest of the emerging markets remained strong and also grew at a double-digit rate.","We remain active and optimistic on the M&A front. Through the first 6 months, we've deployed nearly $1 billion of capital on 8 acquisitions, primarily in our Industrial, Environmental and Test & Measurement segments. Even taking into account the capital we deployed on these transactions, we still expect to have more than $5 billion of M&A capacity over the next 2 years.","Turning to details of the quarter. Today, we reported record second quarter diluted net earnings per share of $0.84, a 31% increase as compared to our diluted net EPS last year. The current period includes a $0.03 benefit from a lower-than-anticipated income tax rate and a gain from resolving a contingency related to a prior asset disposal.","Revenues for the quarter increased 25% to $4.6 billion, with core revenues up 3.5%. The impact of acquisitions, primarily the addition of Beckman Coulter, increased revenues by 25% while currency translation reduced sales by 3.5%. Our gross margin for the second quarter was 51.7%. Our reported operating margin expanded 100 basis points year-over-year to 17.8%.","Second quarter operating cash flow was $1 billion, a 31.5% increase year-over-year. Free cash for the first half of 2012 was $1.5 billion, up 31%, and our free cash to net income conversion ratio for the first half was a robust 131%. Particularly in these uncertain economic times, DBS's impact on cash flow growth serves us very well.","And finally, our tax rate in the second quarter was 22.5% as compared to 24.3% for the second quarter last year. The lower rate reflects the impact of a discrete tax benefit resulting from the expiration of a statute of limitations on an uncertain tax position, as well as the cumulative cash [ph] effect of a lower estimated tax rate for the full year, which, together, benefited EPS by $0.02 in the quarter. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of about 24% for the balance of the year.","Turning to our 5 operating segments. Test & Measurement segment revenues and core revenues increased 1% for the quarter. Core operating margin for the second quarter decreased 85 basis points, while reported operating margin declined 90 basis points to 21.5%.","Our Instruments business' core revenue declined mid-single digits in the quarter. At Fluke, core revenues were down slightly with growth in the U.S. distribution channel more than offset by weak demand in other geographies, particularly China. In the quarter, Fluke received 2 Gold Medal awards from Industrial Design Excellence for our new clamp meter family. During the quarter as well, we acquired U.K.-based IRIS to enhance our R&D capabilities in our core thermography lines.","At Tektronix, core sales declined high single digits in the quarter with continued softness in China and Europe, offset somewhat by strength in Latin America and in our service business. Core revenues from our communications businesses grew mid-teens in the quarter, with continued healthy demand from wireless carriers in both North America and Europe with Tektronix Communications' network management solutions.","At Arbor Networks, we continue to see solid demand for our network security solutions, as DdoS and Internet security remains strategic concerns for our customers as they seek solutions to prevent and defend against cyber attacks.","During the quarter, Fluke Networks launched the multi-fiber Pro-Tool for automatic testing of fiber cables and the TS PRO series for carrier field technician's voice data and video testing. While demand should remain solid in the second half of the year, core growth rates in our communications businesses are expected to moderate due to difficult prior-year comparisons.","During the quarter, we acquired VSS Monitoring, a San Mateo, California-based provider of network monitoring switches and technology using next-generation ultrahigh-speed network probes. Network monitoring switches service to front end for monitoring and securing networks by selectively segregating and directing traffic, allowing telecom service providers and enterprise IT professionals to more effectively manage even the largest networks.","In Environmental, revenues increased 4.5% in the quarter with core revenues up 6%. The segment core operating margin increased 55 basis points in the second quarter, with reported operating margin essentially flat due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions.","Water Quality core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by solid growth in North America. At Hach, demand continued to be healthy for our core lab and process instrumentation, position the company's initiatives to expand its service business to help drive double-digit year-to-date growth in that category.","ChemTreat continues to execute extremely well, with the second quarter marking their eighth quarter in a row of double-digit core revenue growth. Their sustained outperformance can be attributed to their best-in-class go-to-market initiatives, as well as their commitment to innovation on behalf of their customers. They recently launched an environmentally friendly starch-based solution known as Green DTAC [ph] to help customers reduce sludge buildup in their systems, resulting in lower maintenance costs, higher uptime and reduced waste removal charges.","As some of you may recall from our Investor Day last December, we highlighted Trojan's new UVSigna system, which makes conversion to ultraviolet disinfection easier for customers by reducing the footprint, simplifying maintenance and lowering the total cost of ownership. During the quarter, we shipped our first system to a U.S. municipality and continue to see robust order activity for this new product. Trojan is also continuing validation work on its Ballast Water Treatment solution, and during the quarter, shipped its first system.","Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew high single digits, led by solid demand for dispensers, payment solutions and environmental monitoring systems. In particular, payment solution sales increased low double digits in the quarter, with strong sales of EMV security upgrades for credit and debit cards in North America. During the quarter, we acquired Catlow, a manufacturer of nozzles and other hanging hardware to enhance GVR's vapor recovery capabilities while also strengthening our alternative fuel dispensing solutions.","Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter increased 124.5%, largely due to the 2011 addition of Beckman Coulter. Core revenues were up 5% and include one week of Beckman Coulter revenues, which were not material to the overall core growth rates in the quarter. Core operating margin for the segment was up 165 basis points, while our reported operating margin increased 820 basis points from the prior year to 13.1%.","Diagnostics continued their solid performance with high single-digit core growth in the quarter. The Radiometer core sales increased at a high single-digit rate, with broad-based growth in all major geographies led by the emerging markets. China grew in excess of 25%, with particularly robust uptake of our AQT system following regulatory approval late last year.","Leica Biosystems increased at a low double-digit rate led by advanced staining, which was up more than 20%, while the core histology business rebounded at a high single-digit rate. All major geographies saw growth in the quarter, with particular strength in China, the emerging markets and North America.","At Beckman Coulter, we've been exceptionally pleased with the first year progress, as DBS continues making an impact on many facets of the business, including quality, while setting the stage for future growth and improving the cost structure. Quality remains a critical priority for us at Beckman. We continue to focus on the quality system itself and on product quality.","On that front, I'm pleased to report that we have received FDA premarket approval for the Class III Prostate Health Index assay, a simple noninvasive blood test. It's 2.5x more specific in detecting prostate cancer than PSA alone in patients. The accuracy of the test also benefits patients by reducing the number of unnecessary prostate biopsies.","This was the third consecutive quarter of low single-digits Diagnostics revenue growth. We also continue to be encouraged by our retention and win rates, as well as the success we've seen with new product launches, including the AU 5800 series and the phi assay. We've made tremendous progress on the cost side over the last year, and since the acquisition, our operating margin has increased more than 400 basis points.","This week we attended the American Association of Clinical Chemistry meeting in California, where the overall tone was outstanding. A number of customers commented to the team about improvements they've seen over the past year, particularly with respect to lower unplanned service visits and other key metrics with respect to service quality. While there's still a lot of work ahead, we're happy with what the team has accomplished in their first year with Danaher, and my thanks go out to everyone at Beckman who has contributed to the success.","In Life Sciences, we saw low single-digit revenue growth in the quarter. AB SCIEX's core sales grew modestly in the quarter against what was their highest growth quarter in the prior year. We continue to see strong growth in China and the emerging markets, offset by weakness in the U.S. and Japan.","For those of you that joined us last month in Toronto at our Investor Day, you saw firsthand DBS's impact on new product development at AB SCIEX. At ASMS in June, they debuted the new 6500 series, the world's most sensitive triple quad system designed for complex analysis, including drug discovery and development in regulated labs, peptide quantitation and biomarker verification. They also enhanced the TripleTOF, family introducing the 5600 series for routine analysis and the 5600+ for more complex analysis.","Customer feedback on all new products has been exceptional. In particular, the 6500 has been particularly well received, with significant orders booked in the second quarter, even though the product doesn't begin shipping until here in the third quarter.","Leica Microsystems core sales were up mid-single digits in the quarter, with strength in China and the emerging markets across most product categories. Late in the second quarter, we launched the SP8 confocal microscope, a truly innovative solution developed using extensive VOC from Life Science researchers. The SP8 allows a researcher to start with an entry-level confocal and to move up in a modular way to increase the functionality of the system as the research process requires and as funding becomes available. Here, too, initial customer feedback has been excellent.","In Dental, core revenues increased 5% in the first quarter. We have outstanding traction in the margin front, with core operating margins up 325 basis points and reported operating margin increasing 350 basis points to 14.4%. We are extremely pleased with our first half Dental performance.","Dental consumables core revenues grew mid-single digits in the quarter, led by sales for our general dentistry consumables, infection-prevention products and orthodontic solutions across all major geographies. Damon Clear, our aesthetic self-ligating orthodontic brackets, grew double digits in the quarter.","Dental equipment core revenues were up low single digits in the quarter. We saw strength in imaging, up double digits, with healthy demand for our intraoral sensors, along with a solid uptake of our combo 2D\/3D imaging product, which has now been rolled out globally across all of our major brands. During the quarter, we also launched the Helios 1800 LED energy-efficient light, which builds off an existing platform with an entry-level solution in the key LED category.","In Industrial Technologies, total revenues were up 0.5%, while core revenues were up 1% for the quarter. Our core operating margin increased 105 basis points in the second quarter, with our reported operating margin up 60 basis points to 22.4%.","Product Identification core revenues grew mid-single digits in the quarter with growth across most major geographies, including the U.S., China and Latin America. Sales of our CIJ printers were particularly healthy, growing mid-teens globally. During the quarter, we launched the Willett 630 CIJ printer designed in China for the Chinese market. Customer enthusiasm has been high there, with orders for over 500 units in the first couple of months.","During the quarter, we closed our previously announced acquisition of X-Rite. While still in the early days, we're off to a great start with the team embracing DBS and exploring opportunities to lever our global network of PID brands.","Last month, both X-Rite and Esko exhibited at drupa, the world's largest printing and packaging trade show. Esko introduced new hardware at the show, as well as its next-generation software suite for design and preproduction. Esko Suite 12 is packed with new functionality, including richer 3D capabilities and better workflow automation, to help print and packaging customers drive efficiency. Customer response to Esko's new products was extremely favorable, helping to drive mid-single-digit core growth in the quarter.","In Motion, core revenues declined at a high single-digit rate in the quarter, with softness in industrial automation, technology and renewable energy markets across most major geographies. We expect the rate of year-over-year core sales decline to improve as we move forward for the balance of the year, in part due to easier year-over-year comparisons.","So to wrap up, we are quite pleased with our growth, earnings and cash flow performance. While the team continues to execute well, the uncertain macro environment suggests to us that it's prudent to accelerate cost actions, which will help us protect and maintain our growth investments. We now anticipate spending approximately $100 million this year on restructuring activities, about double our previous plan. We believe our focus on capturing market share while taking these actions, coupled with our optimism and capacity on the acquisition front, positions as well for the balance of 2012 and beyond.","We are initiating third quarter diluted net EPS from continuing operations guidance of $0.74 to $0.79. We are also updating our full year diluted net EPS guidance from $3.25 to $3.35 to $3.19 to $3.26. The midpoint of our revised EPS guidance would result in approximately 14% year-over-year EPS growth compared to last year, adjusted EPS of $2.83. The reduction in the full year guidance is primarily attributable to the accelerated restructuring activities and the anticipated negative currency impact from the recent strengthening of the dollar, partially offset by the $0.03 benefit in the second quarter. We are assuming second half core revenue growth will be in line with what we achieved in the first half of this year.","Matt R. McGrew","Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal conference. We are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first today to Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Could you maybe give us some better or some additional clarity? I guess, one, on how were the demand pattern shifting through the quarter itself? Did you see continued acceleration or deceleration into -- through June? And then secondly, when you think about the second half core growth in line with the first half, maybe give us some more color by business about how you're seeing it and what you're seeing either in inventory or other indicators that are leading you to the conservatism other than sort of just macro indicators.","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. I would say -- Steve, maybe a couple of thoughts here. I think with respect to the first part of your question, what we saw, say, by business in the quarter, I think we saw 3 to 5 businesses fundamentally in line with what we thought we would see during the quarter, with Life Sciences & Diagnostics up slightly and Industrial Tech slightly below. I think, again, as we saw the quarter play out, I think we were very encouraged with the strength of the overall quarter as we look around the business. But certainly, during the quarter, I think we saw some things that give us some pause and obviously have us thinking about the environment here with the acceleration of the cost actions. I think as we think about the second half, certainly, we saw in June, I think, some signs that the second half may play out a little bit differently than we had anticipated originally. Certainly, the China rebound, I think we were anticipating as others were, is going to come; it's probably just not going to come in the time frame that we had anticipated here in the second half. Certainly, Motion and T&M are not rebounding in the way that we had anticipated or had hoped. Now there's an obvious intersection there between Motion and T&M and the China softness. Clearly, there's -- I think there's more uncertainty today in and around some of the life science funding dynamics. And even in the U.S., where we've had another, I think, exceptionally strong quarter, we saw some, if you will, hairline fractures in certain businesses that just have us on alert. I think that, coupled with the headlines, which there are very view positive macro headlines out there globally right now, I think give us the impetus here from a topside perspective to say, hey, the risks are to the downside. Let's take note of the fact we're having a very good year from an earnings, from a cash perspective. But let's proactively, even though the businesses probably have a slightly more optimistic outlook for the second half, go ahead and set the stage to take advantage of the year that we're having to take the cost actions in order to protect our growth environments if the environment does continue to slide here a bit. I think with respect to the quarter, the third quarter here, and the current view, Steve, is that we'll be fundamentally in line with what we saw in the first half, so call that 2.5, 3. And as you think about the fourth, probably more in line here with what we just printed, call it 3, 3.5 on the core side.","Daniel L. Comas","And if you looked at it by -- Steve, maybe by segment, just quickly, we'd be looking at 4 of the 5 segments being up low single to mid-single with the exception being T&M, where we would expect that to be down. It's not that the instrument business is getting worse, but, as we alluded, that the communications business is not going to sustain its double-digit growth it's had here in the first half, in part because of the comp issues. So we could see T&M down kind of low single digit to mid-single digit here in the third quarter. And as kind of Larry alluded to are the numbers from our businesses would be higher than that. So most -- some of our segments, where we're telling you we think it's low single to mid-single in some of our businesses, with their numbers, they were all up to more of a mid-single-digit point of view. So I think we're taking, again, a little bit of a top level perspective and adjustment here, given the macro environment, given the few things we've seen here of late.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like there's contingency built into that is what you're saying, right, in terms of roll up versus the top down view?","Daniel L. Comas","That is -- that's the right way to look at it, yes.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, the T&M margin pressure, is that mostly operating leverage?","Daniel L. Comas","Yes. As you know, as we've talked about, T&M is our highest gross margin segment, and obviously, that's hurting us here. And we will see that impact again here in the third quarter, and you'll see a step-down sequentially in our margins Q2 to Q3 in T&M.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you just give us a little bit of an update on the -- in integration and maybe how the instrument placements are going from a top line perspective?","H. Lawrence Culp","I assume you're talking about Beckman, Steve?","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. Beckman, yes.","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes, I'm sorry. A year in here, I think we're very pleased with where we are as we highlighted in some of the prepared remarks. Now certainly, the primary objective there has been quality. I think we've made a lot of progress. You just see that in the reinspections and the new product approvals and just a lot of the internal metrics that we look at on a weekly basis. With respect to growth, and clearly, we're encouraged here with the low single-digit growth in Diagnostics that we're going to print or allude to here, it's not yet part of the core for 3 quarters in a row, I think that speaks to this business really getting back up on its feet, no silver bullet there, Steve, but just a lot of different actions being taken to improve service levels, certainly the quality improvements help. And I think that, coupled with the new product introductions, the investments that we're making in our sales and marketing organizations, has us encouraged that this is a business that, once fully up on its feet, will be a real contributor to Danaher's overall core growth.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then just within the businesses, I mean, you mentioned some, I guess, you used the term hairline fractures, I mean. And anything more specific than that you're seeing in your short cycle businesses? And then how have things kind of started off here in July?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, Steve, I would say that July is very much in line with what we were anticipating here, so we're encouraged by that. A little hard to read, at least the U.S., given the 4th of July holiday falling in the middle of the week. But with respect to what we were talking about in the second quarter, in the U.S., I think we saw some signs in and around Life Sciences, certainly, in T&M and, to a lesser degree, in Environmental, where even businesses like -- even some of the businesses that we're printing very good numbers here just had a little bit of softness, a little bit of, say, a forecast miss here or there where we were seeing customers hesitate to write POs, in other cases projects being pushed out a little more than we would have anticipated. I think if we weren't so mindful of the headlines and the drumbeat of negative news, it might be easier to say, hey, well, that -- those are just -- that's just noise. But again, I think we're going to exercise a level of prudence here and to say, hey, the risks probably are to the downside. Let's go ahead and take some proactive actions here that are the right things for the business so that we continue to make the longer-term investments for the corporation.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then one last question. Is there anything in the portfolio rationalization side where you guys are still -- you're opportunistic in selling things? Is there anything that's out there that you're looking at that could either fund further acquisition on the balance sheet, but also maybe just a timing issue where you could, ultimately, offset this restructuring cost in the ForEx headwind with gains in the back half? I know you don't play that game, but I'm not sure if there's anything you're looking at left in the portfolio that's kind of noncore.","Daniel L. Comas","Steve, I think, well, obviously, we've done a fair amount of pruning the last couple years. And given our joint venture with Cooper, soon to be heating [ph] with the tools -- on the tools front, a business that had a very good second quarter and, in fact, sequentially. So as revenues rise $25 million and with terrific fall-through hits, $25 million sequential increase in revenues and a $10 million increase in OP sequentially, Q1 to Q2, I mean, that's something that obviously down the road, under the right situation, could be something that could be used for acquisition proceeds.","Operator","We'll go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So, Dan, if you could maybe -- or, Larry, if you just talk about the CAGR [ph] cadence. You've given some good detail already. But it looks like 2% to 3% for the second half of the year is your planned assumption, but your comps go much easier in 4Q. So I'm wondering how does 3Q look in your plan relative to the 4Q. And if you could maybe just then pass into that, the impact of Beckman Coulter rolling to the numbers in the second half of the year.","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. Nigel, to be clear, I think that what we're going to see here in the third is a slight downtick from where we were in the second. So call that 2.5, 3, given what we know today. I think we would see near the fourth quarter step up from that, call it to 3, 3.5. But you're kind of in a band where the first half is going to be in line with the second half. Beckman does kick in. It kicked in for a week, but that was just -- it's not meaningful in the second quarter. It kicks in here obviously -- here forward and has an ever so slight dilutive effect. But at this point, given the performance that we're seeing there, it's not much to call out. So I think what we're looking at -- again, I think in light of what we're seeing or not seeing in China, certainly, the softness at T&M, in particular in China and elsewhere, and just some concerns about the way the macro environment plays out in the second half has us putting that outlook together, but one in which we think we can drive good market share gains in.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then -- I mean, it doesn't sound like there's much changing just from your comments, but you talked about some hairline fractures. But the quarter, you're flat in Europe. You're flat in China. I mean, is the decision to restructure, is it driven more by what you see in the macro side, or is that a bit more within the businesses, maybe some of the book-to-bill ratios in June that caused you to launch this program?","H. Lawrence Culp","Nigel, it's a judgment call. So admittedly, it's hard to describe for you how much of it is a view of what we're seeing internally, how much of it is a function of what we see out the window here. But I think all -- and even though the comps do get easier, China is going to take a while to rebound. I think the political dynamics there are probably more pronounced than we had perhaps anticipated. That said, they're clearly engaging. Europe is what it is, and the U.S. has been quite strong for us. But I think we want to make sure that come what may, around the world, we're still in a position to make the growth investments in the second half of this year, the first half of next year, admits that uncertainty so that we're driving the company forward over the long haul. That's the way we've always managed. We'd like to think this is a prudent approach, some may call it conservative. That's fine to our ears. I think at the end of the day, that if things are better, we'll obviously print better numbers. But given what we know today and don't, I think this is the right thing to do.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And just on the 3Q guidance, does the bulk of the $0.06 delta on restructuring come within 3Q?","Daniel L. Comas","No, it's more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. What you're seeing in the third quarter is primarily an FX dynamic. The euro kind of peaked this time last year. The year-on-year, we have about a $0.05 headwind. And then actually, even sequentially, we have about a $0.02 headwind between Q2 and Q3, given the dollar really didn't begin to strengthen significantly until June. That, coupled with -- of the expectation, slightly lower growth sequentially and some restructuring, frames up the guide here for Q3.","Operator","We'll go next to Jon Wood with Jefferies.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So, Larry, can you just tighten up perhaps the view on Life Sciences & Diagnostics for the year? You initially offered 3% to 7%. Is it possible to get a bit better view on how that business shakes out for all of 2012 at this point?","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. I think that what we're clearly seeing there, Jon, is the softening in the spending drivers, particularly with respect to some of the government-funded dynamics. I think, particularly, as we look at some of our big ticket products, the new products, which is SCIEX and Leica, I think we're encouraged by those product launches, probably hurt us a little bit, both with the new mass specs out of SCIEX and Leica with the new confocal, given the timing. I know we hung some customers up here in the second quarter as they were evaluating and, in turn, placing orders on the new products, shipments obviously to come. But I don't think the new product launches are going to be pronounced enough for us not to see some softening in the core in Life Sciences. So I still think Life Sciences & Diagnostics, as a whole, probably will be one of our leading segments from a growth perspective. But Diagnostics will clearly be the better performing business of the 2 as we look at the second half.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right, great. That's good color. And I mean, thanks for the update on Beckman. Just if you look to the back half and obviously with the troponin submissions already in the FDA, assuming that goes according to plan, I mean, is it at the point where we can kind of rule out the flat number for Beckman diagnostics? And would you expect that business to accelerate in 2013 just given what you know today?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, certainly, I think we've got a lot of the things within our control getting better every day, and that's obviously helpful. There's still some factors where we're working with others to improve our ability to grow. But I think at this point, Jon, as we look at next year, I think low singles is probably what makes sense with respect to expectations, with mid-singles being certainly within reach for 2014.","Operator","We'll go next to Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you talk about some of the deals you did this quarter? And you did 8, but really, all we really know about is X-Rite, and it seems like a pretty active deal book. Just in context and maybe what type of multiples you're seeing, are they deals that are easy bolt-ons or generally accretive or dilutive? I mean, just a little bit of color around that.","H. Lawrence Culp","I think that by and large, Scott, we would characterize the other deals here, absent X-Rite, as really bolt-ons, where we're bringing on capability, bringing on distribution resources that bolt on in a clear, close, strategic way to existing businesses. I mentioned a couple in the prepared remarks. Certainly, within TEK Comms, where we've seen tremendous growth, VSS gives us tremendous capacity to continue the monitoring capability that TEK Comms does for the wireless carriers. These network switches are really part of a technology term where we think VSS is very well positioned. So they'll be working hand in hand with the TEK Comms business to make sure that, around the world, we're taking their capability and putting it forward in front of customers in the best possible way. And we mentioned Catlow down at GVR as well, a company we've known for a long time. But as we expand our vapor recovery offering, certainly, having that hanging hardware capability that they have is an important addition, but again, kind of a classic Danaher bolt-on acquisition in that regard.","Daniel L. Comas","And in terms -- I mean, in terms of the multiple, I think the one that's most relative, just given the size, would be X-Rite. It's more kind of an adjacency-type acquisition, and we paid about 10x trailing EBITDA there. Given the cost takeout, some of the public company costs that come out very quickly, we can scale that down very quickly.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Just to get back to some of your macro view. I mean, if you take some of your bellwether businesses, and I always think about Fluke, for example, and a couple of the industrial TEK businesses, but Fluke I know has scale in China, I mean, what do you see in emerging markets as it relates to their shorter cycle businesses? And any bottoming that's going on there?","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. I think, by and large, Scott, that's a good -- certainly, Fluke's a good barometer for us in that regard. The fact we've got 40% of our business on consumables also gives us kind of a really good pulse in addition to some of the other POS data that we have. We really can't, at this point, separate China from the rest of the emerging market basket. I think what we've seen in China has really been, I think, evidence of the slowdown there outside of healthcare. I'm encouraged by that, because while we don't like the fact that we've certainly seen our non-healthcare businesses basically be flattish with flat to slightly down, with T&M being down double digit, the healthcare businesses, I think because of the government's actions purely with its rural healthcare initiatives, have been quite strong, in addition to what they're trying to do to establish an indigenous of life science research capability. But it is what it is, and I don't think that underlying business that we see in Industrial and in Environmental, let alone in T&M, gets materially better until late this year or early next year. But if I go to the other side of the so-called BRICS plus, even though some of the headlines out of India and Brazil have not been, I think, particularly encouraging. By and large, we're seeing a good consistent, steady growth. In many of those markets, we have modest positions. Though the base that we're growing off of is not that pronounced, that's a good thing for us. We're clearly getting our bearings and really understanding how to play and compete in those parts of the world. But there's really no place else in the world right now, Scott, that we would say we're seeing the sort of broad softening x healthcare that we're seeing in China.","Operator","We'll go next to Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So in terms of margins maybe a little bit, I mean, you've obviously taken a more conservative view on organic. I mean, are there areas that are tracking ahead of plan on margins? I mean, Dental, certainly, it looked like a strong spot. I don't know if you've had a breakthrough there, maybe highlight that or some other areas where you think margins are tracking ahead of plan.","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes, I mean, certainly, Shannon, speaking to Dental, I think we're very pleased with that. Really, the first half performance all the way around, given the environment, could not have been better. I wouldn't say it's a breakthrough though, because we've got 3 years, this looks like it's going to be the fourth year in a row, where we had very steady margin improvement in Dental. And I think they know, even though they print, what, 14.4% here in the quarter, that there's plenty of upside still as we adjust the cost structure and get quality growth out of that business. So again, I think a lot of us remember some of the false starts that we had there way back when, but that now is really something for the history books. And the trend they're on, here again in the first half of this year, I think is indicative of what that business and that team is capable of delivering.","Daniel L. Comas","I think the other segment that we've been particularly pleased would be in the Industrial segment, where on modest growth, overall -- good growth at PID, but negative impact from the Motion-related businesses. We've been able to sustain that 20% segment operating margins, see core operating margin improvement in this quarter to about 100 basis points. Again, that's somewhat of a function of what we did in the fourth quarter of last year, another reason why we're teeing up some restructuring here, but we're also getting somewhat of a favorable price cost dynamic in Industrial Technology as well. We've got about 1.5 point of price in that segment. And given some of the commodity and some of the brief in declines in commodity prices, it doesn't benefit us a lot across the other segments, but it does definitely benefit us there.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, that helps. And then on free cash flow, I mean, in the quarter, I mean, the conversion was particularly strong, I mean, the whole first half but particularly in the quarter. I mean, was there anything unusual there? Or how would you characterize that in terms of sustainability?","Daniel L. Comas","Well, we printed a little bit, over $1.4 billion in the first half. I think we're positioned to kind of print a comparable number to that here in the second half. That would be a probably $400 million year-on-year increase in free cash flow. That continues to track very well. We did get a slight benefit versus last year. We had higher tax payments in the first half, lower in the second half. That'll be a little bit different this year. They were low in the first half. We'll be a little bit higher in the second half. But that's a small factor though. Overall, our working capital performance continues to be very strong. And we've got $350 million of amortization flowing through as well, and that continues to support that very high conversion ratio.","H. Lawrence Culp","Which, in turn, Shannon, of course, is why we are optimistic and, I think, ready to go here on the M&A front, right. We talked about what we have to spend here. You think about the $5 billion of firepower over the next couple of years. If the environment does become a bit more uncertain, as we are thoroughly suggesting that it could, that just can't help but make the M&A environment more attractive to us. We're ready to go.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Charles Clarke","It's actually Charlie Clarke for Julian. Just had a real quick question on the restructuring. Just if you guys could kind of break down kind of where you think that's going, just kind from an operating segment standpoint.","H. Lawrence Culp","Charlie, the $100 million in aggregate that we're flagging this morning will be well distributed across segments and geographies. I think as you may know, when we've talked about these actions at this stage probably in the past, we've tried to not getting into too much detail. I think that we prefer to have the opportunity to talk to affected associates before we talk about any specifics publicly, and we'll do that again here this year. But suffice it to say, obviously, the bulk of our developed market's footprint is where a lot of the structural cost in the corporation resides. We will be working hard in that regard. And some of the businesses that have lower relative margins today are probably the ones where there's a bit more upside and potential to improve our structural cost position in order to, again, preserve and protect those growth investments in the second half of this year and next year, which we think are really the long-term fuel for the organization.","Charles Clarke","Okay, great. And then just real quick. SG&A-to-sales ratio just seemed like it ticked up a bit kind of quarter-over-quarter just enough. Do you have any color on that?","Daniel L. Comas","Sorry, I'd have to look at it. Nothing jumps to me off-line right here, but I can -- I'll take a look at it.","Operator","We'll go next to Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So can you, Larry, on Tektronix around -- maybe on the instrument side of Test & Measurement. I think the last quarter, you highlighted that the department returned to a book-to-bill of over 1. Can you maybe just talk about what happened there intra-quarter? And then maybe kind of the follow-up on the restructuring. I know that's where you did a lot of restructuring back during the last downturn. Is that a business where there is more that you can still do, or not so much in that business?","H. Lawrence Culp","Let me take them in reverse order. There's always more you can do. I think that's rooted in the DBS mindset. We have done a lot, as Dan was mentioning earlier. Having done a lot over time is one reason we have such high margins at T&M and why we're going to feel that effect of the revenue softness in the second half. I think we prefer again not to get too specific here in mid-July. We'll keep you posted as we talk to associates through the second half. But suffice it to say, again, we'll be looking at everything as we get ready for the final implementation of this plan. With respect to what we saw through the quarter, the book-to-bill, again, at TEK was positive in -- I mean, positive in terms of being north of 1.0. But I think what we've seen is, again, that intersection between pronounced softness in China, particularly Europe to a lesser degree, and just a hesitancy, perhaps a much more subdued investment level on the part of customers, at least temporarily here, that have us, I think, looking at the second half, again, in line with what we saw in the first half, where T&M is not going to be the growth leader for us, particularly on the instrument side, that we have seen in years past.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","And just to clarify, in the second half, given the macro indicators that we see, you expect, on the instrument side, similar to the first half. That's what you said. And you said communications, that the comps would be slightly -- would make the overall numbers slightly lower, right?","Daniel L. Comas","And that'll be more pronounced in Q3. We then think we'll see some sequential improvement in Q4.","H. Lawrence Culp","Talking instruments.","Daniel L. Comas","Talking instruments, yes, right.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then if, again -- I mean, is that here at AACC [ph] as you alluded to? And it's clear unlike the Life -- on the Diagnostic and on the Life Science side, that all your customers are going to be under much more pressure from either a reimbursement standpoint or a funding standpoint. So now that you've owned those businesses for a while and you're kind of moving into this period, I'm just curious, did your strategy change at all? Or how are you just thinking about those businesses, given the constraints that a lot of your customers are going to be under?","H. Lawrence Culp","Well, I think that those constraints are not dissimilar from the realities that we anticipated when we've made these relative investments over time, and particularly so with Beckman last year. But I just continue to think that on the Diagnostic side, Jon, what we do from a scientific perspective is provide information at the front end of care, which can't help but be part of the solution long term to some of these macro pressures that all payers, government or otherwise are going to see. I think on the Life Science side, what we are, I think, well positioned to do is really skate to where the puck is, if you will, and not necessarily be tethered in a broad-based way to overall spending of what we do at AB SCIEX in mass spec, what we do at Leica with confocals. Very much it's targeted to the higher growth, the higher interest, the higher impact areas and categories where research work is being done. I think if we can continue do to that strategically, we'll be mindful of the macro pressures and any posterior budget effects that fall through our customers. I think we'll be well positioned to take, if you will, our unfair share of those overall budgets because of the value we'll be providing our customers.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","But just -- and I recognize you do not want to give specifics in terms of where you're going to do your restructuring, but in that environment, is there a need maybe as you've look at it to be more cost effective than maybe you initially thought? Or is that -- is it in line -- is everything you're seeing so far, even with some of the cracks that you mentioned in the U.S., is everything in line with your expectations, so it's more about trying to find the value you just alluded to on the revenue side?","H. Lawrence Culp","Yes. I think if you look at Life Sciences & Diagnostics here again in the quarter, they were our star, right. I think we're flagging that the Life Science environment, at least, in the short term, probably gets a bit more challenging for us. But that said, I think anything that we might do in Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Jon, is really a function of the opportunities that we see to improve the overall cost structure, much as we have at Beckman, 400 basis points up over the last year, much as we've done at AB SCIEX over the last 2 years, where I think we've been able to improve the cost structure while improving the overall operation of the business and, clearly, increasing the investment envelope up there for new technology and being a more serious player from a sales and service view, globally. So I think what we're suggesting here this morning is really borne of a global macro view and a desire to have more control over our destiny in a more uncertain world and not really a direct or indirect tieback to some of the long-term pressures that you're alluding to. And again I think there are long-term opportunities embedded there as well, which we're strategically very keen to go take advantage of.","Operator","We'll go next to Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I had a couple quick follow-ups. First, on assumed conversion margins in the second half, a lot of sort of moving pieces in the overall margin picture, but the core conversion assumption is still around 30%, 35%?","Daniel L. Comas","Sure. Terry, we were about 35% in Q2 when you factor out the acquisitions and the FX impact. We should be in that zone here. And again, the one segment we will be challenged here will be T&M as we expect that segment to be down, tipping the third quarter. I think there will be less of a comp [ph] in the fourth quarter to where we expect to be down low single to mid-single digits in terms of growth and expect segment margins to be down a couple of hundred basis points sequentially. But outside that, the other 4 segments should be in that 35% zone.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe I missed it in the detail, but did you or could you give either the Beckman core on a stand-alone basis in 2Q or what Life Science's core, including Beckman, would have been?","Daniel L. Comas","Life Science -- Beckman all up was up low single digits in the quarter.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Larry, you've been very clear on cap allocation in the near term and the focus is on the M&A pipeline, but I just wondered, given sort of the shift in the world, if you will, number one. Number two, looking at your relative valuation versus the peer set versus where it's been historically, I wonder if there's a point at which stock buyback starts to become an option that you entertain more seriously. And if not, under what scenario could you see that occurring?","H. Lawrence Culp","Terry, I'd say this, from time-to-time, as you well know, we've been opportunistic in buying back shares. But I think our bias today is consistent with our long-term bias, and that is to redeploy our free cash by way of M&A. But obviously, it's something that we and the board constantly evaluate. But our long-term bias, I think, is very much intact as we look forward.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe I just wonder if there's any additional color on the pipeline from the standpoint of size. I mean, I think it's been pretty clear that we ought to be anticipating bolt-ons versus anything large, but I wonder if something may have changed there. And then secondly, I think the indication had been previously that maybe you are seeing more things outside of the Life Sciences area, and is that unchanged -- has that changed at all?","Daniel L. Comas","Terry, that's largely been -- things have been largely up by the Life Science-Diagnostics space over the last 2 to 3 quarters. I think we expect that to continue, though I -- we will probably -- now that we're a year post-Beckman, we'll start to be looking at bolt-ons for that space as well. Given where we are from a capital structure, we paid down -- our net debt down almost $2.5 billion over the last 12 months. I think we're geared back up beyond just looking at bolt-ons. And whether it's adjacency-type deals like X-Rite or even larger deals, I think those are all being considered right now. And given the macro environment, obviously, that creates some uncertainty in the marketplace and on Wall Street, that tends to be good for people like us. And we're optimistic we're going to be able to put the money to work here.","Operator","We'll take our last question today from Deane Dray with Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just going back quickly on the restructuring. I might have missed this. But could you address what the assumed paybacks are, the timing on these -- the incremental restructuring initiatives here?","Daniel L. Comas","Deane, we would expect to complete this $100 million of restructuring by the end of the year and would expect a slightly north of a 1-year payback that'll -- in the ballpark of a $75 million benefit next year.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So that would be $75 million on a run-rate basis for the -- for 2013, is that right?","Daniel L. Comas","Correct.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then I know you don't typically call out book to bill. It got called out in the first quarter because of the timing of some of the orders and later shipments. But how did that resolve for this quarter? How did book to bill end up for the second quarter?","Daniel L. Comas","It was right -- it was slightly north of 1, but basically 1.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then last question. Larry, you alluded to some growth investments. Oftentimes, when you see companies there facing a little bit uncertain macro, there's a pullback in growth investments. Can you just talk about what areas, the magnitude and would there be a sense of throttling back, or are these committed resources?","H. Lawrence Culp","I think the throttling back, Deane, is exactly what we're trying to avoid. I think if we were not taking the actions here in the second half, given the macro uncertainties, we might be dialing back some things in the margin, which, frankly, are sometimes the easiest things to pull back on when things are getting tighter or more uncertain, but by the same token, the very things that you ought to protect in tough times. So I think what we want to do is make sure we are taking out the structural costs that we can in a good year here to make sure that come what may, the go-to-market investments that we're making, be that in emerging markets, be that with respect to digital marketing, let alone the science and technology bets that we're making in new product development, are protected and, in some cases, increased.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session.

We were pleased by our solid start to 2015. The team executed well in a changing and challenging macro environment using the Danaher Business System to drive strong organic revenue growth and expand core margins in the quarter.","DBS continues to enhance our competitive position and drive share gains across the portfolio by helping us identify, direct, and execute on high impact investments in product innovation and sales and marketing. As a result, seven of our nine strategic platforms grew at a mid-single-digit rate or better in the quarter including test and measurement instruments, water quality, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics, Life Sciences, Product ID and Automation.","We were also encouraged by the noticeable impact DBS has already made on many of our recent acquisitions including Nobel Biocare, Devicor and Aguasin that further boosted our performance. This is another record first quarter for Danaher, adjusted, diluted net earnings per share was $0.93 including a negative $0.02 impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar versus our previously communicated guidance in January.","Revenues for the quarter grew 4.5% to $4.9 billion with core revenues up 5% due in part to extra selling days in the quarter. This growth exceeded our expectations and marks our best quarterly core growth performance since 2011. Acquisitions contributed 6% to revenues, while currency translation negatively impacted revenues by 6.5%. Geographically, the high-growth markets grew mid-single digits, but performance was mixed as strength in China and India was offset by weakness in Russia and Latin America.","In China, sales increased nearly 10% led by our dental, diagnostics, and Gilbarco Veeder-Root platforms. The developed market also grew at a mid-single-digit rate with both the U.S. and Europe up mid-single digits. In Japan as expected, sales declined double digits due to a difficult prior-year comparison in which customers accelerated purchases ahead of the VAT increase on April 1, 2014.","Gross margin increased 80 basis points to 53.4% marking the first time our gross margins have exceeded 53%. Core operating margin expanded 25 basis points or approximately 60 basis points excluding the impact of foreign currency. With three of our five segments improving more than 110 basis points. Our reported operating margin was 15.9%.","On the capital allocation front, M&A remains our primary focus. We deployed approximately $500 million on three bolt-on acquisitions in the first quarter including the acquisition of the Siemens Microbiology business. These acquisitions strengthened our market positions in our dental, diagnostics, and Product ID platforms. In February, we also increased our annual dividend by 35% to $0.54 per share and we expect further increases over time. Our tremendous balance sheet and active acquisition funnel combined with recent volatility in the global volatility markets uniquely positions us to deploy our substantial M&A capacity.","Turning to our five operating segments. Test and measurement revenues declined 1.5% with core revenues up 2.5%. Reported operating margin decreased 220 basis points and core operating margin declined 225 basis points largely due to lower sales in our higher gross margin communications platform. Core revenues in our instruments platform grew mid-single digits for the second consecutive quarter led by the developed markets and China.","Fluke core revenues were up high single digits as it's biomedical and tomography product lines each increased double digits. Strengthen in tomography was augmented by the launch of the TiX560 and TiX520 series of thermal imaging cameras during the quarter. This expert series combines in articulating lens, on camera analytics and the industries largest responsive LCD touch screen allowing mechanical engineers to navigate over, under and around objects to quickly capture process and process the highest quality infrared images on the spot.","At Tektronix, our core revenues increased at a mid single-digit rate for the second consecutive quarter. Healthy demand for military and government customers in North America was coupled with strength in the semiconductor segment in China. During the quarter, Tektronix introduced new type of high-performance ATI oscilloscope, the DPO70000SX. The DPO offers the most accurate real-time performance and highest analog bandwidth on the market. It combines patented signal capturing technology, compact design and highly scalable architecture to help reduce noise and distortion so electrical engineers can better understand and solve their most common complex problems.","Core revenues from our communications platform decreased at a double-digit rate. Double-digit growth in security solutions and high single-digit growth at Fluke Networks was more than offset by a decline in network management solutions. Platform orders grew over 20% in the quarter, which gives us confidence that we will achieve positive core growth in 2015.","We continue to expect the combination of our communications business with NetScout to close in mid-2015 and this morning we announced that NetScout has received clearance from the U.S. Department of Justice with respect to the proposed transaction. Close is subject to approval by NetScout shareholders and other customary closing conditions.","Moving to our environmental segment, revenues increased 7% with core revenues up 8.5%. Core operating margin expanded 175 basis points while reported operating margin was up 60 basis points to 19.5%. Our water quality platforms core revenues grew approximately 10% with robust growth in our analytical instrumentation, chemical treatment, and ultraviolet treatment businesses.","Hach had an outstanding quarter with growth across most major product lines. Sales in the U.S. and Europe grew double digits as the team's application of DBS growth tools such as funnel management and transformative marketing continued to drive share gains. We've built on this momentum by launching our breakthrough water quality testing system the SL1000 Portable Parallel Analyzer, or PPA in over 40 countries. Notably the PPA's ease-of-use has a ready started to change the way our customers perform critical water quality tests making it one of the most important new products in the market.","At ChemTreat, we saw a robust demand for our chemical treatment solutions and services in both North America and Latin America. ChemTreat's consistently strong performance is a direct result of its targeted investment in Feet-on-the-Street and development of its best-in-class sales force. The ChemTreat team has done a fantastic job implementing this approach in Latin America with its most recent acquisition Aguasin, which grew more than 20% in the quarter.","Gilbarco Veeder-Root crew midfielder gets driven by strength in China and the U.S. In U.S., upcoming EMV regulation changes drove over 20% growth in point-of-sale solutions and dispensers. We're pleased that customers have continued to make Gilbarco their supplier of choice when implementing these necessary payment system upgrades.","Turning now to Life Sciences and Diagnostics. Revenues grew 2% with core revenues up 5%. Core operating margin expanded 115 basis points and reported operating margin was 12.7%, which was negatively impacted by one-time non-cash charges related to the recently closed acquisitions of Devicor and the Siemens Microbiology business, which is now known as Beckman Coulter MicroScan. Core revenues in our diagnostics platform grew at a mid-single-digit rate. At Beckman Coulter diagnostics, core sales were up mid-single digits led by double-digit growth in our immunoassay and urinalysis product lines.","In the U.S., increasing customer utilization and higher win and retention rates help drive mid single-digit growth for the third consecutive quarter. This improvement in win and retention rates is as an example of the team's persistent focus on product innovation and enhancing the customer experience over the past 3plus years. Beckman Coulter is a fantastic example of how thoughtful application of DBS growth, lean and leadership tools can make a good company even better. We hope you'll join us in Vallejo, California for our Investor and Analyst event in June to hear more of this terrific story.","In January, Beckman closed the previously announced acquisition of MicroScan. MicroScan expands our well-established footprint in hospitals and reference labs with a suite of highly accurate automated instruments and consumables that help identify infection causing bacteria and determine appropriate antibiotic treatments.","Radiometer's core sales increased high single digits, its13th consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth or better. Demand was solid across all product lines led by double-digit growth in blood gas and AQT consumables. During the quarter, we expanded our AQT testing menu in Europe with the launch of procalcitonin assay or PCT. PCT detects life-threatening sepsis infections on site in operating rooms and other critical care centers enabling doctors to provide timely antibiotic treatments and ultimately save more lives.","Sales at Leica Biosystems were up high single digits led by Advanced Staining, which grew over 20% in the quarter. We posted double-digit growth in the U.S. where the stabilizing reimbursement environment resulted in improved capital spending. We were also encouraged by a strong start at Devicor, an acquisition we closed last December where reinvigorated product portfolio and implementation of DBS tools, helps to drive approximately 10% growth in the quarter.","Core sales in our Life Science platform increased mid-single digits with solid performance in the U.S. and Europe. Notably we saw China sales return to growth in the quarter. SCIEX score sales grew double digits led by strength in clinical and applied end markets. Strong commercial execution and investments in new products have resulted in meaningful share gains over the past several quarters.","Leica Microsystems core sales declined mid-single digits due to impart to a difficult comparison in Japan where we saw a record shipments ahead of last year's VAT increase. Despite the sales decline, we are confident in Leica steady stream of new product innovation including the DMi8 inverted microscope platform that launched during the quarter. The DMi8 improves customer workflow for industrial applications by enabling users to prepare and change samples more quickly than with traditional microscopes. It also features a configurable design providing one solution for both basic and advanced industrial users.","Turning to Dental; our dental revenue increased 30% with core revenues down slightly due in part to lower volumes related to inventory destocking within our U.S. distribution channels. This occurred across many of our higher-margin product lines and combined with our continued investments in sales and marketing and product development resulted in a 385 basis point core operating margin decline. Robust demand in high growth markets and strength in our orthodontic and value implant solutions were more than offset by the previously mentioned inventory destocking.","That said, we are encouraged by improving sellout data we're seeing in the U.S. market and believe the business will show improving growth trends throughout the course of the year.","Nobel Biocare completed his first full quarter with Danaher and we've made great progress so far while it's still early, we were encouraged by Nobel's mid-single digit average daily sales growth for the quarter. One of Danaher's core values innovation defines our future, certainly rang true at the Biannual International Dental Show in March, where KaVo Kerr Group and Nobel Biocare launched much more than 35 new or updated products. The innovations unveiled ran the full spectrum of dental care from digital imaging to treatment units to consumables. Notably, attendees were able to preview our first integrated Chairside CAD\/CAM solution which will allow dentists to design and manufacture custom prosthetics quickly and easily in their offices.","In Industrial Technologies, revenues declined 2.5% with core revenues up 7%. Our core operating margin expanded 185 basis points while reported operating margin increased 210 basis points to 24.6%. Automation core revenues increased mid-single digits as continued growth in our industrial automation, North American distribution and medical end markets was partially offset by weakness in agriculture. This represents the platform's best quarterly performance since early 2011.","Product Identification core revenues increased high single digits with robust demand for our marking and coding color management and software solutions. Videojet had a solid start to the year delivering high single-digit growth as our substantial and growing installed base continues to drive broad share gains. The team delivered mid-single-digit growth or better in all major geographies with particular strength in Western Europe, China and India. During the quarter, Videojet launched its 1620 and1650 high-resolution micro-printers that enable fast, high-quality printing on very small surfaces. This technology is essential in such industries as electronics and personal care where legibility and clarity are critical because consumer safety and industry regulations.","In March, Esko acquired MediaBeacon a leader in digital asset management software. MediaBeacon saves our customers time and money by allowing them to store repurpose and share their digital media efficiently across projects departments and channels. Bringing together these specialized companies equips us better to serve our global network of customers and meet a growing industry demand for more integrated packaging and artwork management tools.","So to wrap up, we had a very good start to 2015 delivering our highest quarter of core revenue growth since 2011. The team's solid execution using Danaher business system continued to drive relative out-performance and enhanced our competitive position. We remain cognizant of a strengthening U.S. dollar and a changing macro environment. However, we're confident that our focus on optimizing our portfolio and seizing high-impact growth opportunities will help us build a better, stronger Danaher in 2015 and the years to come.","We're initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1.01 to $1.05, which assumes core revenue growth of 3% to 4%. We are also updating our full-year 2015 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance to the range of $4.23 to $4.33. We expect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our fourth quarter earnings release in January to reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.07 per share. We continue to expect core revenue growth between 3% and 4% for the full year 2015.","Matt Gugino","Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Lisa, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Scott Davis of Barclays.","Tom Joyce","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis","And ask a little of FX and I think we understand the impact of translation, I think most people do at least for the group overall, but what does that FX really mean for you guys as it relates to global competition, does it change how you think about where you produce and where you ship out over, there is a change or impact of price dynamic at all, or is it really not much of an impact?","Tom Joyce","Well, Scott, I guess we first start and think about FX from a competitive perspective. And it's hard not to think the competitive dynamics shift a little bit in certain markets where the U.S. dollar has strengthened against that local currency. That being said, let's take Europe for example. We continue to perform exceptionally well there we have during the entire shift of the currency, we have seen solid mid-single-digit growth in that market. We know that market generally across a number of our businesses is probably more of a low single-digit market on a core growth business. And so we're continuing to perform exceptionally well and taking share there.","You can look at Japan as another example where those ships have happened and certainly there has been some modest shifts in the competitive dynamics there, but again, our businesses generally in spite of a very challenging environment there. Overall, we haven't seen really any meaningful shifts in the competitive dynamics and we're continuing to perform well. So we start there and think about competitiveness.","Relative to the overall operational footprint, we're going to see currencies move up and we are going to see currencies move down, it takes quite a while to shift your manufacturing footprint. And the day you think you got that right is a day of currency might turn against you and you end up in a very different place than you would hope.","So in general, over a long period of time, we've had a balanced footprint that is provided a certain level of natural hedge for us. Obviously, the shifts here have been far more dramatic and therefore the impacts have read through -- through the P&L. So we continue to put ourselves in the best position possible from an operational footprint putting manufacturing operations in, in the best costs positions that we can with the best logistics and supply chains. But these shifts do not cause any knee-jerk reactions on our part in terms of a repositioning.","Scott Davis","Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up on dental. I guess I don't remember a time were you had, I'm going to call it flattish core growth where you saw, it looks like in the slides core margins down 385 bps was that just a mixed impact of the higher margin step being destocked or is there some other step in there like restructuring or anything else.","Tom Joyce","It really starts with the volume itself. And that volume being slightly up in one side of the business slightly down in another side of the business, but generally it starts with that volume position and then the destocking, yes, in fact was the primary driver relative to the higher-margin products being the areas where we very cooperatively and teaming with our distribution channels made very conscious decision about what we needed to do in the channel from an inventory perspective.","I think what's really important to recognize about that situation is that we track sellout very, very closely with those distribution partners. And we are very encouraged by what we see from a sellout perspective. So we're confident in our competitive positions we understand that we are performing well, those distribution partnerships are working very effectively. This has been going on for a period of time now. We think we're getting towards the end of that. Q2 is probably more of a transition quarter and we are optimistic that we will see better growth going forward.","But back to your question around the margins, it's really that combination of volume and negative mix. Now one last point there because we're confident in our competitive position because in a number of areas particularly outside the U.S., the dental platform is performing extremely well driving anywhere from mid-single digit in certain markets like China growing double digit. We continue to invest in that business. Investing in new products, you heard me talk about the 35 new products across the platform. Investing in sales and marketing, so while we've got some headwind there in terms of doing the right things relative to the channel, we're confident that those investments are going to pay off as time goes on.","Scott Davis","Okay. Great answer. Thanks guys I will pass it on.","Tom Joyce","Thanks Scott.","Operator","And we will go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","Hi. Good morning.","Tom Joyce","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Can we get more into the specs of the TiBX thermal imaging camera for a second.","Tom Joyce","I love the high hard ones.","Steve Tusa","On the R&D and SG&A both up in the quarter. Was there some little bit of a discretionary loading, if you saw the organic growth come through there or is that just kind of normal course?","Tom Joyce","Steve, I would say that we set a course to continue to invest in the highest impact opportunities that we saw from a product development standpoint as well as from a go-to-market standpoint. So we set that course quite a while ago. We had terrific reviews last fall in our strategic plan reviews. I think we got a good sense of where those opportunities were.","And I think on a discretionary basis, we made the call in a number of places where we knew we were doing well, we knew that as things got choppy, continuing to invest and stay the course would ultimately prove out to our benefit on a long-term basis. I think one of the areas I'd point to specifically to that staying that course would be in Europe. Again, where we've seen the slower growth environment and where we've continued to perform above market rates in most of our businesses and that's largely a function of staying the course from an investment standpoint.","It's true today also in our high-growth markets were we have seen a few of our markets on site specifically Latin America specifically Brazil and Mexico, where we've got some challenges there, but we're continuing to stay the course from an investment standpoint. But also making some thoughtful decisions about shifting investments carefully where there is higher growth opportunities and there's some countries right now in Latin America where the teams are doing a terrific job shifting that investment. Stay in the course in China, right now as well staying the course in India from an investment standpoint both of those countries paying off very well for us across a number of platforms.","So staying the course making some discretionary choices even when the temptation is to pull back hard to make sure we take advantage of what's choppy environment.","Steve Tusa","And so I guess on that I'm getting to something in a range of 25% to 30% core incremental for the quarter, which usually you guys is more like 35% to 40%, I mean should that migrate higher over the course of the year, or are we in kind of, are we in a straight off now where organic growth is going to be higher maybe we should expect a little bit lower incremental?","Dan Comas","Steve, I think there are a couple of things going on, some of which Tom alluded to where we are confident we're taking share, we want to sustain those investments. I think the second element is we're having pretty high fall through on the FX hit. We talked about the fall through on FX has been closer to 22% to 23%, so we are feeling some impact on that. But I think it's a combination, but as we went through the quarter and saw the strength, we saw some opportunity to step up some of the investments. And we will navigate that carefully, but if we're in this mode of outperforming vis-\u00e0-vis competition we probably going to take a little more latitude on investors.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And day sales impact on the quarter that's my final one. Thanks.","Dan Comas","And probably, I think the five is probably closer to a four, when you look at days adjusted, which again would be consistent with what we put up in Q4.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Tom Joyce","Thanks Steve.","Operator","And we will next to Steven Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven Winoker","Thanks. And good morning all.","Tom Joyce","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Winoker","Yes. I have no thermal camera imaging questions you can't top that. So let's see, just -- I think from a high level here stepping back for a second, this is another quarter of solid core growth, you guys have been putting us up and talking about gaining share quarter-after-quarter for a long period of time, now.","And I'm just trying to get a sense going forward as of the business model and the extent to which that in these higher gross margins, you think are sustainable or a function more of the cyclical markets think you're in a new norm at this point? How are you looking at that Tom and Dan?","Tom Joyce","Steve, I think we do think that the trajectory that we are on is sustainable. Clearly, we're in some challenging macroeconomic times here. But again, we feel like the investments that we're making in the right places are driving core growth in a number of our businesses and translating into those share gains. And those are also businesses where we have a got \u2013 where we do have good gross margins and we always look at those gross margins and the improvement of those gross margins as indicative of higher value propositions that we're delivering to our customers those are sometimes value propositions associated with new product innovation; sometimes they're associated with improvements in our technical service and support, our ability to get price across a number of our markets.","So this is the model of the Danaher that we are working on building quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year. So that's the way we tend to think about it. And I'll extend that by the way to the way we think about capital allocation, is looking at businesses and opportunities in the market that represent those same characteristics. Good growth opportunities across global markets. High brand preference to professional and users representing solid gross margins and the ability to build sustainable business models with strong consumable streams that really speak to a level of resilience and ultimately competitive advantage. So that's the playbook.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And then let me ask the obligatory M&A question following your capital deployment point, which is a little bit different though this time, right, we are hearing commentary from other CEOs on how pricey they view the current environment. So how are you thinking about that how is your outlook changing, if at all?","Tom Joyce","I don't know that our outlook has changed very much Steve over the last couple of quarters. Clearly outstanding businesses with a number of the characteristics that I mentioned just a few minutes ago are our assets that are well-valued in the marketplace. And those assets while highly valued tend to be outstanding businesses with great long-term opportunities for growth. So I'm not sure we've seen much change in that, but we continue to be very encouraged by the conversations we're having and the funnels that we have across the businesses we have made some progress here in the first quarter deploying $0.5 billion and we are optimistic about more to come.","Steven Winoker","Okay. Great. See you in Brea. Thanks.","Tom Joyce","Thank Steve.","Dan Comas","Thanks Steve.","Operator","And we will go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Yes. Thanks. Good morning.","Tom Joyce","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Yes. I just want to come back to the dental destock. Inventory movements are something we've heard from other companies. It doesn't feel like it was elsewhere, but did you see any of that dynamic elsewhere across the portfolio.","Tom Joyce","Nigel, I can't think of \u2013 not to suggest there couldn't be a pocket here or there, but in general anything material across any of the other segments, I would say no. We're not hearing much of anything in that regard.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And I just want to pick up on Steve's points on capital allocation rather than thermal imaging. You mentioned in the prepared remarks, the ambition to keep raising dividends and is that an ambition to raise a dividend payout ratio or dividend in line with earnings.","Dan Comas","Nigel, I think the expectation that we would in the intermediate term, continue to raise it faster than overall earnings and cash flow growth. But that's not within expectation of sort of getting to a market yield, but getting to a more meaningful yield.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And you have a target payout ratio over time?","TomJoyce","Well, I mean if you think of the market 2% to 2.5% may be if we were half of that in time, 3 to 5 years that might not be a bad place to be.","Nigel Coe","Okay, great. And then just finally congratulations on the news on the NetScout transaction this morning. Is the impact of that transaction built into \u2013 I know it's not built into organic growth guidance, but is it baked into your EPS outlook and how do you expect the EPS impact of that transaction to play out?","Dan Comas","Nigel, first of all, very good news, I mean that really is the long pole in the tent to get to closing still some other a few other things we need to get through, but it's much more common today that we get to a close here early in the summer. It is not factored in. A lot of that will depend ultimately whether we do a spin or a split. Based where their stock is trading today if we did a split, on an annual basis, it would approximately wash. So the earnings we would get \u2013 we would give up there would reduce our share count and would be roughly an equal offset. Now that may impact first half second half, but an annual basis would be roughly a full offset.","Nigel Coe","And core growth accretive by about 50 bps in the second half of the year? Thanks.","Dan Comas","While as we mentioned orders are very good in the communications business in the first quarter and the last couple of quarters, quarters are up 20%. So I don't think it necessarily will be accretive to revenue growth in the back half, it would be accretive in the first half on a pro forma basis, but wouldn't expect that to impact the second half of that business is definitely building.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Very good. Thanks Dan.","Operator","We will go next to Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Good morning, guys.","Tom Joyce","Hi, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Hey, could you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the mix between equipment and consumable growth? And then on the equipment side specifically, you talked about the product innovation sales and marketing clearly you are getting some share in some places, but it seems like other guys are also struggling just with customers' willingness to spend right now. And it seems like you're overcoming that can you just maybe give a little sense of what you're hearing from customers as you're having more success getting them to step up and buy.","Tom Joyce","Shannon, we're very encouraged by what we see in the balance of growth both in the equipment and the consumable side. Both of those \u2013 both sides have posting good growth. That obviously bodes well for continued performance because as we build that install base, across the number of the businesses those annuities streams that accrue to the consumables business obviously are very important to the resiliency of the business model and also to margins.","Relative to your question about customers willing to spend in CapEx, I would say we have a number of examples where even in challenging markets our teams are performing quite well and seeing great penetrations in terms of the installed base, I would point to the Videojet business and the performance there. The continued growth of that installed base in the consumable stream. Clearly, what we've seen on the diagnostic side a little bit more favorable environment in terms of diagnostic utilization. The macro indicators around the healthcare market are improving marginally quarter-over-quarter. So we're seeing a little bit of loosening in capital spent in hospital environment.","As I mentioned, we saw the first quarter returning to growth in Life Science in China, which is also encouraging that's more of an equipment market than a consumables market. So I think there's a number of places we point to where we're seeing our teams execute extremely well in gaining share driving and installed base without necessarily strong tailwinds from market perspectives.","Dan Comas","And Shannon we were in the quarter equipment we were up mid-single-digit, which was the best quarter we've had in equipment we probably have to go back maybe almost 2011.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Interesting. All right, thanks. And then maybe just a follow-up on CID, so Videojet clearly still gaining from share, but overall that market actually just seems like one of the better places to be right now. Is there \u2013 are there certain verticals that are particularly good there or favorable things you're seeing in the overall market.","Tom Joyce","I think Videojet has performed pretty well across a number of their verticals. When you look at \u2013 for the food market, when we look at the beverage market broadly defined packaging overall, clearly a very competitive market, but one where the Videojet team both through a combination of product innovation and a number of improvements using DBS growth tools have driven an enhanced go-to-market model. There clearly gaining share. And they have over an extended period of time.","If we look back really through the cycle VJ has continued to perform above the market growth rates on a consistent basis and again a combination of product innovation and go-to-market execution really has contributed there. But yes, I think to the vertical end markets they are good, steady, verticals and VJ is taking advantage of those.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Great. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","We will go next to Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. Thank you.","Tom Joyce","Hi, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. I just wanted to follow-up on your comments beginning a changing macro environment because your tone across the businesses sounds pretty good. So I just wondered if you're seeing that changing macro play into your own orders today in parts of T&M or industrial tech. And maybe just any color on how sort of in recent months, you've seen the short cycle industrial demand moving.","Tom Joyce","Sure. I think when we talk about the macro, it's probably easiest to articulate that Julian on a geographic basis. And some of the changes that we've seen have clearly been in Latin America for one where we have seen some significant weakening in that market. Clearly Russia again a much smaller position fortunately for us, but a challenging market there. China while still a very good market we are performing quite well in that market. You've obviously read the headlines about a little bit of softening there from GDP growth rates of the past.","So we see those shift, on the other side, we've seen some geographic markets improve. India being one, again, teams performing quite well there. So I think that's one way to look at it. Europe is still steady, but again, we think we are outperforming in that market. So I think those would be a few of the things that we would point to.","On the short cycle industrial side, really Dan \u2013 Daniels teams a number of those businesses automation we talked to a little while ago really are performing very well. And that's really just a function again of I think a combination of new product innovation in a number of places as well as is good day today go-to-market execution.","Dan Comas","And Julian, I would add \u2013 just you asked about very recently. I think similar to some other companies, we did seeing some pockets in March in the U.S., particularly in the U.S. in the equipment a little bit of softness, it's hard to tell if it's any trend through the first half of April we are pretty much in line here. But if there was any slight shift here in the last 4 to 6 weeks I would say the U.S. equipment piece is slightly weaker.","Julian Mitchell","Great. And then just my second question around the sort of relative appeal of valuations for acquisition in the healthcare and sort of non-healthcare sides of the business. Particularly I guess with regards to industrial tech was certainly on organic growth you see on a much more stronger footing today, how you seeing evaluations in that arena and is that area somewhat more attractive now because we've got the core really firing again.","Dan Comas","Julian, its overall pretty balanced as Tom alluded to nothings inexpensive right now. But there are some good assets out there both on the healthcare on the industrial side that we are active around. I wouldn't put up a highlight more to one space versus the other.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman","Yes. Good morning.","Tom Joyce","Hey, Rich.","Richard Eastman","Can I just \u2013 Tom, could you just double back for a second on the dental business, I'm curious within North America with the destocking phenomenon that you saw here in the quarter given consumer incomes up and disposable personal income is up and spending is up. I'm curious, is there anything structural in North America on the dental side of your business that's creating the destock, and maybe you could share with us just with the sell-through stats are that you are watching.","TomJoyce","Rich, I would not say there's anything structural about our business or our position relative to the North American market. We would agree that the market is improving marginally based on a couple of the things you mentioned around consumer spending and discretionary income and so on. This is more a cooperative agreement with our distribution partners where we've \u2013 where we're working with them to ensure the channels are right-sized from an inventory perspective.","From a sell-through perspective, we see mid-single-digit are moving from low single-digit to the lower end of mid-single-digit kind of sell-through coming out of the channels to the end user. So and we know that based on how our products are performing specifically as well as how the categories are improving. So that reinforces our belief that we are well-positioned and that there's nothing structurally going against us in terms of our position in the market.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then just a quick question for Dan as a follow-up. It appears to me we do some discount basic math against the TechComms, NetScout transaction as its pending and given NetScout's stock price and may be TechComms EBIT as it finished the year in 2014, is there a scenario where this plays out that that transaction and the buyback given NetScout valuation here that buyback of Danaher shares that that's actually accretive to EPS? Because it looks like you could use a math that would show maybe $0.10 accretion from that transaction.","Dan Comas","Rick, if you look backwards, if we would've closed the deal given the respective stock prices are today and we did a split looking backwards it would be accretive. But because of the building backlog in order book, if I look over the next 12 months it would be about a wash.","Richard Eastman","Okay.","Dan Comas","We are going to be \u2013 we were down double-digit Q4 down to double-digit Q1, we expect better performance probably getting to around flat here in the second quarter, but given what we are seeing in the order book and the backlog, we expect growth in the back half year when you factor that in, it changes the economics and the buyback a little bit.","Richard Eastman","Okay. I see. Okay, all right. Well, thank you.","Tom Joyce","Thanks Rich.","Operator","And we will go next to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro","Good morning, guys. Thank you. Question about Europe. I think you guys said that it had mid-single-digit growth in that region and it's slightly outpaced the end market growth like-for-like. So I was curious, if you could maybe give us a little color as to where you think the implied share gains are happening. ","Tom Joyce","Thanks Isaac. They're coming in a number of places. Clearly in our environmental segment, performance at Hach would be one of the places that would we point to that's done an excellent job. Again, a continued focus on investment in that market both in terms of new products as well as in terms of Feet-on-the-Street. I think a good example there also of approaching those investments across multiple verticals are end markets. So strength in both the municipal side and interesting particularly on the industrial side. So I think good performance there. The PID business particularly Videojet, I think continuing to perform well there. So it's fairly broad based.","Isaac Ro","Got it. Okay. And then just may be a bit more of an open ended question on capital allocation. Just sort of curious, if you could talk to the extent that your deal funnel has evolved since you took over in the last fall, any things you could really highlight to help us appreciate how you are looking at acquisitions going forward just general themes that might help us appreciate what you're doing.","Tom Joyce","Sure. I think what we are really trying to do Isaac as we look at markets and companies in those markets platform by platform is ensure that we are looking for the best opportunities to strengthen our existing platforms strategically. I mentioned when we were together in December that we are much more focused on the existing five segments and nine strategic platforms as they exist today and going deeper into those individual segments strengthening each of them in terms of their competitive positions as opposed to going wider to the right or to the left. So I think that's probably the primary focus that we have across each of the platforms is looking for the best opportunities to strengthen our positions in the markets in which we participate today.","You see a couple of examples there recently, right? You look at Siemens micro, how that strengthened our position at Beckman. If you look at Devicor, how that strengthened our position in the workflow of anatomical pathology. Most recently MediaBeacon in our PID platform and the way that strengthened the value proposition of managing digital assets to brand owners all good examples of strengthening a competitive position in the places we play today.","Isaac Ro","Got it. Thanks a bunch.","Tom Joyce","Thanks Isaac.","Operator","And we will go next to Andrew Obin with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin","Yes. Good morning guys.","Tom Joyce","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just a question on environmental. Could you just talk a little bit more detail core growth was just really strong. How much of it was end market dynamics and how much of it was you guys just taking market share or putting new products into the market.","Dan Comas","Well, particularly and water quality where were up almost double-digit. It's very hard to think the market is growing more than 3% to 5%. As Tom alluded to we were exceptionally strong in Europe up over double-digit. Again, at least for the quarter that would probably be at least 2X what the market grew in that quarter.","Andrew Obin","Got you. And as I look at Life Science and Diagnostics once again core growth just seems to accelerate. Why would, can you talk about the momentum until the second quarter and second half of the year, particularly it seems U.S. consumer is improving with lower energy prices or at least it should improve. Why would core growth slow down into the second half during given those fundamentals and given that Beckman Coulter has very nice momentum at this point.","Dan Comas","Andrew, I'm not sure we're suggesting much of a slowdown we were a little bit over 5% and as we said in December and January, 3% to 4% of the year that segment could be more in that 4% to 5% range.","Andrew Obin","Got you. But what I'm saying is why, sorry just to rephrase. It just seems that 5% could be sustainable or better given the consumer trend and given Beckman Coulter finally executing quite well. That's what I don't --","Tom Joyce","We are certainly on a good trajectory there. It is also probably important just to know quickly that there was an impact of days here in the first quarter we have a high proportion of certainly the diagnostic business that is represented on the consumable side of the house and the consumable side of the house is where you get a little bit more of the bump on a days basis. So there's a little bit of a factor there Andrew as well.","Andrew Obin","Got you. Thank you very much.","Tom Joyce","Thank you.","Operator","And it appears we have time for one more question. We will go to our last question from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks good morning.","Tom Joyce","Hi, Brandon","Brandon Couillard","Tom with respect to the Life Science business in China, could you quantify the growth in the period. And perhaps peel back the onion in terms of where you saw the strength and do you feel like the research budget is particularly around high-end instrumentation are maybe starting to loosening up a little bit?","Tom Joyce","Thanks Brandon. We saw a mid-single-digit growth in China and Life Science. Again the first really good signs of life there in terms of growth in the last few quarters. So we are encouraged by that. I think we've reached a point of probably stability there a lot of what the government has done relative to the scrutiny that they applied around tenders. We think is sort of now reached a kind of a level set or a steady-state in the market. There is we believe a little bit of a lift in spending overall as well. We are in the last year of the 12th fifth year plan. And usually you get a little bit of a bump from a spending standpoint in that regard.","And in general, as we said for a long time now, we really believe quite strongly in the structural drivers of that market that there will be continued investment over time in the Chinese market in Life Sciences. And we've seen a number of examples of where the government maintains a consistent outlook that that's an important segment for investment. As our number of other segments that where we are well-positioned like in environmental, like in different segments of healthcare and diagnostics as well as in dental.","So we think if we were to choose some segments in China where the government spending is likely to continue to be a focus, we think we've chosen those that are probably best positioned.","Brandon Couillard","Super. Thank you.","Tom Joyce","Thank you, Brandon.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to Matt Gugino for any closing or additional remarks.","Matt Gugino","Thanks for joining us everyone we are around all day for questions.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt Gugino, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Gugino, you may begin your conference.","Matt Gugino","Thanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call today are Tom Joyce, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Comas, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I\u2019d like to point out that our earnings release, a slide presentation supplementing today\u2019s call and the reconciling and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available in the Investor section of our website, www.danaher.com under the heading Financial Information-Quarterly Earnings and will remain available following the call.","The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investor section of our website later today under the heading Investor Events and will remain archived until our next quarterly call.

The replay number is (888) 203-1112 U.S. and (719) 457-0820 internationally and the confirmation code is 1202913.","During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Please refer to the supplemental materials and our annual report on Form 10-K when it is filed for additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance.","Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and accompanying presentation to earnings, revenues and other company-specific financial metrics relate to the fourth quarter of 2014 and relate only to the continuing operation of Danaher's business, and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year.","I\u2019d also like to note that we\u2019ll be making some statements during the call that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings.","It is possible that actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Joyce","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We were very pleased with the strong finish to 2014. The Danaher Business System continue to enhance our competitive advantage driving market share gains, solid core margin expansion and record free cash flow generation.","For the full year our targeted organic investments help drive 3.5% core revenue growth and our total revenue is now just shy of $20 billion. These investments in new products and go-to-market initiatives enabled us to increase market share in many of our businesses, including Fluke, Hach, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Radiometer, AB SCIEX, Implant Direct and Videojet.","From a portfolio optimization perspective, 2014 was also a very busy year for Danaher. We announced or closed 18 acquisitions for nearly $4 billion, improving our market-leading positions across the portfolio. Most notable among these are our two large deals, Nobel Biocare and Devicor, which closed in December.","We also announced the combination of our Communications business with NetScout, which we believe will better position these two highly complimentary businesses for long-term success.","Finally, we divested the electric vehicle systems and hybrid product lines within our automation platform. Going forward, we remain focused on building a better, stronger Danaher by utilizing our robust balance sheet and smartly deploying our $8 billion plus of acquisition capacity.","In 2014 we generated a record $3.2 billion of free cash flow and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 122%. This represents the 23rd consecutive year in which our free cash flow exceeded net income, an important metric that represent the quality of the earnings we generate. We also returned more of this cash to shareholders, increasing our annual dividend to $0.40 per share from $0.10 per share.","Turning to the fourth quarter, revenues grew 3% to $5.4 billion, while organic revenue grew 4%, exceeding our expectations. More than half of our platforms delivered mid single-digit core revenue growth, including T&M Instruments, Water Quality, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, Diagnostics, Life Sciences and Product ID. Acquisitions increased revenues by 2.5%, while currency translation decreased revenues by 3.5%.","From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets increased at a mid single-digit rate. Performance was mixed with solid results in China and double-digit growth in the Middle East, partially offset by slowing growth in Latin America and a high teens decline in Russia.","In the developed markets, both the U.S. and Western Europe, grew at a mid single-digit rate, an acceleration from the low single-digit growth experienced in the first three quarters of the year. Sales in the U.S. increased at the fastest rate since the second quarter of 2011, with our Gilbarco Veeder-Root and Life Sciences platforms up more than 10%.","Our fourth quarter gross margin was 52.5%, excluding the impact of productivity initiatives. Core operating margin increased 70 basis points, with three of our five segments improving greater than a 100 basis points. Our reported operating margin declined 50 basis points to 16.4%, due primarily to increased productivity charges and the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions. In total, we spent approximately $155 million on productivity initiatives in the fourth quarter.","For the full-year, our gross margin was 52.4% and our gross profit improved nearly $500 million. This allowed us to increase our combined investment in R&D, in sales and marketing over $200 million from 2013, while expanding core operating margin 65 basis points.","We reported fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS of $1.04, which compares favorably to our previous guidance of a $1 to a $1.04, and represents an increase of 8% year-on-year. For the full year, adjusted diluted net EPS was $3.68, also up 8% from 2013.","Now turning to our five operating segments, Test & Measurement revenues increased 1.5%, while core revenues were up 0.5%. Reported operating margin improved 130 basis points, while core operating margin declined slightly.","Core revenue in our instruments platform increased at a mid-single-digit rate with growth in most major geographies. This was the platform\u2019s highest quarterly growth rate in over three years, driven by improving market conditions, organic investments and new product innovations such as Fluke Connect.","Fluke core revenues were up mid-single-digits for the second consecutive quarter, with our core industrial and biomedical product lines, each increasing at a high single-digit rate or better. Distribution sellout in North America accelerated sequentially, growing at a high single-digit rate. Demand in Europe was also healthy.","At Tektronix, core sales were up mid-single digits, representing the highest quarterly growth rate since the third quarter of 2011. Demand was strongest in North America with solid growth in the military and government, optical and semiconductor segments.","During the quarter, Tektronix launched the RSA306 radio frequency spectrum analyzer, a portable USB powered device, which offers as much functionality as a bench-top equipment, allowing engineers in the field to ensure radio frequencies of free of distortion and interference.","Our communications platform core revenues decreased at a double-digit rate. Mid-single-digit growth in our security solution and network enterprises businesses was more than offset by a decline in network management solutions where we continued to experience delays from our North American wireless carrier customers.","Despite the weakness on the topline, we were encouraged by our book-to-bill ratio, which was almost 1.2 times for the second half of 2014. And we believe our communications platform will return to growth in 2015. We continue to expect a combination of our communications business with NetScout to close in mid-2015, subject to approval by NetScout shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse change with respect to either our communications business or NetScout.","At Arbor, North American sales increased over 25%, with robust demand from enterprise security customers. During the quarter, Arbor further strengthened its presence in the enterprise segment with the launch of Pravail Security Analytics. This scalable cloud-based solution allows organizations of any size to detect and view attacks on their global network in real time and in greater detail than ever before.","Fluke Networks saw double-digit growth in its network installation tools and enterprise systems products. FNET bookings also grew at a double-digit rate, surpassing $100 million in the quarter for the first time in its history.","Turning to our Environmental segment, revenues grew 5.5% with core revenues up 5%. Segment operating margin declined 330 basis points, primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions and incremental productivity charges. Water quality core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by robust growth in our analytical instrumentation and chemical treatment businesses.","Hach had another outstanding quarter, with growth across most major product lines. U.S. municipal sales were up high single digits, as customers are increasing their maintenance project budgets. Sales in China were up over 20%, driven by the government\u2019s continued focus on environmental protection. And last quarter, we highlighted the SL1000 Portable Parallel Analyzer, a breakthrough product that simplifies the water quality testing process.","Hach\u2019s new product introductions, including the SL1000 have exceeded expectations, with revenue from new portable lab products tripling from 2013. ChemTreat reached another sales milestone in December, achieving 400 million in annual sales for the first time. ChemTreat has now nearly doubled in size from its acquisition in 2007. Notably, this has largely been organic, the result of the development and application of their best-in-class go-to market model.","Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew mid-single digits, as sales of point of sale solutions and dispensers in the U.S. increased over 30%. GVR's comprehensive product suite has helped to make a deferred solution among customers, looking to upgrade their payment systems to comply with upcoming EMV security requirements. Sales were also robust in China, where demand for GVR\u2019s vapor recovery and dispenser products grew double digits.","Moving to Life Science & Diagnostics, revenue increased 3% with core revenues up 5%. Core operating margin improved 135 basis points. For the full year, core operating margin expanded 110 basis points. This marks the fifth consecutive year, segment core operating margin has improved over a 100 basis points.","Core revenues in our diagnostics platform grew mid-single digits, with healthy demand in both the high-growth and developed markets. For the third consecutive quarter, core revenues at Beckman Coulter increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by immunoassay, chemistry and urinalysis solutions. Beckman also experienced strength in their automation business where new product such as Power Express drove record December shipments.","The positive momentum in the U.S. continued, with our sales team achieving record customer retention and win rates, leading to mid-single-digit growth. Beckman received 510(k) clearance for the Vitamin D Total assay on its access line of instruments. This represents a significant addition to Beckman\u2019s bone metabolism testing menu, as nearly 1 billion people in the world are estimated to be Vitamin D deficient.","Beckman also introduced four immunosuppressant drug assays, allowing doctors to better monitor therapeutic drugs in transplant recipients. Radiometer\u2019s core revenues were up approximately 10%, with HemoCue sales increasing double-digits and AQT growing over 35%.","2014 marked Radiometer's 10th anniversary with Danaher. The results over the past decade have been extraordinary with the team increasing revenues more than 2.5 times to nearly $800 million, while tripling operating profit.","Leica Biosystems core sales were up high-single digits, with healthy demand across our entire suite of anatomical pathology instrumentation and consumables. Advanced staining finished the year, particularly strong in the U.S., placing a record number of Bond systems in the quarter. In December, Leica Biosystems acquired Devicor, a leading provider of minimally-invasive biopsy systems and consumables used in breast cancer diagnostics. This acquisition moves Leica further upstream in anatomical pathology to the biopsy, providing better sample control and delivering higher levels of diagnostic quality and confidence.","Core revenues in our Life Science platform were up mid-single digits, led again by the U.S. and Europe. AB SCIEX core revenues grew mid-single digits with strength in clinical, pharma and applied markets. We've been pleased with the market reception of our new 6600 TripleTOF SWATH Acquisition 2.0 software with demand exceeding expectations since launch in June of last year.","Those of you who attended our Investor Day last month heard about OneOmics AB SCIEX\u2019s innovative partnership with Illumina. OneOmics brings together next-generation sequencing and proteomics data in the cloud to help advance research across multiple diseases such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's and heart disease. This unique solution has received significant attention in the research community and was named one of the top 15 inventions in 2014 by the Analytical Scientist magazine.","Leica Microsystems core sales increased mid-single digits with growth across all major product lines. The confocal line of microscopes continues to garner industry recognition with the latest SP8 STED 3X receiving a Top 10 Innovation award from The Scientist Magazine. The STED further advanced its research in important fields such as immunology by providing scientist a 3D view of previously unobservable details of living cells.","Turning to Dental; segment revenues increased 6%, while core revenues were up 2.5%. Our core operating margin improved 185 basis points. As we previously mentioned, during the quarter we closed on the acquisition of Nobel Biocare. We are excited to have Nobel Biocare as part of the Danaher team and the business end 2014 with its seventh consecutive quarter of core revenue growth. While still very early, we've been pleased with the feedback from both associates and customers and we look forward to sharing further updates on Nobel\u2019s performance with you in the coming months.","Dental consumables core revenues were up low-single digits with 30% growth in China and the Middle East, partially offset by continued weakness in the U.S. Implant Direct, our value-oriented implant business continues to perform well growing double digits. During the quarter we expanded our endodontic product line with the launch of ElementsFree, a cordless hand tool featuring motorized extrusion and precise temperature control, giving endodontist unmatched accuracy and flexibility to perform complex procedures, such as root canals.","Dental technologies core revenues were up low-single digits, led by double-digit growth in hand pieces. Last quarter we launched the i-CAT FLX MV, our most recent advanced in 3D imaging. Customer reception has been exceptional with over 100 systems shipped to-date. We also expanded our line of dental surgical equipment with the launch of KaVo MASTERsurg LUX. The KaVo MASTERsurg line is our latest innovation in surgical instruments for dental implants and oral surgery improving productivity and clinical accuracy by enabling dentists to store and program settings for multiple procedures. The MASTERsurg line also provides better surgical command and flexibility with the industry's first wireless foot control.","Moving to our Industrial Technology segment; revenues declined 1%, while core revenues were up 5%. Core operating margin expanded 120 basis points and reported operating margin expanded 310 basis points to 20.4%. Automation core revenues grew at a low-single digit rate, led by strong demand in North American distribution and for industrial automation products in China. This marks the third consecutive quarter of growth for the automation platform.","Core revenues in our Product Identification platform grew mid-single digits, with high-single digit growth in developed markets and double-digit growth in Europe. At Videojet, core revenue was up high-single digits as it continues to gain market share broadly. During the quarter, Videojet launched remote services, the industry's first virtual troubleshooting solution for printers. With remote services, maintenance technicians can now resolve customer problems up to 90% faster than field visits. Innovative solutions such as these help Videojet increase their service contracts more than 20% in 2014.","X-Rite finished the year strong with both sales and orders growing double digits. In December, Pantone announced Marsala as the 2015 Color of the Year with extensive media coverage online, in-print and on TV. The Color of the Year and the billions of media impressions it generates solidifies Pantone's iconic brand and was one of the drivers of high-single-digit growth in X-Rite\u2019s color standards business in 2014.","So to wrap up, we had a strong finish to the year with core revenue growth exceeding our expectations. The Danaher business system helped us to gain market share, while also driving solid core margin expansion and record free cash flow. While cognizant of the current macroeconomic challenges, our investments in growth and productivity initiatives, combined with a robust balance sheet, we\u2019re confident in our ability to outperform in 2015 and beyond.","We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.90 to $0.94, which excludes non-cash amortization expense and certain acquisition-related charges. We are assuming first quarter core revenue growth of 4% or better. We\u2019re also updating our full year 2015 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance, which we now expect to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.40.","The strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our December investor meeting is expected to reduce 2015 earnings by approximately $0.10 per share. We anticipate offsetting approximately $0.05 per share of this headwind from savings associated with the incremental fourth quarter productivity initiatives we highlighted, recent acquisitions, including the Siemens microbiology deal which we expect to close in the near-term, as well as other actions. Core revenue for the full year 2015 is anticipated to grow between 3% and 4%.","Matt Gugino","Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal remarks. Aaron, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will first go to Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Steven Winoker","Thanks and good morning guys.","Tom Joyce","Good morning Steve.","Steven Winoker","Hope you\u2019re staying warm and dried down there.","Tom Joyce","And same to you and to all on the call. Thanks for what might have been a challenging morning for many.","Steven Winoker","I\u2019m sure none of us have missed this, anyway. Core operating margin in T&M and Environmental, could you just walk us through the slight decline in T&M and a bigger one in Environmental. What drove that? Little more detail there would be great.","Dan Comas","Sure Steve. The Test & Measurement in -- obviously the decline this quarter is lot less than it has been in previous quarter and it is largely driven by the communications business, which was again down mid-teen. So a very high contribution margin business and that volume usually impacting Test & Measurement.","Steven Winoker","And then Environmental?","Dan Comas","Environmental, it was pretty clear we were having a very strong quarter both in GVR and across the water businesses. They have a number of growth initiatives and this created an opportunity to accelerate some of that R&D and go-to-market investment here in the fourth quarter. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s indicative of a trend in all. I think it was an opportunity to get ahead of some things given the strength we saw that began early in the fourth quarter.","Tom Joyce","And Steve, just to add to that, on the Environmental side, certainly talking to water analytics businesses, those businesses continue to perform exceptionally well. They have covered virtually every debt they've made when it came to some incremental investment to drive topline and share gains. So when those guys come up with an opportunity to put a little bit more at work to drive growth in share, we tend to be supportive of that if we can see our way to cover and form.","Steven Winoker","Okay, great. And then on currency, maybe you know -- I know we\u2019ve talked about currency a lot in the past. You weren\u2019t able to fully offset that for your guide for the year, just given how bigger drop obviously it\u2019s been even since December. But are we -- should we -- what\u2019s your ability, I think to sort of provide, you think, maybe additional offset during the year? And then secondly, just -- do you have any competitive issues on pricing what not in any of your markets as given there is such a large move in currency and competitor\u2019s ability to price for that?","Tom Joyce","Steve, on the first point, we have -- in no way, we thrown in the towel on the balance of going after that extra $0.05. We\u2019re continuing to challenge the teams as we always do to try to come back on that. But we\u2019re encouraged by the strong start we've had here coming off of the fourth quarter, encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in the early stages here of January, so that feels good. But we know the strength of the dollar is a headwind. We\u2019re doing things proactively as we did using the productivity initiatives to get a piece of that back.","Siemens is obviously going to help a bit there. And I think we\u2019d also get a little bit of help and that\u2019s part of the $0.05 that we\u2019ve clawed back from what we think would be a maybe a little bit of deflation that could help us on some commodity costs and perhaps some freight and transport top cost. So I think we\u2019ve got a few things that give us confidence in getting the first $0.05 back but we\u2019re continuing to work on the balance per share.","Tom Joyce","I think on the second question about competitively, clearly there has been an impact with the euro on our financial results but competitively we have not seen that impact. We said after the third quarter, we thought we were taking share in Europe. We just posted a mid-single-digit core growth number in Europe. I suspect that\u2019s going to be towards the top of the class here as all companies would report. So despite the stronger dollar, we are performing extremely well in Europe right now.","Steven Winoker","All right, guys. I\u2019ll now pass it on. Thanks.","Tom Joyce","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is now open.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Good morning guys.","Tom Joyce","Hey, Shannon.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Hey, just in terms of the strength that you saw in the U.S., maybe a little more color on what particular piece of that might have surprised you most and what you feel the best about continuing?","Tom Joyce","Sure. Well, as I think I mentioned, it was a terrific quarter in the U.S. best since the second quarter of 2011. It was remarkably broad based, Shannon. We saw strength at GVR, saw strength in T&M instruments, the tech and fluid continuing to execute better, saw good sellout associated with the fluid business. The Hach business continues to perform very well with our muni customers, releasing funds associated with projects. And we\u2019re very encouraged by what we saw in Life Sciences with good performance in that platform. So it was a number of businesses that that had a very good finish to the year in the U.S.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","And some times, we\u2019ve had a good fourth quarter and then you kind of catches up a little bit in 1Q. I mean, this was in sense any kind of boost from just kind of year end flush?","Tom Joyce","Yeah. So it\u2019s -- one of my favorite topics, Shannon, in the first week of any January is that we see anything that might cause an air pocket. It looks pretty good from where we sit right now. The early January orders and it is still early, appear pretty good. So we\u2019re encouraged by that and we think we are off to a good start.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","And then just on M&A, the world has got more volatile here in the markets certainly in \u201815. Is that good for you guys from an M&A perspective? I mean, do you feel better about the acquisition environment than you did few months ago or worse? How does that impact you?","Dan Comas","Well, Shannon, generally volatility is kind of a positive for the strong corporate buyer. We\u2019ve seen some of the restrictions being put on private equity here around leverage. That definitely has a favorable impact as well.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Okay. Great. Thanks guys.","Tom Joyce","Thanks Shannon.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Steve Tusa","Hey, good morning.","Tom Joyce","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Can you just talk about what you're seeing in emerging markets and maybe within some of your more cyclical businesses in emerging markets, China maybe specifically?","Tom Joyce","Sure, Steve. We\u2019re continuing to see very good performance in China. But first of all just broadly across high-growth markets, we clearly have seen a narrowing of the delta that we've seen for a long time between the high-growth markets and developed markets in general. Part of that is a function of some of the strength we've seen in the U.S., certainly our execution in Europe where we gained share in the variety of places. It continues to also support good performance on our side on the developed markets.","On the high-growth market side, again helping it to causing a narrowing of that delta, we\u2019ve got a slower position in China in a macro sense. Obviously some weakness in smaller markets where we have less exposure but we see a little bit of impact in places like Russia and Brazil, clearly is in a slower growth mode than it has been in the prior couple of years.","Probably, a bright spot in the Middle East with excellent performance from our businesses. But I see, actually we\u2019ve believe a pretty good macro environment there at least at the moment. In China specifically, Steve, we\u2019ve had very good performance across a number of our businesses, the Environmental business, certainly Hach and GVR performing exceptionally well there.","Our dental business continues to grow double-digits in China and probably the core weak spots remains the Life Science business. We've talked quite a bit over the last number of months about some of the issues there relative to some scrutiny around tenders, some slowing of the release of funding.","But we think there -- that we might think that -- there maybe a point of stability that we\u2019ve reached here and maybe some cause for some improvement here in 2015. Dan was actually just there a week or so ago in China and he may have a couple of thoughts.","Dan Comas","Yes. Steve, just add one or two things. We grew full year in China kind of 8% or 9%. Q4 was a little slower as more like 6%, but I would say the tone there was pretty good. Clearly, Test & Measurement got better through the year, much better second half than first half.","As Tom alluded to all the -- most of the healthcare businesses, Environmental -- Environmental was up double-digit, Dental was up double-digit, Diagnostic was up double-digit on a very large revenue base and Industrial which was negative had returned to kind of modest growth as well.","Life Sciences was down mid single-digit for the full year kind of in that zone in the fourth quarter, but I think that the tone in early January. I think, in part, because 2015 will be the -- is the fifth year of their current five-year plan and they are fundamentally, I think, so very committed as a country to Life Sciences research, I think the tone is little better there as well. I am not saying, we\u2019re going to bounce back to double-digit growth here in Life Sciences, but would not be at all surprised if we turn positive here in \u201915.","Steve Tusa","Great. Thanks for the color.","Tom Joyce","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague","Good morning, gents.","Tom Joyce","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","Hi. Just a couple of quick one here too. Could you elaborate a little bit, Tom, on the comments on U.S. muni? Do you think there is actually a turn going on there or was there just kind of some project activity in the quarter?","Tom Joyce","Jeff, I think, in general, we see some macro strength in the muni market, with some of the situations in a variety of municipalities getting marginally better and that\u2019s allowed some projects to get released.","I wouldn't say that\u2019s the whole story though. The Hach business continues to execute exceptionally well, many of their digital marketing initiatives and their expansion of feet on the street, across both the muni market and the Industrial market, I think is help them to continue to gain share. So I think a combination of a marginally improving macro environment is part of the story and share gains being the other part.","Jeff Sprague","Have you seen any change in kind of seller\u2019s attitude here with kind of all the turmoil in general and kind of the QE in Europe, just any change in tone or activity at this point?","Tom Joyce","Jeff, its hart to point anything specific other than last competition from private equity, which is a positive.","Jeff Sprague","Right. Right. And then could you just elaborate a little bit more on the acceleration you had in Europe? Was there something that stood out? Was it broad based across the businesses?","Tom Joyce","We saw -- it was relatively broad based, Jeff. Life Sciences executed extremely well. We saw good growth there. Our Dental business, but particularly on the equipment side, the Dental business also executed very well and PID, those would be at least three that I would highlight. If I added a fourth, it would probably be the Beckman Diagnostics business also executing very well.","So it was markedly broad, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily think about that as something indicative of a change in the macro environment in Europe. We saw nothing that would perhaps really indicate that. But instead, we just -- we had some teams that, I think, did an excellent job of some new products and we\u2019re really driving their sales and marketing initiatives very effectively.","Jeff Sprague","And that is in Europe for Europe right. There is not any kind of export kick out of there on lower euro, right?","Tom Joyce","That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s revenue into Western Europe, right.","Jeff Sprague","Perfect. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. Good morning.","Tom Joyce","Good morning, Brandon.","Brandon Couillard","Just a quick one on the Nobel deal, do the changes in the FX reality affect, how you view accretion there for the year and any chance you could give us the actual point estimate on the 4Q organic growth to that business?","Dan Comas","Brandon, it won't have much of an impact. They do have some cost base over there as we -- we also have some cost related to some of our other Healthcare businesses. The offset is we all told. We have about $200 million of revenues in Switzerland, so that will be a benefit.","So net-net, neither for Nobel nor the Corporation do we think what\u2019s happened with the Swiss currency. It\u2019s going -- it will be relatively neutral task. That business continues to kind of grow at kind of 2% to 4% clip and that\u2019s been over the last couple of quarters, they were in that zone for Q4 as well.","Brandon Couillard","Excellent. Secondly, on the Dental business, I mean, a number of companies that wanted to strength in the U.S. in the back half of the year? I mean, to what degree at all if you seen any vitality in the developed world, particularly in the U.S. and is there any sign of optimism in terms of an acceleration perhaps this year?","Tom Joyce","Brandon, I think, we\u2019re probably most excited about what we see on the equipment side in Dental. The new product innovation, I think, you saw many of those when we were out in California earlier during the year in 2014.","The digital initiatives and I think, some of the potential that we have as we integrate the components of the workflow that Nobel Biocare can bring to the table along with what the KaVo, Kerr group of businesses bring. I think that\u2019s really where our optimism sits relative to the U.S. Dental market.","On the consumables side, we see it really as a continuing relatively modest growth market. You\u2019ve seen pretty consistent low single-digit growth from us. We do -- we have seen some inventory de-stocking in the latter part of last year that maybe carrying over here in the first part of this year, but generally that our business has continues to perform pretty well and what arguably is kind a slow growth macro environment there.","Time will tell us to whether or not some of this reduction in oil prices that will translate to cost of filling up a tank ends up improving overall consumer sentiment and give us a little tailwind there, but, boy, probably too early to tell.","Brandon Couillard","Superb. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. Thank you. I guess, first of all, I just wanted to see if there was any change in the expectations on core growth by segment for 2015, given you had a pretty good core growth quarter in Q4? And also just on Industrial Tech specifically, you had the highest growth rate pool since mid-2011, similar growth rate in Q3, but a tougher base, so maybe some updates on that?","Dan Comas","Julian, I would say that PID, clearly, the biggest piece of Industrial Tech continues to perform quite well. I don't think they\u2019re really looking for change in that growth trajectory here in 2015.","In the first quarter as we highlighted, we think we\u2019ll do 4% or better. Again, we're talking 3% to 4% for the full year. Our internal numbers right now are rolling up around 4% for the first quarter, but as Tom alluded to, we finished Q4 pretty strong and we\u2019re off to a very good start here in the first three weeks of January.","We also have some extra days here in the first quarter that should be a benefit as well. I think the offset there are two of those extra days are the Thursday and Friday before Easter, which tends to be kind of slow days. Japan which was a big grower last year ahead of the bad increase we\u2019ll likely be down here in Q1 year-on-year.","And as we allude in the call, we expect our tech comp, this will be the last we think really poor quarter for that business similar to what we saw in the second half of 2015. We\u2019re encouraged by what we are seeing in terms of bookings but from shipments we are going to have a tough Q1 as well. But all up, things are looking pretty good out of the gate here or early in the first quarter.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks and then just secondly. When you talked about the Q1 EPS guidance, I think that was a comment around some M&A charges being excluded. I just wondered if I\u2019d misheard that or if there was anything new in terms of sort of presentation of adjusted earnings?","Tom Joyce","That is correct. I mean consistent with our past practice for deals that are over $1 billion, we call out kind of the early charges, large non-cash charges. So we still have a little bit left in Nobel in the first quarter. And I think that will be about $0.02.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Tom Joyce","Thanks Julian.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Your line is open.","Scott Davis","Hi. Good morning guys.","Tom Joyce","Good morning Scott.","Scott Davis","And excuse me, I doubt in about 10 minutes later if you commented on price and I apologize but is there -- I mean I know your raw material costs are generally lower and it\u2019s not a big deal for you guys, but are you out there with price increases for 2015 or broadly?","Tom Joyce","Scott, if you think about where your question might go specifically , geographically it might go to Europe. And interestingly, we are outperforming in Europe. We think we are taking share in Europe. We saw a broad-based performance across the businesses in Europe.","And so no particular concern there. I think teams are clearly looking very selectively market by market. These currency shifts have not been exclusively in Europe. They\u2019ve been in quite a number of markets. Generally we are pretty well positioned in terms of the functional currency that we transact in. But where there are issues, our teams are carefully looking at those situations and we\u2019ll take price very selectively where we need to or compete on price, if it comes to that.","Scott Davis","I mean, I guess I don\u2019t want to beat a dead horse, but do you anticipate having positive price for 2015 on an ongoing basis?","Tom Joyce","Yes, Scott. And again -- where we will get that, in all likelihood will be the 40% of revenues that comes out in the aftermarket.","Scott Davis","Yeah. That\u2019s what I was alluding to if you are in -- if you are already out there, catalogs et cetera with price increases?","Tom Joyce","Oh yeah. No that\u2019s absolutely right Scott. That -- Those plans were locked and loaded in the fourth quarter and we are on the street, virtually across the businesses right now with those plans and in the market with those numbers.","Scott Davis","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, inverse of Jeff\u2019s question on private equity and competition I mean have you seen the opposite, which means private equity I think for probably the last five years have been buying up industrial and even some healthcare assets. I mean, have you seen those guys come back to the table and say it's -- they are looking to start unloading?","Dan Comas","Scott, they are always in the market place and clearly there are assets out there held in the hands of private equity that we would have some interest in. I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s gotten better or worse here recently, those discussions.","Scott Davis","Okay. And last, last but not least I mean I know you changed your -- the cash earnings. Have you changed internally your hurdle rates at all? I mean historically you guys have had a pretty strict discipline around hurdle rates. I am just wondering and given your lower financing costs as such if that\u2019s dropped at all?","Tom Joyce","Scott, we have not changed our internal hurdle rates, that discipline that we've had over a long period of time remains internally around returns for bolt-ons at three years and broad -- and bigger, larger, more adjacent businesses, new businesses over a five year period. That is discipline has been really important to the overall performance that we\u2019ve demonstrated.","What we have said is that we want to be thoughtful and cognitive in this environment relative to what might be larger transaction that could have significant strategic value for the corporation, where we might need to take a hard look at those returns and the team here and the board. We support making the right decision strategically for the corporation in the event that those returns maybe not where they we might like them to be. But that\u2019s the bridge we\u2019ll cross when we have that opportunity. And we\u2019ll make the right decision that really drives the long-term strategic competitive advantage of platform or our segment.","Scott Davis","Okay. Great. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks guys.","Tom Joyce","Thanks Scott.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Tom Joyce","Hey Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Yeah. So just couple of questions on core growth pretty strong performance across the portfolio ex-T&M but you self alluding to market share gains. It sounds like \u201815 Europe. And I am just wondering is that the case Tom and which businesses would you call out where you are gaining share and perhaps may be if you could comment on whether we are seeing the delayed impact from some of the R&D and marketing investments you have made over the last 12 months?","Tom Joyce","We are continuing to make those investments, Nigel, in sales and marketing and in R&D as I noted in my opening comments. The good performance on the topline and the good gross margin expansion that we\u2019ve seen has allowed us to continue to invest aggressively in growth initiatives around both new product innovation and go-to market, feet on the street. The share gains, as we noted earlier were pretty broad based.","And, yes, they were, in some cases specifically in Europe, couple of the businesses that I mentioned earlier were around our life science platform, our dental equipment business and Product ID, just to name of few.","Nigel Coe","Okay. That\u2019s great. That\u2019s helpful. And then we\u2019ve seen consumables leading the way on topline, I guess this cycle, with equipment lagging behind. Are we seeing any change, I mean, just seeing or hearing about the comments from U.S and Europe, particularly in Life Sciences & Diagnostics, are we seen an inflection point in equipment?","Tom Joyce","We definitely saw a modestly better Q3 and a definitely better Q4 in terms of equipment. So if you look at our 4%, we were 5% aftermarket in 3, or maybe is a little bit over 3 on the equipment side. And that\u2019s one of the better numbers we posted on equipment and that includes our communications business, which came down mid-teens. So if you adjust for that, our equipment business was probably up more like 4 plus. So we are not quite prepared to kind of call it a trend here, but we are encouraged by what we've seen for last four, five months in terms of our overall equipment orders.","Nigel Coe","And that 4%-ex comes would be, with the best in how many years?","Tom Joyce","Probably, you have to go back to the \u201811 recovery.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Middle implicate, right. And then just going back to the comments on the M&A process, little bit of FX and emerging market volatilities, does one that will shake the complacency of sellers? Are you seen any kind of change out from sellers? Are they a bit off spread something now?","Tom Joyce","No, as you know, a lot of this has been just in the last 30, 45 days, I think it\u2019s a little early to tell but it\u2019s hard not to be a little bit more optimistic.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Thanks, Tom.","Operator","And we will take your next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Andrew Obin","Yes. Good morning.","Tom Joyce","Hi, Andrew.","Dan Comas","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just a broader long-term question. If I look at the emerging markets, what\u2019s happening in Russia and Brazil, people are talking about euro going to parity. Do you think you need to change anything about your strategy about your manufacturing footprint for the next several years? Even China is growing at 6%. I\u2019m not sure when was the last time that happened?","Tom Joyce","Andrew, we\u2019ve got a long history of moving manufacturing into lower-cost regions. Not all of that has been into China. In some cases, it\u2019s been into Eastern Europe. In some cases, it has been into India and we\u2019ll continue to position our cost structure, I think in a way that is resilient over the long-term. I think we want to be a little careful not to change our supply chain prematurely or in a disruptive way, not knowing kind of what maybe the sustained currency position is ultimately going to be.","So, I think the teams are doing exceptional job positioning that footprint well for the long-term. And it\u2019s not all about the individual or the cost of individual region. It\u2019s also about the way we execute in any region. And I think we\u2019ve got a number of examples where our business is where that you might say are in higher cost operating regions. In fact, continued to deliver exceptional profitability and have a real competitive advantage because of their cost structures despite their regional positions. So, I think we feel pretty good about where we are.","Andrew Obin","That\u2019s very fair. And just a follow-up question on free cash flow. What should we expect for FY \u201815 versus $3.2 billion you did in \u201914, or if you want to talk about cash flow realization?","Dan Comas","It is our early year. We are very pleased with the way we ended the year in terms of free cash flow. So, I think we would be in the sort of zone here. Again, we have got a benefit in \u201914, given our cash tax rate was fair amount lower than our actual provision for the year. It\u2019s probably too early to kind of make a call on that, where we stand right now.","Andrew Obin","But relatively flat is a good sort of hold for now in the mind.","Dan Comas","I think that\u2019s a good starting point.","Andrew Obin","Thank you so much.","Tom Joyce","Thanks Andrew","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I\u2019d now like turn the program back over to Matt Gugino for any closing remarks.","Matt Gugino","Thanks, Aaron. We\u2019ll be around all day for questions. Thanks for joining us everyone.","Operator","This does conclude today's program. You may disconnect at any time."],"7310":["Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2019  8:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Matt Gugino - Vice President of Investor Relations","Thomas Joyce, Jr. - President and Chief Executive Officer","Matt McGrew - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Tycho Peterson - J.P.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Danaher Corporation's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt Gugino, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Gugino, please go ahead.","Matt Gugino","Thanks, Kathy. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Tom Joyce, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I'd like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call, and the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings.","The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events & Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until October 31, 2019.","During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance.","Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics relate to the third quarter of 2019, and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. All references to individual operating company operating margins exclude the impact of intangible amortization.","We may also describe certain products and devices, which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are available only in certain markets.","During the call, we'll make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future.","These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings, and actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Thank you, Matt. And good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our strong performance in the third quarter as we delivered 5% core revenue growth and solid core margin expansion. We believe our ongoing investments in innovation and commercial initiatives help to continue building sustainable competitive advantages across a number of our businesses.","We also made meaningful progress on our two most recent portfolio moves, the acquisition of GE Biopharma and the initial public offering of our dental business.","During the quarter, we achieved several important milestones related to the GE Biopharma. Earlier this week, we announced that we signed an agreement to sell certain businesses to Sartorius for a purchase price of $750 million. ","The revenue to be divested is approximately $140 million and consists of our label-free biomolecular characterization chromatography hardware and resins, microcarriers and particle validation standards businesses. All of these businesses are part of our life science platform.","While the sale to Sartorius remains subject to certain regulatory approval, it represents a significant step in the GE Biopharma regulatory process. Timing around meeting certain closing conditions such as regulatory approvals can, of course, be uncertain. However, we remain very encouraged by the progress we're making and expect to close the GE Biopharma transaction in the first quarter of 2020.","Additionally, we recently announced that the business will be called Cytiva when it officially becomes part of Danaher. The name is derived from Greek and Latin roots, meaning cell and doing. And everything biopharma customers do relate to the use, growth or analysis of cells.","The name may be new, but the Cytiva logo, or the drop, is actually a reference to the iconic Pharmacia brand of the business going back to the 1960s. Pharmacia was a pioneer in the development of process chromatography and was one of the first businesses to become part of GE Biopharma. We received terrific feedback on the reintroduction of the drop logo as we look to build on its legacy under the new Cytiva brand.","And lastly, we continue to make progress on the financing of the GE transaction. In September, we raised approximately $6.8 billion in euro-denominated debt. We raised this debt at a combined interest rate of less than 1%, with an average maturity of approximately 14 years. We anticipate raising the remaining debt required to finance the transaction prior to year-end.","On September 18, our dental platform, now called Envista, started trading as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker NVST. I want to thank Amir Aghdaei and all of the Envista associates for their contribution. We wish them the very best as they embark on this exciting new endeavor.","Envista released their third quarter earnings earlier this morning and will be holding a conference call at 11 AM Eastern Time to discuss those results. We ask that you direct any questions on Envista's business performance through the Envista team.","So, turning to our third quarter results. Sales grew 4% to $5 billion, with core revenue growth of 5% on a consolidated basis and 6% core revenue growth when excluding the results of our dental segment.","Acquisitions increased revenues by 0.5%, while the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5%.","Geographically, high-growth markets increased high-single digit, with China growing at that rate, while Russia and Eastern Europe both grew double-digits. Developed markets increase mid-single digits, with North America leading the way.","Gross margin for the third quarter was 55.8%, up 40 basis points year-over-year. Operating profit margin was 16.6%, with core operating margins increasing 70 basis points, led by our Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments.","Now for the third quarter results across the portfolio. In Life Sciences, reported revenue increased 6%, with 6.5% core revenue growth. Operating profit margin increased by 60 basis points, with core operating margins expanding 100 basis points.","At segment Life Sciences, we believe we continue to grow above the market as core revenue increased double-digits. We saw strength across most major geographies and product lines as new product introductions continued to contribute meaningfully to core revenue growth.","In particular, we believe [indiscernible] cytometry with the CytoFLEX platform and dry reagents as these innovative product lines are simplifying customer workflows. ","Additionally, Labcyte, the automated liquid handling business we acquired earlier this year, is growing double-digits and has exceeded our initial expectations.","Core revenue at SCIEX declined slightly, in part due to a tough year-over-year comparison as the business grew nearly 10% in the third quarter last year. We saw strength in high-growth markets, and that was offset by softness in North America and Western Europe.","At Pall, the team achieved high-single digit core revenue growth as we saw good performance in both the developed and the high-growth markets. The biotech and aerospace businesses saw the largest increases, offset by continued softness in microelectronics.","August marked the fourth anniversary of our acquisition of Pall. Over the last four years, with the application of Danaher Business System, Pall has accelerated core revenue growth, expanded gross margins by greater than 500 basis points to approximately 55%, and increased operating margins nearly 1,000 basis points to above 25%.","Implementing DBS tools has not only enhanced the financial performance, but also improved operational efficiency, expanded commercial capabilities and increased the cadence of innovation across the business.","Turning to IDT. IDT delivered another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth with solid results across all major geographies. By product line, the business saw particular strength in next-generation sequencing and synthetic biology.","In August, IDT continued to expand its product portfolio in the high-growth areas with the launch of a new product, oPools, the longest strands of ready-to-use DNA on the market.","IDT's proprietary manufacturing process allows them to create DNA at the highest quality levels, enabling scientists focused on developing advanced diagnostic tests and treatments, to generate more consistent and reliable results in their research.","Now moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenues increased 6.5%, with core revenue growth of 8%. Reported and core operating profit margins increased by 100 basis points. DBS-led commercial and operational execution drove performance across the Diagnostics platform.","Beckman Diagnostics had its fourth consecutive quarter of mid-single digit core revenue growth, driven by strength in high-growth markets and increases in North America. A key driver of Beckman's improved growth performance has been its increased cadence of new product introductions.","At the American Association for Clinical Chemistry tradeshow in August, Beckman highlighted a number of these recent innovations, including the DxH 900 high-volume hematology analyzer, as well as the DxA 5000 laboratory automation systems.","The DxH 900, with its early sepsis indicator, has been a key contributor in the improved performance in Beckman's hematology business.","In automation, the DxA 5000, which was launched in Europe earlier this year, recently received 510(k) clearance from the FDA. The system's key benefits of detecting pre-analytical sample quality, increasing turnaround time and reducing the number of manual processing steps from 32 to 4 are driving early adoption and great customer feedback. ","Turning to Radiometer. Core revenue growth increased double-digits led by strong results in China and Japan as we believe the team drove market share gains in our blood gas and immunoassay product lines.","Leica Biosystems also delivered double-digit core revenue growth, led by North American and Japan. Success at Leica is being driven by new product introductions combined with the implementation of growth rooms, one of our most impactful DBS commercial tools.","Growth rooms enable cross functional teams to collaborate and align actions around the businesses' most critical short and long-term commercial initiatives. ","With this focused approach, Leica's core histology and advanced staining product lines delivered mid-single digit core growth or better in each of the last eight quarters. ","Finally, at Cepheid, core revenues increased double-digits across all major geographies and product lines. Next month will mark Cepheid's third anniversary with Danaher and we could not be more pleased with what the team has accomplished.","Since acquisition,, the business has grown double-digits annually to nearly $1 billion in revenue. Gross margins have expanded by 1,000 basis points to approximately 50%. R&D investments have increased by over $50 million annually, while operating profit margins have increased from breakeven to approximately 20%.","Cepheid highlights another powerful example of how running the Danaher playbook by applying DBS to drive growth and expand margins allows for investments back into the business that helps drive compounding returns.","Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenues increased 0.5%, with core revenue growth increasing at 2%. Operating profit margin remained constant, with core operating margins expanding 10 basis points.","In Product Identification, core revenue declined slightly, driven in part by tough prior-year comparisons at Videojet, partially offset by growth in our packaging businesses.","At VJ, core revenue declined low-single digits on a nearly 10% comparison to the third quarter last year. Despite the results of the quarter, we're encouraged by a positive order growth and expect improved performance in the fourth quarter.","Last month, at the annual PACK EXPO tradeshow, Videojet showcased some of its recent instrument and digital innovations. On the instrument side, Videojet highlighted the VJ 7340 laser printer, featuring the smallest marking head available on the market today and allowing for easy integration into existing packaging lines.","Videojet also released Rapid Recover, a digital solution that automatically troubleshoots and diagnoses printer service issues. This functionality builds on Videojet's market-leading service capabilities and improves customer uptime by increasing first-time fixed rates and avoiding costly investigation time.","In our packaging businesses, which include Esko and X-Rite, core revenue increased at low-single digit rates, continuing the improving trends that we referenced in these businesses last quarter. Developed markets led the way, offsetting some softness in high-growth markets.","Finally, at Water Quality, solid execution across the platform drove mid-single digit core revenue growth on top of a double-digit prior-year comparison. ","So, looking at performance by operating company, Trojan core revenue increased double-digits led by North America. The team saw strong performance in the municipal market in both its UV and filtration product lines, driven by high win rates and service expansion initiatives.","At Hach, core revenue increased low-single digits. Strong performance in Europe and North America was offset by declines in China due to a difficult comparison versus 2018 related to China's surface water initiative, Policy 61.","At ChemTreat, core revenue increased mid-single digits, driven by strength in the oil and gas as well as the food and beverage end markets.","In September, many of you attended our water quality platform investor day at Hach in Loveland, Colorado. On that day, we highlighted the key strategic initiatives of the platform. You also saw details on the sustainable business model that's common across Danaher, including strong underlying secular growth drivers, exceptional margin profiles and high recurring revenues. ","The team provided examples throughout the day of customer-focused workflow solutions, innovation and go-to-market execution that we believe have led to share gains across Water Quality.","Finally, the day showcased the variety of tools within the Danaher Business System to accelerate the cadence of innovation and drive sustainable long-term results across the platform.","The presentation and webcast are available in the Investors section of our website and I encourage those who weren't able to attend the event to take a look.","So, to wrap up. We're very pleased by our third quarter performance and the hard work the team has put in throughout the year. It's also worth highlighting the steps we've taken over the last several years to transform the portfolio.","Through acquisitions, we brought in fundamentally higher growth businesses with significant consumables and aftermarket positions. Today, we consider 70% of our revenue to be recurring, with much of it being captive to our installed base and mission-critical to our customers' daily operations.","Combined with our significant organic investments in innovation and outstanding team, the Danaher Business System, we're excited about the opportunity through the end of 2019 and beyond.","So, we're initiating fourth-quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $1.32 to $1.35. We anticipate core revenue growth to be approximately 4.5% which excludes our Dental segment.","We now expect full-year 2019 adjusted diluted net EPS to be in the range of $4.74 to $4.77. Both our fourth-quarter and full-year EPS guidance include the dilution from noncontrolling interest related to the 19.4% of Envista we no longer own.","Matt Gugino","Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Kathy, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Good morning, Tycho. ","Tycho Peterson","Good morning. I'd like to start with the Diagnostics strength. You guys continue to put up great numbers there. Can you talk a little bit about how much of this is driven by the new hematology and automation launches? Can you comment on China? We've heard about some hospital issues there for Diagnostics. And here in the US, we did hear Quest the other day talk about vendor consolidation. Just curious how you think you're positioned as we go through that process with DxA 5000. Thanks.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Sure. Thanks, Tycho. A lot to cover there, starting with hematology. We've talked over the last several months, couple of quarters certainly, and most recently in my prepared remarks, about the impact of our new hematology product line. I think you probably know, Tycho, it's been in the works really since we acquired Beckman. That particular product line was a product line where we had some real challenges. And these new products, the DxH product line, particularly 900 with the early sepsis indicator, is making a significant difference. We have literally turned that business around from a business where we were not happy with our retention and our win rates to the point where now we're very happy with our retention and our win rates. And we're seeing growth in that business now that is having a material impact on the improved performance that you're now seeing from Beckman overall.","Relative to the overall growth of Beckman, however, it's not purely a hematology story. Improvements in our menu across the board, across each of the analytical modalities, improvements in our automation systems \u2013 I noted the DxA 5000 which is also having impact, particularly in labs that are really challenged in terms of throughput and skilled labor where we're reducing the need for skilled labor. It's really all of those things combined that are having impact on seeing that consistent mid-single digit growth rate that Beckman is now improving towards. So, I think it's a combination of things.","You asked specifically about China. We're seeing continued good performance in China. Beckman has always had a strong position in China. It's always been a key growth driver for us and it continues to be so. Clearly, it's is a highly competitive market, but we are extremely well-positioned there and continuing to see good growth, very high retention rates and very solid win rates as well.","You asked about vendor consolidation. And if I caught your question accurately, I think the question was related to North America. And assuming I heard that accurately, clearly, there's always an effort across hospitals today to drive cost reductions. Vendor consolidation is certainly a part of that. But, again, as we look at our win rates and our retention rates across our North American business which is, obviously, an important part of the overall profile of Beck Dx, we continue to see both improved performance there and sustained improved performance. And again, that's underpinning that greater consistency of improvement, in fact, throughout the quarter.","So, hopefully, I covered the water front. If I didn't, Tycho, happy to take a follow-up.","Matt McGrew","Tycho, it's Matt. Tom mentioned Beckman in China, but just to give you some context on Diagnostics overall in China because that might have been part of the question as well. So, from a diagnostics perspective, in China, we were double digit core here in the quarter, just to give you some sense of the overall market over there.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then, one follow-up on Life Sciences, 6.5% core against a 9.5% comp. That certainly stands out. Just curious how you think about the sustainability of that? A lot of that, I guess, Pall up high-single digit as well.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Sure. Tycho, we feel very good about the sustainability of our performance across Life Science. If we step back and we think about kind of Pall side of the house versus Life Science tools, Life Science tools continue to be mid-single digit across the platform. Our underlying businesses like Molecular Devices, like Microsystems, both mid-single digit performance. And then, Beck LS, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, double-digit performance. So, on the tool side, really good performance. Obviously, a little bit more weakness in SCIEX, but we're very encouraged by the order trends that we see there. So, probably only one spot there that was maybe a little bit weaker. But, overall, I'd say the tool side very solid.","And then, across the Pall business and what we would see is really the biopharma side of Pall, again, very good performance there. A solid market that we see continuing to perform well. Our biopharma exposure is now north of a $1.5 billion, most of that obviously coming from Pall Biotech. Pall Biotech saw double-digit core growth in the quarter. That's six quarters in a row of double-digit core growth. And the order trends look very good. We're also seeing good sustained performance across single-use technologies and gene and cell therapies, which are showing double-digit core growth. Admittedly, some of those are smaller portions of the overall portfolio, but really good performance. And we think those are sustainable positions over time, and building. ","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Lastly, could you give us the Pall industrial number?","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Pall industrial, on the quarter, was\u2026","Matt McGrew","Low-single digits, Tycho.","Tycho Peterson","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Derik De Bruin, Bank of America.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Good morning, Derik.","Derik De Bruin","Good morning. Hey, did I catch you correctly, the fourth quarter guidance is 4.5% core growth ex-Dental?","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","That is correct.","Derik De Bruin","All right. Can you sort of walk-through just sort of the market dynamics as we get there? I think that's a little bit lower than what we would've thought on it? I'm just sort of curious what you're sort of like assuming in terms of year-end spending and sort of unpack that, walking through those numbers.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Sure, of course. As you know, I think just stepping back a second, we've had eight quarters in a row of mid-single digit core growth. And we think the fourth quarter is a mid-single digit growth rate quarter as well. However, there are a couple of timing dynamics relative to our most recent \u2013 to our third quarter versus the fourth quarter. So, particularly in Diagnostics where we saw like a biosystems or radiometer at double-digit core growth rates in Q3, little help from the VIT [ph] impact in Japan, those businesses will moderate a little bit off of that double-digit core growth in Q3. And also, a couple of timing issues relative to the Life Science side where we had a big Q3, particularly for Pall, where they were some large equipment orders across biotech and the industrial side that moved from Q4 into Q3.","So, really, we're talking about a little bit of timing impact there between Q3 and Q4, but we feel very good about our execution, very good about the underlying market dynamics across both Life Sciences and Diagnostics as well as across Water Quality and PID.","And when you then look at our fourth quarter guidance in light of the full year, we're still talking about a full year of 2019 at 5.5% to 6%, and that's very consistent with what we talked about for the last couple of quarters. So, in general, we would characterize that fourth quarter, relative to the third, as likely more to do with timing, but still feel very good about where we'll bring in the full year.","Derik De Bruin","Okay. That's helpful. And just out of curiosity, you talked a little bit about Western Europe and what's going on there, and specifically just wondering if some of the bioprocess strength you've seen or some of the stuff you've seen is potentially related to pull forwards in \u2013 because people are worried about Brexit and stuff. We've heard that from other companies recently that there may be some spending patterns that we've seen this year, can you talk about anything you're seeing in the European trends and sort of how that market is shaping up into the close?","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Sure. We are not seeing any sort of unusual procurement behavior in that regard in Western Europe. Europe, overall, across Q3 was performing at about a low-single digit rate. That's down a little bit clearly from the first half. We've seen a bit of softness in certain pockets, like at Videojet, a bit at SCIEX and a bit at like a Microsystems. ","As we look at where those pockets of softness, I think they really speak to some of the overall macro softness in Europe because when we unpack where some of the differences are between the first half and the second half, it largely looks to be around instrumentation and equipment, some of the larger capital spend, some of the OEM customers, for example, in the packaging world, those are the areas where we some of that softness. So, I would attribute that low-single digit performance in Europe a little bit more to the macro softness in Europe than I would some \u2013 any unusual procurement behavior going on one way or the other.","Derik De Bruin","And that's stuff that's not sort of have been into the research labs, it's more the industrial\u2026","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","That's right. Those are the areas that would speak a little bit more to the industrial side of the house. Admittedly, we're not \u2013 with our low percentage of the portfolio that's literally industrially exposed, we're not a terrific proxy, but we can certainly see a few of those pockets, whether it's in North America or in developed Europe where some of that macro slowdown exists. But again those are pretty small pockets.","Derik De Bruin","Great. Thank you.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","VijayKumar","Thanks for taking the question, guys. And congrats on a nice print here. So, Tom, maybe one big picture question for you to start off with. On a pro forma basis, when you look at the assets, some of the comments you made on DBS and how underlying growth for acquired business have improved, if I just look at the numbers, the core Danaher is, call it, a mid singles core. Ex-Dental, that helps your core. And now GE comes in with DBS, this seems to be a solid mid singles. And even if macro were to soften going forward, it seems like that mid-single digit, that stable, strong, mid-single digit piece that should be pretty much intact. So, I'm just curious on that pro forma growth outlook on how you guys are looking at it?","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Well, Vijay, first of all, I think your summary of the portfolio today is an accurate one. We've made tremendous progress in the evolution of the portfolio towards establishing that mid-single digit growth performance. And I think we've done that with businesses that have demonstrated, over time and over cycles, their stability in driving that consistent kind of growth performance.","Now, some of that comes from being in terrific markets with leading positions in those markets, but it also comes from the nature of the balance of sale whereby, as I mentioned earlier, with 70% of our revenue roughly being recurring revenue, largely in the form of consumables that are captive to the instrumentation and with the addition of service and other associated aftermarket, the combination of being in great markets with leading businesses and that strong aftermarket consumables position is what gives us confidence that we built a portfolio that is designed to be sustainable over macro cycles.","Now, that doesn't mean that we are completely immune, as I just mentioned about a couple of soft spots here and there that could be geographic or could be where we have a little bit of exposure to a more industrial-oriented market. But in general, we've built a portfolio to that effect.","And, yes, the addition of the GE Biopharma business is but one more significant step in reinforcing that kind of market position. So, we feel very good about that looking forward into 2020 and beyond.","VijayKumar","That's helpful, Tom. And, Matt, one quick one for you on this fourth quarter guidance. It looks like the guide implies a solid market expansion in Q4. One, am I right in my math on that solid margin expansion and maybe comment on where this is coming from, OpEx versus IGM?","Matt McGrew","Yeah, it's probably going to be a little bit of both on the gross margin side and the OpEx. But the way that I kind of think about \u2013 I think you're right, Vijay. I think the way that we kind of think about the Q4 guide, especially with some of the noise in there with the NCI and the FX, we're kind of talking about 4.5% core growth, kind of a normal solid 35% fall through. And really, that NCI headwind of call it a couple of pennies is really the only change here that we've sort of made to the guide, if you will. But, yeah, I think you're right, we anticipate having pretty good fall through like we normally would expect here in the fourth quarter. I suspect it will be a little bit on the gross margin side and probably with that comes the operating leverage as well.","VijayKumar","Thanks, guys.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Thanks, Vijay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Hi, Scott. How you're doing?","Scott Davis","Great. It's easy covering your company. Every quarter, you put up decent numbers and not exactly sure what you make and what you sell, but it's working.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Scott, you know we love to make life easy for all of the visitors on this call. One of our goals, among many.","Scott Davis","I don't know if I might be the last industrial guy left, but you're not going to get rid of me that easily.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","That's okay. Welcome back. What's up today?","Scott Davis","So, I've got two questions for you, Tom. The first is just the asset sales. Maybe a little bit of color around how this \u2013 was this a compromise with the regulators, was this something the regulators requested, was it US regulators or was it more globally geared? Just a little bit more color on that.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Sure, Scott. Well, when we initially announced this deal, we did it with the clear understanding that regulators were going to do what obviously they would do in a deal of this magnitude, and that that would be done across the span of regulatory bodies from the US to Europe, other countries and certainly to China. And so, eyes wide open that those reviews would take place and that there was always a prospect that there could be a small portion of the GE portfolio or the Danaher Life Science portfolio that the regulators may have questions about.","And so, the sale of the businesses that we announced earlier this week to Sartorius was really a function of what we believe were very constructive discussions with regulatory bodies across the world and with a clear understanding of what the rationales were from their perspective as well as ours, and this is simply something that regulatory bodies along with us came to the point where we thought \u2013 where both parties thought that this made sense. And so, it really was a series of globally-oriented conversations and made sense to take that step.","Scott Davis","Okay. Good color. And then, just since it's the four year anniversary of the Pall deal, just curious to see kind of some of the deltas in the model. Where have things come out versus revenues or things come out versus margins? Doesn't have to be exact numbers, but the pluses and minuses. And kind of at the end of the day, are you going to make the double-digit return promise, assuming things continue in 2020? Once you hit that year five, approaching year six, are you on target to hit the original targets that you laid out?","Matt McGrew","Yeah, Scott. It's Matt. So, I think if you kind of look back at maybe the two core metrics, if you will, that we sort of talk about with deals, if you think about core growth at Pall, so when we kind of bought Pall, I would say it was more of a low-single digit core growth business, in that over the course of, let's say, last, I guess \u2013 like you said, four years here, the team has done a really good job at kind of taking DBS \u2013 in particular, DBS on the growth side and the innovation side and really changing that fundamentally to be more of a mid-single digit plus type growth rate. So, I think you've seen a significant progress on the top line.","As far as kind of OP goes, I think when that business came in, it was kind of a high teens type of OP. Today, we sort of own that business at, call it, a 1000 basis points better than that. So, we've made really good progress on kind of the team coming in there and taking out some of the costs that we knew were there. I think, if you remember, we talked about kind of a cost target at the initial that was kind of $300 million. I think we took that up even to $350 million ultimately. So, from an ROIC perspective, I think that so far as we stand here, I would stay that that exceeds where we thought we would be.","Scott Davis","Okay. Well, congratulations on that. Thank you, guys.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Hey, Doug.","Doug Schenkel","Hey, good morning, guys. So, I guess, first a question on interest rates. So, the interest rate on the Eurobond was under 1%. Recognizing you still need to issue the rest of the debt and probably a good chance it's going to come in at a rate that is at least slightly higher than the Eurobond, it still seems like you're going to have some upside relative to the deal model you shared with the investment community originally. So, by our math, every 50 basis points of lower interest rate translates into about $0.10 of earnings upside. Does that seem reasonable and should we expect you to let this flow through or is there likely to be some reinvestment?","Matt McGrew","Yeah. I think the numbers that you're quoting on the Eurobond are accurate, obviously. I don't think \u2013 and we do still need to do the US deal here. And like you said, I suspect that will probably be at a higher rate, but we will get to that in the fourth quarter.","I think as far as kind of trying to think through the deal model, I think I would say, at this point, we are not trying to update, if you will, kind of the GE accretion. We're, obviously, going to have some moving pieces here. You're going to have a little bit of a headwind, though modest, from the divestitures that we just announced on Monday. Obviously, just talked about likely some favorable financing costs so far on the Eurobond deal. Also, likely to have a business in the GE Biopharma business that when it \u2013 it's had a pretty good year here in 2019. So, I think the way to think about it is we will kind of holistically pull all of that together for you when we do update the guide, so that we can kind of incorporate all of that at one time.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Thank you for that. And very quick follow-up related to the deal as well and following up on the last question on divestitures. Based on where you are in the regulatory process and the fact that you did announce those divestitures earlier this week, how would you characterize the probability that additional divestitures could be required from here on out?","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Well, Doug, as you saw in the announcement \u2013 first of all, those divestitures are pretty modest on a relative basis at $140 million. So, less than 5% of the revenues that we are going to acquire. But, of course, the regulatory process is a fluid one. So, while we believe this was a significant \u2013 a major step towards approval, at this point, we can't comment on this any further. It was an important milestone. But as we commented, we don't expect either this deal to close, nor the actual formality of those approvals to be completed until the first quarter and, therefore, closing immediately following that. We can't comment any further about any prospects for any further actions.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Totally understood. Maybe just a couple on the quarter. First, on Diagnostics, core margin expanded 100 basis points and was ahead of our forecast. Could you talk through some detail on that performance? And specifically, I'd be curious how Cepheid margins are progressing and how growth improvement at Beckman is really contributing to this performance?","And then, just on Pall, it seems like the bioprocessing market is growing broadly at a very strong 15-plus percent rate based on what some of your peers have reported over the last few days. I think you noted that Pall Biotech grew double digits. Is it reasonable to believe that you're growing Pall Biotech at least at that 15% plus level that we're hearing from others? Thank you.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Doug, I'll take the Biopharma piece first and Matt will jump back in on the Dx margins. Yes, the simple answer is, what you are hearing from other sources around the growth in the bioprocessing market overall as being a double-digit growth rate market and a very attractive one, and one by the way that we and obviously others believe is sustainable in terms of its growth prospects, we at Pall are clearly benefiting from that and taking advantage of that opportunity to drive that kind of growth. We did put up double-digit growth within that business, and that's across obviously our filtration business, which is fundamental to biologic drug production, but also includes growth in the really innovative ends of the spectrum around Biopharma which is really around single use technologies which are becoming increasingly important as biological drugs are being produced in smaller and smaller batch sizes for unique patient populations, as well as in the growth areas around cell and gene therapy, which while being somewhat nascent today are going to be significant growth drivers in the future and we are participating in that growth today with outstanding products and I think a series of new products that will be coming over time that we're very excited about.","Matt McGrew","Yeah, Doug. As far as the Dx margins go, in particular in the quarter, I think we had a pretty good performance generally speaking out of all of the businesses, but I would call out both like a biosystems and radiometer. Those are some of our higher margin businesses and, obviously, both of those growing sort of in the double-digit core growth. Certainly helps the margin performance. But, overall, I think it was pretty good with a little bit of a boost here from those businesses that had been kind of sort of high-single digits here year-to-date, turning in kind of a low-double digit performance in the quarter. So, I think that's a big ramp of it.","As far as Cepheid's margins go, again, it's sort of similar to the Pall story. I think the team there has done a fantastic job of really balancing growth, while also focusing on the margin side of it. And they've done a really nice job of kind of embracing DBS and leading from the front. And today, I think when we bought it, it was sort of a \u2013 maybe a breakeven type business from an OP perspective. And today, those margins are, call it, 20% or so from an EBITA [ph] perspective.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi. Good morning and thanks.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Good morning","Steve Beuchaw","I had just a couple for Tom and then one for Matt. Tom, I wonder if you wouldn't mind unpacking the number at SCIEX a little bit. I'd say prospectively, you mentioned that you saw some really good trends on orders. It would be helpful to know a little bit more about what you're seeing. And then, for the quarter, SCIEX is a little bit unique relative to some tools businesses, in that you have a clinical exposure. It would be nice to hear how you saw the relative trends in that business between clinical, some of the core applied markets where you have a good presence. And then, to the extent you have any comment on what you're seeing on pharma on the R&D, that would be really helpful.","Second question is just more of a global question on municipal and broader government project demand. You're uniquely well positioned to have a view on how that's tracking. ","And then, I'll go ahead and, Matt, ask you just one. And more of a prospective, big picture question. You have a lot of moving parts in the model given that we're divesting Dental and we have GE coming into the fray, looking for the majority of 2020. Can you just talk prospectively about the impact on earnings and cash to the extent you can, associated with those transitions? If you can give us any update on the thinking, so we know how and maybe some of it's below the line to think about those items going forward. Really appreciate the help here.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Sure, Steve. Thanks. So, let's start with SCIEX. You heard my comment accurately that while SCIEX was down slightly in the quarter, we are, in fact, encouraged by the order trends that we're seeing and we do in fact expect some improved performance in the fourth quarter.","When we look at the quarter itself, third quarter, we clearly were up against a tough comp. SCIEX, so I think I mentioned was up nearly 10% in the third quarter of last year. So, certainly, a bit of a challenge from a comp standpoint. But we did see some \u2013 outside of that, some softness in North America. A little bit of that was timing of some larger deals in the second half between Q3 and Q4, but also \u2013 and this does get a little bit into some of the market segments that you asked about. We are seeing the consolidation of some small and midsize reference labs, and that has created a bit of a headwind there. ","You asked about specifically the clinical market, and SCIEX has certainly had a position in clinical over time, but over the last couple of years, we've seen a number of challenges in that market that are not unique to SCIEX. Just broadly defined challenges around changes in reimbursement and guidelines around pain management, for one example. And, certainly, the impact both across small and midsize labs are related to those challenges in clinical.","So, SCIEX was really built on the back of tremendous strength and depth of technologies and capabilities around pharma. Small molecule certainly originally and more recently around large molecule positions. And those positions continue to be reasonably good, particularly biopharma which, obviously, is a growth segment. Core small molecule pharma was much more modest in its growth globally. Academic was actually \u2013 remain pretty good really across North America and China. And I think, overall, we think SCIEX is going to continue to be a leader in that market, a real innovator and one where, over time, we'll see a pickup after third quarter.","You asked about the municipal market. And our exposure to the municipal market or the government market is, for the most part, associated with our Water Quality platform. And in that case, the term municipal is probably more appropriate to our position really than any broader governmental construct, at least in the US. And what we've seen most recently in the US and in Europe would be that municipal spending has generally been pretty consistent. And that's what's driven the mid-single digit growth rates that we put up at Water Quality across the US and Western Europe. And that applies certainly to Hach, it applies to Trojan and a bit to ChemTreat, although ChemTreat tends to be more associated with applied markets.","In China, where we continue to see good performance for our Water Quality platform, albeit against a very tough comp associated with what's called Policy 61, which we noted in the prepared remarks, that market is continuing to be an outstanding market. And, yes, it is largely associated with government or, in particular, environmental ministry oriented regulations, such as Policy 61 which drove an increased level of monitoring in surface waters across China last year. That will continue to be a positive dynamic across water quality. So, right now, we see pretty consistent and steady performance around both municipal spending in the developed markets as well as a little bit more governmental orientated attention to environmental issues in the high growth markets.","Matt McGrew","And, Steve, as far your kind of \u2013 your question on the moving pieces with GE and Dental, I think maybe the way I think about it is sort of that, from an EPS perspective, obviously, Q4, there's no GE impact. And we talked a little bit here earlier about all the moving pieces that are there and, obviously, as we get a little closer to close, we will update all of that for 2020. But as far as Q4, obviously, nothing to think about.","As far as Q4 goes for EPS for Envista, the NCI, I kind of put a placeholder of maybe $0.02 in there for the NCI for the fourth quarter. And then, as far as kind of cash flow goes, I think that was your next question. If you think about, we sort of talked about GE coming in at maybe roughly $1 billion worth of cash flow and Envista will kind of be out there, I think, talking to you guys about their own 2020 cash flow projections when they get a little closer. So, I don't want to kind of speak for them, but I think you can kind of pencil in that GE have call it a billion and we'll let Envista talk about 2020 cash flow when they talk to you guys later today.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay. Great details. Really appreciate the time here.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS.","Dan Brennan","Thank you. Great. So, maybe a question just on Q3, Q4. Tom, I think you mentioned a few times, maybe a little bit of timing benefit or timing push out. And, obviously, with the size of Danaher, I'm sure there's always lots of small shifts. But just wanted to understand, was there a more pronounced timing benefit this quarter? And maybe could you just help us then think about \u2013 implicit in your fourth quarter guide, how do we think about kind of Life Science, Diagnostics and kind of EAS?","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Sure, Dan. Yeah, I think perhaps a little bit of timing issue between Q3 and Q4 here and the margin would have been a little bit more pronounced than what we've seen. But I think if you look at the fundamentals underneath each one of the platforms, Life Science, Diagnostics and EAS, each one of them continued to perform quite well. Again, our exposure to the macro environment is somewhat limited in the sense of being a good proxy for an industrial slowdown. We don't have a lot of industrial exposure left. And so, we generally feel very good about how the overall platform will perform going through the fourth quarter and how we're set up for 2020.","Dan Brennan","Okay. Great. And then, you kind of touched upon my kind of second part of the question. Maybe could you help us think about, like maybe between your 70% recurring business on instrument side of the house, were there \u2013 you mentioned earlier in the call that there's a bit of pressure there from what you're seeing globally. It's a question we get a lot, like differentiating between Danaher and other players in the broader tool spaces, the global economy is getting softer. So, how do we think about kind of your instrument kind of growth rate kind of as we look out here with PMIs being a bit weak and the global economy slowing? Thanks, Tom.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","Sure. Here's one sort of way to think about it, Dan, using some specific numbers. If you look at the third quarter, our consumables business was up, call it, 6% versus the equipment side of the house, which is up more like 4%. And so, if you think back to the last couple of quarters, those have been closer to even \u2013 about equal equipment versus consumables. Here you see the consumables number continuing to be quite strong and the equipment number being a little bit softer. And I think that's probably the best way to look at what is underneath some of the softness that I talked about that may be impacted by the macro environment across a business like Videojet, for example, or SCIEX or possibly like a Microsystems, probably to name three examples of businesses where the equipment side of the house is a higher percentage of the balance of sale than on average across the portfolio. ","Dan Brennan","Great. Thank you.","Thomas Joyce, Jr.","You bet. ","Operator","We have reached the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Matt Gugino for closing remarks.","Matt Gugino","Thanks, Kathy. And thanks, everyone, for joining us.

Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Matt, and good morning. This was a busy and exciting quarter for Danaher. Our team executed well using the Danaher business system to deliver solid core revenue growth, excellent margin expansion, strong cash flow and earnings outperformance. In May, we also announced the acquisition of Pall Corporation, the largest in our history, and are intent to separate Danaher into two independent publicly traded companies.","Before moving to the details of the quarter, let me provide a quick update on these two big announcements. First on Pall. The transaction's progressing well. We've received U.S. antitrust regulatory approval and anticipate a ruling from the EU next month. We're also making great progress on the planning front, have identified key leadership appointments, and look forward to closing the transaction later this year.","On the separation, we have a dedicated team working diligently to execute the transaction. At closing, we will have created two strategically focused, independent companies, each with the ability to pursue meaningful M&A. We believe these companies will be better and stronger separately than they are together and generate substantial long-term value for our shareholders. We look forward to sharing more details on the progress of both of these transactions in the weeks and months ahead.","With that, let's move to the details of the quarter. Today, we reported another record second quarter for Danaher. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share were up approximately 5% to $1.08. Reported revenue grew 3.5% to $5.1 billion while core revenues also increased 3.5%. Acquisitions increased our revenue by 6.5% while currency translation was a 6.5% headwind.","Geographically, we saw mid-single-digit growth across the U.S., Europe, and the high-growth markets. In the high-growth markets, strength in China and the Middle East was offset by weakness in Brazil and Russia. Some of our smaller developed markets, including Japan, experienced more modest growth.","Second-quarter gross margin expanded 100 basis points to an all-time high of 53.8%. This increase in gross profit and our continued G&A leverage allowed us to accelerate our investments in sales and marketing and R&D while still improving core operating margin by 80 basis points. In turn, we believe these investments help drive share gains at Fluke, Hach, Radiometer, Leica Biosystems, SCIEX, Nobel Biocare and Videojet, among others. Free cash flow for the quarter was $955 million, up 13% from last year, and our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 137%.","We had a busy quarter on the capital allocation front. We announced not only the Pall deal but also five bolt-on acquisitions for approximately $100 million that strengthen our competitive positions across a number of markets. In the near term, we expect to remain active on the acquisition front with a focus on strengthening our existing businesses via small and mid-sized transactions.","Turning now to our five operating segments. Test & Measurement revenue declined 1.5% while core revenue increased 2.5%. Both reported and core operating margin increased 70 basis points to 19.1%. Our instrument platform core revenue increased low single digits.","At Fluke, core revenue grew at a mid-single-digit rate for the fourth consecutive quarter. Demand was strongest in our calibration and biomedical businesses, each of which grew double digits. During the quarter, we launched our Fluke Connect Asset System to increase the functionality of Fluke Connect, our collection of wireless enabled test tools and analytics software. The Fluke Connect Assets app gives maintenance engineers the power of a complete view of all the equipment in their facilities, including baseline, historical, and current measurement data in one virtual location. This makes predictive and condition-based maintenance even easier for our customers. Since its launch last year, Fluke Connect hardware has exceeded our expectations with almost $50 million in sales and 45,000 software downloads.","Tektronix core revenue was up slightly as strong demand from technology customers in China and our distribution channel in Europe was offset by weaker demand in Russia and Latin America. We expect similar core revenue performance in the third quarter. Core revenue in our communications platform decreased at a low-single-digit rate. Demand for our securities solutions and network enterprise business was more than offset by a decline in our network management solutions. Despite the core revenue decline, the platform maintained solid order momentum with a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.1.","Last week, we closed the previously announced combination of our communications business with NetScout. This is the culmination of a nine-month process in which we brought together two complementary businesses to create one company with extensive global scale and best-in-class solutions to manage and secure the networks of telecom and enterprise customers. As a result of the transaction, our common shares outstanding have been reduced by approximately 26 million.","Before moving on, I'd like to take a moment to thank our associates at Arbor, FNET, and Tek Comms for their hard work during their time at Danaher. I know I speak for our entire leadership team in wishing them well as they join NetScout.","Moving now to Environmental, revenue increased 2% with core revenue up 3%. Core operating margin expanded 145 basis points while reported operating margin was up 150 basis points to 22.5%. Our water quality platform's core revenue grew mid-single digits with growth across our analytical instrumentation, chemical treatment, and ultraviolet treatment businesses. Hach had a good quarter as mid-single-digit revenue growth in the U.S. and Europe was augmented by double-digit growth in China. Strength was broad-based with growth across most major product lines. In the quarter, Hach took steps to strengthen its platform of environmental monitoring solutions with the pending acquisition of Sutron Corporation.","Sutron provides customized monitoring and control solutions that complement Hach's offering in the Hydromet and oceanographic markets. With this acquisition, Hach will have the industry's only end-to-end suite of remote site equipment and systems that are designed for continuous reliable operation in extreme environments.","At ChemTreat, new customer wins and continued traction with new products drove growth in all major geographies. ChemTreat continued to expand its foundation of best-in-class service and sales in Latin America with the acquisition of Lipesa Group, a leading provider of industrial water and process treatment solutions in Columbia, Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru. Gilbarco Veeder-Root core revenue was up low single digits. Strength in North America and China was partially offset by a decline in payment solutions in Australia where we had a significant project roll out last year. In the U.S., future EMB compliance requirements drove double-digit growth in point of sales solutions and dispensers. We expect strong demand to continue in this area for the next few years.","Turning now to Life Sciences & Diagnostics, sales for the quarter were up 3% while core revenue grew 4.5%. Core operating margin increased 55 basis points while reported operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 15.5% due primarily to a dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. Our diagnostics platform delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth. At Beckman Coulter, core sales grew mid-single-digits with growth in most major product lines. Demand in high growth markets remained strong with double-digit growth in China and the Middle East.","In Europe, we launched our VERIS molecular diagnostic system along with four viral load assays. The streamlined design of the VERIS system is a breakthrough in workflow simplification and ease of use for our lab customers. Its sample-in, result-out workflow provides test results in only four steps, thus requiring minimal training in a market that's experiencing a shortage of skilled operators. What's more, results are generated over two times faster than traditional molecular diagnostic testing methods.","Those of you who attended our analyst day in California last month saw firsthand the tremendous progress we've made at Beckman over the past four years. Using DBS, the Beckman team has worked diligently to reverse the significant quality, delivery, and service shortcomings that existed at acquisition and has vastly improved the customer experience in this process. This effort has helped us exceed our cost savings target and more than double operating profit. Most importantly with these challenges largely behind us, Beckman has redeployed resources that have reinvigorated organic and inorganic growth including the acquisitions of IRIS and MicroScan. We see a number of commonalities between Beckman and Pall, and believe we'll be able to run a similar play book at Pall in the coming years.","Turning to Radiometer, Radiometer's core revenue increased high-single-digits with growth in all major product lines and geographies. Demand was particularly healthy at HemoCue where sales grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. Since we acquired HemoCue in 2013, we've made significant progress in leveraging Radiometer sales channel to accelerate growth while also expanding operating margins over 1,000 basis points.","Leica Biosystem sales increased at a high-single-digit rate with balanced growth across both developed and high growth markets. Advanced Staining grew nearly 20% in the quarter as we continue to improve our relative market position. Devicor, the acquisition we closed in late 2014, posted its second consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Our life science platform core revenue increased at a low single digit rate led by double digit in the U.S., particularly offset or partially offset by a decline in Latin America.","SCIEX core sales grew mid-single-digits driven by strength in the pharma and clinical end markets. At June's American Society of Mass Spectrometry meeting or ASMS, we launched a number of complete workflow solutions including BioBA. BioBA is an integrated offering for biologics analysis that combines the capabilities of our 6500 QTRAP mass spectrometer with the ExionLC high performance liquid chromatography system. The system links ready-to-use sample prep kits with lab automation to simplify the bio pharma research workflow enabling researchers to expand their skill sets and improve their productivity.","Leica Microsystems' core revenue decreased low single digits due to weak market conditions in Latin America and in China. Despite the decline, our order growth rate remained positive giving us confidence that Leica will return to growth in the third quarter. During the quarter, Leica closed the acquisition of Bioptigen, strengthening its position in the ophthalmology market. The integration of Bioptigen's advanced optics technology with Leica's surgical microscopes will enable doctors to make better clinical decisions during eye surgery by providing more detailed images of the retina","Turning to Dental, core sales were up 1% while total revenues increased 30% largely due to our Nobel Biocare acquisition. Core operating margins declined 25 basis points with reported operating margin down 60 basis points to 14.2%. Great progress continued at Nobel Biocare as the team delivered another quarter of mid-single-digit average daily sales growth. Profitability has also improved markedly with the operating margins up over 100 basis points in the first half of 2015, excluding restructuring.","Growth in dental consumables and treatment units were partially offset by a decline in imaging. While we saw continued destocking in certain areas within our North American distribution channel, we're encouraged by the normalization across many of our product lines in the quarter. We also experienced healthy demand for our instruments in Europe on the back of last quarter's international dental show in Germany. KaVo's updated master series of hand pieces, which provide dental practitioners with exceptional power, low vibration and patented access angles for easier patient treatment, has been particularly well received and contributed to our overall performance.","Turning to Industrial Technologies. Revenue increased 5.5% while core revenues were up 4%. Core operating margin expanded 165 basis points while reported operating margin increased 180 basis points to 25.6%. Thanks to the team's excellent execution, this was the fourth consecutive quarter that the segment's core margin improved over 110 basis points.","Our automation platform's core revenue grew low single digits, led by healthy demand from defense and technology customers in North America and project wins in Europe. Core revenues for product identification increased high single digits. We saw broad-based strength and believe we continue to gain market share across the business. Videojet grew high single digits, led by healthy demand for equipment and consumables.","Service revenue, a key focus area for the team, grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. Geographically, we saw mid-single-digit growth is better across the U.S., Europe and China. ESKO core sales improved high-single-digits, led by healthy demand for both hardware and software. And within software, demand from brand owners was encouraging, with sales up over 30%. X-Rite had a strong quarter in which demand for our color measurement and standards products drove high-single-digit growth.","So to wrap it up, we're very pleased with the significant steps we've taken to enhance our portfolio and look forward to an exciting future for Danaher. In the midst of change, our team's outstanding execution using the Danaher business system helped deliver solid core revenue growth, excellent margin expansion, strong cash flow and earnings outperformance. We expect the macro environment to remain a challenge as we move into the second half of 2015, but we're confident that our focus on driving growth and optimizing our portfolio will offer our shareholders substantial value for years to come.","We're initiating third-quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1 to $1.04, which assumes core growth comparable to the second quarter of 2015. We're also raising our adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance for the full year 2015 to $4.25 to $4.33 from $4.23 to $4.33. As we described in greater detail in this morning's press release, our recently divested Communications business will be reclassified to discontinued operations, resulting in a $0.03 reduction in adjusted EPS for the first half of 2015. This reduction is largely offset by our outperformance in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding our Communications business in both 2014 and 2015, the midpoint of our full-year 2015 guidance would represent high-single-digit year-over-year adjusted EPS growth.","Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Lynette, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take your first question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Steve.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I would say this is not that exciting, which is actually pretty good in the context of this environment. Boring is good.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","There's a compliment for you.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's the best I'm going do.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","When \u2013 the Pall deal, you've got some approvals in tow now. Any chance you can close this thing a little bit earlier than expected?","Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Steve, its Dan. Clearly we're happy with how we're progressing in terms of the various approvals, but again we don't know until we get the last one in. But, there is a decent chance this happens sooner this year.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","But until we get the last one, it's hard to forecast.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. And then in the second half of the year, the environment is obviously pretty challenging; 3.5% core growth is good. Any views on getting ahead of further weakness in any restructuring in the second half of the year? I assume the gain you're going to take, that's going to be in disc op, so it's not like that'll be used to offset anything, but what are your views on restructuring in the context of the current environment?","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, Steve, we're constantly challenging our teams throughout the course of the year to be looking for opportunities to improve productivity, to position themselves better, to realign cost structures, to align those cost structures to the best growth opportunities. And that's really been going on throughout the course of this year. Obviously as we do assess the macro environment, we'll figure out whether anything more significant needs to be done. But I think at the moment the teams are doing a nice job continuing to look for opportunities as the year progresses.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And is there anything lastly that gets, fundamentally within the businesses, gets materially better or worse in the second half? Anything moving around from an organic perspective?","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think probably one I'd highlight for you, Steve, there are probably a few others that I wouldn't bring immediately to mind but maybe a headline would be GVR. As we see the EMV regulations continue to come closer, meaning the outdoor regulations that have a deadline in the end of 2017, the indoor regulations that are currently driving some encouraging performance in our POS related technologies, I think those dynamics will continue to improve GVR's performance. GVR was a little lighter here in the second quarter, but I think good year-to-date. But I think we'd look to see that accelerate in the back half of 2015 and clearly into 2016.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks lot.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Just to name one, yeah.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks lot.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yep, thanks, Steve.","Operator","We'll hear next from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I just want to echo Steve's comments. Boring is good. I think this quarter is going to stack up very well versus the pack. So just wanted to focus a little bit on margin here, because I think that was the real swing from 1Q where you had a little bit of softness on FX and conversion this quarter is much, much better. So I wondered maybe if you could talk about whether the impact of FX moderated or whether that was offset by efficiency metrics. And if I could just then drill into the core Test & Measurement margins, outstanding margins. Looks to be about 24% and change. That's up, you know, about 3 points year-over-year. How sustainable is that and is that driven by mix? Is that restructuring? What's driving that strength?","Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Nigel, we're clearly continuing to feel the impact of the FX on our margin. Until we anniversary the big move in the euro, that will continue. But overall, very good cost action fall-through. One of the dynamics in Q2, our consumable business aftermarket core growth remained very, very healthy. Our equipment business was slightly softer. I think that's not unlike what we're hearing from a lot of other more equipment-based businesses. So we actually get a favorable mix from that from a margin perspective. But the FX impact is still very much there.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then it looks like the 3Q guide, it looks like you're forecasting on an apples-to-apples basis a pretty significant sequential decline in margins. Looks to be like a 17 handle versus a mid-18s this quarter. Is that the right math?","Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, clearly there's seasonal here. We're typically down $0.03 or $0.04 on slightly lower revenues Q2 to Q3 and we expect a similar dynamic here.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then finally on the Pall, you pre-funded $2.7 billion euros of debt. The Q mentions CP funding. Any intention to get ahead further on the pre-funding as you get closer to the close?","Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Well, clearly we've done the $3 billion of the euros. We've set up all the bank facilities to back us up, the commercial paper, and we'll likely do a U.S. bond deal as we get closer to closing.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, Dan.","Operator","Scott Davis from Barclays, your line is open.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Scott.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I don't think you mentioned anything about any updated timing of the breakup or any additional details. Is there any change? I mean, you've had a few months to dial that in a little bit, I guess.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, we've had a little bit of time here, Scott. But we're still looking at the same timing that we've spoken to earlier. We have a team assembled as I mentioned. Team's gotten to work building action plans. There is a lot to do. I think one of the great things that I've seen recently is how the team is applying principles and the practices of DBS to the whole process. Many of you have seen some of those examples of visual management and project management as you've toured our facilities. We're applying that same approach here. And I think as we do that and time progresses here a bit and we understand some of the details in a deeper way, we'll look for every opportunity to accelerate that. The facts of the matter are that the complexities associated with work to do, associated with the audits that'll need to be done, the filings associated with that. The associated tax-related work will take time, and we're going to do everything we can to accelerate the process. But it's still early days in defining all those details.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Understood. And just getting back I think to Steve's question, if you look at the deeper cyclicals around the world, it almost feels like things are falling apart in front of our eyes. But you guys don't touch oil and gas or commodities in any real way so you don't see it real time. But do you worry that we are on the verge of something that's bigger from a recession perspective and you have to start thinking about getting ahead of it now? Is that something you guys consider, or do you have enough visibility in your book just to say this is generally not going to touch you?","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, Scott, I don't know that we have any clearer crystal ball necessarily on the macro environment than a lot of other folks. I think we feel very good about how well our portfolio is positioned to weather storms in various markets. Today I think we're certainly cognizant of the headlines. We've seen the high growth markets become very uneven. While we're still seeing relative strength and excellent execution in places like China and the Middle East, we're very cognizant of the weaknesses in Latin America, specifically in Brazil, the challenges in Russia, and yet I think in many cases, in the overall, we're performing quite well. As we've said in the last couple of calls, our businesses are really well positioned in Europe. We don't see Europe as a particularly robust market at the moment, but we continue to post good growth across a number of our businesses. The U.S. has been steady for us, but again, I think we would look to our own execution as being the underpinnings of that and not so much any great confidence in macro stability going forward.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And, Tom, what's your view on China more explicitly?","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, we still think China is a very good market for a number of our businesses, Scott. If we look specifically at performances across the portfolio, our Diagnostic business, our Dental business continues to perform exceptionally well in China. So we're seeing strength across some of our other businesses as well. Water grew double digits in the quarter. So it's not the same market that it was a year ago or two years ago. It is a more challenging market in a macro context. We've seen some pockets of weakness in areas like academic-related and research funding. But in general, we continue to invest there. We still remain bullish that it will be one of our better growth markets across the whole global landscape.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys, and good luck.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","We'll move next to Steven Winoker from Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good morning, all. It looks like the core growth ex-Comms for this past quarter would have been closer to 4% than 3.5%. And if that's right, Tom, can you talk through maybe what it would have been or how should we think about the NewCo versus RemainCo core growth rates?","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Good morning, Steve. Your assessment is right that the quarter ex-Comms would have been about 4% rather than the 3.5%. When you look at the portfolio within the context of NewCo and Danaher going forward, the NewCo businesses grew about 3% in the quarter, and the Danaher RemainCo portfolio grew about 4% in the quarter.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And that RemainCo would have been closer to 4.5% then ex-Comms now?","Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","It would have been a little over 4%, yes.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. And then as you see that growth pacing, you talked a little bit about it, but for Q3 versus Q4, how do you maybe see core growth pacing through those two?","Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Well, again, we believe as of now, Q3 will be comparable to Q2. We have a few less selling days in Q4 which benefited Q1, but adjusted for that, we're not looking for a fundamental change and despite arguably a tougher, incrementally tougher macro environment, we're looking for core growth to stay relatively steady with where we are today.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Right. Steady ex-Comms, right?","Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, maybe just a comment on Dental would be helpful. You talked a little bit about it in the prepared remarks, but are you seeing a fundamental improvement then in the business and how should we think about that business progressing going forward?","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Steve, we are seeing some improvement in our performance in dental. The Q2 growth that I mentioned of 1% was better than where we were in Q1. We're not yet where we want to be, but we saw some improvement in a number of areas. We're particularly enthusiastic about the great start that we've had with Nobel. It's not in the core numbers but having a very good start with mid-single-digit core growth for the second quarter and the second quarter in a row. We look at sellout and sellout remains very good. It's in probably the 3% to 4% range. Again, it will vary a bit across product categories, but I think sellout continues to be good. I think as we look at consumables and equipment, generally a number of areas performing better than they were. Still some work to do, but we think we're approaching the tail-end of some inventory related destocking activities that impacted primarily the equipment side, and were more or less isolated to the North American market. So I think quite a number of things to be encouraged about and clearly still some work to do in some spots.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners, your line is open.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Jeff.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Just a couple of quick ones. First, just China overall, can you say if you bid \u2013 I missed it \u2013 what the China growth rate was in the quarter overall?","Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Jeff, we were about 8%, 9% which has been remarkably consistent. We were just talking about it with the China team the last five or six quarters.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah, that is solid. And then on water treatment, Dan or Tom, what's actually driving the activity there? Can you provide a little granularity on muni versus industrial or geographic and how you think that trends in the back half of the year?","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Absolutely, Jeff. Let's start with the Hach business. The Hach business continues to perform very well. Another very good quarter. I just mentioned their growth in China at double digits on the quarter, but continued good performance in the developed markets, specifically obviously in the U.S. and in Europe. And in general, that would span across industrial and muni. So I think we're seeing \u2013 we've seen pretty good progress there. They continue to invest in growth both on the sales and marketing side as well as in R&D. And I think we're seeing the benefits of consistent year-over-year investment net business and very, very good execution.","If you look at Trojan, Trojan more on the equipment side, keep in mind that Hach is a little bit more of an OpEx related business, a little bit less CapEx exposure. Trojan a little bit more CapEx exposure. Had a good quarter, second consecutive positive core growth quarter. We're starting to see some improvement in bid volume on a global basis, and this is a lumpy business given the project nature, more CapEx oriented. But generally we're feeling pretty good about where Trojan is. We talked a number of times about the investments that we've made in ballast water. We noted that we filed formally for U.S. type approval via the coast guard. We're waiting for any questions or follow-up on that filing. But we remain encouraged about the potential for growth there.","And then finally at ChemTreat, another good quarter at ChemTreat, performing very well. Probably faces a few more challenging pockets in the macro environment. There actually is a little bit of oil and gas exposure in that business. We've had some success up in the oil sands in Canada, and so we've seen some softness there. The steel market has been a little bit more challenging. So while ChemTreat continues to grow very positively and gain share, there's a few pockets of softness there that we'll need to offset.","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Just one more quick one. Thank you, Tom, for all that. It sounds like the smaller bolt-ons might be ramping up. Did any of those happen in what's going to be the NewCo in the quarter and do you anticipate bolt-ons in the NewCo as you work through this process?","Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Jeff, we definitely do. And we're spending a lot more time with Jim and his team ramping up that effort. And I would expect to see some bolt-ons here in NewCo in the next 12 months, 18 months","Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","We'll hear next from Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Morning, guys.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Can you talk a little bit about the variation in the core margin improvement across the segments? You had a couple real strong runs, right, with Environmental and Industrial, and then LS&D up a little less on core and then Dental down. I know you're doing some investments and some restructuring there. Maybe just give us a feel for what you're doing there and what kind of benefit we might see coming out of it.","Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. It's Dan, Shannon. On Life Science Diagnostics, that is a segment that we get probably hit the hardest from an FX perspective, but on a constant-currency basis, they would have been up 100 basis points. So kind of feel underlying from a core perspective, we're making the progress we should be making but just paying a lot of FX pain right now. Good core growth numbers. We are investing, high growth markets, new products, so I think you're seeing some of the impact there. But you're seeing it on the core growth side. Dental is a function of very modest core growth, growing 1%, tougher to expand those margins. We'll need a little better core growth to see core margin expansion here in the second half.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then how do you guys feel about the overall healthcare market? I mean, you said I think Life Sciences was up double digits in the U.S., which seemed remarkably strong. I know you guys in a lot of your businesses have new products driving a lot of growth. I mean, is that Life Sciences' number a function of just overall market or just how do you feel about the market?","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Shannon, we think about the market first of all in, probably to keep it simple, two different dimensions. We think about it in terms of truly more of a healthcare-oriented market, the term you used, that would impact our Diagnostic businesses more. And then more of a Life Science market that is more skewed towards selling to life science related academic and research institutions, universities, pharma, big pharma, food testing, et cetera. So first and foremost, we sort of separate it into those two segments of the market. Specific to your question about our Life Science platform in North America, we had some businesses that executed extremely well.","Leica Microsystems, for example, despite the modest performance overall during the quarter due to some high growth market challenges had a very strong quarter in the U.S. SCIEX had an excellent quarter in the U.S. and that's really just good commercial execution. I wouldn't say it's a function of the macro environment. Back on the healthcare side, we've seen utilization in hospitals increase very modestly. Generally hospitals are in better shape financially today, so we've seen some investment coming through. And so I think that's certainly a little bit of a help, but, again, I would point to our execution, improvements in Beckman's overall performance, certainly Radiometer, a consistent performer, Leica Biosystems growing 20% in advanced staining and growing in some of the core histo applications also underpinning that. And those would all be growth rates that would be higher than the underlying market and certainly higher than the increases in utilization.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Shannon.","Operator","Up next is Ross Muken from Evercore ISI.","Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI","Hi. Good morning, guys, and congrats.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ross.","Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI","So I thought I'd start just, you were talking a bit about Life Sciences, digging in just a little more in the biopharma side. It's obviously going to get more important when you close Pall, but it seems like a very kind of healthy sub-segment. We've seen it across the board. Maybe a little color of what you saw in SCIEX in that segment. And I know you obviously haven't closed Pall yet, but filtration numbers across the board have been consistently spectacular this quarter, and so as you're thinking about where you touch today, particularly on the biotech side, but where you will be going forward, how do you feel about that end market specifically?","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Ross, we feel very good about that end market as we, I think, pointed out in a number of our conversations about the Pall transaction. We see the biopharma market to be one of the most attractive markets from a sustainable growth perspective in the years to come. You saw that in Pall's reported numbers coming out of their last quarter. So we feel very good about the growth prospects there. Specific to our business, I would probably point to SCIEX specifically as a business that performed very well. Their approach to that market is broad-based in terms of the full range of pharma customers, and we continue to see good growth. They were one of our best performers in the life science platform and, specifically, a very strong performer in North America. So we remain very bullish on that market.","Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI","And maybe, Dan, just building off of the prior question on sort of tuck-in activity at NewCo, one of the things I've heard from folks is a concern about valuations across that complex and a lack of targets that fit the old Danaher model. I guess as you look at the pipeline there and the types of businesses or the size of businesses and public versus private, do you see a pretty good plethora of opportunities and do you feel like it's difficult given valuations there to do deals, or do you feel like there's pockets where you still could see some pretty good high return type acquisitions?","Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Well, I don't think we would have announced a separation if we didn't see a significant opportunity there. And just in the last 45 days, we really kind of geared up again the M&A activity for many of what will be Jim's businesses. We're already starting to see some bolt-ons that I think will come through in the next six months, but I think there are also larger opportunities in time. And that is a team at Fluke, Gilbarco that have executed extremely well on their bolt-on adjacent-type acquisitions, and we feel very good about that opportunity going forward.","Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks, guys.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ross.","Operator","Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse, please go ahead.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. Just had a question around in Industrial on the product ID side. It looks like you're still outgrowing the market maybe 2x or so. Maybe just give some color as to what's driving that. Is there some disruption at Domino because of the merger? Is it a product suite issue or do you think it's more fundamental around the software expertise?","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thanks, Julian, and good morning. Product ID, specifically Videojet, I'll start with Videojet, has performed very well. I would say that it is largely a function of very strong DBS-oriented execution at VJ. Some of the growth-oriented tools of DBS that we've spoken about in the past, tools around funnel management and transformative marketing, have really been developed and brought to maturity at Videojet. And we've seen the impact of the utilization of those tools in their commercial execution and the resulting growth performance and share gains.","So it's a great job by that team, and I think we'll continue to see good performance there. That performance is replicated or is very similar when we look at Esko and X-Rite, two terrific acquisitions that the platform has done, really broadening its footprint and bringing a broader suite of solutions to brand owners. And so I think all is tracking in the right direction in terms of the platform. Relative to Domino, we have not seen any particular impact of that. The PID business in general and VJ specifically is performing exceptionally well in Europe. And so I think we're in good shape.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. And then just to follow up on Dental, it sounded like the sellout has been pretty good, which I guess would mean the inventories have sort of run their course. But Dan sounded fairly certain with respect about the scope for the margin expansion in dental in the second half. So I just wanted to understand, do you think Q3 and Q4 will see an acceleration in Dental?","Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","We will. I think it'll still be relatively modest but it will be better than what we've seen here in the first half. We were encouraged by consumables returning to a more normal growth level, more typical margin performance. And while equipment was a tad better, and the sellout numbers are fine, I'm not sure we're entirely done from a destock perspective. I think we've got the biggest pieces behind us but I still think there'll be a little bit more here in the second half.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. And then lastly just very quickly, the SG&A costs in Q1 I think had caused a bit of consternation around their increase, more normal in Q2. Given the SG&A to sales should continue to sort of \u2013 the increases should level off there in the second half.","Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I mean, on a sequential basis, clearly part of that's Nobel which comes in with a direct selling model, so it's a pretty more heftier selling expense, but you should see some continued normalization.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Moving next to Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, guys. Thank you.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Isaac.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. I just want to stay on the Dental theme for a minute here. The destocking dynamic, that's the second quarter in a row, and I think, if I understood Dan's comments there previously, sounds like there might be a little more to go. I'm just curious why that is.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think these are the types of things that obviously take some time. They're worked, Isaac, in collaboration with our distribution partners. You've got some balancing going on between different product lines, and so it's really just an evolutionary process.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And so if we were to try and look at the year holistically, the first half's been pretty flat. The last few years you've been closer to 3% or so. Is it unrealistic to think, given the destocking dynamics that 3% is possible this year for the full year?","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think it might be a stretch for the full year, but I think in the second half, we'd be looking to try to achieve that kind of number.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Appreciate it guys. Thank you.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Isaac.","Operator","And your final question today will come from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Considering all the transactions you have going on, you still were able to complete five bolt-ons. Maybe a comment on what that pipeline looks like and capacity both capital and management eyeballs to get more deals done.","Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Deane, we're pretty happy. We did see the pace of bolt-ons ramp up last year. That's continued here in the first half. On the margin, some of the incremental choppiness in the macro environment is helping get some of these bolt-ons to the finish line. Now that we're geared up here with Jim and many of his businesses, I expect that pace to continue. We're not going to do any multibillion dollar deals here in the next 12 months, but I think you should see a very healthy continued pace of bolt-ons across the platform.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then just the last question, if you could put the spotlight on the Sutron deal for a moment and hydrological monitoring. It's interesting that's part of environmental, but it's Hach environmental. What are the linkages with Sutron and water quality both from a technology standpoint but also go to market?","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Deane, we have a suite of products in our Hach portfolio, Hach Lange portfolio, that we refer to as Hach environmental. And we use that term to reference the fact that that suite of products, those instruments and software and various communications modalities, allow us to provide capabilities outside of municipal and industrial water, namely in rivers, lakes, streams, tributaries, and all the way out into the blue ocean \u2013 the deep ocean areas with businesses like Sea-Bird. What Sutron provides us is a bolt-on acquisition that adds capabilities in satellite communications, in remote data transfer that add significant potential to instruments that are already installed in those applications. And so it's a tremendous add. It's a business that we've known for a long time. We've had an excellent relationship over many years with the leaders of that business, and we're thrilled to have them join the portfolio.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Thomas P. Joyce - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Deane.","Daniel L. Comas - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Deane.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. Mr. Gugino, I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Matthew E. Gugino - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We're around all day for questions.","Operator","And that does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you all for your participation."]}}
